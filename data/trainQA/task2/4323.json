      "content": "Paper Title: Parameterized Complexity of Streaming Diameter and Connectivity Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere has been substantial work on the complexity of graph-distance and reachability problems in the streaming setting. For example, Guruswami and Onak  showed that any p𝑝p-pass algorithm needs n1+Ω​(1/p)/p𝒪​(1)superscript𝑛1Ω1𝑝superscript𝑝𝒪1n^{1+\\Omega(1/p)}/p^{\\mathcal{O}(1)} memory when given vertices s,t𝑠𝑡s,t to test if s,t𝑠𝑡s,t are at distance at most 2​p+22𝑝22p+2 in undirected graphs or to test s𝑠s-t𝑡t reachability in directed graphs. Further work on directed s𝑠s-t𝑡t reachability  recently led to a lower bound that any o​(log⁡n)𝑜𝑛o(\\sqrt{\\log n})-pass algorithm needs n2−o​(1)superscript𝑛2𝑜1n^{2-o(1)} bits of memory . Other recent work considers p𝑝p-pass algorithms for ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-property testing of connectivity   [ref]4, including strong memory lower bounds n1−𝒪​(ϵ⋅p)superscript𝑛1𝒪⋅italic-ϵ𝑝n^{1-\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon\\cdot p)} on bounded-degree planar graphs [ref]6. Further problems in graph streaming are extensively discussed and referenced in these works; see also [ref]3. In the non-streaming setting, the Diameter problem can be solved in 𝒪​(n​m)𝒪𝑛𝑚\\mathcal{O}(nm) time by BFS. There is a lower bound of n2−ϵsuperscript𝑛2italic-ϵn^{2-\\epsilon} for any ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0 under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) . Parameterizations of Diameter have been studied with parameter vertex cover , treewidth   , and other parameters  , leading to a 2𝒪​(k)​n1+ϵsuperscript2𝒪𝑘superscript𝑛1italic-ϵ2^{\\mathcal{O}(k)}n^{1+\\epsilon} time algorithm on graphs of treewidth k𝑘k . Running time 2o​(k)​n2−ϵsuperscript2𝑜𝑘superscript𝑛2italic-ϵ2^{o(k)}n^{2-\\epsilon} for graphs of treewidth k𝑘k is not possible under SETH . Subquadratic algorithms are known for various hereditary graph classes; see e.g. 6       and references in .\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: n})-pass algorithm needs n2−o​(1)superscript𝑛2𝑜1n^{2-o(1)} bits of memory .
