The individual elements within hypervectors is dependent upon the specific type of VSA but generally consists of binary values, binary spatter codes, or Fourier coefficients¬†[ref]27. This flexibility highlights the diversity of VSA literature where each has unique properties for specific applications. VSA systems utilize two primary operations: binding (‚äótensor-product\\otimes) and bundling (++). Some implementations also incorporate a permutation operator (‚äìsquare-intersection\\sqcap). Binding, analogous to multiplication, combines two or more input vectors into a final invertible representation that is distinct from each input. Binding also has some other notable mathematical properties: Self-Identity: x‚äóx=1tensor-productùë•ùë•1x\\otimes x=1 Associativity: (x‚äóy)‚äóz=x‚äó(y‚äóz)tensor-producttensor-productùë•ùë¶ùëßtensor-productùë•tensor-productùë¶ùëß(x\\otimes y)\\otimes z=x\\otimes(y\\otimes z) Invertibility: x‚äóy‚äóx‚àí1=y+œµtensor-productùë•ùë¶superscriptùë•1ùë¶italic-œµx\\otimes y\\otimes x^{-1}=y+\\epsilon Bundling, analogous to addition, combines multiple input vectors into the superposition of each where the commutative and associative properties apply: Lastly, permutation protects the orders of role and filler pairs (associativity rules) by shifting vector dimensions: In this work, we focus on a specific subset of VSAs based on Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR)¬†. HHRs were pivotal in increasing understanding about biological cognition within the mammalian brain. Further research lead to the emergence the Fourier Holographic Reduced Representations (FHRR)¬†. FHRRs were instrumental in constructing the world‚Äôs largest full scale brain model Spaun2.0 , and have been applied in a variety of small scale experiments in robotics and engineering applications  .\nThis paper goes beyond these previous works by developing a novel framework for VSAs to perform OGM with large scale real-world data.\nAlso known as the semantic pointer architecture with Spatial Semantic Pointers (SSPs)¬†, FHRR-based implementations have unique computational properties where they can encode probabilistic and continuous spatial information  . Figure¬†1B provides a visualization of this process. More information on SSPs are highlighted in Section¬†III.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: of this process.
