A new non-dominated search is performed on the remaining solutions to determine the non-dominated front Fα+1subscript𝐹𝛼1F_{\\alpha+1}.\nThis process repeats until all solutions are assigned to a front.\nA possible selection mechanism would select all non-dominated solutions, i.e. the solutions in F1subscript𝐹1F_{1}.\nThe selected solution candidates are preserved in a new population of solutions Xτ+1subscriptX𝜏1\\mathrm{{X}}_{\\tau+1} and the whole process (crossover, mutation, selection) is repeated until a convergence criterion is met, e.g. no new solutions are preserved in a population after an iteration.\nOften τ𝜏\\tau is referred to as a generation.\nA widely used algorithm that follows the above strategy for multi-objective optimization is the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II)  .\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: with probability p𝑝p where δ𝛿\\delta is sampled from a probability density function δ∼𝒻similar-to𝛿𝒻\\delta\\sim\\mathcal{f} with finite support  [ref]1delimited-[]0.1 [ref]1.\nAnother probabilistic mechanism is the random mutation, e.g. replacing an element of the solution with a random number sampled from a probability distribution\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
