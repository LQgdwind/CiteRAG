      "content": "Paper Title: BEVTrack: A Simple and Strong Baseline for 3D Single Object Tracking in Bird‚Äôs-Eye View\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n3D single object tracking (SOT) is crucial for various applications, such as autonomous driving   . It aims to localize a specific target across a sequence of point clouds, given only its initial status. Existing tracking approaches [ref]4 [ref]5 commonly adopt the point-wise representation, directly taking raw point clouds as input. For example, P2B[ref]4 and its follow-up works   [ref]8 adopt a point-based network  0 with the Siamese architecture for feature extraction, followed by a point-wise appearance matching module [ref]4 [ref]8 1 for propagation of target cues, and a 3D Region Proposal Network 2 3 for target localization, as illustrated in Fig.¬†1(a). M2-Track[ref]5 proposes a motion-centric paradigm, that first segments the target points from their surroundings with a PointNet 4 segmentation network and then localizes the target through a motion modeling approach followed by a box refinement module, as illustrated in Fig.¬†1(b). Although these approaches have exhibited superior performance in tracking benchmarks, they usually require elaborate designs 1 5 [ref]8 6 and solving multiple subtasks [ref]5 [ref]4 to establish target correspondences across consecutive frames, resulting in complicated tracking frameworks and challenges in hyper-parameter tuning. It is noteworthy that such correspondences naturally exist as objects exhibit continuous motion within the video sequence 7 8. This spatial continuity offers valuable prior knowledge for target localization, whereas the point-wise representation 4  with irregular formats fails to utilize it. In this paper, we present BEVTrack, a simple yet strong baseline for 3D SOT, as shown in Fig.¬†1(c). Converting unordered point clouds into the BEV representation 9 0 1, BEVTrack greatly exploits spatial information and inherently encodes the implicit motion relations of the target as well as distractors in BEV. Specifically, we first adopt a voxel-based network 9 with the Siamese architecture for feature extraction. Subsequently, we squeeze the sparse 3D features along the height dimension to obtain the BEV features. Given that corresponding objects are spatially adjacent in the BEV features across consecutive frames, we can easily fuse them together with an element-wise operation such as concatenation. Thanks to the utilization of spatial information, we can intuitively model the motion cues of the target as well as distractors in BEV via a simple convolutional structure, which is beneficial for identifying the target and accurate localization, especially in challenging scenarios. Finally, we discard the complicated region proposal network while using a global max pooling followed by a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) to localize the target, resulting in a simple one-stage tracking pipeline with a single regression loss. To optimize the regression-based trackers, current approaches typically employ conventional L1subscriptùêø1L_{1} or L2subscriptùêø2L_{2} loss. This kind of supervision actually makes a fixed Laplace or Gaussian assumption on the data distribution, which is inflexible when handling targets possessing diverse attributes (e.g., sizes, moving patterns, and sparsity degrees). For example, when tracking targets with high sparsity degrees, where the predictions may be uncertain while the annotations are not very reliable, the outputs should conform to a distribution with a large variance. To this end, we introduce a novel distribution-aware regression strategy for tracking, which constructs the likelihood function with the learned underlying distributions adapted to distinct targets, instead of making a fixed assumption. Note that this strategy does not participate in the inference phase, thus boosting the tracking performance without additional computation overhead. Despite no elaborate design, BEVTrack exhibits a substantial performance advantage over the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on challenging tracking datasets, i.e., KITTI¬†2, NuScenes¬†3, and Waymo Open Dataset 4, while running at real-time (about 200 FPS). The main contributions of this paper are three-fold: ‚àô‚àô\\bullet We propose BEVTrack, a simple yet strong baseline for 3D SOT. This pioneering approach efficiently leverages spatial information in BEV, resulting in a simplified tracking pipeline design. ‚àô‚àô\\bullet We present a novel distribution-aware regression strategy for tracking, which constructs the likelihood function with the learned underlying distributions adapted to targets possessing diverse attributes. This strategy provides accurate guidance for tracking, resulting in improved performance while avoiding extra computation overhead. ‚àô‚àô\\bullet BEVTrack achieves SOTA performance on three popular benchmarks while maintaining a high inference speed.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: crucial for various applications, such as autonomous driving   .
