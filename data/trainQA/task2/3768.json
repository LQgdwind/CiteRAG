      "content": "Paper Title: Local and global topological complexity measures of ReLU neural network functions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIt is well-known (e.g. ) that the class of functions F:‚Ñùn‚Üí‚Ñù:ùêπ‚Üísuperscript‚Ñùùëõ‚ÑùF:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} realizable by feedforward ReLU neural networks is precisely the class of finite piecewise linear (PL) functions (Definition 3.3). Less well-understood is how architecture impacts function complexity and how complexity evolves during training. That is, for a fixed architecture of fully-connected, feedforward ReLU neural network, how does the set of finite PL functions realizable by that architecture sit inside the set of all finite PL functions? Do the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent preference certain classes of finite PL functions over others? In order to tackle these questions in a systematic way, we need a good framework for characterizing the complexity of finite PL functions. In the present work, we draw on algebraic topology and a PL version of Morse theory to develop a new notion of complexity. The idea of using Betti numbers of sublevel sets as a measure of complexity for neural network functions was initiated in [ref]3. Recall that the Betti numbers of a topological space are the ranks of its homology groups (see e.g. 0), and they are invariants of the space up to homeomorphism (in fact, up to the weaker notion of homotopy equivalence, see Definition 4.2). In [ref]3 and, later, , the homological or topological complexity of a continuous function F:‚Ñùn‚Üí‚Ñù:ùêπ‚Üísuperscript‚Ñùùëõ‚ÑùF:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} was defined as the collection of Betti numbers of the (single) sublevel set F‚â§0:=F‚àí1‚Äã(‚àí‚àû,0].assignsubscriptùêπabsent0superscriptùêπ10F_{\\leq 0}:=F^{-1}(-\\infty,0]. In [ref]3, the authors explore how homological complexity grows with respect to depth and width for neural networks with polynomial and arctan\\arctan activation functions, and in , the authors use persistent homology, introduced by Zomorodian-Carlsson in 5, to perform an empirical study of the homological complexity of ReLU neural networks of varying architectures. We note that modern practitioners favor the ReLU activation function for supervised learning problems involving regression. Our study begins with the observation that another natural and complementary notion of complexity of a continuous function is the number of homeomorphism classes of its sublevel sets, For a smooth function FùêπF, Morse theory provides a toolkit for not only computing algebro-topological invariants of the sublevel sets (e.g., their Betti numbers) but also understanding how they change as the threshold t=aùë°ùëét=a varies. Put simply, for a smooth function F:‚Ñùn‚Üí‚Ñù:ùêπ‚Üísuperscript‚Ñùùëõ‚ÑùF:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}, the homeomorphism class of a sublevel (or superlevel) set can only change across a critical point, where the gradient of FùêπF vanishes. Moreover, generic smooth functions are Morse, which means that the critical points are isolated and admit a standard quadratic local model. These conditions yield\na straightforward description of how the topology of the sublevel set changes as the threshold crosses the critical value; the change is local, controlled, and relatively easy to describe. For PL functions ‚Ñùn‚Üí‚Ñù‚Üísuperscript‚Ñùùëõ‚Ñù\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}, it is still natural to define a notion of complexity based on algebro-topological descriptions of homeomorphism classes of sublevel (or superlevel) sets. However, in contrast to the smooth setting, a generic finite PL function is not necessarily PL Morse (see Section 3); consequently, describing how the homological complexity of a sublevel set F‚â§asubscriptùêπabsentùëéF_{\\leq a} varies with a‚àà‚Ñùùëé‚Ñùa\\in\\mathbb{R} requires a more delicate analysis. Following ideas dating back to Banchoff , we focus our attention on the flat cells of a ReLU neural network map F:‚Ñùn‚Üí‚Ñù:ùêπ‚Üísuperscript‚Ñùùëõ‚ÑùF:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}. The canonical polyhedral complex ùíû‚Äã(F)ùíûùêπ\\mathcal{C}(F) associated to a feedforward ReLU neural network map F:‚Ñùn‚Üí‚Ñù:ùêπ‚Üísuperscript‚Ñùùëõ‚ÑùF:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{R} was introduced in ; informally, it is a decomposition of ‚Ñùnsuperscript‚Ñùùëõ\\mathbb{R}^{n} into convex polyhedra (cells) of varying dimension such that FùêπF is affine-linear on each cell. The flat cells of FùêπF are, by definition, the cells of ùíû‚Äã(F)ùíûùêπ\\mathcal{C}(F) on which FùêπF is constant. Flat cells in the PL category should be viewed as the appropriate analogues of critical points in the smooth category, with the caveat that not every flat cell is critical. Explicitly, we prove: Let F:‚Ñùn‚Üí‚Ñù:ùêπ‚Üísuperscript‚Ñùùëõ‚ÑùF:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} be a finite PL function, and let a‚â§b‚àà‚Ñùùëéùëè‚Ñùa\\leq b\\in\\mathbb{R} be thresholds. If the polyhedral complex ùíû‚Äã(F)F‚àà[a,b]ùíûsubscriptùêπsubscriptùêπabsentùëéùëè\\mathcal{C}(F)_{F_{\\in[a,b]}} contains no flat cells, then the sublevel sets F‚â§asubscriptùêπabsentùëéF_{\\leq a} and F‚â§bsubscriptùêπabsentùëèF_{\\leq b} are homotopy equivalent, as are the superlevel sets F‚â•asubscriptùêπabsentùëéF_{\\geq a} and F‚â•bsubscriptùêπabsentùëèF_{\\geq b}. Here, ùíû‚Äã(F)F‚àà[a,b]ùíûsubscriptùêπsubscriptùêπabsentùëéùëè\\mathcal{C}(F)_{F_{\\in[a,b]}} is a level set complex (see ¬ß2 for the precise definition); it is, roughly speaking, the restriction of the complex ùíû‚Äã(F)ùíûùêπ\\mathcal{C}(F) to the set F‚àí1‚Äã([a,b])superscriptùêπ1ùëéùëèF^{-1}([a,b]).\nHomotopy equivalence is an equivalence relation on topological spaces that is weaker than homeomorphism but strong enough to imply the equality of all standard invariants coming from algebraic topology (cf. Section 4 and 0). Moreover, since a finite PL map has finitely many flat cells, an immediate consequence of Theorem 1 is that there are finitely many homotopy equivalence classes of sublevel sets ‚Äì i.e. for a feedforward ReLU neural network function FùêπF, we need only consider finitely many sublevel sets F‚â§asubscriptùêπabsentùëéF_{\\leq a}, a‚àà‚Ñùùëé‚Ñùa\\in\\mathbb{R}, to capture all of the topological complexity information associated to FùêπF. To this end, we may first consider the sublevel sets F‚â§asubscriptùêπabsentùëéF_{\\leq a} (resp. superlevel sets F‚â•asubscriptùêπabsentùëéF_{\\geq a}) for very negative (resp. very positive) values of a‚àà‚Ñùùëé‚Ñùa\\in\\mathbb{R}.\nIndeed, if the images of all flat cells are contained in the compact interval [‚àíM,M]ùëÄùëÄ[-M,M], then the homology of F‚â§asubscriptùêπabsentùëéF_{\\leq a} and F‚â§bsubscriptùêπabsentùëèF_{\\leq b} agree for all a,b<‚àíMùëéùëèùëÄa,b<-M and the homology of F‚â•asubscriptùêπabsentùëéF_{\\geq a} and F‚â•bsubscriptùêπabsentùëèF_{\\geq b} agree for all a,b>MùëéùëèùëÄa,b>M. Consequently, a first (coarse) description of the topological topological complexity of FùêπF is given by: the collection of Betti numbers of the set F‚â§asubscriptùêπabsentùëéF_{\\leq a} for any a<‚àíMùëéùëÄa<-M, which we call the stable sublevel homological complexity of FùêπF, or stable sublevel HùêªH‚Äìcomplexity for short, and the collection of Betti numbers of F‚â•asubscriptùêπabsentùëéF_{\\geq a} for any a>MùëéùëÄa>M, which we call the stable superlevel HùêªH‚Äìcomplexity of FùêπF. Next, we may investigate how the sublevel sets F‚â§tsubscriptùêπabsentùë°F_{\\leq t} (and superlevel sets F‚â•tsubscriptùêπabsentùë°F_{\\geq t}) change as we vary t‚àà[‚àíM,M]ùë°ùëÄùëÄt\\in[-M,M]. In analogy to the smooth setting, our preference would be to apply PL Morse theory (as developed in ) to the class of finite PL maps realized by ReLU neural network functions, but we quickly see that ReLU neural network functions have a nonzero probability of being non PL Morse (Definition 3.5): Let F:‚Ñùn‚Üí‚Ñù:ùêπ‚Üísuperscript‚Ñùùëõ‚ÑùF:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} be a ReLU neural network map with hidden layers of dimensions (n1,‚Ä¶,n‚Ñì)subscriptùëõ1‚Ä¶subscriptùëõ‚Ñì(n_{1},\\ldots,n_{\\ell}). The probability that FùêπF is PL Morse is We remark that the expression (1) above for the probability is Additionally, note that for architectures whose hidden layers all have the same dimension (a common choice), the upper bound given by Theorem¬†2 is significantly lower for deep networks than for shallow networks of the same total dimension. For ReLU neural networks with >1absent1>1 hidden layer, we expect the true probability that FùêπF is PL Morse to be much lower than the given upper bound. Thus, in order to measure how the sublevel sets F‚â§tsubscriptùêπabsentùë°F_{\\leq t} change as we vary the threshold tùë°t, we need to do more work. Following [ref]7, we associate to each (connected component of)111Flat cells of PL maps need not be isolated. flat cell(s) KùêæK at level tùë°t its local homological complexity (or local HùêªH‚Äìcomplexity for short), which we define to be the rank of the relative homology of the pair (F‚â§t,F‚â§t‚àñK)subscriptùêπabsentùë°subscriptùêπabsentùë°ùêæ(F_{\\leq t},F_{\\leq t}\\setminus K). (Readers unfamiliar with relative homology may informally view the local HùêªH‚Äìcomplexity of KùêæK as the (total rank of the) homology of the quotient space obtained by collapsing everything in F‚â§tsubscriptùêπabsentùë°F_{\\leq t} outside of a neighborhood of KùêæK to a point; for more detail see 0.) We may then define the total HùêªH‚Äìcomplexity of a finite PL map to be the sum of all the local HùêªH‚Äìcomplexities. It is noted in [ref]7 that PL Morse regular points have local HùêªH‚Äìcomplexity 00 and PL Morse nondegenerate-critical points have local HùêªH‚Äìcomplexity 111. To prove Theorem 1 we draw heavily upon Grunert‚Äôs work in , where he proves an analogous result for bounded polyhedral complexes, aka polytopal complexes. We apply results in convex geometry and combinatorics (cf. 2) to construct,\nfor every ReLU neural network map F:‚Ñùn‚Üí‚Ñù:ùêπ‚Üísuperscript‚Ñùùëõ‚ÑùF:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} with canonical polyhedral complex ùíû‚Äã(F)ùíûùêπ\\mathcal{C}(F), a canonical polytopal complex, ùí¶‚Äã(F)ùí¶ùêπ\\mathcal{K}(F), and a homotopy equivalence |ùíû‚Äã(F)|‚àº|ùí¶‚Äã(F)|similar-toùíûùêπùí¶ùêπ|\\mathcal{C}(F)|\\sim|\\mathcal{K}(F)| (we use |‚ãÖ||\\cdot| to denote the underlying set of a polyhedral complex) that respects the finite PL map FùêπF: Let ùíûùíû\\mathcal{C} be a polyhedral complex in ‚Ñùnsuperscript‚Ñùùëõ\\mathbb{R}^{n}, let F:|ùíû|‚Üí‚Ñù:ùêπ‚Üíùíû‚ÑùF:|\\mathcal{C}|\\to\\mathbb{R} be linear on cells of ùíûùíû\\mathcal{C}, and assume |ùíûF‚àà[a,b]|‚äÜ|ùíû|subscriptùíûùêπùëéùëèùíû|\\mathcal{C}_{F\\in[a,b]}|\\subseteq|\\mathcal{C}| contains no flat cells. Then there exists a polytopal complex ùíüùíü\\mathcal{D} with |ùíü|‚äÇ|ùíû|ùíüùíû|\\mathcal{D}|\\subset|\\mathcal{C}| and a strong deformation retraction Œ¶:|ùíû|‚Üí|ùíü|:Œ¶‚Üíùíûùíü\\Phi:|\\mathcal{C}|\\to|\\mathcal{D}| (which induces a cellular map ùíû‚Üíùíü‚Üíùíûùíü\\mathcal{C}\\to\\mathcal{D}) such that\nŒ¶Œ¶\\Phi is FùêπF-level preserving on |ùíûF‚àà[a,b]|subscriptùíûùêπùëéùëè|\\mathcal{C}_{F\\in[a,b]}| and for every c‚àà[a,b]ùëêùëéùëèc\\in[a,b], Furthermore, there is an FùêπF-level preserving PL isotopy Combined with results of Grunert () for polytopal complexes, this immediately implies: Let ùíûùíû\\mathcal{C} be a polyhedral complex in ‚Ñùnsuperscript‚Ñùùëõ\\mathbb{R}^{n}, let F:|ùíû|‚Üí‚Ñù:ùêπ‚Üíùíû‚ÑùF:|\\mathcal{C}|\\to\\mathbb{R} be linear on cells of ùíûùíû\\mathcal{C}, and assume |ùíûF‚àà[a,b]|‚äÜ|ùíû|subscriptùíûùêπùëéùëèùíû|\\mathcal{C}_{F\\in[a,b]}|\\subseteq|\\mathcal{C}| contain no flat cells. Then for any threshold c‚àà[a,b]ùëêùëéùëèc\\in[a,b], |ùíûF‚â§c|subscriptùíûùêπùëê|\\mathcal{C}_{F\\leq c}| is homotopy equivalent to |ùíûF‚â§a|subscriptùíûùêπùëé|\\mathcal{C}_{F\\leq a}|; also |ùíûF‚â•c|subscriptùíûùêπùëê|\\mathcal{C}_{F\\geq c}| is homotopy equivalent to |ùíûF‚â•b|subscriptùíûùêπùëè|\\mathcal{C}_{F\\geq b}|. Because polytopal complexes admit finite simplicial subdivisions and there exist finite time algorithms for computing homology for finite simplicial complexes, Theorems 3 and 4 together have the following important practical consequence, which we state informally: For every flavor of HùêªH‚Äìcomplexity described in this paper and every finite PL map F:‚Ñùn‚Üí‚Ñù:ùêπ‚Üísuperscript‚Ñùùëõ‚ÑùF:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}, there exists a finite time algorithm for computing the HùêªH‚Äìcomplexity of FùêπF. After establishing these foundational preliminaries, we turn our attention to bounds, computations, and examples. In Section 6 we provide a useful combinatorial characterization of the local complexity of flat cells in shallow (i.e., depth 222) ReLU neural networks in terms of the ‚àáF‚àáùêπ\\nabla F orientation on the 111‚Äìcomplex of ùíû‚Äã(F)ùíûùêπ\\mathcal{C}(F). In Section 7, we introduce the stable sublevel and superlevel HùêªH‚Äìcomplexities as well as the coarse bounded sublevel and superlevel HùêªH‚Äìcomplexities of a finite PL function F:‚Ñùn‚Üí‚Ñù:ùêπ‚Üísuperscript‚Ñùùëõ‚ÑùF:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}. These are significantly less computationally expensive than total HùêªH‚Äìcomplexity but provide a reasonable measure of topological complexity in their own right. We also establish the following weak but computationally inexpensive lower bounds for coarse HùêªH‚Äìcomplexity: Let F:‚Ñùn‚Üí‚Ñù:ùêπ‚Üísuperscript‚Ñùùëõ‚ÑùF:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} be a finite PL function for which the images of the flat cells are contained in the interval [‚àíM,M]ùëÄùëÄ[-M,M]. Let n¬±subscriptùëõplus-or-minusn_{\\pm} denote the number of connected components of F‚â§¬±Msubscriptùêπabsentplus-or-minusùëÄF_{\\leq\\pm M} and let n¬±superscriptùëõplus-or-minusn^{\\pm} denote the number of connected components of F‚â•¬±Msubscriptùêπabsentplus-or-minusùëÄF_{\\geq\\pm M}. We have the following lower bounds: |n‚àí‚àín+|subscriptùëõsubscriptùëõ|n_{-}-n_{+}| is a lower bound for the coarse bounded sublevel HùêªH‚Äìcomplexity |n+‚àín‚àí|superscriptùëõsuperscriptùëõ|n^{+}-n^{-}| is a lower bound for the coarse bounded superlevel HùêªH‚Äìcomplexity We close, in Section 8, by presenting a construction proving that local HùêªH‚Äìcomplexity of a ReLU neural network function can be arbitrarily large.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: and a PL version of Morse theory to develop a new notion of complexity.
