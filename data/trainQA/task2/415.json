      "content": "Paper Title: Mapping Matters: Application Process Mapping on 3-D Processor Topologies\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nProcess placement on modern hardware architectures has been studied from various dimensions and in various contexts, leading to a significant body of work emerging in the literature over the years.\nRecent surveys provide an overview of existing solutions and open problems on the topic¬†¬†¬†¬†. The approach taken in this work involves: parallel MPI applications, algorithmic strategies for topology mapping, three-dimensional direct network topologies, communication models, application tracing, and trace-driven simulation. Most existing work considers parallel MPI applications when studying process mapping.\nMPI point-to-point calls have been found in a recent study¬† to be more prominently used than either persistent point-to-point or one-sided MPI calls. In this work, we study the effect of process mapping on the performance of MPI point-to-point calls. Hoefler et al.¬† classify the algorithmic strategies for topology mapping into four categories.\nThe algorithms considered in this work fall into three of those categories: greedy includes the Peano, Hilbert, Gray, sweep, and scan SFCs, greedy, FGgreedy, greedyALLC, and topo-aware, graph partitioning includes bipartition and PaCMap, while Bokhari is an isomorphism-based algorithm.\nWe do not include any subgraph isomorphism-based algorithms, because we only consider bijective mappings in this work. Process mapping is influenced by the underlying network topology.\nTherefore, mapping has been studied in the context of modern network topologies (torus, fat-tree, and Dragonfly) and technologies (InfiniBand, Ethernet, BlueGene, Cray, and others)¬†.\n¬†LibTopoMap¬† is a generic library of graph mapping heuristics (recursive bisection, kùëòk-way partitioning, simple greedy strategies, and Cuthill-McKee).\nMapping with LibTopoMap is based on similarity metrics (e.g., bandwidth of the adjacency matrices), employs rank reordering for MPI applications, and can be used on various network topologies and technologies.\nWhile the library is generic and versatile, it is not directly usable in a simulated environment where certain practical effects in the software stack are abstracted and a study of process mapping can concentrate on specific aspects such as the communication cost.\nSimulation is also important for the co-design of applications and future systems and is the approach we take in the present work. MPIPP¬† is a framework dedicated to MPI applications with arbitrary virtual topologies executing on SMP clusters and multi-clusters.\nSimilar to our work, the framework employs application tracing to obtain the communication behavior of the application.\nIn contrast to this work, the communication pattern is stored as a communication graph which is placed on the topology graph (determined on-the-fly via a parallel ping-pong mechanism).\nAlso different from our work, they only consider graph partitioning algorithms and conduct direct experiments on SMP clusters. Rodrigues et al.¬†[ref]46 use a purely quantitative approach to apply resource binding for MPI applications and reduce communication costs in multicore nodes.\nMercier and Clet-Ortega¬† use a similar but qualitative approach to the same problem.\nBoth works¬†[ref]46¬† employ graph partitioning to compute the mapping. Automated mapping has also been studied in the context of regular application communication graphs on 2-D and 3-D mesh and torus networks¬†.\nThere, the virtual topology is also represented as a graph and the mapping heuristics are chosen to optimize for hop‚ãÖ‚ãÖ\\cdotByte.\nIn our work, the virtual topology is represented as an adjacency matrix, while the mapping heuristics also optimize for dilation (measured as hop‚ãÖ‚ãÖ\\cdotByte) on 3-D mesh and torus topologies, complemented by the 3-D HAEC Box topology. EagerMap¬† employs a greedy topology mapping algorithm for hierarchical machine topologies (trees).\nIts algorithm groups together the application‚Äôs processes that show the highest affinity based on the communication matrix.\nAlthough the algorithm has been adapted to handle arbitrary network topologies, it requires hierarchical multicore nodes. In contrast, in this work we concentrate on 3-D network topologies. Rico-Gallego et al.¬† surveyed prominent communication performance models in high-performance computing, which are often tested in simulation.\nThey state that future models will need to take into account accurate performance and energy modeling.\nIn this work, we employ a contention-oblivious communication model called network coding dynamic resilient (NCDr)¬† that transmits messages efficiently, reliably, and with minimal energy costs.\nNCDr is implemented in HAEC-SIM¬†, the trace-based simulator used in this work. In addition to careful process mapping, Sensi et al.¬† show that application-aware routing outperforms application-agnostic routing.\nSimilarly, in this work we employ shortest path routing and argue that, in addition, communication-aware mapping is needed and show that, in certain cases, it outperforms communication-oblivious mapping. Trace-driven simulation has also recently been used by Tsuji et¬†al.¬† to study application behavior on future systems.\nTheir workflow is very similar to ours with the difference that their focus is to support the analysis of applications larger than the real MPI traces from existing systems and they do not explicitly consider process mapping.\nWhile we are also concerned with scalability (planned for future work), in the present work we concentrate on answering the three research questions (Section¬†1) for modern application-system pairs. Kenny et al.¬† consider the influence of the network and its parameters on the performance of parallel MPI applications.\nThey decompose the application time spent in MPI into: communication, synchronization, and software stack components.\nThrough the combination of Bayesian inference and trace replay, they found that synchronization and MPI software stack overheads are at least as important as the network itself in determining time spent in communication routines.\nIn this work, we explicitly study the impact of network topology and its parameters under various process mapping strategies.\nMeasuring the time spent in synchronization and in various components of the software stack is highly complex and will be incorporated into our workflow in the future.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: on-the-fly via a parallel ping-pong mechanism).\nAlso different from our work, they only consider graph partitioning algorithms and conduct direct experiments on SMP clusters.
