The sets in ℛ​(E,k)ℛ𝐸𝑘\\mathcal{R}(E,k) are called the winning committees for E𝐸E under ℛℛ\\mathcal{R}. In this work, we focus on\na well-studied class of voting rules known as Thiele rules  , and their greedy variants.\nWe say that a function λ:ℕ+→[ref]0 :𝜆→superscriptℕ01\\lambda:\\mathbb{N}^{+}\\rightarrow[ref]0  is an Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) function\nif λ​(1)=1𝜆11\\lambda(1)=1 and λ𝜆\\lambda is non-increasing, i.e. for all i,j∈ℕ+𝑖𝑗superscriptℕi,j\\in\\mathbb{N}^{+} it holds that i>j𝑖𝑗i>j implies λ​(i)≤λ​(j)𝜆𝑖𝜆𝑗\\lambda(i)\\leq\\lambda(j) . In what follows, we assume that all OWA functions λ𝜆\\lambda we consider take values in ℚ∩[ref]0 ℚ01{\\mathbb{Q}}\\cap[ref]0  and are polynomial-time computable.\nEach OWA function λ𝜆\\lambda\ndefines a Thiele rule ℛλsubscriptℛ𝜆\\mathcal{R}_{\\lambda} as follows.\nGiven an election E=(C,V)𝐸𝐶𝑉E=(C,V) and a committee size k∈[|C|]𝑘delimited-[]𝐶k\\in[|C|], the λ​-score𝜆-score\\lambda\\text{-score} of a candidate set S⊆C𝑆𝐶S\\subseteq C in E𝐸E is defined by:\nλ​-scoreE​(S)=∑i∈N(∑j=1|S∩vi|λ​(j)).𝜆superscript-score𝐸𝑆subscript𝑖𝑁superscriptsubscript𝑗1𝑆subscript𝑣𝑖𝜆𝑗\\lambda\\text{-score}^{E}(S)=\\sum_{i\\in N}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{|S\\cap v_{i}|}\\lambda(j)\\right).\nThe rule ℛλsubscriptℛ𝜆\\mathcal{R}_{\\lambda} then outputs all size-k𝑘k subsets of C𝐶C with the maximum λ​-score𝜆-score\\lambda\\text{-score}: ℛλ​(E,k)=argmax​{λ​-score​(S)∣S∈(Ck)}subscriptℛ𝜆𝐸𝑘argmaxconditional-set𝜆-score𝑆𝑆binomial𝐶𝑘\\mathcal{R}_{\\lambda}(E,k)=\\mathrm{argmax}\\{\\lambda\\text{-score}(S)\\mid S\\in\\binom{C}{k}\\}.\nWe omit λ𝜆\\lambda and/or E𝐸E whenever it is clear from the context.\nThis framework captures many well-known voting rules. Specifically, λ​(i)=1𝜆𝑖1\\lambda(i)=1 for all i∈ℕ+𝑖superscriptℕi\\in\\mathbb{N}^{+} corresponds to the Approval Voting (AV) rule ; λ​(i)=1/i𝜆𝑖1𝑖\\lambda(i)=\\nicefrac{{1}}{{i}} for all i∈ℕ+𝑖superscriptℕi\\in\\mathbb{N}^{+} corresponds to the Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) rule 2; and λ​(i)=[i=1]𝜆𝑖delimited-[]𝑖1\\lambda(i)=[i=1] for all i∈ℕ+𝑖superscriptℕi\\in\\mathbb{N}^{+} corresponds to the Chamberlin–Courant Approval Voting (CCAV) rule 1. The AV rule is appropriate when the aim is to select a group of individually excellent candidates, whereas CCAV aims to represent as many voters as possible; the PAV rule provides strong proportional representation guarantees .\nWe say that an OWA function λ𝜆\\lambda (and the associated Thiele rule ℛλsubscriptℛ𝜆\\mathcal{R}_{\\lambda}) is unit-decreasing if\nλ​(1)=1>λ​(2)𝜆11𝜆2\\lambda(1)=1>\\lambda(2). AV is not unit-decreasing, whereas PAV and CCAV are. Intuitively, unit-decreasing rules capture that the voters’ marginal utility from having an additional representative in the winning committee is lower than their utility from being represented at all. Since committees under both PAV and CCAV are 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hard to compute   3, there exist greedy approximation variants of these rules, which are based on the notion of marginal contributions.\nGiven an election E=(C,V)𝐸𝐶𝑉E=(C,V), a subset S⊆C𝑆𝐶S\\subseteq C of candidates and an OWA function λ𝜆\\lambda, we define the marginal contribution (or points) of a candidate c∈C∖S𝑐𝐶𝑆c\\in C\\setminus S with respect to S𝑆S as\nλ​-score​(S∪{c})−λ​-score​(S)𝜆-score𝑆𝑐𝜆-score𝑆\\lambda\\text{-score}(S\\cup\\{c\\})-\\lambda\\text{-score}(S).\nThen, the greedy variant of a Thiele rule ℛλsubscriptℛ𝜆\\mathcal{R}_{\\lambda}, which we denote by Greedy-​ℛλGreedy-subscriptℛ𝜆\\text{Greedy-}\\mathcal{R}_{\\lambda}, outputs all committees that can be obtained by the following iterative procedure: start with an empty committee S𝑆S and perform k𝑘k iterations; at each iteration, add a candidate in C∖S𝐶𝑆C\\setminus S with maximum marginal contribution to S𝑆S under λ𝜆\\lambda (at each iteration there may be multiple candidates with maximum marginal contribution to the current committee; a committee is in the output of the rule if it can be obtained by some way of breaking these ties at each iteration). Clearly, a committee in the output of Greedy-​ℛλGreedy-subscriptℛ𝜆\\text{Greedy-}\\mathcal{R}_{\\lambda} can be computed in polynomial time (recall that we assume that λ𝜆\\lambda itself is polynomial-time computable).\nWe note that Greedy-AV is equivalent to AV; however, other Thiele rules differ from their greedy variants.\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: the winning committees for E𝐸E under ℛℛ\\mathcal{R}. In this work, we focus on\na well-studied class of voting rules known as Thiele rules  , and their greedy variants.\nWe say that a function λ:ℕ+→[ref]0 :𝜆→superscriptℕ01\\lambda:\\mathbb{N}^{+}\\rightarrow[ref]0  is an Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) function\nif λ​(1)=1𝜆11\\lambda(1)=1 and λ𝜆\\lambda is non-increasing, i.e. for all\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
