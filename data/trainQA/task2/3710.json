      "content": "Paper Title: Disentangling Object Motion and Occlusion for Unsupervised Multi-frame Monocular Depth\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCityscapes¬† is a challenging dataset with significant amount of dynamic objects. It contains 5,00050005,000 videos each with 303030 frames, totaling 150,000150000150,000 image frames. We exclude the first, last, and static-camera frames in each video for training, resulting in 58,3355833558,335 frames training data. The official testing set contains 1,52515251,525 image frames. Table¬†1 shows the depth prediction results on the Cityscapes¬† testing set. Following the convention, we rank all methods based on the absolute-relative-errors. Since the Cityscapes dataset contains significant amount of dynamic objects, the object-motion-optimized method InstaDM¬†[ref]22 achieved the best accuracy among all the existing methods. With the help of our proposed Dynamic Object Motion Disentanglement (DOMD), Dynamic Object Cycle Consistency Loss, Occlusion-aware Cost Volume and the Occlusion-aware Re-projection Loss, our method outperforms the InstaDM¬†[ref]22 by a large margin in all of the metrics using a lower resolution and more concise architecture (we do not require the explicit per-object-motion network, instance level segmentation prior and inter-frame correspondences). Qualitative visualizations are in Fig.¬†8. Table¬†2 shows the depth errors in the dynamic objects area. Our Depth Prior Network Œ∏D‚ÄãP‚ÄãNsubscriptùúÉùê∑ùëÉùëÅ\\theta_{DPN} shares a similar architecture with the Monodepth2¬†[ref]10 while trained jointly with our multi-frame model Œ∏M‚ÄãFsubscriptùúÉùëÄùêπ\\theta_{MF} using Dynamic Object Cycle Consistency Loss LcsubscriptùêøùëêL_{c}. It outperforms all the existing methods including Monodepth2¬†[ref]10 and InstaDM¬†[ref]22. Manydepth¬† suffers catastrophic failure on the dynamic objects due to the aforementioned mismatch and occlusion problems. They employed an separate single-frame model as a teacher for dynamic objects area. However, since it does not actually solve the mismatch and occlusion problems, it still makes severe mistakes on dynamic objects. In contrast, with our proposed innovations, our multi-frame model Œ∏M‚ÄãFsubscriptùúÉùëÄùêπ\\theta_{MF} boosts up the accuracy even higher, achieves superior advantages on all the metrics, showing its significant effectiveness. We show a qualitative visualization in Fig.¬†7.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: the convention, we rank all methods based on the absolute-relative-errors.
