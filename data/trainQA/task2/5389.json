      "content": "Paper Title: Cut and Learn for Unsupervised Object Detection and Instance Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSelf-supervised feature learning involves inferring the patterns within the large-scale unlabeled data without using human-annotated labels. Contrastive learning based     methods learn such representations that similar samples or various augmentations of the same instance are close to each other, while dissimilar instances are far apart.\nSimilarity-based self-supervised learning methods   learn representations via minimizing the distance between different augmentations of the same instance and use only positive sample pairs.\nClustering-based feature learning      automatically discovers the natural grouping of data in the latent representation space.\nRecently, 5  have shown that masked autoencoders, which learn representations via masking out a large random subset of image patches and reconstructing the missing pixels or patches 4 3 5 , are scalable self-supervised learners for computer vision 5. In contrast to these unsupervised representation learning efforts,\nour work aims to automatically discover natural pixel groupings and locate instances within each image. Unsupervised object detection and instance segmentation.\nThe main comparisons to previous works are listed in Table 1 and are elaborated as follows: DINO [ref]7 observes that the underlying semantic segmentation of images can emerge from the self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) 5, which does not appear explicitly in either supervised ViT or ConvNets  [ref]7.\nBased on this observation, LOST  and TokenCut  leverage self-supervised ViT features and propose to segment one single salient object 1   from each image based on a graph that is constructed with DINO’s patch features. These previous works either can not detect more than one object from each image, e.g., DINO and TokenCut, or can not improve the quality of features for better transfer to downstream detection and segmentation tasks, e.g., TokenCut and LOST. Unlike these works, CutLER can locate multiple objects and serve as a pretrained model for label-efficient and fully-supervised learning. FreeSOLO [ref]47 achieves unsupervised instance segmentation by extracting coarse object masks in an unsupervised manner, followed by mask refinement through a self-training procedure.\nWhile FreeSOLO’s FreeMask stage can generate multiple coarse masks per image, the quality of these masks is often rather low [ref]47.\nMaskDistill  distills class-agnostic initial masks from the affinity graph produced by a self-supervised DINO [ref]7.\nHowever, it utilizes one single mask per image in the distillation stage, which greatly limits the model’s ability to detect multiple objects. By contrast, the initial masks generated by our MaskCut are usually better in quality and quantity than the initial masks used by [ref]47 . Therefore, CutLER achieves 2×⁣∼similar-to\\times\\raise 0.73193pt\\hbox{$\\scriptstyle\\sim$}4×\\times higher APboxbox{}^{\\text{box}} and APmaskmask{}^{\\text{mask}} than FreeSOLO [ref]47 and MaskDistill  on almost all experimented detection and segmentation benchmarks, even when FreeSOLO and MaskDistill are trained and tested on the same domain.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: and locate instances within each image.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
