Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

Code is available at https://github.com/alinlab/SelfPatch. ImageNet pre-training details.\nIn Sec. 4, we perform unsupervised pre-training using ViT-S/16  on the ImageNet [ref]11 dataset\nfor 200 epochs with a batch size of 1024.\nIn the case of the joint usage of DINO  and our method (i.e., DINO + SelfPatch), we generally follow the training details of Caron et al. , including the optimizer and the learning rate schedule. Specifically, we use the AdamW  optimizer with a linear warmup of the learning rate during the first 10 epochs, and the learning rate is decayed with a cosine schedule. We also follow the linear scaling rule : l​r=0.0005⋅batchsize/256𝑙𝑟⋅0.0005batchsize256lr=0.0005\\cdot\\text{batchsize}/256.\nWe use 2 global crops and 8 local crops (i.e., 2×2242+8×9622superscript22428superscript9622\\times 224^{2}+8\\times 96^{2}) for multi-crop augmentation  .\nFor our aggregation module, we use two class-attention blocks 6 without Layerscale normalization 6.\nFor the final output dimension of the projection head, we use K=65536𝐾65536K=65536 for the SSL projection head following Caron et al.  and K=4096𝐾4096K=4096 for our projection head.\nIn Sec. 4, we use a publicly available DINO pre-trained model555https://github.com/facebookresearch/vissl. with 300 training epochs on the ImageNet as the baseline, which also use the same hyperparameters as the above.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
