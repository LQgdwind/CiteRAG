      "content": "Paper Title: CVAE-H: Conditionalizing Variational Autoencoders via Hypernetworks and Trajectory Forecasting for Autonomous Driving\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we review existing models for the prediction task and categorize them. The first categorization of the prediction approaches is based on input features the prediction model utilizes. Models that focus on the social features include Social-LSTM [ref]9, Social-GAN , and Trafficpredict [ref]14. Some models focused on exploiting the spatial features, for example, IntentNet , Fast and Furious , that effectively capture underlying traffic rules from the road geometry; however, interactions among road agents are not explicitly modeled. There are also models that utilize both social and spatial features such as DESIRE [ref]6, SoPhie , R2P2 , and MTP . The second categorization is based on the core mechanics of the prediction models; either deterministic or probabilistic. Many earlier deterministic models leveraged either physics-based modeling techniques  (e.g., constant velocity model and car-following model) or relatively light-weight neural networks such as multi-layer perceptron (MLP), RNN, and/or CNN [ref]9, while a few recent deterministic models work with larger deep neural networks   . Generative models are examples of probabilistic models that model a joint distribution p‚Äã(xi)ùëùsubscriptùë•ùëñp(x_{i}) using zùëßz that is a variable that encodes the underlying dynamics of the data distribution. Furthermore, a group of generative models that are used to model a conditional distribution p‚Äã(xo|xi)ùëùconditionalsubscriptùë•ùëúsubscriptùë•ùëñp(x_{o}|x_{i}) are called conditional generative models. Examples include conditional VAE , conditional GAN , and conditional flow . Modern generative models, including GAN, VAE, Flow, and Mixture Density Networks (MDN)  are popular across several domains of artificial intelligence and machine learning due to their capacities to approximate complex probability distributions. GAN is well-known for producing samples of excellent qualities. However, it does not explicitly model the probability 0. This means that GAN has to rely on expensive Monte-Carlo sampling to approximate the probability distribution of the generated samples to reason the uncertainties of the predictions. Unlike GAN, VAE is a type of explicit generative model that models probability density p‚Äã(x)ùëùùë•p(x) explicitly. This property allows us to obtain the uncertainties of the sample predictions directly. Besides, several recent VAE-based models have shown promising results at predicting trajectories of human-driven vehicles in urban environments [ref]6  1. Normalizing flow, or Flow, is also a type of explicit generative model. While flow-based models  2  have access to the exact probability density p‚Äã(x)ùëùùë•p(x), flow-based models are typically better suited for density estimations than generative tasks (e.g., trajectory forecasting). MDN is another generative model that models explicit probability densities. A common choice for the density model is a mixture of Gaussians where the neural network estimates the parameters of the Gaussian mixture. MDN with Gaussian mixtures have been used for prediction tasks  [ref]14 3. Since MDN works with a pre-determined number of modes, a MDN(GMM)-based model may sacrifice the generality.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: task and categorize them.
