      "content": "Paper Title: Reinforced Causal Explainer for Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph neural networks (GNNs)   have exhibited impressive performance in a variety of tasks, where the data are graph-structured.\nTheir success comes mainly from the powerful representation learning, which incorporates graph structure in an end-to-end fashion.\nAlongside performance, explainability becomes central to the practical impact of GNNs, especially in real-world applications on fairness, security, and robustness [ref]3  .\nAiming to answer questions like “Why the GNN model made a certain prediction?”, we focus on post-hoc , local , model-agnostic  explainability — that is, considering the target GNN model as a black-box (i.e., post-hoc), an explainer interprets its predictions of individual instances (i.e., local), which is applicable to any GNNs (i.e., model-agnostic).\nTowards this end, a prevalent paradigm is feature attribution and selection  0 1 2.\nTypically, given an input graph, it distributes the model’s outcome prediction to the input features (i.e., edges), and then selects the salient substructure (i.e., the subset of edges) as an explanatory subgraph.\nSuch an explanatory subgraph is expected to provide insight into the model workings. Towards high-quality feature attribution, it is essential to uncover the relationships between the input features and outcome predictions underlying the GNN model.\nMost existing explainers reveal the relationships via\n(1) gradient-like signals w.r.t. edges 3 4 5, which are obtained by backpropagating the model outcome to the graph structure;\n(2) masks or attention scores of edges 6 7 8, which are derived from the masking functions or attention networks to approximate the target prediction via the fractional (masked or attentive) graph;\nor (3) prediction changes on perturbed edges 9 0 , which are fetched by perturbing the graph structure, such as leaving subgraphs out and auditing the outcome change 9 or computing the Shapley values .\nSubsequently, the subset of edges with top attributions composes an explanatory subgraph most influential to the model’s decision. Nonetheless, we argue that these explainers are prone to generating suboptimal explanations since two key factors remain largely unexplored: Causal effects of edges. It is crucial to specify the edges that are the plausible causation of the model outcome, rather than the edges irrelevant or spuriously correlated with the outcome 1 2. However, as the explainers using gradient- and attention-like scores typically approach the input-outcome relationships from an associational standpoint, they hardly distinguish causal from noncausal effects of edges.\nTake Figure 1 as a running example, where SA 3 and GNNExplainer 6 explain why the GIN model 3 predicts the molecule graph as mutagenic.\nAs the nitrogen-carbon (N-C) bond often connects with the nitro group (NO2), it is spuriously correlated with the mutagenic property, thus ranked top by SA.\nFeeding such spurious edges solely into the model, however, hardly recovers the target prediction, thus unfaithfully reflect the model’s decision. Dependencies among edges. Most explainers ignore the edge dependencies when probing the edge attributions and constructing the explanatory subgraph. One key reason is that they draw attributions of edges independently 4 9 5.\nIn fact, edges usually collaborate and cooperate with other edges to approach the decision boundary instead. Such highly-dependent edges form a coalition that can frame a prototype memorized in the model to make decisions.\nConsidering SA’s explanation, compared to the individual N-C bond, its combination with the carbon-carbon (C=C) bond brings no unique information about the model prediction, as only a marginal improvement on predictive accuracy is achieved111When removing the counterparts, the single N-C bond and its combination with the C=C bond are predicted as mutagenic with probability of 0.31 and 0.35, respectively.. In contrast, two nitrogen-oxygen (N=O) bonds form a nitro group (NO2), which is a typical coalition responsible for the mutagenic property [ref]3 and purses a higher influence on the prediction than individuals222The probability of being mutagenic increases from 0.72 (feeding the first N=O bond solely into GIN) to 0.95 (feeding the first two N=O bonds together into GIN).. Clearly, the N=O bonds within NO2 ought to be better post-hoc explanations. In this work, we explore the edges’ causal effects and dependencies, in order to generate explanations that are faithful to the model’s decision-making process and consistent to human cognition.\nIndeed, it is challenging but can be solved after we introduce the screening strategy 6 equipped with causality 7.\nSpecifically, the screening strategy frames the explanation task as sequentially adding edges — that is, it starts from an empty set as the explanatory subgraph, and incrementally adds edges into the subgraph, one edge at a time step.\nDuring the screening, causality gifts us the manner to assess the dependencies of the previously added edges and the edge candidate being selected, answering the “What would happen to the prediction, if we add this edge into the GNN’s input?” question.\nThe basis is doing causal attribution on the edge candidate as its individual causal effect (ICE) 7 8, given the previous selections.\nFormally, it compares the model outcomes under treatment (i.e., the GNN takes the coalition of the edge and the previous selection as input) and control (i.e., the GNN tasks the previous selection only).\nPositive causal attribution indicates the edge coalition offers unique information strongly relevant to the prediction; otherwise, the edge is redundant or irrelevant. Towards this end, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) agent, Reinforced Causal Explainer (RC-Explainer), to achieve the causal screening strategy.\nThe insight is that the RL agent with the stochastic policy can determine automatically where to search, given the uncertainty information of the learned policy, which can be updated promptly by the stream of reward signals.\nTechnically, RC-Explainer uses a simple neural network as the policy network to learn the probability of edge candidates being selected, and then select one potential edge as the action, at each step.\nSuch a sequence of edges forms the policy, and gets rewards that consist of the causal attributions of each compositional edge and subgraphs.\nAs such, we can to exhibit the dependencies of explained edges, and highlight the influence of edge coalition.\nWe resort to policy gradient to optimize the policy network.\nWith a global understanding of the GNN, our RC-Explainer is able to offer model-level explanations for each graph instance, and generalize to unseen graphs.\nExperiments on three datasets showcase the effectiveness of our explanations, which are more consistent, concise, and faithful to the predictions compared with existing methods.\n Contributions of this work are summarized as follows: We emphasize the importance of edges’ causal effects and dependencies to reveal the edge attributions and build the explanatory subgraph, so as to interpret the GNN predictions faithfully and concisely. We frame the explanation as a sequential decision process and develop an RL agent, RC-Explainer, to take the cause-effect look at the edge dependencies. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets, showing the effectiveness of our RC-Explainer w.r.t. predictive accuracy, contrastivity, sanity checks, and visual inspections.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: structure in an end-to-end fashion.\nAlongside performance, explainability becomes central to the practical impact of GNNs, especially in real-world applications on fairness, security, and robustness [ref]3  .\nAiming to answer questions like “Why the GNN model made a certain prediction?”, we focus on post-hoc , local , model-agnostic  explainability — that is, considering the target GNN model as\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
