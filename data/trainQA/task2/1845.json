We begin with some definitions. A symmetric kernel function k:𝒳×𝒳→ℝ:𝑘→𝒳𝒳ℝk:\\mathcal{X}\\times\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} is positive semi definite (psd) if the corresponding matrix [k​(𝝃n,𝝃m)]n​msubscriptdelimited-[]𝑘subscript𝝃𝑛subscript𝝃𝑚𝑛𝑚[k(\\bm{\\xi}_{n},\\bm{\\xi}_{m})]_{nm} for any finite set {𝝃1,…,𝝃N}⊂𝒳⊂ℝlsubscript𝝃1…subscript𝝃𝑁𝒳superscriptℝ𝑙\\{\\bm{\\xi}_{1},\\ldots,\\bm{\\xi}_{N}\\}\\subset\\mathcal{X}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{l} is psd. Henceforth, we consider only kernels k𝑘k that are symmetric, psd and bounded on 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}. A real-valued function f:𝒳→ℝ:𝑓→𝒳ℝf:\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} is Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant L≥0𝐿0L\\geq 0 if |f​(𝝃)−f​(𝝃′)|≤L​∥𝝃−𝝃′∥𝑓𝝃𝑓superscript𝝃′𝐿delimited-∥∥𝝃superscript𝝃′|f(\\bm{\\xi})-f(\\bm{\\xi}^{\\prime})|\\leq L\\lVert\\bm{\\xi}-\\bm{\\xi}^{\\prime}\\rVert, ∀𝝃,𝝃′∈𝒳⊂ℝlfor-all𝝃superscript𝝃′𝒳superscriptℝ𝑙\\forall\\bm{\\xi},\\bm{\\xi}^{\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{X}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{l}, in which the standard Euclidean norm is used (∥⋅∥delimited-∥∥⋅\\lVert\\cdot\\rVert is used to denote a standard Euclidean norm throughout). We define a kernel k𝑘k to be Lipschitz continuous with a Lipschitz constant Lksuperscript𝐿𝑘L^{k} in the sense that Most commonly used kernels, including the squared-exponential and the Matern class of kernels, are Lipschitz continuous in the sense defined above. A function f:𝒳→ℝ:𝑓→𝒳ℝf:\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} admits a monotonic function ω​(⋅)𝜔⋅\\omega(\\cdot) as a modulus of continuity iff |f​(𝝃)−f​(𝝃′)|≤ω​(∥𝝃−𝝃′∥)𝑓𝝃𝑓superscript𝝃′𝜔delimited-∥∥𝝃superscript𝝃′|f(\\bm{\\xi})-f(\\bm{\\xi}^{\\prime})|\\leq\\omega(\\lVert\\bm{\\xi}-\\bm{\\xi}^{\\prime}\\rVert), ∀𝝃,𝝃′∈𝒳for-all𝝃superscript𝝃′𝒳\\forall\\bm{\\xi},\\bm{\\xi}^{\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{X}. The τ𝜏\\tau covering number M​(τ,𝒳)𝑀𝜏𝒳M(\\tau,\\mathcal{X}) of a set 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}\nis defined as the minimum number of open balls with radius τ𝜏\\tau (with respect to the standard Euclidean metric) that\nis required to completely cover 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}. We use ∥𝐀∥2=sup∥𝐱∥=1∥𝐀𝐱∥subscriptdelimited-∥∥𝐀2subscriptsupremumdelimited-∥∥𝐱1delimited-∥∥𝐀𝐱\\lVert{\\bf A}\\rVert_{2}=\\sup_{\\lVert{\\bf x}\\rVert=1}\\lVert{\\bf A}{\\bf x}\\rVert to denote the matrix norm of 𝐀∈ℝn×m𝐀superscriptℝ𝑛𝑚{\\bf A}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times m} induced by the standard Euclidean norm in ℝmsuperscriptℝ𝑚\\mathbb{R}^{m}. A number of results have been obtained in relation to error bounds for the simplest univariate GP models. Most of the bounds are derived based on the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) (a recent review can be found in ). For every psd kernel k​(⋅,⋅)𝑘⋅⋅k(\\cdot,\\cdot) there exists a unique RKHS ℋksubscriptℋ𝑘\\mathcal{H}_{k}, the functions f𝑓f in which inherit the smoothness properties of the kernel. This is easily seen by the following characterization of a RKHS: define an inner product space 𝒱𝒱\\mathcal{V} with inner product ⟨f,g⟩ℋk=∑n∑man​bm​k​(𝝃n,𝝃m′)subscript𝑓𝑔subscriptℋ𝑘subscript𝑛subscript𝑚subscript𝑎𝑛subscript𝑏𝑚𝑘subscript𝝃𝑛superscriptsubscript𝝃𝑚′\\langle f,g\\rangle_{\\mathcal{H}_{k}}=\\sum_{n}\\sum_{m}a_{n}b_{m}k(\\bm{\\xi}_{n},\\bm{\\xi}_{m}^{\\prime}), where g​(⋅)=∑mbm​k​(⋅,𝝃m′)𝑔⋅subscript𝑚subscript𝑏𝑚𝑘⋅superscriptsubscript𝝃𝑚′g(\\cdot)=\\sum_{m}b_{m}k(\\cdot,\\bm{\\xi}_{m}^{\\prime}),\nand induced norm ∥f∥ℋk=⟨f,f⟩ℋk1/2subscriptdelimited-∥∥𝑓subscriptℋ𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑓subscriptℋ𝑘12\\lVert f\\rVert_{\\mathcal{H}_{k}}=\\langle f,f\\rangle_{\\mathcal{H}_{k}}^{1/2}. 𝒱𝒱\\mathcal{V} is a pre-Hilbert space from which we obtain the unique RKHS as ℋk={f∈𝒱¯:∥f∥ℋk<∞}subscriptℋ𝑘conditional-set𝑓¯𝒱subscriptdelimited-∥∥𝑓subscriptℋ𝑘{\\mathcal{H}_{k}}=\\{f\\in\\overline{\\mathcal{V}}:\\lVert f\\rVert_{\\mathcal{H}_{k}}<\\infty\\}, where the closure is defined with respect to the metric induced by ∥⋅∥ℋksubscriptdelimited-∥∥⋅subscriptℋ𝑘\\lVert\\cdot\\rVert_{\\mathcal{H}_{k}}.\nFor the squared exponential and other common kernels, ℋk⊂C∞​(𝒳)subscriptℋ𝑘superscript𝐶𝒳{\\mathcal{H}_{k}}\\subset C^{\\infty}(\\mathcal{X}), while for Matern kernels, ∥⋅∥ℋksubscriptdelimited-∥∥⋅subscriptℋ𝑘\\lVert\\cdot\\rVert_{\\mathcal{H}_{k}} is norm-equivalent to a Sobolev space Ws,2​(𝒳)superscript𝑊𝑠2𝒳W^{s,2}(\\mathcal{X}), s>l/2𝑠𝑙2s>l/2. In general, therefore, RKHSs are quite restrictive, and are small compared to the support of a prior GP distribution with the covariance function (kernel) that defines the RKHS. Bounds can be derived for the GP regression error using the equivalence between GP regression and stationary kernel interpolation , the latter of which can be posed as an optimization problem in the RKHS ℋksubscriptℋ𝑘\\mathcal{H}_{k} corresponding to the interpolation kernel k𝑘k . If the true function in GP modelling is hypothesised to lie in this space, the results can be carried over. The bounds are given in terms of a power function, which is identified with the posterior variance of an equivalent GP model. For noisy data, analogous results for kernel ridge regression can be used, in which case the error bounds depend on\nthe norm ∥f∥ℋksubscriptdelimited-∥∥𝑓subscriptℋ𝑘\\lVert f\\rVert_{\\mathcal{H}_{k}} of the unknown function f𝑓f, as well as an empirical covering number with respect to the L2​(μ)superscript𝐿2𝜇L^{2}(\\mu) norm, where μ𝜇\\mu is the unknown distribution over the data . Again for noisy observations, information theoretic and RKHS approaches were used by Srinivas et al. [ref]31, later improved upon by Chowdhury and Gopalan , to find error bounds for GP regression. These bounds involve constants that in practice are difficult to obtain.\nAn alternative hypothesis is to take the support of the prior distribution of the GP as the belief space from which to seek the true function. This hypothesis has been employed in stochastic bandit problems based on GPs  [ref]34 and more recently has been used to establish general interpretable bounds for basic GP models  . The sample space is the largest possible space of candidate functions, and leads to bounds that can be approximated for common settings with relative ease, in comparison to the RKHS approaches. In the analysis below, we use the interpolation (noise-free) results of Wang et al. [ref]34, and, in particular, follow closely the analysis of Lederer et al.  to extend their univariate, single-fidelity probabilistic uniform error bound to ResGP. Such a bound is defined as follows A GP estimate μ​(𝛏)𝜇𝛏\\mu(\\bm{\\xi}) of an unknown function y​(𝛏)𝑦𝛏y(\\bm{\\xi}) has a uniformly bounded error\non a compact set 𝒳⊂ℝl𝒳superscriptℝ𝑙\\mathcal{X}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{l} if there exists a function g​(𝛏)𝑔𝛏g(\\bm{\\xi}) such that If this bound holds with probability of at least 1−δ1𝛿1-\\delta for some\nδ∈(0,1)𝛿01\\delta\\in(0,1), it is called a probabilistic uniform error bound. As stated above, we require the following main assumption over the unknown function, in this case yF​(𝝃)superscript𝑦𝐹𝝃y^{F}(\\bm{\\xi}), namely that it belongs to the sample space of the prior GP. yF​(𝝃)superscript𝑦𝐹𝝃y^{F}(\\bm{\\xi}) is a realisation (is in the sample space) of the following GP and observations ynFsuperscriptsubscript𝑦𝑛𝐹y_{n}^{F} are evaluations of this function at the design points, that is ynF=yF​(𝛏n)superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑛𝐹superscript𝑦𝐹subscript𝛏𝑛y_{n}^{F}=y^{F}(\\bm{\\xi}_{n}), ∀𝛏n∈𝒳Ffor-allsubscript𝛏𝑛superscript𝒳𝐹\\forall\\bm{\\xi}_{n}\\in\\mathcal{X}^{F}. The properties of sample paths of this GP (the belief space) are again closely related to the smoothness of the kernel, but are more difficult to establish and quantify. For stationary kernels k​(𝝃−𝝃′)𝑘𝝃superscript𝝃′k(\\bm{\\xi}-\\bm{\\xi}^{\\prime}), almost surely (a.s.) or sample path continuity is ensured by sufficient smoothness of k𝑘k at the origin  (section 2.5). Similar continuity results can be established for derivatives of the sample paths, essentially requiring 2k𝑘k times differentiability of the kernel to establish k𝑘k times differentiability of sample paths  (section 2.5.2). Although Lipschitz continuity is a rather strong form a continuity, implying amongst other things uniform continuity, this assumption is still rather mild in comparison to the RKHS hypothesis. The following Lemma (see Appendix A for the proof) enables us to prove the main result on the uniform error bound for the ResGP approximation of yFsuperscript𝑦𝐹y^{F}. Consider the posterior GP process defined by 20, in which all of the\nkernels kf​(𝛏,𝛏′|𝛉f)superscript𝑘𝑓𝛏conditionalsuperscript𝛏′superscript𝛉𝑓k^{f}(\\bm{\\xi},\\bm{\\xi}^{\\prime}|\\bm{\\theta}^{f}) are assumed to be Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constants Lkfsuperscriptsubscript𝐿𝑘𝑓L_{k}^{f}\non the compact sets 𝒳f⊂𝒳superscript𝒳𝑓𝒳\\mathcal{X}^{f}\\subset\\mathcal{X}, f=1,…,F𝑓1…𝐹f=1,\\ldots,F. Furthermore, consider a continuous unknown\nfunction yF:𝒳→ℝ:superscript𝑦𝐹→𝒳ℝy^{F}:\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} with Lipschitz constant Lysubscript𝐿𝑦L_{y}\nand NFsubscript𝑁𝐹N_{F} observations ynFsuperscriptsubscript𝑦𝑛𝐹y_{n}^{F} satisfying Assumption 3.2.

The Lipschitz constant Lysubscript𝐿𝑦L_{y} is clearly not available in practice. However, a probabilistic bound can be obtained as in Theorem 3.2 in . The remaining terms in these expressions depend only on the training data and\nkernels, which are explicitly known. Using Cauchy-Schwartz and the fact that ∥⋅∥2subscriptdelimited-∥∥⋅2\\lVert\\cdot\\rVert_{2} is subordinate to ∥⋅∥delimited-∥∥⋅\\lVert\\cdot\\rVert, the bound for LμFsubscript𝐿superscript𝜇𝐹L_{\\mu^{F}} can be elaborated further as follows in which ρm​(𝐊f)=∥(𝐊f)−1∥2−1subscript𝜌𝑚superscript𝐊𝑓superscriptsubscriptdelimited-∥∥superscriptsuperscript𝐊𝑓121\\rho_{m}({\\bf K}^{f})=\\lVert({\\bf K}^{f})^{-1}\\rVert_{2}^{-1} is the smallest singular value of 𝐊fsuperscript𝐊𝑓{\\bf K}^{f}. ρm​(𝐊f)>0subscript𝜌𝑚superscript𝐊𝑓0\\rho_{m}({\\bf K}^{f})>0 ∀ffor-all𝑓\\forall f since 𝐊fsuperscript𝐊𝑓{\\bf K}^{f} is psd. The error on any design 𝒳τFsuperscriptsubscript𝒳𝜏𝐹\\mathcal{X}_{\\tau}^{F} is bounded as in Srinivas et al. [ref]31 [Lemma 5.1], introducing a constant β​(τ)𝛽𝜏\\beta(\\tau), which depends on an upper bound τ𝜏\\tau for the fill distance of 𝒳τFsuperscriptsubscript𝒳𝜏𝐹\\mathcal{X}_{\\tau}^{F}, defined as h=sup𝝃∈𝒳min𝝃′∈𝒳τF⁡‖𝝃−𝝃′‖ℎsubscriptsupremum𝝃𝒳subscriptsuperscript𝝃′superscriptsubscript𝒳𝜏𝐹norm𝝃superscript𝝃′h=\\sup\\limits_{\\bm{\\xi}\\in\\mathcal{X}}\\min\\limits_{\\bm{\\xi}^{\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{X}_{\\tau}^{F}}\\|\\bm{\\xi}-\\bm{\\xi}^{\\prime}\\|. hℎh represents the radius of the largest ball in 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} that does not\ncontain any point in the design 𝒳τFsuperscriptsubscript𝒳𝜏𝐹\\mathcal{X}_{\\tau}^{F}. In greedy designs that minimise the GP posterior variance (as in the active learning component), for any\nkernel k𝑘k that induces a RKHS that is norm equivalent to Ws,2​(ℝl)superscript𝑊𝑠2superscriptℝ𝑙W^{s,2}(\\mathbb{R}^{l}) with s>l/2𝑠𝑙2s>l/2, Santin and Haasdonk [ref]37 showed that ∀ϵ>0for-allitalic-ϵ0\\forall\\epsilon>0, ∃Cϵ>0subscript𝐶italic-ϵ0\\exists C_{\\epsilon}>0 such that h≤Cϵ​|𝒳τF|−l/2+ϵℎsubscript𝐶italic-ϵsuperscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝒳𝜏𝐹𝑙2italic-ϵh\\leq C_{\\epsilon}|\\mathcal{X}_{\\tau}^{F}|^{-l/2+\\epsilon}, in which |𝒳τF|superscriptsubscript𝒳𝜏𝐹|\\mathcal{X}_{\\tau}^{F}| is the cardinality of 𝒳τFsuperscriptsubscript𝒳𝜏𝐹\\mathcal{X}_{\\tau}^{F}. \nThe minimum number of grid points satisfying the upper bound on the fill distance is M​(τ,𝒳)𝑀𝜏𝒳M(\\tau,\\mathcal{X}), an upper bound for which is M​(τ,𝒳)≤(1+e/τ)d𝑀𝜏𝒳superscript1𝑒𝜏𝑑M(\\tau,\\mathcal{X})\\leq(1+e/\\tau)^{d}, assuming a hypercubic set\n𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}\nwith edge length e𝑒e. By utilizing Lemma 3.3 and the continuity of yFsuperscript𝑦𝐹y^{F}, the error bound on 𝒳τFsuperscriptsubscript𝒳𝜏𝐹\\mathcal{X}_{\\tau}^{F} can then be extended to the whole of 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}, which leads to Theorem 3.5 below Let the conditions of Lemma 3.3 be satisfied.
