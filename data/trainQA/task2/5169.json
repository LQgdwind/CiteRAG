      "content": "Paper Title: Multiagent Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Routing and Pickup Problem with Adaptation to Variable Demand\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe consider the problem of dynamic multiagent autonomous taxicab routing for rider pickups, a special case of the Dynamic Vehicle Routing (DVR) problem [ref]1. This problem has relevance to several robotics tasks, including coordinated package delivery    [ref]4, warehouse robot path planning , autonomous transportation, and on-demand mobility systems      . We express the demand as riders waiting to be transported, and assume that taxicabs can transport one rider at a time. We are interested in finding a strategic, cooperative pickup plan for a fleet of autonomous taxicabs to minimize the total wait time of all riders where the number and location of future requests are not known a-priori. Obtaining an optimal solution for this problem is intractable since it requires considering multiple scenarios of potential future requests and all relevant taxicab actions at each decision point. This condition results in an extremely large state space and a control space that grows exponentially with the number of agents.\nHence, finding a competitive sub-optimal solution is crucial. Several sub-optimal solutions to the taxicab pickup problem explore instantaneous assignment    , and other routing heuristics, including 2-opt , local search , and genetic algorithms . These methods tend to generate myopic policies due to the lack of consideration for future demand. Sampling-based stochastic optimization methods that consider potential future requests  address this limitation, but at the expense of long computation times due to multistep planning in a large state space. Several learning-based approaches aim to achieve faster computation times. Some authors consider offline trained approximations, such as approximate value iteration, Deep Q-learning 0, Deep Q Networks 1, and transformer-based architectures 2. Offline trained architectures may fail to generalize to unknown scenarios, not fully represented in the training data. This condition makes them infeasible for deployment in real urban environments with fluctuating demand. Other authors consider online policy evaluation with finite lookahead, including Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) 3, DESPOT 4, and a Multiple Scenario Approach (MSA) 5. These methods tend to be computationally expensive if no approximations are used. In this paper we aim to address the lack of generalization of offline trained architectures, and the high policy evaluation time of online methods, by proposing a hybrid planning method with online optimization on top of an offline trained policy approximation. Our method obtains a competitive suboptimal solution to the taxicab routing problem by leveraging (i) online play, a lookahead optimization scheme that improves on the results of offline training 6 7, and (ii) an offline approximation switching scheme that endows the system with adaptivity in the face of significant changes in the underlying demand model. We use an offline trained approximation as the base policy for online play for faster computation times compared to simulation-based rollout algorithms. Our offline approximation is implemented using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)8 that exploit the topological characteristics of a city environment. We achieve adaptivity for the offline approximations by formulating Wasserstein Ambiguity Sets 9 centered around representative historical demand models. These sets represent regions of validity, or probability spaces in which the offline approximations correctly approximate the rollout based Reinforcement Learning (RL) method 6 under a particular demand model. The main contributions of this work are as follows:\n1) We formulate the autonomous taxicab routing problem as a stochastic Dynamic Program (DP)\nin such a way that an offline trained GNN successfully approximates a rollout-based RL method. This then allows us to apply online play as an approximate Newton step 7 to further improve the performance of the learned policy.\n2) Our method adapts to fluctuating demand conditions by\nswitching between offline approximations to maintain the performance improvement of online play. We replace the offline approximation once the current demand is no longer inside the approximation’s region of validity.\n3) We apply our approach on a real taxicab pickup dataset 0 (an example map is shown in Fig. 1).\nWe empirically show that our method outperforms one-at-a-time rollout with a simple base policy, and several classical benchmark algorithms operations research (OR). The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we present our formulation of the multiagent taxicab routing problem. In Sec. III, we present our approach, our application of online play with offline approximation, and our formulation of Wasserstein Ambiguity Sets to quantify regions of validity. Finally, in Sec. IV we present numerical results on the San Francisco taxicab pickup dataset 0.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: We consider the problem of dynamic multiagent autonomous taxicab routing for rider pickups, a special case of the Dynamic Vehicle Routing (DVR) problem [ref]1.
