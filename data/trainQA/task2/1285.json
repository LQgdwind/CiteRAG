      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Reduce Defocus Blur by Realistically Modeling Dual-Pixel Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the ability to generate synthetic DP data, we can shift our attention to training new RCN-based architectures addressing image sequences (e.g., video) captured with DP sensors. This is possible only by using our synthetic DP data, as no current device allows video DP data capture. As we will show, our method can be used for both image sequences and single-image inputs. In the context of image sequences, the amount of defocus blur changes based on the motion of the camera and scene’s objects over time. In the presence of such motion, sample depth variation over a sequence of frames provides useful information for deblurring. Our work is the first to explore the domain of defocus deblurring on image sequences (e.g., video). We adopt a data-driven approach for correcting defocus blur. We leverage a symmetric encoder-decoder CNN-based architecture with skip connections between corresponding feature maps  . Skip connections are widely used in encoder-decoder CNNs and have been found to be effective for image deblurring tasks  1. Our proposed network is also coupled with convLSTM units [ref]44 [ref]47  to better learn temporal dependencies between multiple frames and to allow variable sequence size. With convLSTM units, the same network remains fully convolutional and can successfully deblur a single image or a sequence of images of arbitrary number. Fig. 6 shows a detailed overview of our proposed CNN-convLSTM architecture, which we refer to as recurrent dual-pixel deblurring (RDPD). Our architecture is similar to the one in , but with the following modifications: (1) convLSTM units are added to the network bottleneck, (2) we train the network using the radial distance patch to address the patch-wise training issue, (3) we introduce a multi-scale edge loss function that helps in recovering sharp edges, (4) the number of nodes are reduced to half at each block to make the model lighter, and (5) the last layer is replaced by a linear layer with a   clamping as it is found to be more effective in 1. RDPD architecture. Given an input video of j𝑗j consecutive frames that have defocus blur {{𝐈l​(t),𝐈r​(t)},⋯,{𝐈l​(t+j),𝐈r​(t+j)}}subscript𝐈𝑙𝑡subscript𝐈𝑟𝑡⋯subscript𝐈𝑙𝑡𝑗subscript𝐈𝑟𝑡𝑗\\{\\{\\mathbf{I}_{l}(t),\\mathbf{I}_{r}(t)\\},\\cdots,\\{\\mathbf{I}_{l}(t+j),\\mathbf{I}_{r}(t+j)\\}\\} (such that 𝐈l​(t)subscript𝐈𝑙𝑡\\mathbf{I}_{l}(t) and 𝐈r​(t)subscript𝐈𝑟𝑡\\mathbf{I}_{r}(t) are the DP views of the given frame at time t𝑡t), we first obtain a sequence of compact convolutional features {X​(t),⋯,X​(t+j)}𝑋𝑡⋯𝑋𝑡𝑗\\{X(t),\\cdots,X(t+j)\\} encoded at the CNN bottleneck – namely, X​(t)=CNN-Encoder​(𝐈l​(t),𝐈r​(t))𝑋𝑡CNN-Encodersubscript𝐈𝑙𝑡subscript𝐈𝑟𝑡X(t)=\\textrm{CNN-Encoder}(\\mathbf{I}_{l}(t),\\mathbf{I}_{r}(t)). Then, the features are fed to a convLSTM as shown in Fig. 6. We utilize the convLSTM to learn of the temporal dynamics of the sequential inputs. This is achieved by incorporating memory units with the gated operations. The convLSTM also preserves spatial information by replacing dot products with convolutional operations, which is essential for making spatially variant estimation align with the spatially varying DP PSFs. We choose LSTM over RNN because standard RNNs are known to have difficulty in learning long-time dependencies 7, whereas LSTMs have shown the capability to learn long- and short-time dependencies 8. For the input feature X​(t)𝑋𝑡X(t) at time t𝑡t, our convLSTM leverages three convolution gates – input itsubscript𝑖𝑡i_{t}, output otsubscript𝑜𝑡o_{t}, and forget ℱtsubscriptℱ𝑡\\mathcal{F}_{t} – in order to control the signal flow within the cell. The convLSTM outputs a hidden state ℋtsubscriptℋ𝑡\\mathcal{H}_{t} and maintains a memory cell 𝒞tsubscript𝒞𝑡\\mathcal{C}_{t} for controlling the state update and output: where the W𝑊W terms denote the different weight matrices, and the b𝑏b terms represent the different bias vectors. ΣΣ\\Sigma and τ𝜏\\tau are the activation functions of logistic sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent, respectively. Afterwords, the output deblurred image 𝐈dsubscript𝐈𝑑\\mathbf{I}_{d} is obtained by decoding otsubscript𝑜𝑡o_{t} through the decoder part of our encoder-decoder CNN as follows: Radial distance patch. Radial distortion and lens aberration make the PSFs vary in radial directions away from the image center. Similar to  , we perform patch-wise training to avoid the redundancies of full image training and ensure that the input has enough variance. However, this approach breaks the spatial correlation between the image patches as they are fed independently with no knowledge of their location on the image plane. As a result, in addition to the six-channel RGB DP views, we include a single-channel patch that represents the relative radial distance. Multi-scale edge loss. In addition to the MSE loss, we introduce a multi-scale edge loss using a Sobel gradient to guide the network to encourage sharper edges. Our new loss is similar in principle to the single-scale (i.e., 3×3333\\times 3) Sobel loss used in , but we modified this loss in two ways: first, we added multiple scales of the Sobel operator (i.e., kernel sizes) in order to capture different edge sizes. Second, we minimized for the horizontal and vertical directions separately, to concentrate more on the direction that is perpendicular to the imaging sensor orientation. For our multi-scale modified edge loss, the vertical Gxsuperscript𝐺𝑥G^{x} and horizontal Gysuperscript𝐺𝑦G^{y} derivative approximations of the deblurred output IdsubscriptI𝑑\\mathrm{I}_{d} and its ground truth IssubscriptI𝑠\\mathrm{I}_{s} are: where Sm×mxsubscriptsuperscript𝑆𝑥𝑚𝑚S^{x}_{m\\times m} and Sm×mysubscriptsuperscript𝑆𝑦𝑚𝑚S^{y}_{m\\times m} are the vertical and horizontal Sobel operators of size m𝑚m, respectively. The derivative operations are performed at multiple filter sizes. Our new edge loss ℒedgesubscriptℒedge\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{edge}} is the mean of multiple scales for each direction x/y𝑥𝑦x/y and denoted as:\n Then the final loss function ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} is: such that ℒMSEsubscriptℒMSE\\mathcal{L}_{\\textrm{MSE}} is the typical MSE loss between the output estimated IdsubscriptI𝑑\\mathrm{I}_{d} and its ground truth IssubscriptI𝑠\\mathrm{I}_{s}. The λ𝜆\\lambda terms are added to control our final loss.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: feature maps  .
