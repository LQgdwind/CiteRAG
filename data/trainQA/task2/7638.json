      "content": "Paper Title: Algorithmic progress in language models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe want to estimate the rate at which newer language models are able to achieve a certain level of performance more efficiently than older models. We do this by fitting a model that meets two key desiderata: (1) the model must be broadly consistent with previous work on neural scaling laws (e.g. [ref]20), and (2) the model should allow for a decomposition of the main contributors to increased performance, such as improvements in how efficiently data or free parameters in the model are used. In this sense, our core approach is similar to that in [ref]12. The starting point is the scaling law from [ref]20, which relates the training loss L𝐿L of a dense transformer to its number of parameters N𝑁N and the training dataset size D𝐷D: where L𝐿L is per-token cross entropy loss on the dataset, and E𝐸E, A𝐴A, B𝐵B, α𝛼\\alpha and β𝛽\\beta are constants. E𝐸E represents the ‘irreducible loss’ of the dataset, while the second and third terms, ANα𝐴superscript𝑁𝛼\\frac{A}{N^{\\alpha}} and BDβ𝐵superscript𝐷𝛽\\frac{B}{D^{\\beta}}, capture the errors that are due to the finiteness of the model or dataset, respectively. Following [ref]12 and [ref]19, we quantify algorithmic progress in terms of reductions of the resources (N𝑁N and D𝐷D) required to achieve the same level of performance over time. To measure this, we introduce the concepts of “effective data\" Deffsubscript𝐷effD_{\\text{eff}} and “effective model size\" Neffsubscript𝑁effN_{\\text{eff}} into the model:111This is not an original idea—for example, [ref]19 and [ref]12 use the concept of “effective compute” to calculate doubling times for compute efficiency in computer vision, and  incorporates a similar idea into an integrated economic model. where Y𝑌Y is the current year, Y0subscript𝑌0Y_{0} is some reference year222Note that the “years\" in our model do not need to be integers, i.e. “fractions of a year\" are allowed and are determined based on the specific publication date of a model., and α′superscript𝛼′\\alpha^{\\prime} and β′superscript𝛽′\\beta^{\\prime} characterize the rate of algorithmic progress for model size and dataset size, respectively.\n\nIn other words, we assume that continued algorithmic progress results in an exponential increase in Deffsubscript𝐷effD_{\\text{eff}} and Neffsubscript𝑁effN_{\\text{eff}} over some time interval Y−Y0𝑌subscript𝑌0Y-Y_{0}, even with fixed D𝐷D and N𝑁N.\nPlugging these into the original scaling law gives: where A𝐴A, B𝐵B, αparamsubscript𝛼param\\alpha_{\\text{param}}, αyearsubscript𝛼year\\alpha_{\\text{year}}, βdatasubscript𝛽data\\beta_{\\text{data}} and βyearsubscript𝛽year\\beta_{\\text{year}} are constants. In relation to equation 2, we have that α′=αyear/αparamsuperscript𝛼′subscript𝛼yearsubscript𝛼param\\alpha^{\\prime}=\\alpha_{\\text{year}}/\\alpha_{\\text{param}} and β′=βyear/βdatasuperscript𝛽′subscript𝛽yearsubscript𝛽data\\beta^{\\prime}=\\beta_{\\text{year}}/\\beta_{\\text{data}}. Algorithmic progress is thus captured as a constant exponential trend that multiplies with each of the two terms in the scaling law. In doing so, we are able to estimate the rate at which fewer ‘resources’ (N𝑁N and D𝐷D) are required to achieve the same level of performance over time. Furthermore, given that that the physical compute is approximately given by C≈6​N​D𝐶6𝑁𝐷C\\approx 6ND [ref]20 , we can similarly define an “effective compute\" which is determined from the effective parameters and effective data.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: performance more efficiently than older models.
