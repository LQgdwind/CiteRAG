      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Knowledge Distillation from Model Checkpoints\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe ‚ÄúIntermediate Teacher vs. Full Teacher‚Äù experiment is conducted on the CIFAR-100  and ImageNet [ref]38 datasets. The CIFAR-100 contains 50,000 training images with 500 images per class and 10,000 test images with 100 images per class, and comprises 32 √ó\\times 32 pixel RGB images with 100 classes. The ImageNet dateset contains 1.2 million images for training and 50,000 for validation from 1,000 classes. On CIFAR-100, we use a standard data augmentation scheme , in which the images are zero-padded with 4 pixels on each side, randomly cropped to produce 32 √ó\\times 32 images, and horizontally mirrored with probability 0.5. WRN-40-2 [ref]39 and ResNet-110  are adopted as teacher models, while WRN-40-1 [ref]39, ResNet-32 , and MobileNetV2 [ref]41 are adopted as student models. In this paper, we use MobileNetV2 with its width multiplier set to 0.75. We train each teacher model for 200 epochs with batch size 128, cosine learning rate schedule  gradually decaying from 0.1 to 0, weight decay 5e-4, and SGD optimizer with momentum 0.9. We save the intermediate models at the 20t‚Äãhsuperscript20ùë°‚Ñé20^{th}, 40t‚Äãhsuperscript40ùë°‚Ñé40^{th}, ‚Ä¶, 180t‚Äãhsuperscript180ùë°‚Ñé180^{th} epoch as ‚ÄúIntermediate Teachers‚Äù, and the final models at the 200t‚Äãhsuperscript200ùë°‚Ñé200^{th} epoch as ‚ÄúFull Teachers‚Äù. On ImageNet, we adopt MobileNetV2 [ref]41, ResNet-18  as student models and ResNet-50 , ResNet-34  as teacher models. We follow the standard PyTorch practice but train teacher models for 120 epochs. The 120t‚Äãhsuperscript120ùë°‚Ñé120^{th} checkpoints are taken as the full teachers while the 60t‚Äãhsuperscript60ùë°‚Ñé60^{th} checkpoints are adopted as the intermediate teachers. We distill the student models by the same way as  except for the hyperparameters. To perfectly show the performance of each network, we search for the optimal hyperparameters (i.e., the loss ratio Œ±ùõº\\alpha and the temperature œÑùúè\\tau) to each teacher-student pair as shown in Table 4. Generally, intermediate models at the later training stages tend to choose a larger œÑùúè\\tau and a smaller Œ±ùõº\\alpha. The ‚ÄúSnapshot Ensemble vs. Full Ensemble‚Äù experiment is conducted on CIFAR-100  and Tiny-ImageNet . Tiny-ImageNet consists of a subset of ImageNet dataset. There are 100,000 images for training and 10,000 images for validation from 200 classes. All images are 64 √ó\\times 64 colored ones. Some different settings on Tiny-ImageNet include: 1) we train models for 150 epochs on Tiny-ImageNet while 200 epochs on CIFAR datasets; 2) we add a stride of 2 to the first layer of the CIFAR models, in order to downsample the images to the same 32√ó32323232\\times 32 resolution, following . For fair comparison, we also use grid search to find the best value of hyperparameters œÑùúè\\tau and Œ±ùõº\\alpha, as shown in Table¬†5.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: The ‚ÄúIntermediate Teacher vs. Full Teacher‚Äù experiment is conducted on the CIFAR-100  and ImageNet [ref]38 datasets.
