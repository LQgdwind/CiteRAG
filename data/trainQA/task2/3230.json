      "content": "Paper Title: Class-aware Sounding Objects Localization via Audiovisual Correspondence\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSounding object localization in the visual scene refers to associating the sound signal with the specific visual location. This task takes full advantage of the audiovisual consistency and enables the machine model to learn human-like audiovisual perception. Before the booming of deep learning, some methods for sound source localization were born. These methods relied on spatial sparsity prior of audio-visual events  or hand-crafted motion cues . The semantic information of the object is known in these methods. In addition, there are some acoustic hardware-based approaches   with the aid of devices, e.g., microphone arrays, to grad phase the difference of sound arrival. Conversely, our proposed method neither requires semantic information of objects nor other devices, overcoming the limitations of the above methods. Recent methods for visual sound localization majorly focus on correlating audio and visual information   [ref]7 [ref]35 [ref]11    . Arandjelović et al.  and Owens et al.  adopted CAM  or similar methods to calculate the correspondence score between global audio feature and spatial visual features to figure out sounding areas. Senocak et al. [ref]7 developed a cross-modal attention mechanism to capture the primary visual areas in a semi-supervised or unsupervised manner. The cross-modal attention mechanism can reflect the localization information of the sound source for interaction between the audio and visual modalities. Tian et al. [ref]35 proposed audio-driven visual attention as well as temporal alignment to figure out the semantically correlated visual regions. These methods mostly perform well in simple scenes with single sound source, but are comparatively poor to localize multiple objects with mixed sounds. To address this challenge, Zhao et al.   developed a self-supervised mix-then-separate sound-separation framework to build the channel-wise association between audio and visual feature maps, where the sounding object is determined through the sound energy of each pixel.\nHu et al. [ref]11 leveraged clustering to represent different audiovisual components to correlate each sound center with its visual source, but it requires the number of sound sources as prior. Qian et al.  developed a two-stage learning framework that disentangles visual and audio representation of different categories, then performs cross-modal feature alignment. However, this work still requires extra scene prior due to the lack of one-to-one annotations. Oya et al.  proposed a step-wise training strategy that first gets potential sounding objects based on visual information and then identifies the proposal based on audio information. Nevertheless, the experimental scenario in the work is relatively simple (two objects, one of which makes a sound). Tian et al.  performed sound separation with the help of visual object proposal but required a pre-trained object detector. Chen et al.  considered the background regions of the localization results and offered a more fine-grained localization framework. Unlike the above methods, our method uses only the correspondence between audio and vision as the supervision and can deal with complex cocktail-party scenarios. We utilize the established category-representation object dictionary to produce class-aware object localization maps, which filter out the silent objects. Moreover, our method can be applied to the typical vision task of object detection.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: information of objects nor other devices, overcoming the limitations of the above methods.
