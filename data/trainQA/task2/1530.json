      "content": "Paper Title: A Review of Speaker Diarization: Recent Advances with Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis section describes the evaluation series and the commonly used datasets for speaker diarization evaluations. The summary of the most commonly used datasets that include English is shown in Table 5.\n\n † Most of the contents are English while there are few non-English contents.\n NIST SRE 2000 (Disk-8), often referred to as the CALLHOME dataset, is the most widely used dataset for speaker diarization in\nrecent papers. This dataset contains 500 sessions of multilingual telephonic speech. Each session has two to seven speakers with two dominant speakers in each conversation. AMI Corpus\nThe AMI database  includes 100 h of meeting recordings from multiple sites in 171 meeting sessions. The AMI database provides an audio source recorded using lapel microphones that are separately recorded and amplified for each speaker. Another audio source is recorded using omnidirectional microphone arrays mounted on the table while meeting. The AMI database is a suitable dataset for the evaluation of speaker diarization systems integrated with the ASR module since AMI provides forced alignment data that contains word and phoneme level timings along with the transcript and speaker label. Each meeting session has three to five speakers.\n\n•\n\nICSI Meeting Corpus\nThe ICSI meeting corpus  contains 75 meeting corpus with four meeting types. The ICSI meeting corpus provides word level timing along with the transcript and speaker label. The audio source is recorded using close-talking individual microphone and six tabletop microphones to provide speaker-specific channel and multichannel recording. Each meeting has 3 to 10 participants.\n CHiME-5/6 challenge and its dataset\nThe CHiME-5 challenge [ref]202 and CHiME-6 challenge  were designed as\nseries of ASR competitions for the daily conversation of multiple speakers.\nThe dataset was provided at the CHiME-5 challenge,\nand it contains 50 h of multiparty real conversations in the everyday home environment.\nIt contains speaker labels, segmentation, and corresponding transcriptions.\nThe audio source is recorded using six four-channel microphone arrays located in the kitchen and dining/living rooms in a house and also binaural microphones worn by participants.\nThe number of participants is fixed at four.\nWhile the oracle diarization results were allowed to be used for the ASR task in the CHiME-5 challenge,\nCHiME-6 challenge track 2 requires the result of both ASR and diarization.\nThe primary evaluation metric for such a track was cpWER, which counts both the speaker-attributed\nerrors and word recognition errors in the WER calculation.\nDER and JER were also evaluated as secondary metrics without “score collar” and with overlapped regions.\nThe CHiME-5/6 corpus was also used as one track in the DIHARD 2 challenge. VoxSRC Challenge and VoxConverse corpus\nThe VoxCeleb Speaker Recognition Challenge (VoxSRC) is the recent evaluation series for speaker recognition systems [ref]203 [ref]95.\nThe goal of VoxSRC is to test how well the current technology can cope with the speech “in the wild”.\nThis evaluation series initially started with a pure speaker verification task [ref]203,\nand the diarization task was added as track 4 at the latest evaluation at the VoxCeleb Speaker Recognition Challenge 2020 (VoxSRC-20) [ref]95.\nThe VoxConverse dataset  was used for the speaker diarization task with DER as the primary metric, and JER as the secondary metric.\nThe VoxConverse dataset contains 74 h of human conversation extracted from YouTube videos.\nThe dataset is divided into development set (20.3 h, 216 recordings),\nand test set (53.5 h, 310 recordings).\nThe number of speakers in each recording\nhas a wide range of variety from\n1 speaker to 21 speakers.\nThe audio includes\nvarious types of noises such as background music, laughter, etc.\nIt also contains a significant portion of overlapping speech\nfrom 0% to 30.1% depending on the recording.\nWhile the dataset contains the visual information as well as audio,\nas of June 2021,\nonly the audio of the development set was released under\na Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License\nfor research purposes.\nThe audio of the evaluation set was used\nas a blind test set.\n LibriCSS\nThe LibriCSS corpus  contains\n10 h of multichannel recordings and was designed for the research of speech separation, speech recognition,\nand speaker diarization.\nIt was created by playing the audio in the LibriSpeech corpus  in\na real meeting room, and recorded using\na 7-channel microphone array.\nIt\nconsists of 10 sessions,\neach of which is further decomposed to\nsix 10-min mini-sessions.\nEach mini-session was made by audio of eight speakers\nand designed to have\ndifferent overlap ratios from 0% to 40%.\nTo facilitate the research, the baseline system for speech separation and\nASR  and the baseline system that integrates speech separation, speaker diarization\nand ASR  have been developed and released.\n DIHARD Challenge and its dataset\nDIHARD evaluation   focuses on the performance gap of state-of-the-art diarization systems on challenging domains. The first DIHARD challenge, DIHARD 1, started with track 1 (oracle SAD) and\ntrack 2 (system SAD). The evaluation data was a collection of various corpus.\nIt includes very challenging datasets such as clinical interviews, web videos, and speech in the wild (e.g., recordings in restaurants), as well as relatively less challenging datasets, such as CTS and audio books to diversify the domains.\nDIHARD 2 additionally included multichannel speaker diarization task in track 3 (oracle SAD) and track 4 (system SAD) using the recordings from the CHiME-5 corpus [ref]202.\nIn the latest DIHARD challenge, DIHARD 3,\nthe CTS dataset was added, whereas multichannel tracks 3 and 4 were excluded.\nThe DIHARD challenge employs DER and JER for the evaluation metric without “score collar” and with overlap region. Rich Transcription Evaluation Series\nThe RT Evaluation  is the pioneering evaluation series of initiating deeper investigation on speaker diarization in relation to ASR. The main purpose of this effort was to create ASR technologies that would produce transcriptions with descriptive metadata, like who said when, where speaker diarization plays in. Thus, the main tasks in the evaluation were ASR and speaker diarization. The domains of the data of interest were broadcast news, CTS and meeting recordings with multiple participants. Throughout the period of 2002-2009, the RT evaluation series promoted and gauged advances in speaker diarization and ASR technology.\nThe evaluations among this period are named as RT evaluations (RT-02, RT-03S, RT-03F, and RT-05F) and RT Meeting Recognition (RT-06S, RT-07S and RT-09). These evaluations and their datasets include speaker diarization evaluation as a part of automatic metadata extraction (MDE). Other datasets There are also several corpora that have been used for the diarization research but not covered in the list above.\nThe Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese  contains about 12 h of two-speaker dialogue recorded using headset microphones. AISHELL-4  is a relatively new Mandarin Chinese dataset containing 118 h of four to eight speakers in a conference scenario. It is recorded by 8-ch circular microphone array as well as headset microphones for each participant. The ESTER-1  and ESTER-2  evaluation campaign datasets are a set of French recordings designed for three task category: Segmentation (S), Transcription (T) and Information Extraction (E). In the ESTER-1 and ESTER-2 evaluation campaign, speaker diarization was evaluated as one of the core tasks among other tasks including speaker tracking, sound event tracking, and transcriptions. The datasets for ESTER-1 and ESTER-2 include 100 h and 150 h of manually transcribed French radio broadcast news, respectively.\nETAPE  is also a French speech processing evaluation dataset that contains 36 h of TV and radio shows with both prepared and spontaneous speech. Unlike the ESTER evaluation series, ETAPE targets cross-show speaker diarization.\n\nReference markers found: [202]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]202: and six tabletop microphones to provide speaker-specific channel and multichannel recording. Each meeting has 3 to 10 participants.\n CHiME-5/6 challenge and its dataset\nThe CHiME-5 challenge [ref]202 and CHiME-6 challenge  were designed as\nseries of ASR competitions for the daily conversation of multiple speakers.\nThe dataset was provided at the CHiME-5 challenge,\nand it contains 50 h of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
