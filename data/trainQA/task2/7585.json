      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Codebook Design for Network Beam Management\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems have played a critical role in supporting high-speed wireless communications . Between spatial multiplexing and beamforming, array-based systems have supported new verticals and applications since 3GPP Release 777 .\nBeam management is an important component of expanding MIMO to massive MIMO and extreme MIMO (X-MIMO) .\nBeam management employs codebook-based strategies for beam training with hybrid arrays   and configurable feedback   to support large-scale arrays. While beam management enables improved flexibility and higher dimensional MIMO arrays, the performance is dependent on the beam codebooks employed throughout the process. Yet optimizing codebooks for beam management is challenging because each codebook is dependent on the other system processes. As a result of this lack of optimization, massive MIMO, and even multi-user MIMO deployments are still limited in 5G [ref]7. Beam management, from a system level, is a series of operations enabling initial access, beam refinement, and feedback that ultimately lead to data transmission [ref]7 . Beam tracking and other beam search reduction techniques can also be understood within the overarching beam management framework. The primary operations can be referenced by the codebooks and 3GPP signals transmitted during the respective stages. First, user equipment (UE) joins and synchronizes with the network using a pre-defined synchronization signal block (SSB) sequence that is beamformed using a beamforming codeword from a codebook stylized as the SSB codebook [ref]8. Broadly speaking, this beamforming is intended to ensure all users can accurately synchronize, requires a small amount of time-frequency resources, and trades off beamforming gain for broad coverage. In contrast, beam refinement requires a large amount of resources to enable channel estimation on top of a fine-grained beam search using another beamforming codebook. Channel state information reference signals (CSI-RS) are transmitted using a subset of the CSI-RS codebook based on the user-reported SSB feedback. The beamformed channel represents a compressed channel and allows for reduced-rank feedback and increased coherence time . Finally, a third codebook (referred to as the feedback codebook) is used to quantize the beamformed channel estimates to reduce the overhead of feedback signaling with large arrays. The feedback codebook is configurable and standardized in 5G, with the most relevant format for MU-MIMO (type-II) defined as an oversampled DFT codebook 0. Using the combination of coarse and refined beam training as well as quantized feedback, a serving cell can design a set of precoders to serve the UEs for data transmission. Although beam management has been standardized since 3GPP Release 151515 , new research for optimizing beam management to improve the performance in 6G is underway 1.\nAt the forefront of this innovation are extensions and improvements for beam management including support for 128 ports 2. Yet, configuring, optimizing, and updating codebooks is challenging because mathematically capturing the codebook interrelationships in addition to user distributions and realistic channel models is often intractable or imprecise. As a result, 3GPP has identified beam management and CSI as potential areas to integrate artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) 1. These data-driven techniques present new possibilities for designing site-specific algorithms without explicitly modeling distributions within the data 3 4 5. Within the scope of AI/ML for beam management, we identify three directions of work relevant to our investigation–codebook design, beam training, and interference mitigation. Prior work on codebook design:\nAI/ML is used in the design or implementation of beamforming codebooks 6 7 [ref]8 or CSI feedback codebooks 8 9 0 1. Although beamforming and feedback codebooks are used for different roles, the systems and techniques for applying AI/ML to these problems are very similar. For beamforming codebooks, hierarchical codebooks have been a primary focus and adopted for 5G since early proposals 2 3 4. Prior work has considered supervised learning 7 [ref]8 5 and reinforcement learning 6 styles of learning initial access codebooks. That work (7 [ref]8 5 6) does not consider how the new beamforming codebooks impact beamformed channel feedback nor the achievable rate in MU-MIMO data transmission. Ignoring the system-level impact of codebook design is a reoccurring result in prior work on beam management where a subset of the process–either beam training or codebook design–is modified but the overarching metrics are not considered. Codebook design using AI/ML has also been explored for feedback quantization and reconstruction 6 7 0 8 9 8. Deep learning autoencoder models have been used to replace feedback codebooks 6 7 or as a denoising process to improve the received feedback 0 8 9 8. Feedback autoencoders require the encoder and decoder of the model to be trained together and then shared throughout the network. While sharing a neural network may be reasonable for higher-level tasks, the size of the models and difficulty with standardizing these models make them ill-suited for practical deployments. Denoising algorithms that operate in a one-sided fashion 0 8 9 are advantageous as they can be employed at the BS and improve the uplink feedback, which typically operates at a low SNR due to uplink power constraints 9. The challenge with denoising algorithms is they tend to be site-specific, not generalize well, and are not applicable for dynamic beamformed channels as seen by hybrid arrays [ref]7. Some work on generalization or meta-learning has been proposed 8 though it still ignores the prior beam management steps that impact the effective channel and CSI distribution. Prior work on beam training:\nThe second direction of focus on AI/ML in beam management is beam training, which is the process of determining the beam-codewords to use from the standard beamforming codebooks. Beam training has received significant attention toward the goal of maximizing the wireless link power with limited overhead 0 1 2 2 3 4. Data-driven techniques have been used to integrate localization and sensing information 2, capture site-specific characteristics 5, or improve mobility robustness 3 5 4. Additional work on a generalized beam selection algorithm was proposed in 6. These investigations are focused on mmWave bands where the environment is sparse. While sparse environments can challenge beam training, the sparsity also results in the beam search primarily focused on finding a rank-111 beamformer aligned with a single path. Lower bands such as sub-6GHz or upper-mid bands  exhibit richer scattering that makes the beam training process depend on coherent combining over multiple paths and limiting interference instead of simply finding a main beamforming direction. Instead, these works 0 1 2 2 3 4 are primarily targeting analog beamforming and do not consider MIMO formats. This is a significant limitation in mobile broadband, which has supported SU-MIMO and digital systems since 3GPP release 777 . Prior work on codebook-based interference mitigation:\nInterference-aware beam management is a combination of codebook design and beam training with additional consideration for how overlapping beams cause interference in adjacent sectors and cells. In one line of work, a conventional beam management interference cancellation algorithm was converted to a deep learning approximate to reduce complexity 7. A direct AI/ML algorithm for interference-aware codebooks was also recently proposed 8. These algorithms (7 8), though, are trained on data from mmWave bands and therefore benefit from the sparse channel nature while also only considering simplified SU-MISO systems. There is a lack of research investigating data-driven codebook algorithms that operate in rich scattering environments and in MU-MIMO settings. Prior work on beamspace codebook design: Our prior work introduced the concepts of beamspace codebook learning and hierarchical codebook learning for X-MIMO arrays [ref]7 9. We proposed a learning algorithm that produced highly effective beam training codebooks but only provided a modest improvement in the overall spectral efficiency. In our present work, we extend the end-to-end training to encapsulate the achievable spectral efficiency, thereby producing codebooks that support full rank MIMO connections, while also mitigating inter-cell interference. Contributions of this paper: We describe a complete beam management process for a multi-cell, hybrid, X-MIMO system. The beam process includes inter- and intra-cell interference during beam training and data transmission to characterize the impact of interference with dynamic codebooks. By capturing and modeling each stage from initial access through network spectral efficiency, we can obtain insights into the net effects of advanced codebook algorithms in realistic settings. We propose an end-to-end learning strategy and neural processing architecture “Network Beamspace Learning” (NBL) to design SSB and CSI-RS codebooks for multiple base stations serving overlapping regions. The strategy is based on representing beamformers in the beamspace and backpropagating gradients through the entire beam management model from initial access through achievable rate calculation. The end-to-end training strategy ensures that codebooks are learned to maximize the beamformed channel and mitigate interference that would reduce spectral efficiency. The NBL formulation only requires sharing the SSB feedback, yet significantly improves the overall system performance. We evaluate the capabilities of the beam management framework with X-MIMO using traditional and NBL codebooks across a range of possible deployments. In particular, we evaluate using different array geometries and codebook sizes in raytraced environments. Ultimately, we find that MU-MIMO systems are susceptible to interference with extremely large arrays, but learned codebooks can mitigate the interference and achieve significantly higher cell spectral efficiency.

Then, we describe a typical feedback and data transmission strategy that we use for evaluating the system-level performance of the proposed codebook algorithm in Sectoin III. In Section IV we describe NBL which includes beamspace preprocessing, a multi-stage neural network, and achievable-rate maximizing end-to-end learning. In the final sections, we present the simulation setup and a rigorous evaluation of the various codebooks, overall performance, and out-of-distribution (OOD) performance achieved by our proposed method.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: is challenging because each codebook is dependent on the other system processes.
