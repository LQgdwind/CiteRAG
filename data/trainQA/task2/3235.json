      "content": "Paper Title: Adversarial Deep Reinforcement Learning for Improving the Robustness of Multi-agent Autonomous Driving Policies\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent work  proposes to use RL-based driving agents to test connected cars by perturbing both the inputs and outputs of a car during training. However, this approach targets mixed-traffic driving with a single AC and multiple human-driven cars, thus it does not consider complex scenarios having more than one non-communicating AC agent.\nAnother work [ref]24 performs adversarial RL for testing a multi-agent driving environment by training more than one adversarial RL agent against one rule-based driving model. While the results look promising, the approach only covers the cases where the trained adversarial cars are exposed to a single non-AI model. As another limitation, the approach has not been evaluated on more complex adversarial driving scenarios, such as T-intersection, which we target in our work. Another work [ref]22 uses RL to stress-test ACs in a simulated environment. The extension of this work [ref]25 proposes the idea of reward augmentation for increasing the search space and also finding failure cases in driving policies. Compared to our work, they lack multi-agent test cases even on a small scale. Besides, the work is tested neither in a vision-based simulator nor in real-world driving conditions. Furthermore, while the work improves driving conditions for experiments, it uses adversarial perturbations as noise in the simulation model itself. In contrast, our work adds perturbations by the adversarial car’s policy, thus adding adversarial actions as example trajectories for improving AC’s driving policies. Authors in  proposes a Bayesian optimization-based method for testing ACs. Their method involves creating adversarial scenarios in a Carla-based urban driving simulation  to expose the weaknesses of autonomous driving policy. Another work  also uses an optimization technique for producing physical attacks on driving lanes, in order to attack vision-based driving models. Compared to our work, these works are lacking multi-agent AC scenarios. Authors in  use a GAN model to generate adversarial objects able to attack LiDAR-based driving systems. Another work  uses GAN to apply metamorphic testing to CNN-based driving models. Authors in  propose a stress testing methodology for LiDAR based perception. Using a real-world driving dataset, they use various weather conditions to test the performance of autonomous driving systems. However, neither of these approaches has been tested in an RL-based multi-agent AC environment.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: this approach targets mixed-traffic driving with a single AC and multiple human-driven cars, thus it does not consider complex scenarios having more than one non-communicating AC agent.\nAnother work [ref]24 performs adversarial RL for testing a multi-agent driving environment by training more than one adversarial RL agent against one rule-based driving model.
