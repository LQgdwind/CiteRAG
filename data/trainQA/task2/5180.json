      "content": "Paper Title: A Critical Analysis of Classifier Selection in Learned Bloom Filters\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStarting from an initial list of classifiers—without presuming to be exhaustive—we performed a set of preliminary experiments, from which we received indications about the classifiers’ families to be further analyzed, based on their trade-off between performance and space requirements111The experiments and data about this preliminary part are available upon request.. Namely, from the initial list we have removed the following classifiers: Logistic Regression , Naive Bayes  and Recurrent Neural Networks , due to their poor trade-off performance, confirming the results of a preliminary study . The remaining ones are briefly described in the following paragraphs. Since our evaluation considers both balanced and unbalanced classification problems, we also detail how their inference is managed in an unbalanced context.\nThe hyperparameters of the corresponding learning algorithms are distinguished between regular and key hyperparameters, the latter affecting the space occupancy of the classifier. The model selection phase only involves non-key hyperparameters, while different configurations for key hyperparameters are analysed in dedicated experiments aiming at studying the interplay among FPR, space occupancy and reject time of Learned Bloom Filters.\nHereafter, when not differently specified, the space occupancy serves as a proxy for the complexity of a classifier.\n In order to fix notation, we assume U=ℝq𝑈superscriptℝ𝑞U=\\mathbb{R}^{q} as universe, and we refer to D⊂U𝐷𝑈D\\subset U as a set of d𝑑d labeled instances, denoting by 𝒙∈D𝒙𝐷\\boldsymbol{x}\\in D a training instance and by yx∈{0,1}subscript𝑦𝑥01y_{x}\\in\\{0,1\\} its label (with a slightly different notation for SVMs, as explained here below). Classification in Linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for a given instance 𝒙𝒙\\boldsymbol{x} is usually based on the optimal hyperplane (𝐰,b𝐰𝑏\\mathbf{w},b) and the sign of f​(𝒙)=𝐰⋅𝒙+b𝑓𝒙⋅𝐰𝒙𝑏f(\\boldsymbol{x})=\\mathbf{w}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{x}+b. To fall in the setting defined for a LBF, we need to transform the SVM prediction into a score in   . To this end, we use f​(𝒙)𝑓𝒙f(\\boldsymbol{x}) as argument to a sigmoid function.\nThe optimal hyperplane (𝐰,b𝐰𝑏\\mathbf{w},b) is learned via maximization of the margin between the two classes, by solving where misclassification is allowed by the slack variables ξxsubscript𝜉𝑥\\xi_{x} and penalized using the hyperparameter c>0𝑐0c>0 (note that in this case yx∈{−1,1}subscript𝑦𝑥11y_{x}\\in\\{-1,1\\}). Nonlinear SVMs might have been used here, but the need of storing the kernel matrix, e.g., a Gaussian kernel, alongside the hyperplane parameters results in an unacceptable size for the learned filters. For the linear case we have chosen, we have only one non-key hyperparameter, namely c𝑐c. When dealing with unbalanced labels, we consider the cost-senstive SVM version described in . We also consider Feed-Forward neural networks   accepting instances as inputs and equipped with l𝑙l hidden layers, respectively having h1,…,hlsubscriptℎ1…subscriptℎ𝑙h_{1},\\ldots,h_{l} hidden units\n(NN-h1,…,hlsubscriptℎ1…subscriptℎ𝑙h_{1},\\dots,h_{l} for short).\nOne output unit completes the network topology.\nAs usual, training involves the estimation of unit connections and biases from data. In this case, the hisubscriptℎ𝑖h_{i}s are key hyperparameters, while the learning rate l​r𝑙𝑟lr acts as a regular hyperparameter to be tuned. It is worth noting that we fix the activation functions for all network units (although the former are tunable in principle), to limit the size of the already massive set of experiments. Precisely, as typically done, we use ReLU and Sigmoid activations for hidden and output units, respectively.\nWhere appropriate, label imbalance is dealt using a cost-sensitive model variant . Finally, we consider also Random Forests , shortened as RF-t𝑡t to make explicit that this model is an ensemble of t𝑡t classification trees . Each such tree is trained on a different bootstrap subset of D𝐷D randomly extracted with replacement. Analogously, the splitting functions at the tree nodes are chosen from a random subset of the available attributes. The RF aggregates classifications uniformly across trees, computing for each instance the fraction of trees that output a positive classification. To address the case where labels are unbalanced, we adopt an imbalance-aware variant of RFs  [ref]26\nin which, during the growth of each tree, the bootstrap sample is not drawn uniformly over D𝐷D, but by selecting an instance 𝒙𝒙\\boldsymbol{x} with probability where D+={𝒙∈D|yx=1}subscript𝐷conditional-set𝒙𝐷subscript𝑦𝑥1D_{+}=\\{\\boldsymbol{x}\\in D|y_{x}=1\\}, and D−=D∖D+subscript𝐷𝐷subscript𝐷D_{-}=D\\setminus D_{+}. In this way, the probabilities of extracting a positive or a negative example are both 1/2121/2, and the trees are trained on balanced subsets. The key hyperparameter of a RF is t𝑡t, directly impacting on the classifier size. The non-key hyperparameter which we consider here is the minimum number δ𝛿\\delta of samples in a leaf, which allows to control the depth of the individual trees. It is worth observing that this hyperparameter can also slightly affect the tree size, but in our setting the adopted grid of values only yields a negligible difference in size (see Section 4.3).\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: across trees, computing for each instance the fraction of trees that output a positive classification.
