Their statement is analogous, with the class of quantum examples |ψfA⟩ketsubscript𝜓subscript𝑓𝐴\\ket{\\psi_{f_{A}}} replacing that of unitaries VfAsubscript𝑉subscript𝑓𝐴V_{f_{A}}.\nThe only things we need to prove are the following and then the result follows from (, Theorem 16).\nThe first line follows by checking that Where the lower bound is proven in .\nAs for the variance, we notice the following where the observable M′superscript𝑀′M^{\\prime} is the one obtained following the procedure of Lemma 2.1 and the upper bound follows again from .\n∎ We also provide a double exponential lower bound for testing properties of channels, which also comes as a direct consequence of a lower bound for testing purity of states given in . First, recall that the unitarity   of a quantum channel is defined as Let 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} be an algorithm that\nestimates with high probability the unitarity of a quantum channel 𝒩𝒩\\mathcal{N} with error smaller than 0.240.240.24 using 𝖰𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗍𝒩subscript𝖰𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗍𝒩\\mathsf{Qstat}_{\\mathcal{N}} queries with tolerance at least τ𝜏\\tau. Then 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} must make at least 2Ω​(τ2​2n)superscript2Ωsuperscript𝜏2superscript2𝑛2^{\\Omega(\\tau^{2}2^{n})} such queries. Assume the existence of an algorithm 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} contradicting the statement of the theorem.\nWe will prove the theorem by contradiction, by first showing that the unitarity is closely related to the purity of the Choi state 𝒥​(𝒩)𝒥𝒩\\mathcal{J}(\\mathcal{N}), and then applying the lower bound for testing purity given in (, Theorem 25). Then we can rearrange the unitarity as follows We can also use the Kraus representation 𝒩​(⋅)=∑ℓKℓ​(⋅)​Kℓ†𝒩⋅subscriptℓsubscript𝐾ℓ⋅superscriptsubscript𝐾ℓ†\\mathcal{N}(\\cdot)=\\sum_{\\ell}K_{\\ell}(\\cdot)K_{\\ell}^{\\dagger} and write where the last two identities are proven in ([ref]14, Eqs. 160-164). Putting all together, we obtain: Thus the unitarity of 𝒩𝒩\\mathcal{N} and the purity of 𝒥​(𝒩)𝒥𝒩\\mathcal{J}(\\mathcal{N}) are within an exponentially small additive terms. Then the algorithm 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} would estimate the purity of 𝒥​(𝒩)𝒥𝒩\\mathcal{J}(\\mathcal{N}) with error smaller than 0.24+1/(4n−1)0.241superscript4𝑛10.24+1/(4^{n}-1) with less than 2Ω​(τ2​2n)superscript2Ωsuperscript𝜏2superscript2𝑛2^{\\Omega(\\tau^{2}2^{n})} queries, contradicting (, Theorem 25).\n∎\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: representation 𝒩​(⋅)=∑ℓKℓ​(⋅)​Kℓ†𝒩⋅subscriptℓsubscript𝐾ℓ⋅superscriptsubscript𝐾ℓ†\\mathcal{N}(\\cdot)=\\sum_{\\ell}K_{\\ell}(\\cdot)K_{\\ell}^{\\dagger} and write where the last two identities are proven in ([ref]14, Eqs. 160-164).
