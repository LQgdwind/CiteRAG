      "content": "Paper Title: Nonsmooth Implicit Differentiation for Machine Learning and Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConservative Jacobians are generalized forms of Jacobians well suited for automatic differentiation, introduced in [ref]14. Given a locally Lipschitz continuous function F:ℝn→ℝm:𝐹→superscriptℝ𝑛superscriptℝ𝑚F:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{m}, we say that JF:ℝn⇉ℝn×m:subscript𝐽𝐹⇉superscriptℝ𝑛superscriptℝ𝑛𝑚J_{F}:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightrightarrows\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times m} is a conservative mapping or a conservative Jacobian for F𝐹F if JFsubscript𝐽𝐹J_{F} has a closed graph, is locally bounded, and is nonempty with whenever γ𝛾\\gamma is an absolutely continuous curve in ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}. When m=1𝑚1m=1, the corresponding vectors are called conservative gradient fields. Note that when JFsubscript𝐽𝐹J_{F} is conservative, so is its pointwise convexified extension conv​JFconvsubscript𝐽𝐹\\mathrm{conv}\\,J_{F}. A locally Lipschitz function is called path differentiable if it has a conservative Jacobian.\nRecall that the Clarke Jacobian is defined as where diffFsubscriptdiff𝐹\\mathrm{diff}_{F} is the full measure set of points where F𝐹F is differentiable and Jac​FJac𝐹\\mathrm{Jac}\\,F is the standard Jacobian of F𝐹F. Path differentiability is equivalent to having a chain rule as in (1) for the Clarke subdifferential, see [ref]14 . (a) Convex functions and concave functions are path differentiable, see [ref]14. This implies that their subdifferential in the sense of convex analysis is a conservative field. \n(b) The vast class of definable functions are path differentiable  [ref]14. As a result, the Clarke Jacobian of a Lipschitz definable mapping is a conservative Jacobian. Definable functions (see    [ref]14 for an optimization context and  for a foundational work) encompass semialgebraic functions , elementary log-exp selection [ref]14, PAP [ref]34 (restricted to analytic functions with full domain), and many others, see  and references therein. This includes networks with common nonlinearities: for example analytic with full domain (e.g., square, exponential, logistic loss, hyperbolic tangent, sigmoid), relu, max pooling, sort, (see Appendix A.2 for more detail). \n(c) The backpropagation can be seen as an oracle (in the optimization sense) for a conservative Jacobian. Let PFsubscript𝑃𝐹P_{F} be a numerical program for a function F𝐹F, aggregating elementary functions, for instance, relu, max pooling, affine mappings, polynomials (in general, any definable function).\nThen the backpropagation algorithm applied to PFsubscript𝑃𝐹P_{F}, which we denote (abusively) by backprop​PF:=backpropFassignbackpropsubscript𝑃𝐹subscriptbackprop𝐹\\mathrm{backprop}\\,P_{F}:=\\mathrm{backprop}_{F}, outputs an element of a conservative Jacobian [14, Theorem 8] which depends on PFsubscript𝑃𝐹P_{F} and can be constructed by a closure procedure [15, definition 5]. As described in , due to spurious behaviors, backpropFsubscriptbackprop𝐹\\mathrm{backprop}_{F} is not in general an element of the Clarke Jacobian of F𝐹F. As established in  in a semialgebraic context, the discrepancy between conservative gradients and Clarke subdifferentials is somehow negligible. Let us provide a version of that result matching our concerns. We call conservative mappings of the null function residual or residual conservative. Such a mapping R𝑅R has the property that R​(x+t​v)​v=0𝑅𝑥𝑡𝑣𝑣0R(x+tv)v=0 for almost all t𝑡t in ℝℝ\\mathbb{R} and all x,v𝑥𝑣x,v in ℝn×ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛superscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{n}.\nThe following theorem and proposition (partially) extend results from [ref]14 and , their proof is given in Appendix B. Given a nonempty open subset 𝒰𝒰\\mathcal{U} of ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n} and F:𝒰⊂ℝn→ℝm:𝐹𝒰superscriptℝ𝑛→superscriptℝ𝑚F:\\mathcal{U}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{m} locally Lipschitz, let JFsubscript𝐽𝐹J_{F} be a convex-valued conservative Jacobian for F𝐹F. Then for almost all x∈𝒰,JF​(x)={Jac​F}formulae-sequence𝑥𝒰subscript𝐽𝐹𝑥Jac𝐹x\\in\\mathcal{U},J_{F}(x)=\\left\\{\\mathrm{Jac}\\,F\\right\\} and, for all x∈𝒰𝑥𝒰x\\in\\mathcal{U}, Jacc​F​(x)⊂JF​(x)superscriptJac𝑐𝐹𝑥subscript𝐽𝐹𝑥\\mathrm{Jac}\\,^{c}F(x)\\subset J_{F}(x). Let JFsubscript𝐽𝐹J_{F} be a conservative Jacobian for F𝐹F, then there is a residual R𝑅R such that Note that the above may not hold with equality. Consider F​(x)=|x|𝐹𝑥𝑥F(x)=|x| and JF​(0)=[−1,1]∪ [ref]3subscript𝐽𝐹01123J_{F}(0)=[-1,1]\\cup [ref]3, JF​(x)=sign​(x)subscript𝐽𝐹𝑥sign𝑥J_{F}(x)=\\mathrm{sign}\\,(x) otherwise. One cannot write JF=Jacc​F+Rsubscript𝐽𝐹superscriptJac𝑐𝐹𝑅J_{F}=\\mathrm{Jac}\\,^{c}F+R with a residual operator R𝑅R. Propagating derivatives within a nonsmooth function finds its justification in the following: Let F:ℝn→ℝm:𝐹→superscriptℝ𝑛superscriptℝ𝑚F:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{m} and G:ℝm→ℝl:𝐺→superscriptℝ𝑚superscriptℝ𝑙G:\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{l} be two locally path differentiable functions having respective conservative Jacobians JFsubscript𝐽𝐹J_{F} and JGsubscript𝐽𝐺J_{G}. Then F∘G𝐹𝐺F\\circ G is path differentiable and the point-to-set matrix-valued x⇉JF​(G​(x))​JG​(x)⇉𝑥subscript𝐽𝐹𝐺𝑥subscript𝐽𝐺𝑥x\\rightrightarrows J_{F}(G(x))J_{G}(x) is conservative. There is already a long tradition of nonsmooth implicit function theorems, e.g.,    5. What makes the following theorem useful is that it comes with a qualification-free calculus. The proofs are given in Appendix B. Let F:ℝn×ℝm→ℝm:𝐹→superscriptℝ𝑛superscriptℝ𝑚superscriptℝ𝑚F:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{m} be path differentiable on 𝒰×𝒱⊂ℝn×ℝm𝒰𝒱superscriptℝ𝑛superscriptℝ𝑚\\mathcal{U}\\times\\mathcal{V}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{m} an open set and G:𝒰→𝒱:𝐺→𝒰𝒱G:\\mathcal{U}\\to\\mathcal{V} a locally Lipschitz function such that, for each x∈𝒰𝑥𝒰x\\in\\mathcal{U}, Furthermore, assume that for each x∈𝒰𝑥𝒰x\\in\\mathcal{U}, for each [A​B]∈JF​(x,G​(x))delimited-[]𝐴𝐵subscript𝐽𝐹𝑥𝐺𝑥[A\\ B]\\in J_{F}(x,G(x)), the matrix B𝐵B is invertible where JFsubscript𝐽𝐹J_{F} is a conservative Jacobian for F𝐹F. Then, G:𝒰→𝒱:𝐺→𝒰𝒱G:\\mathcal{U}\\to\\mathcal{V} is path differentiable with conservative Jacobian given, for each x∈𝒰𝑥𝒰x\\in\\mathcal{U}, by Let F:ℝn×ℝm→ℝm:𝐹→superscriptℝ𝑛superscriptℝ𝑚superscriptℝ𝑚F:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{m} be path differentiable with conservative Jacobian JFsubscript𝐽𝐹J_{F}.\nLet (x^,y^)∈ℝn×ℝm^𝑥^𝑦superscriptℝ𝑛superscriptℝ𝑚(\\hat{x},\\hat{y})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{m} be such that F​(x^,y^)=0𝐹^𝑥^𝑦0F(\\hat{x},\\hat{y})=0. Assume that JF​(x^,y^)subscript𝐽𝐹^𝑥^𝑦J_{F}(\\hat{x},\\hat{y}) is convex and that, for each [A​B]∈JF​(x^,y^)delimited-[]𝐴𝐵subscript𝐽𝐹^𝑥^𝑦[A\\ B]\\in J_{F}(\\hat{x},\\hat{y}), the matrix B𝐵B is invertible. Then, there exists an open neighborhood 𝒰×𝒱⊂ℝn×ℝm𝒰𝒱superscriptℝ𝑛superscriptℝ𝑚\\mathcal{U}\\times\\mathcal{V}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{m} of (x^,y^)^𝑥^𝑦\\left(\\hat{x},\\hat{y}\\right) and a path differentiable function G:𝒰→𝒱:𝐺→𝒰𝒱G:\\mathcal{U}\\to\\mathcal{V} such that the conclusion of Theorem 2 holds. Let 𝒰𝒰\\mathcal{U} and 𝒱𝒱\\mathcal{V} be open neighborhoods of 00 in ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n} and Φ:𝒰→𝒱:Φ→𝒰𝒱\\Phi:\\mathcal{U}\\to\\mathcal{V} path differentiable with Φ​(0)=0Φ00\\Phi(0)=0. Assume that ΦΦ\\Phi has a conservative Jacobian JΦsubscript𝐽ΦJ_{\\Phi} such that JΦ​(0)subscript𝐽Φ0J_{\\Phi}(0) contains only invertible matrices. Then, locally, ΦΦ\\Phi has a path differentiable inverse ΨΨ\\Psi with a conservative Jacobian given by (a) (On the necessity of conservativity) Example 1 in Appendix B shows that one cannot hope for the formulas in Corollaries 1 & 2 to provide Clarke Jacobians in general, even if the input(s) are Clarke Jacobians themselves.\n(b) (Lipschitz definable implicit and inverse function theorems) See Theorem 4 and 5 in the appendix\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: Conservative Jacobians are generalized forms of Jacobians well suited for automatic differentiation, introduced in [ref]14.
