      "content": "Paper Title: Morph-SSL: Self-Supervision with Longitudinal Morphing to Predict AMD Progression from OCT\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImpact of Morph-SSL:  In Table I, rows 1-3, we evaluate 3 training setups: (a) end-to-end training from random weight initialization; (b) freeze the Morph-SSL trained Encoder weights and only train the classifier on the TTC task; (c) use the Morph-SSL trained Encoder weights and the learned classifier weights from (b) to initialize and perform end-to-end finetuning of the Encoder and Classifier on the TTC task. The Morph-SSL features showed significant performance improvement, even without fine-tuning, over end-to-end training form scratch (row 2 vs 1). Further fine-tuning on the TTC task (row 2 vs. 3) did not lead to a statistically significant improvement in AUC, except for t=18𝑡18t=18. This indicates that the initial Morph-SSL trained weights are very close to the optimal network weights for the TTC task. Overall, a good performance is observed in identifying the scans that have just converted to nAMD (t=0) or are about to convert within 6 months. However, the performance drops progressively as we consider larger time-intervals in the future. This may indicate that often, distinct morphological changes signaling imminent nAMD conversion appear unexpectedly only a few months before conversion rather than gradually over a long period. Few examples of the Saliency Maps 𝐌𝐌\\mathbf{M} are shown in Fig. 4. Impact of the loss terms for the TTC task:  An ablation of the auxiliary loss terms in eq. 6 is evaluated in rows 4, 5 of Table I. Removal of the L-2 regularization on the slope parameter a𝑎a (row 2 vs 4) leads to a minor drop in the AUC across all 4 time-points. However, the effect on Balanced accuracy is mixed with slight performance drop at t=6,12𝑡612t=6,12 but improvement at t=0,18𝑡018t=0,18. Removing the loss term which penalizes high activations outside the retinal tissue leads to a small drop in both AUC and Balanced Accuracy for all time-points (row 5 vs 2). Impact of TTC formulation: \nWe propose to model the CDF of the TTC with a sigmoidal function. An alternative way is to pose it as multi-label classification with each class indicating if the image converts within a discrete time-point , , . We compare our performance against multi-label classification in Table I, row 6 by modifying the last layer of our classifier architecture to produce a 4 channel ouptut (instead of 1), to which GAP is applied followed by a sigmoid activation to obtain the predictions for the 4 time-points. The AUCs of our method is slightly higher than multi-label classification at all time-points except t=0𝑡0t\\!=\\!0. The improvement is not statistically significant for t=6,12𝑡612t=6,12. However, our approach guarantees the monotonic non-decreasing property of the CDF (e.g., the probability of an eye to convert within 12 months cannot be lower than the conversion probability within 6 months) which is not the case with multi-label classification. Across the 555 folds, the multi-label classifier is inconsistent in some cases, with higher predictions for a previous time-point compared to the next, 161616 cases between t=0,6𝑡06t\\!=\\!0,6 months, 606060 cases between t=6,12𝑡612t\\!=\\!6,12 and 84 cases with inconsistencies between t=12,18𝑡1218t\\!=\\!12,18 months. Additionally, once trained, our model can predict conversion risk at any continuous time point within 18 months by varying t𝑡t in eq 4, unlike multi-label classification that can predict conversion risk only at predefined discrete time intervals used during training. Architecture Design to predict slope: \nSpatial entropy of 𝐌𝐌\\mathbf{M} was used to predict the slope a𝑎a of the sigmoid function. We compared this design choice against a modified architecture in Table I, row 7 which predicts two channels. One channel is used similar to 𝐌𝐌\\mathbf{M} to compute b𝑏b while a GAP is applied to the second channel for obtaining a𝑎a. Although the new architecture requires extra network parameters, the difference in their AUCs (row 7 vs 2) was statistically insignificant. Comparison with state-of-the art 3D Networks: \nAn alternative to SSL is to fine-tune standard CNN networks after initializing them with the already available pre-trained weights. We compared our performance against two popular 3D-CNN networks, I3D  and X3D . Their last fully connected layer was modified to predict a𝑎a and b𝑏b in eq.4. Both networks were initialized with pre-trained weights trained on the Kinetics video dataset and fine-tuned end-to-end on our task. Our Morph-SSL trained Encoder significantly outperformed both of these networks (row 2 vs 8,9 in Table I) in terms of both AUC and Balanced accuracy across all time-points. Comparison with other SSL methods: \nWe compare Morph-SSL against the state-of-the-art in Table II. The same 3D U-net and the transformations for the reconstruction task were employed for Model Genesis as reported in . The time interval prediction task  was originally developed for the central B-scans alone, however we implemented a 3D version using our Encoder architecture for a fair comparison. The latest CL methods, VICReg  and Barlow Twins  could not be trained in 3D due to their large batch size requirements. They were used to train a ResNet-50 with a batch size of 128 following . The positive image pairs were constructed by selecting B-scans (from the same position) from two random visits of the same eye within 18 months and applying the data augmentations used in . The Classifier was modified to handle a 2048×322048322048\\times 32(feature dimensions ×{\\mkern-2.0mu\\times\\mkern-2.0mu} B-scans) input. First, a 1D convolution layer with 32 input and 1 output feature channel was used to obtain a 204820482048 dimensional feature for the entire OCT volume. This was followed by two fully connected layers with 1024 and 2 neurons respectively, to get the predictions for a𝑎a and b𝑏b in eq. 4. The SSL methods were compared under different training setups by: (a) using the SSL-trained features off-the-shelf and only training the Classifier (Freeze) vs. initialization with the SSL-trained network weights for end-to-end fine-tuning (Finetune), and (b) training on the entire vs. one-third of the supervised training data. To evaluate performance in a small data regime, one-third of the training data in each fold of the TTC Dataset was randomly selected and kept consistent across all SSL methods. The Delong test was employed for statistical significance between AUCs using the pyroc 0.20 library [ref]41. Small Data Regime: Morph-SSL outperforms all benchmark methods (under identical Freeze/Finetune setup) across all 4 time-points in Table II. All differences were statistically significant except for VICReg-Finetune at t=18𝑡18t\\!=\\!18(p-value 0.30). Finetune improves performance over Freeze for all methods except Model-Genesis, which showed signs of overfitting. Entire Training Data: In the Freeze setup, again Morph-SSL outperforms all benchmark methods in terms of AUC with a statistically significant difference across all 4 time-points. In the Fine-tune setup, Morph-SSL still clearly outperforms time-interval prediction  and Barlow twins  with a statistically significant difference in AUC across all time-points. Although, Morph-SSL outperforms VICReg in terms of AUC the difference was not statistically significant for t=0𝑡0t=0 (p-value 0.27) and t=6𝑡6t=6 (p-value 0.28). Similarly, compared to Model-Genesis, the difference in AUC was not statistically significant for t=6𝑡6t=6 (p-value 0.21) and t=12𝑡12t=12 (p-value 0.41) with a marginally higher AUC for Morph-SSL. Overall, Morph-SSL shows better performance than other methods, particularly in scenarios where the features are used off-the-shelf or in a small data regime with limited labeled data for fine-tuning. When trained on the entire dataset, Morph-SSL was found to learn strong features with good performance on the TTC task with minimal effect of further fine-tuning.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: in each fold of the TTC Dataset was randomly selected and kept consistent across all SSL methods.
