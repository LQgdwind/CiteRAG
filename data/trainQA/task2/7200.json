      "content": "Paper Title: StarCraftImage: A Dataset For Prototyping Spatial Reasoning Methods For Multi-Agent Environments\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSpatial tasks in multi-agent environments require reasoning over both agents’ positions and the environmental context such as buildings, obstacles, or terrain features.\nThese complex spatial reasoning tasks have applications in autonomous driving, autonomous surveillance over sensor networks, or reinforcement learning (RL) as subtasks of the RL agent.\nFor example, to predict a car collision, an autonomous driving system needs to reason about other cars, road conditions, road signs, and buildings.\nFor autonomous surveillance over sensor networks, the system would need to reason over the positions of objects, buildings, and other agents to determine if a new agent is normal or abnormal or to impute missing sensor values.\nAn RL system may want to predict the cumulative or final reward or impute missing values given only an incomplete snapshot of the world state, i.e., partial observability.\nYet, collecting large realistic datasets for these tasks is expensive and laborious.\n Due to the challenge of collecting real-world data, practitioners have turned to (semi-)synthetic sources for creating large clean datasets of photo-realistic images or videos    .\nFor example,  leveraged the Grand Theft Auto V game engine to collect a synthetic video dataset for pedestrian detection and tracking.\n overlays aerial images with crowd simulations to provide a crowd density estimation dataset.\nYet, despite near photo-realism, these prior datasets focus on simple multi-agent environments (e.g., pedestrian-like simulations  ) and thus lack complex (or strategic) agent and object positioning.\nIn sharp contrast to these prior datasets, human-based replays of the real-time strategy game StarCraft II capture complex strategic and naturally adversarial positioning of agents and objects (e.g., buildings and outposts).\nIndeed, the human player provides thousands of micro-commands that produce an overall intelligent and strategic positioning of agents and building units.\nThe release of the StarCraft II API and Python bindings [ref]38 significantly reduces the barrier to using this rich data source for multi-agent environments.\nYet, the StarCraft II environment still requires significant overhead including game engine installation, looping through the game engine, understanding the API, etc.\nThis greatly limits the broad adoption of this very rich source of multi-agent interactions as a benchmark dataset—in contrast to the classic and extremely easy-to-use MNIST  and CIFAR10  benchmark datasets\nthat drove image classification research in the early years and continue to be used for prototyping new ML methods.\nIn summary, prior multi-agent datasets either lack complex strategic behavior or require significant implementation overhead. To address these issues, we created StarCraftImage: a simplified image-based representation of human-played StarCraft II matches to serve as a large-scale multi-agent spatial reasoning benchmark dataset that is as easy to use as MNIST and CIFAR10 while still exhibiting complex and strategic object positioning.\nAs seen in Fig. 1, each image in StarCraftImage is akin to a detailed snapshot of the StarCraft II minimap and includes the locations of all units (both moveable units and buildings), the units’ IDs, as well as important metadata like which player won that match, player resource counts, the current map name, player ranking, etc.\nWe made two key design decisions when developing StarCraftImage.\nFirst, we chose to represent the matches by snapshot images that summarize a window of approximately 10 seconds of gameplay rather than a video.\nThis design choice was motivated both by the ease-of-use criteria (as images are easier to load and manipulate than videos) and by the goal of performing spatial rather than temporal reasoning tasks—though a video dataset for complex temporal reasoning is a natural direction for future work. Our second design choice was to represent the matches via minimap-like images rather than photo-realistic renderings of the game state.\nThis choice was motivated by two reasons.\nFirst, minimap images are easy to use because they are small yet still represent of the whole environment.\nBy using a minimap representation, we can encode the most crucial game information (unit types, recent troop movements, building locations, environmental features, etc.) in a naturally compact representation.\nIndeed, the minimap representation is critical for playing StarCraft II as evidenced by the following quote from the famous StarCraft II player Day[ref]9 (Sean Plott): “…the two most important things [are] the minimap and your money” .\nSecond, the minimap representation allows for us to have many diverse samples while still maintaining a small data footprint.\nThe resultant smaller disk size allows for rapid prototyping via quick dataset downloads and swift data consumption.\nCompared to prior common spatial reasoning datasets, our proposed 3.6 million image dataset has a total disk size of 10.6Gb while the MOTSynth-MOT-CVPR22 dataset , which consists of 1.3 million images, has a disk size of 167Gb (16x larger, while containing half the number of samples).\nUltimately, we construct three different image representations with decreasing complexity: Hyperspectral images which give precise game state information by encoding the unit ids and last-seen timestamps at each spatial location (mimicking the hyperspectral geospatial representations), RGB images that mimic CIFAR10, and grayscale images that mimic MNIST.\nThus, our dataset is compatible with common ML frameworks with minimal overhead or preprocessing effort.\nOverall, we use 60k StarCraft II replays to create 3.6 million summary images (not multi-counting different representations) and corresponding metadata.\n To demonstrate how multi-agent spatial reasoning tasks can be easily prototyped using StarCraftImage, we also provide a series of benchmark tasks.\nWe perform target identification (i.e., determining unit type from only knowing unit locations) where the input is either an RGB or grayscale image and the target image is hyperspectral with each channel corresponding to a unit type.\nWe also perform more complex tasks such as map event prediction (i.e., game outcome and StarCraft race prediction) which serve as canonical image-level reasoning problems.\nTo show how our image representations can be easily manipulated for other tasks (like Rotated MNIST  or Color MNIST ), we map missing data imputation as an image inpainting task using both simulated sensor network faults and the fog-of-war from the game engine.\nUltimately, we hope to provide a large-scale and rich multi-agent spatial reasoning dataset that is very easy to use yet exhibits complex and strategic placement of agents for complex spatial reasoning applications.\nWe summarize our contributions as follows:\n We design and extract StarCraftImage as an easy-to-use multi-agent spatial reasoning dataset under three representations: 1) Hyperspectral images that encode all unit ids and lasts seen timestamps for each spatial location, 2) RGB images that mimic CIFAR10, and 3) grayscale images that mimic MNIST. We apply StarCraftImage on tasks such as target identification, movement prediction, and more. We also propose several noise simulation models and discuss several task modifiers such as domain generalization. We publicly release the datasets with a permissive CC BY 4.0 license.\nWe also release the StarCraft II dataset extraction code and the relevant data loaders and modules for using the data as a Python package with an MIT license, and provide matainance as laid out in our dataset nutrition label: Table 4.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: human player provides thousands of micro-commands that produce an overall intelligent and strategic positioning of agents and building units.\nThe release of the StarCraft II API and Python bindings [ref]38 significantly reduces the barrier to using this rich data source for multi-agent environments.\nYet, the StarCraft II environment still requires significant overhead including game engine\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
