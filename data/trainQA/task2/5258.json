The benefits of a latent space model is to obtain the low-rank approximations from the original features, so that obtain a more compact matrix by removing the redundant information of the large scale matrix  .  proposed a dynamic model for a static co-occurrence model CODE, where the coordinates can change with time to get new\nobservations. There are several advanced investigations focusing on traffic analysis under the latent space assumption. For example, to address the issues of finding abnormal activities in crowded scenes,  devised a spatio-temporal Laplacian eigenmap strategy to\ndetect anomalies.  leveraged a tensor structure to resolve the high-order time-varying prediction problem. The key characteristics of the original time sequences can be represented by the learned latent core tensor.  developed\na real-time traffic speed prediction model that learns temporal and topological features from the road network. It then used an online latent space learning method to solve the proposed constrained optimization problem. [ref]34 took the advantage of dynamic latent space learning to address the temporal analysis problem very efficiently on the large-scale streaming data. In other applications, [ref]4  used the online matrix factorization model to solve the crowd flow distribution problem. In summary, latent space models can effectively capture dynamic evolving trends from real-world networks, as well as learning the latent embedding for such networks.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: space learning methods provide excellent solutions for the dynamic network problems, e.g., flow prediction , community\ndetection systems , social network evolution learning , sequential analysis    [ref]28, and traffic speed prediction .
