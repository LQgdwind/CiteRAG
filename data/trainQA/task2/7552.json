      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Learning for Cross-Domain Data Fusion in Urban Computing: Taxonomy, Advances, and Outlook\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile urban multi-modal research has made significant advancements in recent years, several challenging issues persist, highlighting directions for potential future research.\nWe summarize these challenges and suggest potentially feasible research directions as follows: LLM-enhanced Application: Since the advent of GPT-4 [ref]203 and Sora [ref]21, the academic community has embarked on extensive research on the roles of LLM as predictors [ref]161 , enhancers  , controllers   , and evaluators  [ref]161. However, the field of cross-domain data fusion in urban computing is still in its initial stage in terms of exploring how to apply LLMs effectively. For example, there exists research    focusing on LLM as urban predictors but also as naive reasoners yet; whereas others   attempt to leverage LLM as model backbone but such works are limited within remote sensing domain instead of general urban computing. Therefore, we eagerly anticipate that the research community will focus on the application of LLMs in urban computing, exploring their impact similar to their roles in NLP and other domains. Agent-based Simulation: Agent-based simulation aims to model the behavior of individual components or agents to comprehend their interactions and how they collectively contribute to the functioning of the entire system  . It has been extensively used in various fields such as biology , ecology , sociology , etc., to model systems where individual entities influence collective behavior. However, the early attempts at agent-based simulation 8   are limited because they are not autonomous and need human-defined rules or goals, which may not simulate the complex dynamics of urban systems. Hence, LLM-driven agents such as Urban Generative Intelligence (UGI) , can serve as up-to-date solutions for simulating urban dynamics based on cross-domain urban data. This paradigm not only propels forward the field of urban computing, but also paves the way for future cities that are more adaptive and responsive to the evolving needs of their inhabitants. Multi-modal Causal Learning: Causal learning or inference aims to investigate causal relationships between variables, ensuring stable and robust learning and inference  . Integrating deep learning techniques with causal inference has shown great success in recent years, especially in the fields of spatio-temporal graph forecasting   , CV   , NLP   , and recommender systems  . However, regarding cross-domain data fusion in urban computing, the application of causal learning is still in its early stages. Hence, we eagerly anticipate further research on multi-modal causal learning of urban data, aiming to improve the interpretability of intricate and dynamic urban systems. Multi-source Data Privacy: Urban data can be highly sensitive, especially in multi-source scenarios in the field of economy and healthcare. When models are trained upon such shared data, there is a risk that they may memorize specific information from the training data, potentially compromising the privacy of individuals. As a result, there is a need for further research on how to incorporate privacy-preserving techniques, such as differential privacy 4  and federated learning  , in order to safeguard data privacy while still benefiting from the advantages of cross-domain data fusion in urban computing. Open Benchmark: The challenge of developing an open benchmark for cross-domain data fusion in urban computing lies in the complexity of integrating diverse data sources, such as sensor data, images, and even text, to understand urban environments comprehensively. This complexity arises due to the heterogeneity of data formats, modalities, and the need for effective fusion methods to extract meaningful insights. A potential solution involves collaborative efforts to standardize data formats, develop unified evaluation metrics, and establish shared benchmarks that facilitate the evaluation and comparison of cross-domain data fusion models. Downstream Task Diversity: Existing urban research predominantly concentrates on specific task domains such as transportation and urban planning, overlooking the inherent diversity of challenges in real-life urban environments. This limitation exists due to the compartmentalized nature of current research efforts, hindering a holistic understanding of cross-domain data fusion in urban computing. Therefore, we anticipate a more extensive scope of urban research encompassing diverse applications in the realms of economy, society, and environment, providing a thorough comprehension of the intricate conditions prevailing in urban settings. Computation Efficiency: Current urban research emphasizes the fulfillment of specific applications within cross-domain urban computing, but it overlooks the crucial aspect of computational efficiency. This oversight hampers the practical deployment of these computational models in real-life scenarios. Addressing this challenge requires our focus on optimizing computation efficiency, involving model compression (e.g., knowledge distillation , low-rank decomposition  , and quantization  ), efficient training (e.g., prompt tuning  and hardware-assisted attention acceleration  ), and efficient architecture (e.g., mixture of experts  0), to enhance the feasibility and effectiveness of deploying cross-domain data fusion solutions in practical urban environments.\n\nReference markers found: [203]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]203: directions for potential future research.\nWe summarize these challenges and suggest potentially feasible research directions as follows: LLM-enhanced Application: Since the advent of GPT-4 [ref]203 and Sora [ref]21, the academic community has embarked on extensive research on the roles of LLM as predictors [ref]161 , enhancers  , controllers   , and evaluators  [ref]161.
