      "content": "Paper Title: A Brief Survey and Comparative Study of Recent Development of Pronoun Coreference Resolution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBesides the ordinary and hard PCR tasks, PCR is also an important research topic for many special purposes (e.g., gender bias) or in some special settings (e.g., Visual-aware PCR).\nIn this section, we briefly introduce these tasks: PCR in the Medical Domain: I2b2  is a dataset that focuses on identifying coreference relations in electrical medical records.\nAs reported in , the training set of I2b2 contains 2,024 third personal pronouns, 685 possessive pronouns, and 270 demonstrative pronouns. Its test set contains 1,244 third personal pronouns, 367 possessive pronouns, and 166 demonstrative pronouns.\nAs a dataset in a relatively narrow domain, the usage of domain knowledge becomes important.\nAs shown in , i2b2 can be used as an additional dataset to evaluate models’ cross-domain abilities. PCR for Machine Translation: ParCor 6 and ParCorFull 7 are datasets focusing on PCR in parallel multi-lingual datasets, which can be used in downstream machine translation tasks.\nDifferent from other PCR works, it focuses on how to leverage the PCR results for better translation rather than how to solve the PCR problem. PCR for Chatbots: CIC 8 is a dataset focusing on identifying coreference relations in multi-party conversations. Compared with the ordinary PCR tasks, which are mostly annotated on formal textual data (e.g., newswire), identifying coreference relation in conversation is more challenging. PCR for Studying Gender Bias: Nowadays, gender bias has been a hot research topic in the NLP community 9 . Among all the works, WinoGender 9 is one of the most popular ones.\nThe setting of WinoGender is similar to the setting of WSC , where each sentence contains one target pronoun and two candidate noun phrases and the models are required to select the correct antecedent from the two candidates.\nBut the purpose is different.\nWSC aims at evaluating models’ abilities to understand commonsense knowledge, while WinoGender aims at evaluating how well models can predict without the influence of gender bias.\nThe experiments show that some gender bias (e.g., ‘he’ is more likely to be predicted to be the doctor rather than the nurse by the machine) indeed exists in pre-trained language representation models.\nSuch observation is astonishing and motivates the community to think about how to minimize the influence of such gender bias. Visual-aware PCR: Recently, a visual-aware PCR dataset [ref]51, which evaluates how well models can ground pronouns to visual objects, was proposed.\nSimilar to CIC 8, Visual-PCR also focuses on pronouns in daily dialogue, where the language usage is informal and a lot of background knowledge could be missing.\nFor example, if one speaker refers to something both speakers can see, they may directly use a pronoun rather than introduce it first.\nIn such a case, a pronoun may refer to not mentioned objects in the conversation.\nAs analyzed in the original paper, 15% of pronouns in conversations refer to not mentioned objects and for them, leveraging the visual context information becomes crucial.\nAs shown in , grounding pronouns to the visual objects can significantly help the model to better understand the dialog and generate the better response, which further proves that visual PCR is an important research topic worth exploring.\n\nReference markers found: [51]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]51: models.\nSuch observation is astonishing and motivates the community to think about how to minimize the influence of such gender bias. Visual-aware PCR: Recently, a visual-aware PCR dataset [ref]51, which evaluates how well models can ground pronouns to visual objects, was proposed.\nSimilar to CIC 8, Visual-PCR also focuses on pronouns in daily dialogue, where the language usage is\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
