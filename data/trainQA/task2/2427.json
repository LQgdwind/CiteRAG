      "content": "Paper Title: An Empirical Analysis of Measure-Valued Derivatives for Policy Gradients\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPolicy gradient methods can be derived through the trajectory, also called actor-only, or actor-critic formulations .\nIn the former, the expected return from a state-action pair is estimated with samples from the trajectory rollout, as done in REINFORCE  and GPOMDP .\nIn stochastic environments this results in high variance gradient estimates and poor convergence.\nInstead, an actor-critic agent performs updates by estimating the returns using a state-action value function approximator.\nThese methods have lower variance and show more stable learning.\nSeveral actor-critic algorithms have been presented in the recent years, particularly using deep neural networks as function approximators, including Trust Region Policy Optimization  (TRPO) , Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) [ref]16, Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3)  and SAC . The connection between trajectory and actor-critic methods was established in the policy gradient theorem in its stochastic  and deterministic versions . Most policy gradient methods optimize stochastic policies using the SF or Rep-trick, while MVDs have not yet been extensively explored in the ML and RL communities. A modified version of the policy gradient theorem using MVDs, also referred to as weak derivatives, was first introduced in .\nThe authors derive an unbiased estimator and provide an extensive theoretical analysis of its properties, including the variance and computational complexity.\nHowever, the practical implementation of the algorithm has to perform two rollouts starting from the same state to obtain an unbiased estimate of the state-action value function.\nApplying this approach to a real-world scenario, where we cannot reset a system to an arbitrary continuous state, is impossible.\nFurthermore, it makes use of Monte Carlo rollouts to estimate the return from a state-action pair, discarding all the collected data after an update, which leads to inefficient use of samples.\nOther works used MVDs to solve Constrained Markov Decision Processes  [ref]14, also assuming that the environment can be reset to any state.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is no actor-critic algorithm based on MVDs that replicates a RL scenario.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: been presented in the recent years, particularly using deep neural networks as function approximators, including Trust Region Policy Optimization  (TRPO) , Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) [ref]16, Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3)  and SAC .

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
