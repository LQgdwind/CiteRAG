      "content": "Paper Title: Diffusion bridges for stochastic Hamiltonian systems and shape evolutionsSubmitted to the editors DATE.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe geometry of landmark spaces and the landmark matching problem, exemplified by matching of finite sets of anatomical markers on medical images, have been extensively studied in shape analysis. Examples include the seminal work of Kendall  on landmark configurations modulo scaling and rotation, and the extensive interest of landmark dynamics for diffeomorphic shape models  . The landmark matching problem has a geometric formulation in the language of geometric mechanics where diffeomorphisms of the underlying domain act to move the landmarks, and optimal trajectories between observed landmark configurations satisfy geodesic equations for a right-invariant metric on the diffeomorphism group (). These equations are also called Euler-Poincaré equations .\nLandmark dynamics are intrinsically linked to soliton dynamics in fluid dynamics , e.g.  soliton solutions of the Camassa-Holm equations , or more generally singular solutions of the Euler-Poincaré equation . Stochastic models of landmark evolutions are therefore of interest in both shape analysis and fluid dynamics. Several recent models include stochastic effects in landmark analysis      . The interest appears for several reasons: If v𝑣v denotes the observed landmark configuration, the presence of noise in the observation implies that landmark analysis is classically performed in the inexact setting where the requirement that the flow qtsubscript𝑞𝑡q_{t} satisfy qT=vsubscript𝑞𝑇𝑣q_{T}=v at observation time t=T𝑡𝑇t=T is essentially relaxed to qT=v+ϵsubscript𝑞𝑇𝑣italic-ϵq_{T}=v+\\epsilon for some perturbation ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon. This thus amounts to adding noise at the endpoint qTsubscript𝑞𝑇q_{T} of the flow qtsubscript𝑞𝑡q_{t}. If the perturbation is not linked to observation noise but instead comes from intrinsic stochastic behaviour of the shape or soliton evolution, it is more natural to make the noise intrinsically time-continuous, i.e. added to qtsubscript𝑞𝑡q_{t} for each t𝑡t on an infinitesimal level. The flow qtsubscript𝑞𝑡q_{t} can have multi-scale behaviour where the coarse scale evolution is modeled by a deterministic flow while the fine scale behaviour, which in a fluid system is closer to turbulence, can be summarised with stochastic terms. In medical applications, it can be hypothesised that the shape evolution is not purely deterministic, and that the stochastic deformation happen continuously in time. It is generally hard to construct natural families of probability distributions on geometric spaces without linearising the spaces around a center point. Solutions to stochastic differential equations however provide such probability models [ref]39. In this paper, we focus on models defined by stochastic differential equations. In all of the above enumerated cases, it is common that observations are discrete in time. Constructing paths that are conditioned on such partial in time observations is called bridge simulation and the paths bridges. Bridge simulation is essential for likelihood based inference as it provides a stochastic method for approximating the intractable likelihood. If possible, it enables methods such as sequential Monte Carlo, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, stochastic Expectation-Maximisation, or stochastic gradient descent. This in turn allows for estimation of parameters in the process’ dynamics and recovery of latent states at observation times. Moreover, in applications like landmark matching, there is intrinsic interest in bridge simulation as bridges appear as stochastic perturbations of landmark geodesics or as critical paths for a stochastically perturbed energy. Bridges therefore present a stochastic generalisation of the geodesic paths usually considered when matching sets of landmarks. Bridge simulation is generally a challenging problem. It has been addressed in the Euclidean setting in a series of works including 2    .\nFor shape manifolds, previous papers have centred on simulation in landmark spaces. Manifolds of finite numbers of landmarks are generally of finite dimensionality in contrast to spaces of continuous shapes which are in essence infinite dimensional. While bridge sampling on infinite dimensional shape spaces remains an open question, bridge sampling for landmarks spaces has been considered recently    using the approach of 2 7.\nThe underlying diffusion arises from stochastic Euler-Poincaré equations 5 and, in a different setting, Brownian motion on the landmark space . The difficulty in landmark bridge sampling arises from the high-dimensionality, the curvature and hence nonlinearity of the diffusion process, the degenerate diffusion processes in the stochastic Euler-Poincaré case (vanishing eigenvalues in the diffusion matrix), and from observations being only in the position variable of the phase-space flow.\nThe methods from 2 and   apply only for certain classes of stochastic evolution, excluding other important stochastic landmark approaches such as proposed in  , due to the degeneracy of the flow. As stated in : “Unfortunately, none of the known methods for diffusion bridges works with (2.1) to give computationally convenient algorithms. Without an efficient method for sampling the diffusion bridge, it is hard to formulate an MCMC method with good acceptance rates. Consequently, the generalised Langevin prior distribution is difficult to use in Bayesian statistics, and we now turn to simpler prior distributions, which arise by approximating the Langevin equation.” In the present paper, we show that resorting to such simpler prior distributions is unnecessary.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: families of probability distributions on geometric spaces without linearising the spaces around a center point.
