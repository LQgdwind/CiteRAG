      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey of RWKV\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs an important branch of machine learning, deep learning originated from the perceptron model , which laid the foundation for the development of neural networks. Over the past decade, deep learning has rapidly advanced and been widely applied, profoundly impacting various fields. Classic deep learning models, including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), have achieved significant success in areas such as image recognition  [ref]3 , speech recognition   , and natural language processing  . For example, CNNs have become central to computer vision 0 1 2, with applications ranging from facial recognition to automatic driving 3 4 5. Meanwhile, RNNs and their variants, particularly long-short-term memory (LSTM) networks 6, have proven essential for natural language processing tasks, especially in speech recognition and machine translation 7 8 9. Proposed by Vaswani et al. in 2017, the Transformer model 0 has since become a dominant architecture in natural language processing (NLP) 1 2 3 and various other fields 4 5 6. Transformer-based models such as BERT 7 and GPT 8 have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as text classification 9, language generation , and question answering . The Transformer utilizes a self-attention mechanism to adeptly capture long-distance dependencies in input sequences, providing a more robust approach for modeling intricate data relationships than earlier models like RNNs and LSTMs . Furthermore, the parallelization of both training and inference processes enhances the scalability of the Transformer, significantly improving processing speed and model performance. However, despite these advantages, the Transformer faces significant challenges. The computational cost of the attention mechanism grows quadratically with the sequence length, leading to inefficient memory usage and slower processing of long sequences . This issue becomes particularly problematic in tasks that require handling large amounts of data. Despite numerous endeavors to explore methods for reducing the complexity of the Transformer model, unfortunately, significant progress in substantially decreasing its complexity has yet to be achieved   . To address the limitations of the Transformer model, recent advancements have introduced state-space models , which provide a promising solution for efficiently handling long sequences while maintaining strong contextual understanding. Models such as Mamba  and RetNet  have been proposed to reduce computational complexity in sequence data processing. Mamba aims to enhance the efficiency of long-sequence processing by modifying the attention mechanism and reducing memory usage in the process. Similarly, RetNet employs a recurrent structure to improve memory retention and extend the model’s ability to capture long-range dependencies, all while avoiding the quadratic time complexity that affects traditional Transformers. One of the most notable innovations in recent times is the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model 0, which effectively combines the strengths of RNNs with the attention-based mechanism of Transformers. The RWKV model utilizes a unique key-value approach to manage dependencies sequentially, significantly reducing computational overhead while preserving the ability to model long-term dependencies with minimal memory requirements. RWKV has already demonstrated its potential across a wide range of applications, from NLP tasks such as text generation 1, machine translation 2, and sentiment analysis to time series prediction tasks 3. Inspired by the exceptional efficiency of RWKV in handling long sequences and its growing influence in various fields, there has been a surge in research exploring its capabilities and potential applications. Given the increasing interest in RWKV, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the model, its evolution, and future directions. As depicted in Figure 1, the remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a systematic review of foundational concepts, covering RNNs, Transformer architectures, and Attention-Free Transformer (AFT). Section 3 delves into the principles and implementations of RWKV, providing a comparative analysis with Transformer and Mamba, along with a detailed discussion of its various implementations. Section 4 thoroughly explores various applications of RWKV, including Natural Language Generation (NLG), Natural Language Understanding (NLU), other NLP tasks, computer vision, web applications, and evaluation methods. Finally, Section 5 provides the key challenges RWKV faces and its future research directions. for tree=\ngrow=east,\nreversed=true,\nanchor=base west,\nparent anchor=east,\nchild anchor=west,\nbase=left,\nfont=,\nrectangle,\ndraw,\nrounded corners,align=left,\nminimum width=2.5em,\ninner xsep=4pt,\ninner ysep=1pt,\n,\nwhere level=1text width=5em,fill=blue!10,\nwhere level=2text width=5em,font=,fill=pink!30,\nwhere level=3font=,yshift=0.26pt,fill=yellow!20,\n[A Survey of RWKV,fill=green!20\n[Background (Sec. 2),text width=9em\n[Recurrent Neural Networks,text width=11em]\n[Transformers,text width=5em]\n[Attention Free Transformer,text width=11em]\n]\n[RWKV (Sec. 3),text width=6em\n[RWKV-4,text width=4em]\n[RWKV-5(Eagle),text width=6em]\n[RWKV-6(Finch),text width=6em]\n[Compare RWKV with \nTransformer or mamba,text width=9em]\n[Various \nImplementations,text width=7em\n[Official Version 4 / ChatRWKV 5 / C 6 7 / C++ 8 9 0\nRust 1 2 3 4 5 / TensorFlow 6 7 8 9 0 1 2\nFortran 3 / Julia 4 / Zig 5 / Go 6 7 8 9 0 1\nKeras  2 3 / PaddlePaddle 4 5 / JAX 6 7 8\nNode.js 9 0 / MLX 1 / LoRA 2 3\nOthers 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2]\n]\n]\n[Applications of the \nRWKV Model(Sec. 4),text width=9em\n[Natural Language \nGeneration,text width=7em\n[Chatbot 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 00 01 02\nRole-playing  03 04 / Writing robot 1\nOthers05 06 07 08 09 10 11]\n]\n[Natural Language \nUnderstanding,text width=7em\n[Virtual Assistant 12 / PDF Query Systems 13\nMachine Translation 2 / OnlySports 14\nClassification 15 / Write novel 16\nOthers 17 18 19 20 21]\n]\n[Other NLP \ntasks,text width=4em\n[CLOPPS 22 / MSRWKV-2DTCN 3 / Stock Price Prediction  23 24 25\nRWKVCC 26 / Code Completion 27 / Mod-RWKV 28 / GoldFinch 29\nRWKV-TS 30 / TIM 31 / RRWKV 32 / LKPNR 33 / Music-Diff 34\nDecision-RWKV 35 / ProSG 36 / SpikeGPT 37\nOthers 38 39 40 41\n]\n]\n[Computer \nVision,text width=4em\n[BSBP-RWKV 42 / Restore-RWKV 43 / RWKV-based MIL 44 / LION 45\nPointRWKV 46 / OccRWKV 47 / TLS-RWKV 48 / RuleVM 49\nLineRWKV 50 / RWKV-SAM 51 / Vision-RWKV 52 / VisualRWKV 53\nLSTM CrossRWKV 54 / RWKV-CLIP 55 / SDiT 56 / Social-CVAE 57\nDiffusion-RWKV 58 / RWKV-IR 59\nOthers 60 61]\n]\n[Web \nApplication,text width=5em\n[MoZi-RWKV 62 / RWKV-3B-7B-Webui-GPT-SoVITS 63 / AI00-Server 64\nRWKV-v4-Web 65 / RWKV-Role-Playing 66 / RWKV-QQBot-BackEnd 67\nWeb-RWKV-Axum 68 / WebChatRWKVstic 69 / Chatux-Server-RWKV 70\nChatRWKV-Flask-Api 71 / ChatRWKV-Webui 72 / RWKV-Api 73\nRWKV.cpp-Webui-Macos 74 / RWKV-Role-Playing-UI 75\nRWKV.cpp-Webui-GPT-SoVITS 76 ]\n]\n[Evaluation of \nRWKV Models,text width=6em\n[REGBENCH 77 / LongctxBench 78 / LooGLE 79 / RULER 80\nS3EVAL 81 / MAGNIFICO 82 / MANGO 83 / SuperCLUE 84\nZhujiu 85 / BIPIA 86 / CoDI-Eval 87 / VasE 88 / CMATH 89\nHead-to-Tail 90 / PRE 91 / Freshbench 92 / LongICLBench 93\nLongBench 94 / Long Range Arena 95 / MT-bench 96\nOthers 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04\n]\n]\n[Others,text width=3em\n[Voice Activity Detection 05 / RWKV-Transducer 06 / RWKV-ASR 07\nSpiking Mixer 08 / MiniRWKV-4 09 / RWKV-RAG 00\nVisualRWKV 10 / Dlip-RWKV 11 / RWKV-LM-EXT 12\nAudioRWKV 13 / RWKV-Reward-Enhanced 14 / RWKV-MusicGenerator 15\nMusic-Genre-Classification-RWKV 16 / RWKV-Twitter-Bot-Detection 17\nUnifiedImplicitAttnRepr 18 / RWKV-PEFT 19 20 / RWKV5-InfctxLM 21\nDecisionRWKV 22 / RWKV-Nonogram 23 / RWKV-RUL 24\nTrainChatGalRWKV 25 / TinyRWKV 26 / Simple-RWKV 27\nRWKV-Runner 28 / Llama-node 29 / Godot-rwkv 30\nRWKVRaven-Alpaca 31 / RWKV-Reward 32 / Decision-RWKV 33\nRWKV-LM-RLHF 34 / RWKV-LM-State 35 / MARWKV 36\nRWKV-Finetune 37 / RWKVWorld-LoraAlpaca 38\nRWKV-LM-LoRA 39 / RWKV-Light-API 40 / RWKV-StateTuning 41\nChunkRWKV6 42 / RWKV-LM-Interpretability 43\nweb-RWKV-Inspector 44 / RWKV-Umap45 / RWKV-Tensorrt46\nLLMFarm 47 / RWKV-Chains 48 / RWKV-Ouroboros 49\nAltaeraAI 50 / RWKVinLLAMA 51 / GPTQ-for-RWKV 52\nRWKV-LM-AMD-Radeon-ROCm 53 / InnerDNN 54 / EasyChat-Server 55\nChatRWKV-PC 56 / Generative Calibration 57 / PlantFlowerDatasets 58]\n]\n]\n[Future Directions and \nChallenges (Sec. 5),text width=9em\n[Expanding RWKV’s Capabilities \nin Future Applications,text width=12em\n[(1) Long sequence processing capability \n(2) Multi-modal and Cross-modal Learning \n(3) Parameter-efficient Finetuning]\n]\n[Security and \nStability,text width=5em\n[(1) Safety&Robustness \n(2) Bias and fairness \n(3) Privacy]\n]\n[Optimizing RWKV for \nHardware Acceleration,text width=9em\n]\n]\n]\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: models, including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), have achieved significant success in areas such as image recognition  [ref]3 , speech recognition   , and natural language processing  .
