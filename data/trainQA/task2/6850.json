While recent 3D image synthesis techniques like Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)  have opened up new applications for 3D content production    at scale, their ability to enable precise and localized editing of object shapes and colors remains a challenge for broader adoption. Often time, a more localized and granular editing of 3D objects, especially attaching or removing certain objects of certain styles, is still difficult and costly in spite of several recent attempts at 3D object editing  [ref]18 [ref]21 [ref]35 0. (a) bulldozer (original) (b) twinkle bulldozer (c) bulldozer in glass (d) bulldozer frame Previous attempts, such as EditNeRF [ref]18 and NeRF-Editing 0, only offer limited and non-versatile editing options, while Text2Mesh [ref]21 and TANGO  allow only simple texture and shallow shape transformations of entire 3D objects. CLIP-NeRF [ref]35 propose a generative method with disentangled conditional NeRF for object editing but it requires a large volume of training data for the targeted editing category and is hard to edit only the desired part of objects locally. They present an additional approach, fine-tuning a single NeRF per scene with a CLIP-driven objective, which can edit object appearance but not shape well. To achieve effective and practical localized editing of 3D objects by any text prompts at scale, it is necessary to apply style changes to specific portions of the object, including selectively changing color and locally adding and removing densities, as shown in Figure 1. In this study, we propose a novel method for localized object editing that allows modification of 3D objects by text prompts, enabling full stylization including density-based localized editing. We believe that relying on the simple fine-tuning of a single NeRF to generate new densities in the low initial density area or to alter existing densities through a CLIP-driven objective is inadequate for achieving complete stylization of shapes and colors. Instead, our approach involves parameterizing specific regions in the implicit 3D volumetric representations and blending the original 3D object representation with an editable NeRF architecture specifically trained to render the blended image naturally. We use a pretrained vision-language method like CLIPSeg  to specify the area to be modified in the text input workflow. The proposed method is based on a novel layered NeRF architecture, called Blending-NeRF, which includes a pretrained NeRF and an editable NeRF.\nThere are some studies that employ multiple NeRFs and train them simultaneously to individually reconstruct the static and dynamic components of a dynamic scene    . On the other hand, our approach introduces an additional NeRF to facilitate text-based modifications in specific regions of a pretrained static scene. These modifications encompass various editing operations, including color changes, density addition, and density removal. By blending density and color from the two NeRFs, we can achieve fine-grained localized editing of 3D objects. In summary, our contributions include: We propose the novel Blending-NeRF architecture that combines a pretrained NeRF with an editable NeRF using various objectives and training techniques. This approach allows to naturally edit the specific regions of 3D objects while preserving their original appearance. We introduce new blending operations that capture the degree of density addition, density removal, and color alteration. Thanks to these blending operations, our method allows for precisely targeting the specific regions for localized editing and constraining the degree of object editing. We conduct several experiments involving text-guided 3D object editing, such as editing of shape and color, and compare our approach to previous attempts and their simple extensions, showing that Blending-NeRF is both qualitatively and quantitatively superior.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: and granular editing of 3D objects, especially attaching or removing certain objects of certain styles, is still difficult and costly in spite of several recent attempts at 3D object editing  [ref]18 [ref]21 [ref]35 0.
