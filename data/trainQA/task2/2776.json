Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Zero-shot Natural Language Video Localization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFollowing¬†[ref]39 [ref]43, we use two datasets, Charades-STA¬† and ActivityNet-Captions¬†, for the NLVL task not using the annotation for training but only for evaluations.\nWe provide a pre-trained Faster R-CNN¬† trained with 1,600 object categories of Visual Genome dataset¬† that is used in¬† as an object detector, and Flicker-description corpus¬†5 as a language corpus.\nFurther details are in the supplement.\n Following , we compare the results in two types of metrics: (1) Recall at various intersection over union thresholds (R@tIoU). It measures percentage of predictions that have larger IoU than the thresholds (we use threshold values of {0.3, 0.5, 0.7}). (2) mean intersection over union (mIoU), which is an averaged temporal IoU between the predicted and the ground-truth region. Following¬†[ref]39 [ref]43, we extract visual features for each frame using the pre-trained I3D¬† and C3D models¬†, respectively.\nTo make the video features fixed-length, we uniformly sample 128 features from a video.\nFor the temporal event proposal, we use k=5ùëò5k=5 for kùëòk-means clustering algorithm for both datasets.\nWe provide a detailed analysis for different kùëòk in the supplement. For generating pseudo-queries, we samples top-5 objects from the object detector and top-3 verbs from VerbBERT to make a simplified pseudo-query.\nWe investigate the effect of different number of nouns and verbs in the supplementary material. To train the VerbBERT, we fine-tune RoBERTa¬† with the Flicker-description corpus. We match the size of pseudo-supervision data to that of the original supervision, otherwise stated (Sec.4.2).\nThe same-sized supervision makes ours largely comparable to the ones with stronger supervisions.\nWe use ŒªùúÜ\\lambda = 1.0 as a balancing parameter between losses in Eq.(¬†1). As this is the first work to address zero-shot NLVL, we consider various baselines including 1) predicting random region (Random), and ablated methods from PSVL such as a model trained with 2) random query with the proposed temporal event proposal (Rnd.Q+TEP), 3) pseudo-query on random temporal regions (PQ+Rnd.T), 4) pseudo-query only with the ‚Äògrounded nouns‚Äô (random verbs) on the TEP (PQ.N+TEP) and 5) pseudo-query only with the ‚Äòinferred verbs‚Äô (random nouns) on the TEP (PQ.V+TEP).\nWe use the same NLVL model (Sec.¬†3.3). As references, we further present performance of several state-of-the-art weakly-supervised methods such as TGA¬†[ref]38, WSLLN¬†, and SCN¬†, and fully-supervised methods such as CTRL¬† and LGI¬†[ref]39.\nNote that the weakly-supervised methods¬†[ref]38   are trained with more expensive supervision (aligned pairs of descriptions and temporal regions of a video), whereas ours do not use such paired annotations.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: Following¬†[ref]39 [ref]43, we use two datasets, Charades-STA¬† and ActivityNet-Captions¬†, for the NLVL task not using the annotation for training but only for evaluations.\nWe provide a pre-trained Faster R-CNN\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
