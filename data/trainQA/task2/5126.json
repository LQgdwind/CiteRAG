Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

It has been exploited in other tasks including player detection , player tracking , team activity recognition . Traditional methods for automatic player classification rely on the combination of color histograms (RGB¬†, L‚àóa‚àób‚àó¬†, L‚àóu‚àóv‚àó¬†) and clustering algorithms (kùëòk-means¬†[ref]45, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)¬†, Basic Sequential Algorithmic Scheme (BSAS)¬†). A more recent supervised approach [ref]23 performs a semantic segmentation of players that learns a separation embedding between the teams in the field. In comparison with this method, our method does not rely on pixel-level annotations for training the network. Another recent approach  trains an embedding network for team player discrimination using a triplet loss for contrastive learning. Contrary to this approach, our method works on partial views of the field and not only clusters the two majority classes (players from team 1 and team 2) but also considers minority classes (referees and goalkeepers).\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: , team activity recognition .
