      "content": "Paper Title: Data Streaming and Traffic Gathering in Mesh-based NoC for Deep Neural Network Acceleration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDNN processing involves tens of layers and a large number of MAC operations using millions of parameters, which imposes tremendous throughput and energy-efficiency challenges to the computing platforms. Recently, spatial DNN accelerators like [ref]16   are gaining attention, as they are optimized to handle DNN processing effectively. Commonly used in FPGA and ASIC based designs  [ref]16  , spatial architectures use a distributed approach, which adopts a large number of PEs, each having its own control logic and limited local memory and shared global memory. Communication between PEs is allowed, which enables the data movement between them. In the design of a DNN accelerator, a major consideration is optimizing data movement, which aims to minimize the global memory access, and thereby reduce the power consumption during DNN processing. The dataflow determines the processing order, as well as where data is stored and reused, i.e., the way how data (i.e., inputs, weights, and partial sums) communication happens between the PE and memory element. In the literature, various dataflow models have been proposed , including Weight Stationary (WS), Output Stationary (OS), Row Stationary(RS), and No Local Reuse (NLR); each of them has its own memory usage and energy advantages. In the WS model [ref]16, weights are stationary at the PEs, while the inputs and partial sums move through the PEs and the memory element. On the contrary, the OS model has the output stationary at the PEs, while the inputs and weights move . The NLR model  focuses on increasing the size of the global buffer at the expense of a register file, and thus decrease the DRAM accesses. The RS model increases the reuse of all data types rather than focusing on the reuse of one type. DNN workloads contain different types of communication traffic that manages the data movement, such as partial sums, weights, and inputs streams to and from the memory. In a DNN accelerator , data movement is expensive in terms of energy, consuming around 50% of the total energy. In some cases, data movement can even increase the latency  due to the communication bottleneck. Although a bus-only based system has been proposed in some prior work, this kind of system will quickly become a bottleneck when the DNN size increases . This observation leads to the works focused on the NoC architecture, and communication support of DNN accelerators    [ref]26  . Various studies have been done in NoC topology to accelerate a DNN workload    . In , a hierarchical Neu-NoC architecture that adopts a hybrid ring-mesh topology. Multiple PEs are connected in a group of rings connected via a mesh topology is proposed. This structure reduces the communication distance and shows better performance against the bus and tree structures. Other research  propose, a reconfigurable topology for a 3D neural network accelerator that can be reconfigured as a tree to handle the multicast traffic. A many-core system SpiNNaker is proposed to simulate spiking neural networks with torus network topology. In , the study looks at different topologies and concludes that the mesh NoC is better for realizing spiking neural networks, compared with the tree, point-to-point, and bus-based structures. In , a fat tree and a mesh are used for intrachip communication and data movement among chips, respectively. The separation of intrachip and interchip communication may create a bottleneck for the gather traffic abundant in a DNN workload. Changes in the NoC topology also cause a change in the communication cost and support of different traffic patterns. Another study  proposes a mesh-based interconnection network called a hierarchical mesh network for DNN processing. The PEs and memory elements are grouped into a cluster, which is then connected via the hierarchical mesh network. The NoC is capable of configuring the network topology based on the needs. The NeuronLink  is a chip-to-chip interconnection network for large neural networks that support both interchip and intrachip communication. Each chip consists of 16 PEs in a mesh topology, and 4 such chips are connected in a star topology to handle a large amount of unicast and multicast traffic. Various routing methods are adopted to fulfill the communication needs, especially multicast and gather traffic, in a DNN accelerator. Research in  adopts XY routing for unicast traffic and a table-based routing for multicast traffic. However, another study  proposes different NoC configurations for each datatype i.e, input activation, weights, and partial sums. Further, this method is suitable for an RS dataflow architecture, where partial sums are accumulated across multiple PEs, and hence, not suitable to perform gather for unique partial sums across the PEs, which exist in an OS dataflow architecture. Other research  proposes an array of microswitches that are configured to handle different kinds of DNN traffic by creating a tree. In ClosNN [ref]26, one or more layers can be conducted on the network by mapping the neurons (PEs) on the input/output ports. Various stages of switching are done in order to connect the input and output ports in ClosNN, depending on the type of data traffic. Since the field of DNNs is evolving rapidly, hardware design should also be able to maintain this pace. As widely adopted NoC topology, mesh is used in most of the recently proposed DNN accelerators     . As many-to-one and one-to-many traffic are not inherently supported in a mesh topology, one-to-many has many solutions  that can be well adapted to DNN workloads, but many-to-one does not have an efficient method. Recent work modifies the topology to simulate a tree or Clos network [ref]26  to support many-to-one traffic, while other work   models this traffic as repetitive unicast (RU). In this work, we focus on providing communication support to this traffic on a mesh topology rather than proposing an alternate topology.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: large number of MAC operations using millions of parameters, which imposes tremendous throughput and energy-efficiency challenges to the computing platforms.
