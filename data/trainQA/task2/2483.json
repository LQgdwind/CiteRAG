      "content": "Paper Title: Reinforcement Learning with Formal Performance Metrics for Quadcopter Attitude Control under Non-nominal Contexts\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe first three algorithms we are discussing in Section¬†7, DDPG , SAC [ref]4 and TD3  are all off-policy, actor-critic methods, which are generally considered to be better suited for control applications in robotics  (DDPG is used for instance in ). Because of its effectiveness in practice, observed by many authors, e.g. [ref]15 for attitude control, we also compare with the on-policy\nProximal Policy Optimisation [ref]12, also used for similar applications in\n and\nin . DDPG is the historical method for continuous observation and action space applications to control, SAC and TD3 being improvements of DDPG. For instance,\nSAC regularizes the reward with an entropy term that is supposed to reduce the need to fine hyper-parameter tuning. Let us now describe the training mechanism: we call query signal the function describing the prescribed angular rates at any given time. We model this signal by a constant plateau, of magnitude chosen randomly between -0.6 and 0.6 radians per second, and duration chosen randomly between 0.1 and 1 second. We are training over a time window of 1 second (a training episode) during which the query signal is a constant plateau followed by a value of 0 until the end of the episode.\nWe chose to report on training where these query signals are used independently on pitch, roll and yaw. We tested joint queries as well but do not report specifically the corresponding results since we observed no significant difference. Controls are updated every 0.03 seconds, and we simulate the full state of the quadrotor, using a Runge Kutta of order 4 on Equation¬†1 with a time step of 0.01 seconds. The evaluation of the controller is made on similar query signals, but on time windows that last 20 seconds, with a query signal generated according to a more general class of queries (see below).\nQuery signals on such longer time windows could also be considered for training : [ref]15 refers to this approach as ‚Äùcontinuous mode‚Äù and reports much poorer performance compared to the ‚Äùepisodic mode‚Äù with 1 second queries. We therefore decided to report only on episodic mode training. Such query classes are characterised by three distributions Aùê¥A, Dùê∑D and SùëÜS for respectively the amplitude and duration of stable plateaus, and the step amplitude between successive stable plateaus. These distributions are the same for each axis.\nWe define three different classes of queries (where U(a,b) denotes the Uniform distribution of support [a,b]):\neasy (A = U(-0.2, 0.2), D = U(0.5, 0.8), S = U(0, 0.3)),\nmedium (A = U(-0.4, 0.4), D = U(0.2, 0.5), S = U(0, 0.6)) and\nhard (A = U(-0.6, 0.6), D = U(0.1, 0.2), S = U(0, 0.9)).\nOur query generator actually changes the joint distribution of amplitude and duration of stable plateaus by filtering out those queries which would make the roll, pitch and yaw go through singular values in the Euler angles description of the dynamics.\n The initial states are sampled in rather large intervals of values. These values as well as\nthe maximal magnitudes of states are given in Table¬†2:\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: The first three algorithms we are discussing in Section¬†7, DDPG , SAC [ref]4 and TD3  are all off-policy, actor-critic methods, which are generally considered to be better suited for control applications in robotics  (DDPG is used for instance in ).

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
