      "content": "Paper Title: AutoDFP: Automatic Data-Free Pruning via Channel Similarity Reconstruction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTable II and Table III show the pruning result of VGG-16/19 , ResNet-56/50 [ref]29 and MobileNet-V1  on the CIFAR-10 datasets. Note that the reported experimental results represent the average outcomes obtained from 5 separate experiments on one NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti.\nWe contrast our approach proposed with the data-free pruning method Neuron Merging , DFPC [ref]22, and a generative-based data-free pruning method DFNP [ref]19.\nDue to the disparate hardware platforms employed in our experiments and those of the comparative study, direct comparison of inference speeds for pruned models proves challenging. Consequently, we employ the FLOPs preserved ratio as a metric to gauge inference speed. As shown in Table II, in comparison to Neuron Merging , our method achieves a substantial improvement in accuracy on both ResNet-56 and MobileNet-V1 models with the same preserved ratios of parameters.\nOn the ResNet-56 network, with a parameter preserved ratio of 60%, our method outperforms Neuron Merging by 8.92% in accuracy (85.48% vs. 76.56%). Meanwhile, on the MobileNet-V1 network, our experiments tested parameter preserved ratios ranging from 40% to 20%. It is worth noting that with such low preserved ratios, our method does not incur any loss in accuracy. Furthermore, Table III presents a comparison of our method with the recent data-free pruning method DFPC [ref]22 and generative-based data-free pruning method DFNP [ref]19.\nAcross the VGG-16, VGG-19, and ResNet-50 networks, it is evident that under the same or reduced number of FLOPs, our pruning outcomes exhibit comparatively minor accuracy degradation when contrasted with DFNP and DFPC.\nOn the VGG-16 network, our method achieves higher accuracy (-0.76% vs. -1.01%) and fewer FLOPs (64.3% vs. 67.7%) compared to the DFNP.\nMeanwhile, on the VGG-19 network, our method achieves pruned networks with fewer FLOPs and parameters, and higher accuracy compared to DFNP and DFPC methods.\nNotably, particularly on the ResNet-50 network, our approach demonstrates exceptional performance when compared to the DFPC method, regardless of whether this method involves coupled channel pruning (DFPC and DFPCCPsubscriptDFPCCP\\text{DFPC}_{\\text{CP}}).\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: Table II and Table III show the pruning result of VGG-16/19 , ResNet-56/50 [ref]29 and MobileNet-V1  on the CIFAR-10 datasets.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
