      "content": "Paper Title: Speedup deep learning models on GPU by taking advantage of efficient unstructured pruning and bit-width reduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve some of the best results in various artificial intelligence tasks including image processing [ref]3, [ref]4 or natural language processing [ref]6. Deep neural networks for running training and inference process on large datasets need specialised accelerators such as GPGPUs or other dedicated hardware accelerators. Over the years, scientists have been looking for methods to accelerate the calculations of the convolution operation. The direct convolution algorithm to perform convolutions requires N2superscriptùëÅ2N^{2} multiplications and N(N-1) additions where N is the size of the input. For the same input the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method reduces operation complexity to O(Nl‚Äão‚Äãg2ùëôùëúsubscriptùëî2log_{2}(N)) . The Winograd algorithm is suitable for small fixed-size kernels and requires 2.25 times fewer multiplications than direct convolution . The convolution operation can be realised by matrix-multiplication , especially on the GPGPU which is highly tuned for performing this operation . The NVIDIA deep neural network library (cuDNN)111https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn performs convolution with different algorithms (Winograd, FFT and GEMM) depending upon filter size, batch size and data representation. Apart from choosing different algorithms for speeding up convolution there are some other algorithms based on complexity and memory footprint reduction. Some CNN models for image processing, natural language processing or other task can be heavily pruned and theirs weights and activations bit-width can be reduced.\nDepending upon the level of sparsity, it can be worth performing the convolution through the application of the direct sparse convolution method proposed by Chen  and extended by ≈ªurek et al. . The work concentrates on two main issues. The first is about methods for complexity reduction. It explains pruning and quantisation methodologies on chosen CNN models and theirs results. The second is focused on investigating when it is worth using sparse operations, instead of using dedicated NVIDIA libraries to run the convolution layer. As the main optimization strategy we propose the introduction of a unified sparse level for each of the output channels in each convolutional layer. The second strategy is determining the most optimal number of thread blocks for each convolutional layer separately. The presented approach is optimized towards the optimal arrangement of the data in order to obtain speedup with the direct convolution approach using the sparse format. These steps are crucial for achieving optimal efficiency. This work shows real examples of CNN models where it is possible to obtain the high level of sparsity so that acceleration using the presented algorithm vs cuDnn could be possible. These examples are well known CNN models like VGG and Resnet-50 architectures used on smaller and less complex data sets. The high sparsity levels were obtained by the presented pruning approach. Apart from achieving a high sparsity the accuracy levels were also improved. Finally, the impact on time efficiency of using half precision (FP-16) in a direct sparse convolution is explored. It is compared with cuDnn, where for 16-bit data representation, NVIDIA Tensor Cores specialised arithmetic units are used. In the presented work both linear and nonlinear approaches of quantisation were applied on pretrained and pruned models. To our knowledge, this is the first work that shows the acceleration of the unstructured sparsity of weights compared to the dense approach using real models with highly optimized direct sparse convolution algorithm.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve some of the best results in various artificial intelligence tasks including image processing [ref]3, [ref]4 or natural language processing [ref]6.
