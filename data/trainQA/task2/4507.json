      "content": "Paper Title: Proof-of-Learning is Currently More Broken Than You Think\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nJia et al. [ref]2 define a spoof as any proof that passes verification and requires lesser computation to obtain than honest training would (see Table III in Appendix A for the full list of spoof categories they introduce). One of the key contributions of this paper is to analyze why, if at all, such spoofs exist. For now, we briefly review spoofing schemes known in the literature. 1. Sequence Inversion [ref]2:\nWe assume an adversary has access to WTsubscript𝑊𝑇W_{T} and the data used to train the model, but not to 𝕀𝕀\\mathbb{I} or 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A}. Here, an adversary aims to invert gradient descent: given WTsubscript𝑊𝑇W_{T}, find a corresponding WT−1subscript𝑊𝑇1W_{T-1} that was used to obtain it. The authors show that such a process is difficult due to the increasing entropy as training progresses and that it is computationally lower bounded by the cost of honest training. 2. Directed Retraining [ref]2: Under the same assumptions as (1), an adversary employing this strategy aims to either create (a) structurally correct proofs i.e., spoofs that pass verification by generating invalid updates or (b) shorter ones by artificially directing the weights to WTsubscript𝑊𝑇W_{T} quicker. The authors showed that unless the entire proof was valid, any discontinuities produced by methods in (a), e.g., concatenating proofs, would be detected by a verification mechanism that checked the few largest updates first. They also argued that approaches in (b) require custom training algorithms (e.g., regularizers, loss functions, etc.) with direct knowledge of the desired final weights WTsubscript𝑊𝑇W_{T}, and thus would fail verification. 3. Adversarial Examples for PoL: Zhang et al.  introduce two techniques to generate shorter structurally correct spoofs (see Section IV-A in Jia et al. [ref]2), based on evasion   (i.e., perturbing inputs to create adversarial examples which result in erroneous model predictions). These strategies assume the adversary has access to WTsubscript𝑊𝑇W_{T} and the data that was used to obtain the proof, but no other information. Herein, we define 𝒰k​(Wi,Xi)subscript𝒰𝑘subscript𝑊𝑖subscript𝑋𝑖\\mathcal{U}_{k}(W_{i},X_{i}) to represent the update to go from Wisubscript𝑊𝑖W_{i} to Wi+ksubscript𝑊𝑖𝑘W_{i+k} with data Xisubscript𝑋𝑖X_{i}. We utilize W^^𝑊\\hat{W} to denote a weight created by the adversary. 3.1. Synthetic Adversarial Update: The objective of the adversary is to create synthetic data X^^𝑋\\hat{X} such that, w.l.o.g, the following is possible: W^t+n=𝒰n​(W^t,X^)subscript^𝑊𝑡𝑛subscript𝒰𝑛subscript^𝑊𝑡^𝑋\\hat{W}_{t+n}=\\mathcal{U}_{n}(\\hat{W}_{t},\\hat{X}). The synthetic data X^^𝑋\\hat{X} is termed an “adversarial example” by the authors. Since generating these adversarial examples requires additional computation, the adversary only performs T^−1^𝑇1\\hat{T}-1 steps of legitimate training with T^≪Tmuch-less-than^𝑇𝑇\\hat{T}\\ll T leaving enough computation for the single step from W^T^−1subscript^𝑊^𝑇1\\hat{W}_{\\hat{T}-1} to WTsubscript𝑊𝑇W_{T} so that the overall computation is still lesser than honest training. This is their “Attack 1”. However, the authors only conceptually describe the attack and do not evaluate it because they find it is difficult for the optimization to converge. Despite our best efforts, we also failed to have our implementation of this strategy converge and synthesize data that satisfies the adversary’s objective. Thus, given that Zhang et al.  do not provide evidence that this attack strategy can succeed for the adversary, we will later provide an intuition as to why “Attack 1” is unlikely to succeed, but we do not consider it further in our work. 3.2. Synthetic Checkpoint Initialization: Zhang et al. also propose a technique to choose intermediary weights that exploit the threshold δ𝛿\\delta picked by the verifier. Recall that this threshold allows the verifier to tolerate noise induced by stochasticity in SGD. The adversary can choose pairs of weights W^tsubscript^𝑊𝑡\\hat{W}_{t} and W^t+ksubscript^𝑊𝑡𝑘\\hat{W}_{t+k} such that d​(W^t,W^t+k)≪δmuch-less-than𝑑subscript^𝑊𝑡subscript^𝑊𝑡𝑘𝛿d(\\hat{W}_{t},\\hat{W}_{t+k})\\ll\\delta, ∀t,kfor-all𝑡𝑘\\forall t,k, for example, by linearly interpolating between a chosen W^0subscript^𝑊0\\hat{W}_{0} and WTsubscript𝑊𝑇W_{T}. The authors also propose techniques to minimize the distance d​(W^0,WT)𝑑subscript^𝑊0subscript𝑊𝑇d(\\hat{W}_{0},W_{T}) between the model initialization and final weights which naturally further minimizes each intermediate update distance d​(W^t,W^t+k)𝑑subscript^𝑊𝑡subscript^𝑊𝑡𝑘d(\\hat{W}_{t},\\hat{W}_{t+k}). To achieve this, data X^^𝑋\\hat{X} is initialized with training data and perturbed such that d​(W^t,𝒰k​(W^t,X^))≈0≪δ𝑑subscript^𝑊𝑡subscript𝒰𝑘subscript^𝑊𝑡^𝑋0much-less-than𝛿d(\\hat{W}_{t},\\mathcal{U}_{k}(\\hat{W}_{t},\\hat{X}))\\approx 0\\ll\\delta (note that, semantically, the data is synthesized to obtain “small” updates instead of the “correct” updates as in Attack 1); this results in d​(W^t+k,𝒰k​(W^t,X^))≪δmuch-less-than𝑑subscript^𝑊𝑡𝑘subscript𝒰𝑘subscript^𝑊𝑡^𝑋𝛿d(\\hat{W}_{t+k},\\mathcal{U}_{k}(\\hat{W}_{t},\\hat{X}))\\ll\\delta as d​(W^t,W^t+k)≪δmuch-less-than𝑑subscript^𝑊𝑡subscript^𝑊𝑡𝑘𝛿d(\\hat{W}_{t},\\hat{W}_{t+k})\\ll\\delta and thus passes verification. The authors call this “Attack 2”.111The authors also introduced “Attack 3”, which is a more computationally efficient, yet conceptually similar implementation of Attack 2. Given that the two achieve the same performance, we exclusively consider Attack 2 in Section 6.1.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Jia et al. [ref]2 define a spoof as any proof that passes verification and requires lesser computation to obtain than honest training would (see Table III in Appendix A for the full list of spoof categories\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
