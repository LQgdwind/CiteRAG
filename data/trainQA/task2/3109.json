      "content": "Paper Title: High Quality Segmentation for Ultra High-resolution Images\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the rapid development of camera and display equipment, the resolution of images is getting higher and higher, where 4K and 6K resolutions become common. It gives different chances in portrait photo post-processing, industrial defect detection, medical diagnose, etc. However, ultra high-resolution images also bring challenges to the classical image segmentation methods. First, the significant number of input pixels is computationally expensive and GPU memory-hungry. Second, most existing methods up-sample the final prediction for 4 to 8 times through interpolation [ref]44 [ref]47  [ref]5 , without building fine-grained details on output masks. Previous segmentation refinement methods include those of    . They still target at images with 1K∼similar-to\\sim2K resolutions. Work of   handles ultra high-resolution refinement based on low-resolution masks generated from classic segmentation algorithms. They utilize cascade-scheme in decoder to upsample intermediate refinement results in several resolution stages until reaching the target resolution. They are still time-consuming due to working in discrete style on predefined resolution stages of decoder. We instead consider continuity to make the decoding more efficient and more friendly to the learning of up-sampling resolution. We propose the Continuous Refinement Model (CRM) to exploit continuity. The coarse mask is from low-resolution segmentation. In order to expand it further, the problem is similar to a classical super-resolution (SR) task. Other than classical SR methods, constructing continuous local representation is proposed . We note that utilizing implicit function  to handle high-resolution segmentation refinement is not trivial. First, the resolution of the training image in our task is around 500, while the training image for SR is with 2K resolution. The training strategy to down-sample the input to SR would make our input mask tiny and meaningless. Second, more multi-level semantic features are needed compared with super-resolution configuration. Third, there exists a resolution gap between training on low-resolution and testing on ultra high-resolution. Therefore, this task needs specific designs. To realize the continuity in ultra high-resolution segmentation refinement, we first propose Continuous Alignment Module (CAM) to align the feature and refinement target continuously (different from utilizing the cascade scheme in decoder). In CAM, the coordinates of feature and refinement target are transferred into a continuous space. We then align position and feature based on the continuous coordinate. An implicit function combines position information and aligned latent image feature to predict the segmentation label for the queried pixel on images. Here, the pixel-wise implicit function models the relationship between continuous position and prediction and realizes image-aware refinement by latent feature. Overall, this design is simpler and lighter than the cascade-based decoder, but generates more precise refinement mask as Fig. 1. In addition, there is a resolution gap between low-resolution training images and ultra high-resolution testing ones. In cascade-decoder-based methods  , convolution always covering a fixed size neighbor patch under the training resolution reduces its generalization to other testing resolutions. However, implicit function in CRM is in pixel-wise extracted feature without this bias. Also, in our multi-resolution inference strategy, low-resolution input is inferred first. Then we increase the input resolution to generate more details in the refined mask. Working with a multi-resolution inference strategy, CRM realizes stronger generalization ability than previous methods . In experiments, our CRM achieves better performance and infers more than twice as fast as previous state-of-the-art methods in the ultra high-resolution segmentation refinement task. Our main contribution is the following. We propose a general Continuous Refinement Model (CRM). It introduces an implicit function that utilizes continuous position information and continuously aligns latent image feature in ultra high-resolution segmentation refinement. Without a cascade-based decoder, we effectively reduce computation cost and yet reconstruct more details. CRM with multi-resolution inference is suitable for using low-resolution training images and ultra high-resolution testing images. Due to the simple design, even with refining from low- to high-resolution, the total inference time is less than half of CascadePSP . In experiments, CRM yields the best segmentation results on ultra high-resolution images. It also helps boost the performance of state-of-the-art panoptic segmentation models without fine-tuning.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: First, the significant number of input pixels is computationally expensive and GPU memory-hungry.
