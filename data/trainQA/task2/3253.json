The estimation is done either through Bayesian probabilistic approaches [ref]28 or Monte-Carlo sampling based methods [ref]25, with the uncertainty encoded in the posterior distribution of model prediction. The Bayesian probabilistic approach model the parameter of neural network with probabilistic distributions, based on which uncertainties are analytically computed . Simplification and approximation is needed to make the computation tractable in the process [ref]28. The approach require modification of the network optimization process, and additional efforts is needed to integrate them into existing deep neural network architectures. Probabilistic light weight neural network  simplifies the previous models by adopting a partial probabilistic approach. The model requires minimal modification on existing networks, and proved effective for modeling uncertainty from data. Monte-Carlo based approaches is another major branch of uncertainty estimation methods. Researchers found existing techniques such as dropout  and ensemble models [ref]25 could imply useful information on prediction uncertainty. Dropout base approaches  adopt dropout operation during test time for uncertainty estimation, which can be seen as modeling parameters in network to be Bernoulli distributed. Ensemble based approaches [ref]25 estimates the posterior of model predictions by sampling on the differently trained neural networks. These Monte-Carlo based approaches effectively capture the uncertainty lies in model parameters. These models have been applied recently for uncertainty estimation in fields such as gravitational lensing of astrophysics , biomarker quantification  and diagnosis of kidney injury .\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: Uncertainty estimation is being actively explored in machine learning with important applications in fields such as auto driving and robotics [ref]25[ref]26.
