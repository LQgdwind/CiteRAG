      "content": "Paper Title: Information-Theoretic Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization with Continuous Approximations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA large number of real-world engineering and scientific design problems involve optimizing multiple expensive black-box functions with continuous approximations (also called as fidelities) which vary in accuracy and resource cost. For example, in rocket launching research, the goal is to find designs that trade-off return time and angular distance using continuous-fidelity simulators which trade-off accuracy of evaluation and simulation time by varying the tolerance parameter. Solving these problems require finding the optimal Pareto set of design inputs (as all objectives cannot be optimized simultaneously) while minimizing the total resource cost of function evaluations. For solving such expensive blackbox optimization problems, Bayesian optimization (BO)    [ref]15  is an effective framework. BO methods intelligently select the sequence of inputs for evaluation using the following three key elements: 1) Surrogate statistical model learned from past function evaluations data, e.g., Gaussian process (GP); 2) Acquisition function parametrized by the statistical model to score usefulness of evaluating different inputs, e.g., expected improvement (EI); and 3) Acquisition function optimization to select the best input for function evaluation in each BO iteration. There are two broad categories of acquisition functions in the BO literature: myopic family accounts for local utility of improvement, e.g., EI; and non-myopic family relying on global utility for solving the optimization problem when evaluating a candidate input, e.g., predictive entropy search . Recent work has shown the theoretical and practical benefits of non-myopic acquisition functions over myopic ones   6. In this paper, we propose a novel approach referred as information-Theoretic Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization with Continuous Approximations (iMOCA) to solve multi-objective optimization problems using continuous-fidelity function evaluations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study this continuous fidelity in the multi-objective setting within the ML literature. The key idea behind iMOCA is to select the sequence of candidate input and fidelity-vector pairs for evaluation which maximize the information gained per unit cost about the optimal Pareto front (i.e., non-myopic acquisition function). To efficiently compute entropy, which is an important step for iMOCA, we develop two qualitatively different approximations that make different trade-offs in terms of computation-time and accuracy.\niMOCA extends the single-fidelity multi-objective algorithm MESMO () and its discrete-fidelity version ([ref]7) to the more general continuous-fidelity setting. Contributions. We make the following specific contributions. Development of a principled information-theoretic approach referred as iMOCA to solve multi-objective blackbox optimization problems using continuous function approximations.\nProviding two qualitatively different approximations for iMOCA. Experimental evaluation on diverse synthetic and real-world benchmark problems to demonstrate the effectiveness of iMOCA over existing single-fidelity MO algorithms and a naive continuous-fidelity MO approach.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: cannot be optimized simultaneously) while minimizing the total resource cost of function evaluations.
