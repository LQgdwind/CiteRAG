      "content": "Paper Title: Approximate Evaluation of Quantitative Second Order Queries\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCourcelle’s celebrated theorem  establishes\nthat all problems expressible in monadic second order logic (MSO2) can be solved\nin linear time on graph classes of bounded treewidth.\nIts modern formulations   strengthen this result to problems expressible in LinECMSO2, i.e., optimization problems where for a given CMSO2 formula111The framework is often referred to as “LinEMSO”, but here we opt to consciously include the “C” to emphasize that the framework supports CMSO formulas 4 [ref]12. with free set variables,\none asks for a satisfying assignment of the free variables that optimizes a given linear function.\nTogether with the variant for LinECMSO1-definable problems on graph classes of bounded cliquewidth ,\nthese famous results are considered the\narchetype of algorithmic meta-theorems—universal theorems that establish the\ntractability of a broad range of computational problems on structured inputs. While CMSO extends MSO with the ability to compare set sizes modulo a fixed constant,\nthe arguably largest drawback of the formalism is the inability\nto compare set sizes in the standard (i.e., non-modular) arithmetic.\nThis prevents the framework from capturing problems that make statements about set sizes beyond simple maximization or minimization,\nsuch as Equitable Coloring  , Capacitated Vertex Cover  or Bounded Degree Vertex Deletion 6.\nAnd indeed, this is for good reason: there are well-established lower bounds that exclude the\nfixed-parameter tractable evaluation of even very simple queries with size\ncomparisons when parameterized by the treewidth and query size. But while the\nassociated reductions rule out the possibility of handling exact statements\nabout set sizes, in many cases of interest (and especially those motivated by\npractical applications) it would be more than sufficient to compare them in an\napproximate sense. Numerous extensions of LinECMSO have been\nproposed that incorporate some degree of access to set\nsizes [34, Subsection 1.2] and which trade greater expressive power for, e.g., weaker notions of tractability.\nIn this work, we provide a unifying investigation whether—and to\nwhat extent—one can strengthen Courcelle’s theorem\n(for LinECMSO on treewidth and cliquewidth) to also incorporate\nexact and approximate optimization and comparison of set sizes and weights in standard arithmetic.\nWe identify a clear trade-off between the tractability of a problem\nand the degree of approximation one allows.\nThis reproves many exact and approximate results in a unified framework\nand characterizes the complexity of many additional (exact and approximate)\nproblems on graphs of bounded treewidth or cliquewidth (presented in Section 5).\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: problems where for a given CMSO2 formula111The framework is often referred to as “LinEMSO”, but here we opt to consciously include the “C” to emphasize that the framework supports CMSO formulas 4 [ref]12. with free set variables,\none asks for a satisfying assignment of the free variables that optimizes a given linear function.\nTogether with the variant for LinECMSO1-definable problems on\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
