      "content": "Paper Title: AritPIM: High-Throughput In-Memory Arithmetic\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPartitions have recently emerged   as a simple modification to PIM architectures that vastly improves parallelism with a highly-unique computational model. The dynamically-controlled switches dividing the partitions in each array allow merging adjacent partitions to perform gates amongst data stored in different partitions. At the extreme cases, we find that disconnecting all switches (parallel) provides maximal parallelism but with minimal flexibility (each gate is constrained to a single partition), and connecting all switches (serial) provides minimal parallelism but with maximal flexibility (each gate can access all of the columns of the array). Semi-parallelism refers to the case where only some switches are connected, providing intermediate parallelism and flexibility, see Figure 5. The implementation of partitions has been discussed in the context of memristive PIM using transistors  , and should be applicable to DRAM PIM as well. Furthermore, partitions nearly attaining the model assumed in this paper are already included in a commercially-available SRAM processor . Counter-intuitively, the overhead required for the switches is rather minuscule in comparison to the array size  , with the more significant overhead being the periphery and control required to select all of the involved columns . Therefore, PartitionPIM  proposes a reduced set of semi-parallel operations that requires various patterns to significantly reduce such overhead; in AritPIM, we assume this reduced set (minimal model ). Partitions in arithmetic accelerate element-parallel algorithms by enabling multiple concurrent logic gates per function, see Figure 2(a). We assume in this section that k=N𝑘𝑁k=N (representation size is exactly the number of partitions)999The proposed algorithms can be trivially extended to any k>N𝑘𝑁k>N, and may also be generalized for the case of k<N𝑘𝑁k<N.. In this case, the inputs and outputs are stored in a strided format: e.g., 32-bit integers are stored with a single bit per partition. This enables O​(1)𝑂1O(1) latency for bitwise integer operations (e.g., integer OR of two 32-bit numbers) as all partitions operate in parallel. Arithmetic functions more complex than bitwise integer operations require semi-parallelism to share information between the different partitions. Only few works have explored bit-parallel arithmetic [ref]25 [ref]26.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: Arithmetic functions more complex than bitwise integer operations require semi-parallelism to share information between the different partitions.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
