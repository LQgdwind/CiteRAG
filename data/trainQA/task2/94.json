Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Sentiment Analysis Using Averaged Weighted Word Vector Features\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStanford IMDB dataset of reviews contains 100,000 movie reviews in English. 25,000 of these reviews are labeled as positive, the other 25,000 reviews are labeled as negative and the remaining 50,000 reviews are unlabeled. In fact, IMDB reviews are labeled numbers that are between 1 and 10. However, this dataset contains only reviews with 1 to 4 as negative and reviews with 7 to 10 as positive. Therefore, there are only two labels: positive and negative. For IMDB reviews, we produced word2vec and glove vectors from IMDB reviews. The length of the vectors is 300, and their window sizes are 5. We run our methods by using word2vec vectors(_wv) and glove vectors(_gl) separately and combined(_wvgl). Therefore, the number of features of our Averaged Review Vectors (ARV) and Weighted Averaged Review Vectors (WARV) is 300 for separate runs and 600 for combined runs. In the same manner, for our CNN model, the number of features is 300 (separate run) and 600 (combined run). As seen in Table 3, with % 94.286 accuracy, our WARV method has better accuracy values than N-Gram, RNNLM, and Mesnil’s paragraph vector. Also, our WARV method is computationally more efficient than Mesnil’s paragraph vectors (PV) (Mesnil et al.). When our weighted averaged review vectors (WARV) are ensembled with NBSVM, they reach an accuracy value % 95.02 as shown in Table 4. When we ensemble three methods, the best accuracy (% 95.032) is obtained by the ensemble of WARV, NBSVM, and CNN as shown in Table 4. Also, these two results are better than Mesnil’s results. When we ensemble four methods or five methods, the best accuracy is again % 95.032 as shown in Table 4. When we ensemble all six methods, accuracy becomes % 95.028. These results are nearly close to other results that were obtained by using Bidirectional Transformers BERT embeddings [ref]37 in some studies [ref]39 that reached % 96 accuracy. Note that we didn’t share the ensemble results of the combinations whose accuracies are below % 94 except for ensembles in Mesnil’s study.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: shown in Table 4. When we ensemble all six methods, accuracy becomes % 95.028. These results are nearly close to other results that were obtained by using Bidirectional Transformers BERT embeddings [ref]37 in some studies [ref]39 that reached % 96 accuracy. Note that we didn’t share the ensemble results of the combinations whose accuracies are below % 94 except for ensembles in Mesnil’s study.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. Generate exactly 40 titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning."
