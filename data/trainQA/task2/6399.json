      "content": "Paper Title: LaDe: The First Comprehensive Last-mile Delivery Dataset from Industry\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDriven by increasing urbanization and e-commerce development, last-mile delivery has emerged as a critical research area with growing interest from scholars and practitioners. Last-Mile Delivery, as illustrated in Figure 1, is the package transport process that connects the depot and the customers, including both the package pick-up   and delivery [ref]3  process. In addition to being a key to customer satisfaction, last-mile delivery is both the most expensive and time-consuming part of the shipping process  . Consequently, researchers from different fields, from logistics operation management to spatio-temporal data mining, have been consistently shedding light on problems in last-mile delivery in recent years. These problems include route planning  [ref]8 , Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) prediction 0 1 2, and route prediction 3 4 5, etc. A quick search for “last-mile delivery” on Google Scholar returns over 19,400 papers since 2018. Recent endeavors 0 1 2 focus on leveraging machine/deep learning techniques for problems in last-mile delivery research. A critical prerequisite for those researches is the availability of high-quality, large-scale datasets. Since such datasets have the potential to significantly accelerate advancements in specific fields, such as ImageNet 6 for computer vision and GLUE 7 for natural language processing. Nonetheless, in the domain of last-mile background research, a multitude of algorithms have been devised, but there is still an absence of a widely recognized, publicly accessible dataset. Consequently, research in this field has become concentrated within a limited number of industrial research laboratories, thereby restricting transparency and hindering research progress. Moreover, the lack of public datasets also poses a hurdle for industry practitioners to develop advanced algorithms for last-mile delivery. To meet the rising calling for a public dataset, we propose LaDe, the first comprehensive Last-mile Delivery dataset collected by Cainiao. It contains both package pick-up and delivery data as depicted in Figure 1. LaDe has several merits: (1) Large-scale, covering 10,677k packages of 21k couriers across 6 months. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest publicly available dataset. (2) Comprehensive, providing detailed information on package, location, task-event, and courier. (3) Diverse, collecting data from both pick-up and delivery processes across various cities. By virtue of these advantages, LaDe can be employed to evaluate a wide spectrum of last-mile-related tasks. In this paper, we investigate its properties by three tasks, including route prediction 3 4 5, estimated time of arrival prediction 0 1 2, and spatio-temporal graph forecasting 8 9 0. Beyond these tasks, it is easy to integrate some of the aforementioned features to support additional tasks. We believe that such a large-scale dataset like LaDe is a critical resource for developing advanced algorithms under the context of last-mile delivery, as well as for providing critical training and benchmarking data for learning-based algorithms. Overall, we identify three key contributions of this work: A New Dataset. We collect, process, and release LaDe. The dataset boasts large-scale, comprehensive, and diverse characteristics. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first exhaustive, industry-scale last-mile delivery dataset. The dataset is publicly accessible at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Cainiao-AI/LaDe. Comprehensive Data Analysis. Extensive data analysis is conducted to depict and highlight the properties of the dataset. Based on the analysis, we introduce potential tasks supported by LaDe, from logistics operation management to spatio-temporal data mining, and beyond. Benchmark on Real-World Tasks. We benchmark this dataset by performing three representative tasks, including service route prediction, estimated time of arrival prediction, and spatio-temporal graph forecasting. The source codes for these tasks are provided to promote research in this field. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses related work, and Section 3 introduces the details of the dataset, including the methodology used to construct the dataset, and the statistics and properties of the dataset. In Section 4, we benchmark the dataset on three tasks and discuss the potential use of the data in related research fields.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: and practitioners.
