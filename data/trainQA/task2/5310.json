      "content": "Paper Title: Evaluating Glyph Design for Showing Large-Magnitude-Range Quantum Spins\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAt least four perceptual and vision science theories have inspired our work: integral and separable dimensions , preattentive scene features    ,\nfeature ranking, and monotonicity . Integral and Separable Dimensions.\nGarner and Felfoldy’s seminal work on integral and separable dimensions  has inspired many visualization design guidelines.\nWare  suggests a continuum from more integral to more separable pairs:\n(red-green)-(yellow-blue), s​i​z​ex𝑠𝑖𝑧subscript𝑒𝑥size_{x}-s​i​z​ey𝑠𝑖𝑧subscript𝑒𝑦size_{y}, color-shape/size/orientation, motion-shape/size/orientation,\nmotion-color, and group position-color.\nHis subsequent award-winning bivariate study  using hue-size, hue-luminance, and hue-texton (texture)\nsupports the idea that more separable dimensions of hue-texton lead to higher accuracy.\nOur work follows the same ideas of quantifying integral and separable dimensions but differs from Ware’s texton selection in\ntwo important aspects.\nFirst,\nthe Ware study focuses on finding relationships between two\nindependent data variables. In contrast, ours demands\nparticipants to examine a complex scene for item discrimination when\nthe two variables are component parts of a vector magnitude.\nSecond, our texture uses the amount of black and white to show\nluminance variations, in contrast to the discrete shape variation in textons.\nWe anticipate that ours will be more suitable to continuous\nquantitative values so it is easier to compare large and small to divide the regions .\nNo existing work we know of has studied whether or not one of the separable features being categorical can facilitate global comparisons and can be scaled to large and more complex 3D vector magnitude analysis. Scene-Guidance and Feature Distance.\nIn order to recognize items, viewers do not “see” features and instead “bind” these features to objects. This binding studies how our visual systems separate object features such as shape, color, motion trajectories, sizes, and distances into the whole object .\n\nWhat we “see” also depends on our goals\nand expectations. Wolfe et al. propose the theory of “guided\nsearch” , a first attempt to incorporate users’ goals\ninto viewing.\nFor example, if the viewer’s goal is to search largest values, s/he can just check the yellow ones in Figure 2.\nWolfe et al.  further suggest that\ncolor, texture, size, and spatial frequency are among the most\neffective features in attracting the user’s attention. When we combine features together, Duncan and Humphreys articulate some of the most basic principles. In general, guidance to a target will be stronger when the feature differences between the target (T) and distractor (D) are larger (TD differences), and when the feature differences amongst distractors are smaller (DD similarity) .\nFor example, Ts are 2.3 (digit) and 2 (exponent) for 230 (2.3×1022.3superscript1022.3\\times 10^{2}). Ds include all numbers but 2.3 and 2.\nUsing the TD differences between features may explain why splitVectors was time\nconsuming.\nFor example, to compare 230 (2.3×1022.3superscript1022.3\\times 10^{2}) to 2,300 (2.3×1032.3superscript1032.3\\times 10^{3}),\nviewers have to differentiate the two lengths of 2 (T) and 3 (T) from other distractors (Ds other than 2 or 3).\nThe heterogeneity of Ds or small DD distances from 3D lengths may make the use of splitVectors challenging, thus introducing temporal cost. Preattentive and Attentive Feature Ranking. Human visual processing can be faster when it is preattentive. Wolfe called a feature preattentive when it guides attention in search and cannot be decomposed into simpler features .\nThe idea of preattentive pop-out has historically highlighted that a single object has been considered compelling because it captures the user’s attention against a background of other objects (e.g., in showing spatial highlights 0).\nVisual features such as orientation and color (hue, saturation, lightness) can generate pop-out effects\n 1. This type of pop-out was also used visualizations. For example, Ropinski, Oeltze, and Preim 2 summarized two groups of glyph design: “parameter mapping” from shape and appearance (color, transparency, and texture) and “placement” driven by features or data. Our study concerns appearance. Recent vision science development also suggests that\nthe preattentive feature is not limited to single items but expanded to high-level structures. Global statistical and structural features can be\nalso preattentive .\nUnlike the now outdated Treisman’s 1988 preattentive processing 3, where\npreattentive features were considered to be\nperceived before it is given focused attention 3,\nthese preattentive features are persistent during viewers’ data exploration thus can continue to provide guidance  . Viewers can use peripheral vision to compare in parallel to confidently tell apart regions relevant or irrelevant to tasks 4. Visual features\nalso can be responsible for different attention speeds, and color (hue) and size (length and spatial frequency) are among those that guide attention  .\nHealey and Enns 5\nin their comprehensive review further\nremark that\nthese visual features are not popped-out at the same speed:\nhue has higher priority than shape and texture 6.\n\nAlso, when data size\nincreased, some preattentive features diminished 7 8.\n\n For visualizing quantitative data, MacKinlay 9 and Cleveland and McGill  leverage the\nranking of visual features and suggest that position and size are quantitative and can be compared\nin 2D.\nFor example,\nMacKinlay’s A Presentation Tool (APT) 9 automatically recommends visualizations using  effectiveness and expressive criteria and outputs a ranked set of encoding to enumerate candidate visualizations based on data types.\n\nCasner [ref]31\nexpands MacKinlay’s APT by incorporating user tasks to guide visualization generation.\nMcColeman et al. \nrevise the ranking of visual features based on the number of items.\nAll these studies almost exclusively consider only single item mappings.\nDemiralp et al.  evaluate a crowdsourcing\nmethod to study subjective perceptual distances of 2D bivariate pairs of shape-color, shape-size, and size-color. When adopted in 3D glyph design, the authors further suggest that the most important data\nattributes should be displayed with the most salient\nvisual features, to avoid situations in which secondary data values mask the information the viewer wants to see.\nOurs also emphasizes the use of global scene features to optimize viewing experiences. Monotonicity.\nQuantitative data encoding must normally\nbe monotonic, and various researchers have recommended a coloring sequence that increases monotonically in luminance .\nIn addition, the visual system mostly uses luminance variation to determine shape information . There has been much debate about the proper design of a color sequence for displaying quantitative data, mostly in 2D  and in\n3D shape volume variations .\nOur primary requirement is\nto use categorical colormaps that users be able to read large or\nsmall exponents at a glance. We used four color steps\nin the first study and up to seven steps in the second study from ColorBrewer  \nfor showing areas of large and small exponents that are mapped to a hue-varying sequence.\nWe claim not that these color sequences are optimal, only that they are reasonable solutions to the design problem.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: (APT) 9 automatically recommends visualizations using  effectiveness and expressive criteria and outputs a ranked set of encoding to enumerate candidate visualizations based on data types.\n\nCasner [ref]31\nexpands MacKinlay’s APT by incorporating user tasks to guide visualization generation.\nMcColeman et al. \nrevise the ranking of visual features based on the number of items.\nAll these studies\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
