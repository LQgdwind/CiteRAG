In this section we broaden our discussion by considering side topics relevant to our study. Regarding semantic studies, we did not address denotational semantics‚Äîour sampling (Definition¬†1) is an operational semantics. By denotational semantics, we mean a mathematical characterization of the set of all traces that can be produced by the considered system. The subject was indeed addressed in core mathematical probability theory‚Äîit was not called this way‚Äîwith the Kolmogorov extension theorem: this theorem gives the denotational semantics of a sequence of independent identically Œºùúá\\mu-distributed random variables as a probability space (Œ©,‚Ñ±,œÄ)Œ©‚Ñ±ùúã(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},\\pi), where Œ©Œ©\\Omega is the set of trajectories, ‚Ñ±‚Ñ±\\mathcal{F} the associated product œÉùúé\\sigma-algebra, and œÄ=Œº‚Ñïùúãsuperscriptùúá‚Ñï\\pi=\\mu^{\\mathbb{N}}, whose existence and uniqueness follows from this extension theorem. Since the 197019701970‚Äôs, mathematicians in probability theory gave a denotational semantics (this term was not used) to stochastic differential equations in a very general setting, see e.g, the seminal paper¬†. In our context of nondeterministic/probabilistic dynamical systems, the task was not really investigated by mathematicians, and one should rather look at the literature closer to computer science. The seminal paper by Kozen  defines two kinds of semantics of simple imperative probabilistic programs. The first semantics has finite horizon [0,S]0ùëÜ[0,S] where SùëÜS is a stopping time (causally defined random time) and closely follows probability theory with its construction of probability spaces of program traces; the second semantics, advocated by the author, is more denotational, uses Scott-like techniques of continuous linear operators on a Banach space of measures, and supports infinite traces, see also¬†3 . This approach was extended in¬†   in order to provide semantics to the observe statement present in most modern probabilistic programming languages.\nIn¬†, the semantics of a functional language supporting mixtures of continuous and discrete distributions and dedicated to certainly terminating programs, is\nspecified as measure transformers, describing how the program itself propagates the distribution of the probabilistic inputs. Major probabilistic programming languages do offer recursion¬† , all of them offer while loops. These features raise the issue of possible non termination. Non terminating while loops are the essence of¬†. We did not consider recursion in its full generality, but only under the limited form of non-terminating time-recursion, with Mixed Automata. Actually, time-recursion is the most widely used form of recursion considered in statistics and learning. Inference and learning are the main concerns of probabilistic programming. Due to the generality of the considered models, Monte-Carlo based inference algorithms are preferred¬†7    . Nondeterminism, which is supported by probabilistic languages, breaks the stationarity (or time-invariance) of the specified statistical models. This is a source of difficulties when invoking limit theorems of probability theory to support learning algorithms¬†. We did not consider learning in this work. Clearly, our model of Mixed Automata would face the same challenge if inference were considered. Extension of model based IOCO testing with probabilities was considered in¬†‚Äîthis is a different subject than statistical testing in the sense of¬†. In Section¬†4,\nwe have shown that Mixed Automata¬†subsume pa. Tutorial¬†\ninvestigates more variants of pa. We conjecture that similar results hold for\nthese as well: mappings exist that preserve simulation but not parallel\ncomposition.\nAbstract Probabilistic Automata¬† are an interface model, aiming to support specification, not programming. In addition to parallel composition, Abstract Probabilistic Automata offer refinement and possess Probabilistic Automata as their models, two concepts irrelevant to our study. In our work we have considered only automata, whose dynamics is indexed by discrete time nùëõn. Equipping true concurrency models with probability was classical for some net models. Free choice (or confusion free) nets are models for which this is rather simple; since choices remain local and statically defined, it is easy to turn them into probabilistic choices. For event structures with confusion, however, this is no longer the case: concurrency interferes with choice, making the latter dynamically defined. This makes it intricate, to equip choices with probabilities while maximally preserving concurrency.\nFirst constructions were proposed in¬†   [ref]7, based on the notion of branching cell, capturing the above difficulty. Infinite event structures are supported (with restrictions) for which the law of large numbers is proved.\nDrawbacks are: 1) different sequences of events corresponding to the same configuration may be given different probabilities, and 2) the overall probability is globally defined, hence no parallel composition can be proposed.\nA different construction was proposed for occurrence nets in¬† , addressing the above drawback. The net is augmented with ‚Äúnegative places‚Äù, thus enforcing supplementary causalities with the result of deferring choices until they become local. Through the notion of statically defined s-cell, the so augmented net can be given probabilistic choices meeting full concurrency, and parallel compositions of such nets is supported. In turn, the construction of the negative places works for finite nets only. In¬†, a link of such augmented nets is established with Bayesian networks, thus providing a result similar to ours in Section¬†2.2.\nFinally,¬†   study trace monoids by equipping them with probabilities derived from local specifications, using analytic combinatoric techniques. As far as we know, this is the only approach supporting true concurrency with probabilistic choice and parallel composition, for infinite traces. Concurrency makes everything definitely harder.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: with choice, making the latter dynamically defined.
