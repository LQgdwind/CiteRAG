      "content": "Paper Title: Probabilistic Constraint for Safety-Critical Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo solve probabilistic-constrained RL formulations, i.e., problems of the form (II), we are required to compute the gradient of the probabilistic constraints with respect to the policy parameter θ𝜃\\theta. We proceed by defining an important quantity in what follows next. Let Gtsubscript𝐺𝑡G_{t} be the product of indicator functions 𝟙​(Su∈𝒮safe)1subscript𝑆𝑢subscript𝒮safe\\mathbbm{1}\\left(S_{u}\\in\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{safe}}\\right) from u=t𝑢𝑡u=t to u=T𝑢𝑇u=T Having defined this quantity we are now in conditions of providing an expression for the gradient of the probabilistic constraint. This is the subject of the following Theorem. Let S0∈𝒮safesubscript𝑆0subscript𝒮safeS_{0}\\in\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{safe}}, the gradient of the safety probability for a given policy πθsubscript𝜋𝜃\\pi_{\\theta} yields See Appendix A-B.\n∎ This result has been stated in our prior work . We provide the proof here for completeness.\nIt is worth pointing out that the proof of this result is similar to Policy Gradient Theorems in the literature   . To draw parallelisms between them, let us define the cumulative rewards until horizon T𝑇T starting from t𝑡t Then, the gradient of the value function (1) can be computed using Policy Gradient Theorem  as Despite the similarities between (2) and (23) an important difference is evident. In (23) the gradient of the logarithm at time t𝑡t is multiplied by the cumulative reward from time t𝑡t until the end of the episode. This means that action Atsubscript𝐴𝑡A_{t} is only concerned with the rewards in the episode’s future. While in (2), this is not the case, and action Atsubscript𝐴𝑡A_{t} is concerned with the whole episode. Intuitively, if the agent is unsafe for the first few steps the actions in the future are irrelevant since the episode is considered unsafe as a whole. This will pose additional challenges in estimating the gradient. Let us start, however, by describing a challenge in the computation of (2) which is also shared by the computation of ∇θV​(θ)subscript∇𝜃𝑉𝜃\\nabla_{\\theta}V(\\theta). This is the need to compute expectations with respect to the trajectories of the system. In order to avoid sampling a multitude of trajectories, stochastic approximation methods  are often considered. Namely, one can use only one sample trajectory to approximate (23) Likewise, applying the stochastic approximation to (2) yields We term (25) “SPG-REINFORCE”. From (25) the additional challenges in estimating the gradient of the probabilistic safety constraint become explicit. Unlike the classic policy gradient (24) (where the policy parameter is updated at each iteration), under this framework the parameter in (25) is only updated when every step of the trajectory is safe, i.e., when G1=∏t=1T𝟙​(St∈𝒮safe)=1subscript𝐺1superscriptsubscriptproduct𝑡1𝑇1subscript𝑆𝑡subscript𝒮safe1G_{1}=\\prod_{t=1}^{T}\\mathbbm{1}\\left(S_{t}\\in\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{safe}}\\right)=1. To address this issue, one can use a different expression for the gradient which we provide in the next corollary. To do so, we rely on a crucial quantity that captures the product of indicator functions 𝟙​(Su∈𝒮safe)1subscript𝑆𝑢subscript𝒮safe\\mathbbm{1}\\left(S_{u}\\in\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{safe}}\\right) from u=0𝑢0u=0 to u=t𝑢𝑡u=t By defining Gtcsuperscriptsubscript𝐺𝑡𝑐G_{t}^{c} we can now provide an alternative expression for the gradient in the following corollary. Under the hypothesis of Theorem 2 it holds that Conditioning the right hand side of (2) with respect to Stsubscript𝑆𝑡S_{t} and Atsubscript𝐴𝑡A_{t} yields Using the fact that G1=Gt+1​Gtcsubscript𝐺1subscript𝐺𝑡1superscriptsubscript𝐺𝑡𝑐G_{1}=G_{t+1}\\,G_{t}^{c} and that S0,…,Stsubscript𝑆0…subscript𝑆𝑡S_{0},\\ldots,S_{t} are measurable with respect to St,Atsubscript𝑆𝑡subscript𝐴𝑡S_{t},A_{t} yields (2).\n∎ Note that 𝔼​[Gt+1∣St,At]𝔼delimited-[]conditionalsubscript𝐺𝑡1subscript𝑆𝑡subscript𝐴𝑡\\mathbb{E}\\left[G_{t+1}\\mid S_{t},A_{t}\\right] is the probability of remaining safe from time t+1𝑡1t+1 until the end of the episode. This information about the future is akin to the Q function in RL problems [44, Chapter 6]. Hence, assuming that an estimate of the probability is available, one can run actor-critic  type algorithms e.g., DDPG [ref]8, TRPO , PPO [ref]10 in this setting as well. In particular, the estimate takes the form We term (29) “SPG-Actor-Critic”. An advantage of “SPG-Actor-Critic” is that if the episode is safe until some time 0<t<T0𝑡𝑇0<t<T, we have Guc=1superscriptsubscript𝐺𝑢𝑐1G_{u}^{c}=1, with u≤t𝑢𝑡u\\leq t. Hence the estimate of the gradient is not zero and the policy will be updated. This is in contrast to the expression in (25). This fact can also be interpreted as an improved estimate with reduced variance as in actor-critic methods. The next theorem is a step forward in confirming this intuition.\n Consider G1,Gt+1subscript𝐺1subscript𝐺𝑡1G_{1},\\,G_{t+1} as defined in (20) and Gtcsuperscriptsubscript𝐺𝑡𝑐G_{t}^{c} in (26). Let X=∑t=0T−1G1𝑋superscriptsubscript𝑡0𝑇1subscript𝐺1X=\\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}G_{1} and Y=∑t=0T−1Gtc​𝔼​[Gt+1|St,At]𝑌superscriptsubscript𝑡0𝑇1superscriptsubscript𝐺𝑡𝑐𝔼delimited-[]conditionalsubscript𝐺𝑡1subscript𝑆𝑡subscript𝐴𝑡Y=\\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}G_{t}^{c}\\,\\mathbb{E}\\left[G_{t+1}|S_{t},A_{t}\\right]. It holds that var​[X]>var​[Y]vardelimited-[]𝑋vardelimited-[]𝑌\\text{var}\\left[X\\right]>\\text{var}\\left[Y\\right]. Denote by 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} the set {0,1,⋯,T}01⋯𝑇\\{0,1,\\cdots,T\\}.\nWe proceed by stating the fact that Gtcsuperscriptsubscript𝐺𝑡𝑐G_{t}^{c} is measurable with respect to St,Atsubscript𝑆𝑡subscript𝐴𝑡S_{t},A_{t}. Then, by virtue of the towering property [54, Theorem 4.1.13] yields\n𝔼​[G1]=𝔼​[Gtc​𝔼​[Gt+1|St,At]]𝔼delimited-[]subscript𝐺1𝔼delimited-[]superscriptsubscript𝐺𝑡𝑐𝔼delimited-[]conditionalsubscript𝐺𝑡1subscript𝑆𝑡subscript𝐴𝑡\\mathbb{E}\\left[G_{1}\\right]=\\mathbb{E}\\left[G_{t}^{c}\\,\\mathbb{E}\\left[G_{t+1}|S_{t},A_{t}\\right]\\right], ∀t∈𝒯for-all𝑡𝒯\\forall t\\in\\mathcal{T}. Therefore, by exchanging the sum and the expectation we obtain Since var​[X]=𝔼​[X2]−𝔼​[X]2vardelimited-[]𝑋𝔼delimited-[]superscript𝑋2𝔼superscriptdelimited-[]𝑋2\\text{var}\\left[X\\right]=\\mathbb{E}\\left[X^{2}\\right]-\\mathbb{E}\\left[X\\right]^{2} and var​[Y]=𝔼​[Y2]−𝔼​[Y]2vardelimited-[]𝑌𝔼delimited-[]superscript𝑌2𝔼superscriptdelimited-[]𝑌2\\text{var}\\left[Y\\right]=\\mathbb{E}\\left[Y^{2}\\right]-\\mathbb{E}\\left[Y\\right]^{2} it follows that By definitions of X𝑋X and Y𝑌Y and expanding the square we obtain\n We claim that ∀t,u∈𝒯for-all𝑡𝑢𝒯\\forall{t,u\\in\\mathcal{T}} the following inequality holds Using the linearity of the expectation along with the previous inequality and the expressions (31)–(32) completes the proof of the result. We are left to prove (33). Denote by DX​Ysubscript𝐷𝑋𝑌D_{XY} the left-hand side of (33). We divide the analysis into two cases: t=u𝑡𝑢t=u and t≠u𝑡𝑢t\\not=u. For t=u𝑡𝑢t=u, rewrite DX​Ysubscript𝐷𝑋𝑌D_{XY} as Since Gtcsuperscriptsubscript𝐺𝑡𝑐G_{t}^{c} is measurable with respect to St,Atsubscript𝑆𝑡subscript𝐴𝑡S_{t},A_{t}, the previous equation is equivalent to where the last equation directly follows from the definition of G1subscript𝐺1G_{1}. Taking the conditional expectation on St,Atsubscript𝑆𝑡subscript𝐴𝑡S_{t},A_{t} for the right-hand side of (IV) yields By the definition of conditional variance, (36) reduces to For t≠u𝑡𝑢t\\not=u, let us consider t<u𝑡𝑢t<u (the case of t>u𝑡𝑢t>u is analogous). Using the fact that G1=Gtc​Gt+1=Guc​Gu+1subscript𝐺1superscriptsubscript𝐺𝑡𝑐subscript𝐺𝑡1superscriptsubscript𝐺𝑢𝑐subscript𝐺𝑢1G_{1}=G_{t}^{c}G_{t+1}=G_{u}^{c}G_{u+1}, and Gtcsuperscriptsubscript𝐺𝑡𝑐G_{t}^{c} and Gucsuperscriptsubscript𝐺𝑢𝑐G_{u}^{c} are in the past of t𝑡t and u𝑢u, one can rewrite DX​Ysubscript𝐷𝑋𝑌D_{XY} in (33) as Taking the conditional expectation on St,Atsubscript𝑆𝑡subscript𝐴𝑡S_{t},A_{t} for the right-hand side of (38) using the fact that t<u𝑡𝑢t<u and the towering property [54, Theorem 4.1.13] yields This completes the proof of the result.\n∎ The intuition of the modified estimate in (29) is that it leads to an estimate with smaller variance as compared to (25). Note that this claim is merely an intuition, as it does not incorporate the term ∇θlog⁡πθ​(At|St)subscript∇𝜃subscript𝜋𝜃conditionalsubscript𝐴𝑡subscript𝑆𝑡\\nabla_{\\theta}\\log\\pi_{\\theta}(A_{t}|S_{t}). Equipped with expressions to estimate the gradient of the safety probability, in the next section we turn our attention to algorithms aiming to solve the relaxations (3) and (13) of problem (II).\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: about the future is akin to the Q function in RL problems [44, Chapter 6].
