      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Transferable Parameters for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has proven highly successful in handling distribution shift and knowledge transfer. On the one hand, conventional supervised learning algorithms perform well under static environments where we draw training and test examples from an identical data distribution. If the training and test distributions are substantially different, the conventional supervised learning algorithms often fail to generalize . In practice, we expect our learning machines to generalize well on the test domain of interest that is similar yet distinct from the training domain. UDA is the key machine learning topic to deal with this dilemma . On the other hand, deep neural networks (DNNs) are applied to an increasingly broad array of applications but at the expense of laborious large-scale training data annotation. To avoid expensive data labeling, UDA takes on the critical responsibilities of transferring knowledge from previously labeled datasets in a transductive manner [ref]3. Prominent theoretical advances in UDA emerge a consensus that the generalization error of the source hypothesis (e.g., classifier, regressor) with respect to the target domain is upper bounded by the empirical source risk, the domain dissimilarity, the ideal joint hypothesis error, and a factor consisting of the hypothesis complexity and sample size  . Unlike conventional supervised learning bounds, the measurement of domain dissimilarity is the key to bridge the source and target domains. Currently, the most popular measures of domain dissimilarity include the ℋ​Δ​ℋℋΔℋ\\mathcal{H}\\Delta\\mathcal{H} distance , maximum mean discrepancy  , discrepancy distance [ref]7, and margin disparity discrepancy . On par with the above important theoretical findings, deep UDA methods resort to learning the domain-invariant feature representation to minimize the distribution discrepancy. Great studies in deep UDA can be divided into two categories: 1) moment matching. The core idea is to minimize the discrepancy of high-dimensional features cross domains  0; 2) adversarial training. The core idea is to learn transferable feature representations by confusing a domain discriminator in a two-player game, yielding the state-of-the-art performance on many visual tasks 1 2 3. Intuitively, they expect a good feature representation and a hypothesis learned from the source domain to generalize well to the target domain. However, during learning domain-invariant features and source hypotheses, much unnecessary domain-specific information is still involved, thus compromising the generalization to the target domain. Therefore, if we can reduce the side effect of domain-specific information before the testing time, the generalizability and robustness of deep UDA will improve. In essence, the parameters in deep UDA networks dominant the learning of transferable feature representation and source hypotheses. Recent interesting studies have theoretically proven that over-parameterization is one of the key factors that has contributed to the successful training of DNNs, but allowing them to overfit the domain-specific information of the source domain easily 4 5. The lottery ticket hypothesis 6 shows that only partial parameters are important for generalization (see Fig. 1). Motivated by that, it remains a question whether we can divide the parameters of any deep UDA network into two parts to reduce the side effect of domain-specific information. In this way, we can enhance the learning of domain-invariant features and source hypotheses and further improve deep UDA networks’ generalization performances on the target domain. In this paper, we present a novel insight: rather than learning the domain-invariant feature representation, it is better to learn domain-invariant parameters. Interestingly, as illustrated in Fig. 1, we find that only partial parameters are essential for learning domain-invariant information and generalizing well in UDA, which we term as transferable parameters. In contrast, the other parameters tend to fit domain-specific information and usually fail to generalize, which we term as untransferable parameters. Driven by this insight, we propose Transferable Parameter Learning (TransPar) to reduce the side effect of domain-specific information in the learning process and thus enhance the learning of domain-invariant information. Specifically, TransPar first identifies the transferable parameters among all parameters of a deep UDA network by exploiting the largest-magnitude weights and distribution distance in each iteration. In this way, TransPar categorizes all parameters into two parts, i.e., the transferable and untransferable parameters. TransPar then suggests separate update rules for these two types of parameters. For the transferable parameters, TransPar performs the robust positive update. This part of the parameters is updated using the gradients derived from the objective function and weight decay. For the untransferable parameters, TransPar performs the negative update. Their values are penalized with the weight decay and without the gradients derived from the objective functions. As the first effort to identify the transferable parameters in UDA, two critical questions emerge and determine the success of domain adaptation: Firstly, how to set the ratio between transferable and untransferable parameters? Our answer is according to the distribution distance. Intuitively, the smaller the distribution distance between source and target domains, the larger the ratio of the transferable parameters because the domain-specific information is minor. However, the variational distance of real-valued distributions cannot be measured from finite samples 7. Instead, we propose to estimate the ratio between transferable and untransferable parameters by using logistic regression classifiers to measure the proxy 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}-distance . Secondly, which module parameters are dividable as transferable and untransferable parameters in deep UDA networks? Most deep UDA networks comprise three modules: a feature extractor to learning invariant representation, a source hypothesis to optimize the objective function based on the labeled source data, and a domain discrepancy measurement module (e.g., domain discriminator) to minimize the distribution distance of high-level features. We find that 1) the parameters of the feature extractor and the domain discrepancy measurement are dividable because they promote each other; 2) the parameters of the source hypothesis can be dividable only if the objective function adds a term about the unsupervised loss of target domain (i.e., entropy minimization loss). We summarize our contributions as follows: To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that finds only partial parameters are important for learning domain-invariant information and generalizing well in UDA. This exciting insight could open a new door to address the problem of distribution shift and knowledge transfer. We propose a novel and effective method to categorize the transferable and untransferable parameters according to the largest-magnitude weights and the distribution distance. The proposal is suitable to any deep UDA network and can be easily extended to handle any case of data distribution mismatches (e.g., covariate shift, target shift). We empirically validate the proposal on various UDA datasets and settings, on which it achieves remarkable improvements compared with the original deep UDA networks. For example, after integrated our proposal into domain adversarial neural network (DANN) 1, the average accuracy is improved from 82.2% to 87.8% on the Office-31 dataset. In the following, we first briefly review related work in Section II. Then, we fulfill the learning set-up and short introduction for unsupervised domain adaptation networks in Section III. Next, we present a detailed description of our proposed methods in Section IV. Experimental results on the image classification and keypoint detection tasks are in Section V. Finally, we close this paper in Section VI.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: large-scale training data annotation.
