Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

Since DDPM [ref]19, the convolutional U-Net architecture [ref]37 has become the standard choice of diffusion backbone [ref]36 . Built on the U-Net proposed in [ref]19, several improvements have also been proposed (e.g.,  ) to achieve better generation performance, including increasing depth versus width, applying residual blocks from BigGAN , using more attention layers and attention heads, rescaling residual connections with 1212\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, etc.\nMore recently, several works have proposed transformer-based architectures for diffusion models, such as GenViT 3, U-ViT , RIN 2 and DiT , largely due to the wide expressivity and flexibility of transformers 1 .\nAmong them, DiT is a pure transformer architecture without the U-Net inductive bias and it obtains a better class-conditional generation result than the U-Net counterparts with better scalability .\nRather than developing a better transformer architecture for diffusion models, our main goal is to improve the training efficiency of diffusion models by applying the masked training to the diffusion transformers (e.g., DiT).\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: The success of diffusion models in image generation does not come true without more advanced backbone architectures.
