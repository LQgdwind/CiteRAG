      "content": "Paper Title: MeloTrans: A Text to Symbolic Music Generation Model Following Human Composition Habit\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMachine composition has two synthetic targets, the first is to directly synthesize musical waveform, and the second is to synthesize symbolic music. Both have made great progress in recent years. For the former, it is mainly realized by large retrieval model  or large multimodal model . The main difficulty in implementing these models is the lack of text-music pairing data, which makes the creation of corresponding datasets an important part of their work [ref]17 . To overcome this problem, pre-trained models [ref]19, semi-supervised  and unsupervised  training methods have been used in composition models. However, the challenge of generating music waveforms from text lies in their limited editability. Users cannot directly edit the generated music and must continuously adjust the text prompt to regenerate the music, imposing limitations on the composition process. Moreover, certain professional requirements are challenging to implement in waveform generation, such as when users provide motifs and request the model to develop them into musical phrases. In contrast, symbolic music, represented as a series of musical symbols, can be readily interpreted and manipulated by both humans and machines. Early symbolic music generation models primarily utilized Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and similar architectures. In 2002, Eck et al.  pioneered the application of LSTM to blues music composition, demonstrating the ability to improvise well-paced and well-structured blues music from short musical inputs. MelodyRNN , proposed by the Magenta team, improved the capacity to learn long-term structures through the implementation of Lookback RNN and Attention RNN architectures. Owing to the limitations of recurrent neural networks in generating extended sequences, researchers have explored alternative generative models, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). MusicVAE [ref]1 employs a hierarchical decoder for modeling long structured sequences and utilizes a bi-directional RNN as an encoder, enhancing interpolation and reconstruction capabilities. GrooVAE , an extension of MusicVAE, generates drum melodies by training on a corpus of electronic drum recordings from live performances. Yang et al.  proposed MidiNet, a GAN-based model that enhances the innovation in Jazz track generation by incorporating previously generated melody and chord information as conditional input to the generatorâ€™s intermediate convolutional layer, thereby constraining the generation of note types. JazzGAN  presents a GAN-based monophonic Jazz generative model, utilizing LSTM to improvise over chord progressions and introducing several metrics for evaluating Jazz-specific musical features. MuseGAN, proposed by Dong et al. , is widely recognized as the pioneering model capable of generating multi-track polyphonic music. Capturing long-term dependencies in music has always been a significant challenge for deep learning models. Several studies have proposed different solutions to address this issue[ref]1. Music Transformer introduced the first Transformer model for symbolic music generation, demonstrating the capacity of Transformer models to generate coherent, minutes-long polyphonic piano music. Since then, various Transformer-based models have been proposed. However, deep learning models, including Transformers, still face difficulty in generating musical phrases and fragments with clear repetition and development. Another approach is to create new representation of music to shorten the input sequence length, but this cannot fundamentally solve the problem9. Meanwhile, these works tend to use the first few notes of existing fragments as a prompt, without attributing specific meaning to them. To solve this problem, researchers have considered introducing prior knowledge to the generating process. Theme Transformer proposed gated parallel attention mechanisms and theme-aligned positional encoding to conditionally reference thematic material in the music generation process. However, it merely repeats theme fragments without considering the development relationships between these hierarchical structures. MELONS summarizes the relationships between bars into eight types and proposes a two-step task: structure generation and structure-conditioned melody generation. This approach can generate complete songs with clear long-term structures, but lacks musical richness compared to real music. MeloForm employs an expert system for rule-based melody generation and a Transformer for refinement, performing high accuracy in musical form, but the result sounds similar when generated from the same motif. Despite significant advancements in symbolic music composition, relatively few studies have focused on generating symbolic music from textual prompts. TransProse , proposed in 2014, established a set of mapping rules for generating music based on the density of emotional words in a given text. However, this approach fails to capture non-emotional textual information, and its performance is constrained by the hand-crafted nature of the mapping rules. Rangarajan et al.  developed three strategies for mapping text to musical notes; however, due to the character-level functionality, the resulting music lacks coherence and fails to capture the semantic content of the text. BUTTER , based on the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), enables the search and generation of music clips based on specific textual descriptions. While BUTTER employs a data-driven approach, its flexibility is constrained by the use of synthesized texts from specified keywords (i.e., 25 keys, 6 beat types, and 3 styles), limiting its output to 4-bar music clips in ABC format. Wu et al.  introduced a text-music dataset in 2022 and utilized a pre-trained large language model (LLM) for text-controlled music generation, demonstrating the viability of extracting textual features for controlled music generation. Despite fine-tuning the LLM on over 200,000 texts and ABC notated music samples, the model struggles to effectively align sparse musical information in the text with the generated music. MuseCoco  employs musical attributes as an intermediary to generate symbolic music from textual descriptions. This approach enables self-supervised training of the model using substantial amounts of unlabeled data. To address the challenge of limited labeled data, the text-to-attribute understanding stage employs templates and language models such as ChatGPT to synthesize paired text-attribute data. Instructed with musical input prompts, the large language model ChatGPT-4  can also generate music from a given motif, but its development is monotonous. Although considering prior knowledge, previous works still fail to touch the essential element in human composition, consequently lack the desired musicality. In this paper, we propose MeloTrans, which can generate music following 5 kinds of motif-to-variant development to improve both humanity and music richness.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: large multimodal model .
