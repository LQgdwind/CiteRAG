      "content": "Paper Title: An ASP approach for reasoning on neural networks under a finitely many-valued semantics for weighted conditional knowledge bases\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe ‚Äúconcept-wise‚Äù multipreference semantics (both in the two-valued and in the fuzzy case) has recently been proposed as a logical semantics of MultiLayer Perceptrons (MLPs) . In this paper we consider weighted conditional ùíú‚Äã‚Ñí‚Äãùíûùíú‚Ñíùíû\\mathcal{ALC} knowledge bases in the finitely many-valued case, under a coherent, a faithful and a œÜùúë\\varphi-coherent semantics, the last one being suitable to characterize the stationary states of MLPs.\nFor the boolean fragment ‚Ñí‚Äãùíû‚Ñíùíû\\mathcal{LC} of ùíú‚Äã‚Ñí‚Äãùíûùíú‚Ñíùíû\\mathcal{ALC} we exploit ASP and asprin  for reasoning under œÜùúë\\varphi-coherent entailment, by restricting to canonical models of the knowledge base.\nWe have proven soundness and completeness of ASP encoding for the finitely many-valued case and provided an upper complexity bound.\nAs a proof of concept, we have experimented the proposed approach for checking properties of some trained neural networks for the MONK‚Äôs problems . Undecidability results for fuzzy DLs with general inclusion axioms\n \nmotivate the investigation of many-valued approximations of fuzzy multipreference entailment.\nThe choice of ‚Ñí‚Äãùíû‚Ñíùíû\\mathcal{LC} is motivated by the fact it is sufficient to encode a neural network as a weighted KB as well as to formulate boolean properties of the network.\nThis work is a first step towards the definition of proof methods for reasoning from weighted KBs under a finitely many-valued\npreferential semantics in more expressive or lightweight DLs. For ‚Ñ∞‚Äã‚Ñí‚ä•‚Ñ∞superscript‚Ñíbottom\\mathcal{EL}^{\\bot}, the two-valued case has been studied in previous work [ref]30. The encoding of a neural network as a conditional knowledge base opens the possibility of combining empirical knowledge with elicited knowledge, e.g.,\nin the form of strict inclusions and definitions.\nMuch work has been devoted, in recent years, to the combination\nof neural networks and symbolic reasoning (see the survey by Lamb et al. ), leading to the definition of new computational models\nand to extensions of logic programming languages\nwith neural predicates.\nThe relationships between normal logic programs and connectionist network have been investigated by Garcez and Gabbay  and by Hitzler et al. .\nA correspondence between neural networks and gradual argumentation semantics has been recently investigated by Potyka \nby studying the semantic properties and the convergence conditions of a MLP-based bipolar semantics. The correspondence between neural network models and fuzzy systems has been first investigated by Kosko in his seminal work .\nA fuzzy extension of preferential logics has been studied by Casini and Straccia  based on Rational Closure. While using preferential logic for the verification of properties of neural networks is a general (model agnostic) approach, first proposed for\nSOMs [ref]27 ,\nwhether it is possible to extend the logical encoding of MLPs as weighted conditional KBs to other network models\nis a subject for future investigation. The development of a temporal extension of weighted conditional KBs to capture the transient behavior of MLPs is also an interesting direction to extend this work.
