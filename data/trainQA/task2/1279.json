How to effectively train a deep network has been a central topic for decades. In the past several years, efforts have mainly focused on better architecture design (e.g., batch normalization , residual blocks [ref]14, dense connections ) and better loss functions (e.g., label smoothing  , contrastive loss , large-margin softmax ) than the standard cross-entropy (CE) loss. Knowledge distillation (KD)  is a training method that falls into the second group. In KD, a stronger network – called teacher – is introduced to guide the learning of the original network – called student – by minimizing the discrepancy between the representations of the two networks, where 𝒟K​Lsubscript𝒟𝐾𝐿\\mathcal{D}_{KL} represents KL divergence ; α∈(0,1)𝛼01\\alpha\\in(0,1) is a factor to balance the two loss terms; ℒC​Esubscriptℒ𝐶𝐸\\mathcal{L}_{CE} denotes the cross-entropy loss; y𝑦y is the one-hot label and 𝐩(t),𝐩(s)superscript𝐩𝑡superscript𝐩𝑠\\mathbf{p}^{(t)},\\mathbf{p}^{(s)} stand for the teacher’s and student’s output probabilities over the classes; τ𝜏\\tau is a temperature constant  to smooth predicted probabilities. KD allows us to train smaller, more efficient neural networks without compromising on accuracy, which facilitates deploying deep learning in resource constrained environments (e.g., on mobile devices). KD has found plenty of applications in many tasks     . Most existing KD methods have attempted to improve it by proposing better KD loss functions applied at the network outputs   . Few works have considered KD from the input side. Especially, the interplay between KD and data augmentation (DA)  has not been well understood so far (note, by DA here, we mean the conventional DA concept: generating a new input by transforming one or multiple inputs. A broader scope of DA may involve the neural network, e.g., dropout can be seen as a kind of DA . We do not consider this type of DA in this paper due to the limited length). In this work, we ask: What makes a “good” data augmentation in knowledge distillation? A clear answer to this question has many benefits. First, theoretically, it can help us towards a better understanding about how data augmentation plays a role in KD. Second, practically, it can bring us considerable performance gain – in Fig. 2, we show test error rates using the standard CE loss (no teacher) vs. using KD loss (with a teacher). As seen, a stronger DA can lower the test error rate and admit more training iterations without overfitting in KD. It is pretty obvious to see that “Flip+Crop” is stronger than “Flip” alone in Fig. 2. However, for other DA schemes, such as Mixup  vs. AutoAugment [ref]8, which one is stronger? Not very clear. We thus desire a principled way (e.g., a concrete metric) to make the vague concept “stronger” exact. Presenting such a theoretically sound metric and empirically validating its effectiveness is the goal of this paper. Intuitively, a good DA should enrich the input data and expose more knowledge of the teacher so that the student can generalize better. We formalize this idea from a statistical learning perspective. Specifically, we will show a good DA scheme is defined by a lower variance (or covariance) of the teacher’s mean output probability over different input samples, which ultimately leads to a lower generalization gap for the student. The proposed theory is well justified by our extensive empirical studies on CIFAR100 and Tiny ImageNet datasets with various pairs. The proposed theory well explains why CutMix is better than other alternatives (such as Mixup , AutoAugment [ref]8) in KD. In addition to the new theoretical results, we also propose an entropy-based data picking scheme to select more informative samples for KD, which can deliver even lower variance of the teacher’s mean probability as well as lower generalization error of the student. We make the following contributions in this paper: We present a proven proposition (Proposition 5) that precisely answers what defines a better DA in KD: Given a fixed teacher, a better DA is the one that gives a lower variance of the teacher’s mean probability. The proposition is well justified empirically on standard image classification datasets with many teacher-student pairs. An entropy-based data picking scheme is introduced to further reduce the variance of the teacher’s mean probability, which can further advance CutMix, the prior state-of-the-art DA approach among those evaluated in this paper. Empirically, we show how the presented theory can benefit in practice – we can simply enhance the existing KD methods by using a stronger DA and prolonged training iterations.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are the de facto methodology in many artificial intelligence areas nowadays [ref]25 .
