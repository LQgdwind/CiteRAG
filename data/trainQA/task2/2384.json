      "content": "Paper Title: From Show to Tell: A Survey on Deep Learning-based Image Captioning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince every image captures a wide variety of entities with complex interactions, human descriptions tend to be diverse and grounded to different objects and details. Some image captioning variants explicitly focus on these aspects. Diverse Captioning.\nDiverse image captioning tries to replicate the quality and variability of the sentences produced by humans. The most common technique to achieve diversity is based on variants of the beam search algorithm [ref]213 that entail dividing the beams into similar groups and encouraging diversity between groups. Other solutions have been investigated, such as contrastive learning , conditional GANs [ref]170 , and paraphrasing [ref]215. However, these solutions tend to underperform in terms of caption quality, which is partially recovered by using variational auto-encoders    . Another approach is exploiting multiple part-of-speech tags sequences predicted from image region classes  and forcing the model to produce different captions based on these sequences. Multilingual Captioning.\nSince image captioning is commonly performed in English, multilingual captioning  aims to extend the applicability of captioning systems to other languages. The two main strategies entail collecting captions in different languages for commonly used datasets (e.g. Chinese and Japanese captions for COCO images  , German captions for Flick30K ), or directly training multilingual captioning systems with unpaired captions    . Application-specific Captioning.\nImage captioning can be applied to ease and automate activities involving text generation from images. For example, captioning systems can be applied for medical report generation, for which they need to predict disease tags and try to imitate the style of real medical reports   .\nAnother interesting application is art description generation, which entails describing not only factual aspects of the artworks, but also their context and style, and conveyed message\nart description . To this end, captioning systems could also rely on external knowledge, e.g. metadata. A similar application is automatic caption generation for news articles  , for which named entities from the article should be described  , and the rich journalistic style should be maintained  . Another important application domain is assistive technology for the visually impaired , where image captioning approaches must be able to provide informative descriptions even for low-quality visual inputs .\n\nReference markers found: [213]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]213: image captioning tries to replicate the quality and variability of the sentences produced by humans. The most common technique to achieve diversity is based on variants of the beam search algorithm [ref]213 that entail dividing the beams into similar groups and encouraging diversity between groups. Other solutions have been investigated, such as contrastive learning , conditional GANs [ref]170\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
