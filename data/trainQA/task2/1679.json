[ref]46 leverage auto-encoders to jointly learn user-user and item-item correlations (JCA).\nHowever, JCA uses high dimensional sparse vectors as the input for users and items, which restrics it from being applied in the large scale industry scenario.\nLater, Ebesu et al. [ref]22 equip collaborative filtering with Memory Network (CMN) [ref]47, which also takes user neighborhood into consideration. Despite the success of the above user-based methods, they fail to be applied in a real-time scenario where user-user relations are usually not stable .\nUsers’ interests usually change sharply overtime.\nTherefore, the similar users are also dynamic for each user.\nTo adapt to users’ dynamic interests with their new interactions and identify new user-user relations, these methods need to be retrained since most of the above user-based methods are transductive models.\nHowever, retraining a model in a streaming manner is usually infeasible in real-world applications, thus restricting them from real-time candidate generation tasks.\nThough CMN is an inductive model, it regards someone as the neighbor if she/he has any connection with the specific user’s interacted items, which is also not affordable in real-world applications.\nDifferent from the above methods, our SCCF addresses the real-time problems existing in the user-based literature by leveraging user neighborhood through the inductive UI model’s representations.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: to estimate the user-user similarity through user representation embedding.\nIn addition, a few works attempt to incorporate user-based methods with deep learning approaches.\nFor example, Zhu et al.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
