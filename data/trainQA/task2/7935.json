      "content": "Paper Title: Realizing the Maximal Analytic Display Fragment of Labeled Sequent Calculi for Tense LogicsThis research was supported by the European Research Council European Research Council (Grant Agreement no. 771779, DeciGUT).\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLabeled sequents generalize the syntax of Gentzen-style sequents through the incorporation of labels and semantic elements. This idea is rooted in the work of Kanger , who employed spotted formulae in the construction of sequent systems for modal logics. Since then, large classes of modal and constructive logics have been supplemented with labeled sequent systems [ref]9    . The labeled formalism has been successful in generating modular systems that cover extensive classes of logics in a uniform manner, i.e. through the inclusion or exclusion of structural rules, one labeled system for a logic may be transformed into a labeled system for another logic  . Moreover, general results exist (e.g.  ) which show that labeled systems commonly possess favorable properties such as admissible structural rules, invertible logical rules, and cut-admissibility (we formally define these properties below). In this section, we introduce labeled calculi with primitive tense structural rules. The base calculus for the logic 𝖪𝗍subscript𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{K_{t}} is a notational variant of Boretti’s  labeled calculus 𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍subscript𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{G3K_{t}}, though the primitive tense structural rules we define are entirely new.222We employ a schematic representation of labeled calculi whereby rules are instantiated by means of substitutions to better match the display formalism. We let Lab={w,u,v,…}Lab𝑤𝑢𝑣…\\mathrm{Lab}=\\{w,u,v,\\ldots\\} be a denumerable set of labels. A labeled sequent is defined to be a formula of the form ℛ,Γ⇒Δ⇒ℛΓΔ\\mathcal{R},\\Gamma\\Rightarrow\\Delta, where ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} is a (potentially empty) set of relational atoms of the form R​w​u𝑅𝑤𝑢Rwu, and ΓΓ\\Gamma and ΔΔ\\Delta are (potentially empty) multisets of labeled formulae of the form w:A:𝑤𝐴w:A, where w𝑤w and u𝑢u range over LabLab\\mathrm{Lab}, and A𝐴A ranges over ℒℒ\\mathcal{L}.333Usually labeled calculi employ multisets of relational atoms. However, since weakenings and contractions are admissible over relational atoms in our setting, it is well-known that sets can be used instead of multisets. We use ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} to denote sets of relational atoms, ΓΓ\\Gamma and ΔΔ\\Delta to denote multisets of labeled formulae, and λ𝜆\\lambda to denote labeled sequents, as well as use annotated versions of these symbols. We let Lab​(ℛ)Labℛ\\mathrm{Lab}(\\mathcal{R}), Lab​(Γ)LabΓ\\mathrm{Lab}(\\Gamma), and Lab​(λ)Lab𝜆\\mathrm{Lab}(\\lambda) indicate the set of all labels in a set ℛℛ\\mathcal{R}, a multiset ΓΓ\\Gamma, or a labeled sequent λ𝜆\\lambda, respectively. We define the length of a labeled sequent ℛ,Γ⇒Δ⇒ℛΓΔ\\mathcal{R},\\Gamma\\Rightarrow\\Delta to be ℓ​(ℛ,Γ⇒Δ)=|ℛ|+|Γ|+|Δ|ℓ⇒ℛΓΔℛΓΔ\\ell(\\mathcal{R},\\Gamma\\Rightarrow\\Delta)=|\\mathcal{R}|+|\\Gamma|+|\\Delta|, where |ℛ|ℛ|\\mathcal{R}|, |Γ|Γ|\\Gamma|, and |Δ|Δ|\\Delta| denote the cardinality of each (multi)set. Given two labeled sequents λ1:=ℛ1,Γ1⇒Δ1formulae-sequenceassignsubscript𝜆1subscriptℛ1⇒subscriptΓ1subscriptΔ1\\lambda_{1}:=\\mathcal{R}_{1},\\Gamma_{1}\\Rightarrow\\Delta_{1} and λ2:=ℛ2,Γ2⇒Δ2formulae-sequenceassignsubscript𝜆2subscriptℛ2⇒subscriptΓ2subscriptΔ2\\lambda_{2}:=\\mathcal{R}_{2},\\Gamma_{2}\\Rightarrow\\Delta_{2}, we define the sequent composition λ1⊗λ2:=ℛ1,ℛ2,Γ1,Γ2⇒Δ1,Δ2formulae-sequenceassigntensor-productsubscript𝜆1subscript𝜆2subscriptℛ1subscriptℛ2subscriptΓ1⇒subscriptΓ2subscriptΔ1subscriptΔ2\\lambda_{1}\\otimes\\lambda_{2}:=\\mathcal{R}_{1},\\mathcal{R}_{2},\\Gamma_{1},\\Gamma_{2}\\Rightarrow\\Delta_{1},\\Delta_{2}. It follows by definition that sequent compositions are (1) associative, i.e. (λ1⊗λ2)⊗λ3=λ1⊗(λ2⊗λ3)tensor-producttensor-productsubscript𝜆1subscript𝜆2subscript𝜆3tensor-productsubscript𝜆1tensor-productsubscript𝜆2subscript𝜆3(\\lambda_{1}\\otimes\\lambda_{2})\\otimes\\lambda_{3}=\\lambda_{1}\\otimes(\\lambda_{2}\\otimes\\lambda_{3}), and (2) commutative, i.e. λ1⊗λ2=λ2⊗λ1tensor-productsubscript𝜆1subscript𝜆2tensor-productsubscript𝜆2subscript𝜆1\\lambda_{1}\\otimes\\lambda_{2}=\\lambda_{2}\\otimes\\lambda_{1}. Due to the associative property, we will often omit parentheses when writing successive sequent compositions. If {A1,…,An}⊂ℒsubscript𝐴1…subscript𝐴𝑛ℒ\\{A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\}\\subset\\mathcal{L}, we define w:{A1,…,An}:=w:A1,…,w:An:𝑤assignsubscript𝐴1…subscript𝐴𝑛𝑤:subscript𝐴1…𝑤:subscript𝐴𝑛w:\\{A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\}:=w:A_{1},\\ldots,w:A_{n}. As in the display setting, we utilize variables in the formulation of our inference rules and calculi. In particular, we let w˙,u˙,v˙,…˙𝑤˙𝑢˙𝑣…\\dot{w},\\dot{u},\\dot{v},\\ldots denote label variables, which will be instantiated with labels, we define schematic relational atoms to be formulae of the form R​w˙​u˙𝑅˙𝑤˙𝑢R\\dot{w}\\dot{u} with w˙˙𝑤\\dot{w} and u˙˙𝑢\\dot{u} label variables, and we define schematic labeled formulae to be formulae of the form w˙:ℱ:˙𝑤ℱ\\dot{w}:\\mathcal{F} where w˙˙𝑤\\dot{w} is a label variable and ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} is generated by the following grammar in BNF: with ▽∈{¬,[𝖦],⟨𝖥⟩,[𝖧],⟨𝖯⟩}▽delimited-[]𝖦delimited-⟨⟩𝖥delimited-[]𝖧delimited-⟨⟩𝖯\\triangledown\\in\\{\\neg,[\\mathsf{G}],\\langle\\mathsf{F}\\rangle,[\\mathsf{H}],\\langle\\mathsf{P}\\rangle\\}, ⊙∈{∧,∨,→}\\odot\\in\\{\\land,\\lor,\\rightarrow\\}, p˙˙𝑝\\dot{p} an atomic variable, and A˙,B˙˙𝐴˙𝐵\\dot{A},\\dot{B} formula variables. We use λ˙˙𝜆\\dot{\\lambda} and annotated versions thereof to denote labeled sequent variables, which will be instantiated with labeled sequents. Last, we define schematic labeled sequents to be formulae of the form where, for each 1≤i≤n1𝑖𝑛1\\leq i\\leq n and 1≤j≤k1𝑗𝑘1\\leq j\\leq k, ℛ˙isubscript˙ℛ𝑖\\dot{\\mathcal{R}}_{i} is a (potentially empty) set of schematic relational atoms, Γ˙isubscript˙Γ𝑖\\dot{\\Gamma}_{i} and Δ˙isubscript˙Δ𝑖\\dot{\\Delta}_{i} are (potentially empty) multisets of schematic labeled formulae, and λ˙jsubscript˙𝜆𝑗\\dot{\\lambda}_{j} is a labeled sequent variable. We sometimes denote schematic labeled sequents by Λ˙˙Λ\\dot{\\Lambda} and annotated versions thereof. As can be seen in Figures 5–7, schematic labeled sequents are used to define inference rules, instances of which, are obtained via applications of substitutions. A substitution σ𝜎\\sigma is defined to be a function (written in postfix notation) that satisfies the following: w˙​σ∈Lab˙𝑤𝜎Lab\\dot{w}\\sigma\\in\\mathrm{Lab}, p˙​σ∈Prop˙𝑝𝜎Prop\\dot{p}\\sigma\\in\\mathrm{Prop}, A˙​σ∈ℒ˙𝐴𝜎ℒ\\dot{A}\\sigma\\in\\mathcal{L}, and λ˙​σ˙𝜆𝜎\\dot{\\lambda}\\sigma is a labeled sequent. We extend a substitution σ𝜎\\sigma to sets of schematic relational atoms, multisets of schematic labeled formulae, and schematic labeled sequents in the expected way by applying σ𝜎\\sigma to each label variable, atomic variable, formula variable, and labeled sequent variable occurring therein. If we want to indicate what variables are mapped to which labeled sequents, formulae, atoms, or labels then we write a substitution σ𝜎\\sigma as indicating that λ˙s​σ=λssubscript˙𝜆𝑠𝜎subscript𝜆𝑠\\dot{\\lambda}_{s}\\sigma=\\lambda_{s}, A˙i​σ=Aisubscript˙𝐴𝑖𝜎subscript𝐴𝑖\\dot{A}_{i}\\sigma=A_{i}, p˙j​σ=pjsubscript˙𝑝𝑗𝜎subscript𝑝𝑗\\dot{p}_{j}\\sigma=p_{j}, and w˙t​σ=wtsubscript˙𝑤𝑡𝜎subscript𝑤𝑡\\dot{w}_{t}\\sigma=w_{t} for s∈{1,…,r}𝑠1…𝑟s\\in\\{1,\\ldots,r\\}, i∈{1,…,n}𝑖1…𝑛i\\in\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}, j∈{1,…,k}𝑗1…𝑘j\\in\\{1,\\ldots,k\\}, and t∈{1,…,m}𝑡1…𝑚t\\in\\{1,\\ldots,m\\}. It follows from the above definition that applying a substitution to a schematic labeled sequent yields a labeled sequent as the result. We define a rule or inference rule to be a schema utilizing schematic labeled sequents, which produces a rule instance or rule application when a substitution is applied to each schematic labeled sequent occurring in the rule (see Example 2 below). When a substitution σ𝜎\\sigma is applied to a rule, we assume that every label variable, atomic variable, formula variable, and labeled sequent variable occurring in the rule is within the domain of σ𝜎\\sigma. The labeled calculus 𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍subscript𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{G3K_{t}} is defined to be set of the inference rules presented in Figures 5 and 6. 𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍subscript𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{G3K_{t}} contains the initial rules (i​d)𝑖𝑑(id), (⊥l)subscriptbottom𝑙(\\bot_{l}), and (⊤r)subscripttop𝑟(\\top_{r}), as well as logical rules for ¬\\neg, ∨\\lor, ∧\\land, and →→\\rightarrow, all of which are shown in Figure 5. We refer to each rule (i​d)𝑖𝑑(id), (⊥l)subscriptbottom𝑙(\\bot_{l}), and (⊤r)subscripttop𝑟(\\top_{r}) as an initial rule and refer to any labeled sequent generated by an initial rule as an initial sequent. The rules governing the introduction of modal formulae are provided in Figure 6, and we note that ([𝖦]r)subscriptdelimited-[]𝖦𝑟([\\mathsf{G}]_{r}), ([𝖧]r)subscriptdelimited-[]𝖧𝑟([\\mathsf{H}]_{r}), (⟨𝖥⟩l)subscriptdelimited-⟨⟩𝖥𝑙(\\langle\\mathsf{F}\\rangle_{l}), and (⟨𝖯⟩l)subscriptdelimited-⟨⟩𝖯𝑙(\\langle\\mathsf{P}\\rangle_{l}) have a side condition, namely, for any application of the rule with a substitution σ𝜎\\sigma, u˙​σ˙𝑢𝜎\\dot{u}\\sigma must be fresh, i.e must not occur in the conclusion of the rule application. As in the display setting, the explicitly presented formula(e) in the premise(s) of a rule is (are) referred to as auxiliary and the explicitly presented formula(e) in the conclusion is (are) called principal. We also note that the labeled sequent variable λ˙˙𝜆\\dot{\\lambda} in each inference rule provides the context of the rule when instantiated. This formulation of labeled sequent rules is new and will be helpful in studying and defining translations with display calculi later on since substitutions may be explicitly taken into account in translations. To provide the reader with intuition concerning the application of rules, we give two examples. First, let λ=(ℛ,Γ⇒Δ)𝜆⇒ℛΓΔ\\lambda=(\\mathcal{R},\\Gamma\\Rightarrow\\Delta) and σ=[λ/λ˙,q/p˙,u/w˙]𝜎𝜆˙𝜆𝑞˙𝑝𝑢˙𝑤\\sigma=[\\lambda/\\dot{\\lambda},q/\\dot{p},u/\\dot{w}]. Applying σ𝜎\\sigma to the rule (i​d)𝑖𝑑(id) (shown below left) yields the rule instance below right. Second, let λ=(ℛ,Γ⇒Δ)𝜆⇒ℛΓΔ\\lambda=(\\mathcal{R},\\Gamma\\Rightarrow\\Delta) and σ=[λ/λ˙,⟨𝖯⟩​p/A˙,w/w˙,v/u˙]𝜎𝜆˙𝜆delimited-⟨⟩𝖯𝑝˙𝐴𝑤˙𝑤𝑣˙𝑢\\sigma=[\\lambda/\\dot{\\lambda},\\langle\\mathsf{P}\\rangle p/\\dot{A},w/\\dot{w},v/\\dot{u}]. Applying σ′superscript𝜎′\\sigma^{\\prime} to the rule ([𝖦]r)subscriptdelimited-[]𝖦𝑟([\\mathsf{G}]_{r}) (shown below left) yields the rule instance below right. Proofs are defined in the usual, inductive way: each instance of an initial rule is a proof, and applying a rule to the conclusion of a proof, or between conclusions of proofs, yields a proof. We use ΠΠ\\Uppi and annotated versions thereof to denote labeled proofs. A labeled sequent is derivable iff it is the conclusion of a proof. As with display proofs, we use various metrics to quantify the size of, or certain aspects of, proofs. We define the quantity, width, and size of a proof just as in Definition 9 (though relative to labeled proofs), i.e. the quantity of a proof is equal to the number of sequents it contains, the width is defined to be the maximal length among all labeled sequents occurring in the proof, and the size is defined to be the product of the quantity and the width of the proof. For a labeled proof ΠΠ\\Uppi, we let q​(Π)𝑞Πq(\\Uppi) denote the quantity, w​(Π)𝑤Πw(\\Uppi) denote the width, and s​(Π)𝑠Πs(\\Uppi) denote the size. A rule is (quantity-preserving) admissible in a calculus iff for any instance of the rule, if each premise λisubscript𝜆𝑖\\lambda_{i} with 1≤i≤n1𝑖𝑛1\\leq i\\leq n is derivable with a proof ΠisubscriptΠ𝑖\\Uppi_{i}, then the conclusion is derivable with a proof ΠΠ\\Uppi (such that q​(Π)≤max⁡{q​(Πi)| 1≤i≤n}𝑞Πconditional𝑞subscriptΠ𝑖1𝑖𝑛q(\\Uppi)\\leq\\max\\{q(\\Uppi_{i})\\ |\\ 1\\leq i\\leq n\\}). To simplify terminology, we write qp-admissible rather than quantity-preserving admissible. The (qp-)admissible structural rules for 𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍subscript𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{G3K_{t}} are shown in Figure 7. More specifically, the rules (l​s)𝑙𝑠(ls), (cl)subscript𝑐𝑙(c_{l}), (cr)subscript𝑐𝑟(c_{r}), and (w)𝑤(w) rules are qp-admissible in 𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍subscript𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{G3K_{t}} and (c​u​t)𝑐𝑢𝑡(cut) is admissible . The (l​s)𝑙𝑠(ls) rule is called the labeled substitution rule because it applies a label substitution (w/u)𝑤𝑢(w/u) to any instance of the premise to obtain the conclusion. As usual, a label substitution (w/u)𝑤𝑢(w/u) replaces each label u𝑢u occurring in a labeled sequent by a label w𝑤w (see ). For example, (Ruv,w:A⇒u:B)(w/u)=(Rwv,w:A⇒w:B)(Ruv,w:A\\Rightarrow u:B)(w/u)=(Rwv,w:A\\Rightarrow w:B). To provide the reader with intuition, we give two examples of applications of structural rules. First, let λ=(Ruv,w:A⇒u:B)\\lambda=(Ruv,w:A\\Rightarrow u:B) and σ=[λ/λ˙,w/w˙,u/v˙]𝜎𝜆˙𝜆𝑤˙𝑤𝑢˙𝑣\\sigma=[\\lambda/\\dot{\\lambda},w/\\dot{w},u/\\dot{v}]. Applying σ𝜎\\sigma to the rule (l​s)𝑙𝑠(ls) (shown below left) yields the rule instance below right. Second, let λ=(ℛ,Γ⇒Δ)𝜆⇒ℛΓΔ\\lambda=(\\mathcal{R},\\Gamma\\Rightarrow\\Delta), λ′=(Rwu⇒w:A)\\lambda^{\\prime}=(Rwu\\Rightarrow w:A), and σ=[λ/λ˙,λ′/λ˙′]𝜎𝜆˙𝜆superscript𝜆′superscript˙𝜆′\\sigma=[\\lambda/\\dot{\\lambda},\\lambda^{\\prime}/\\dot{\\lambda}^{\\prime}]. Applying σ′superscript𝜎′\\sigma^{\\prime} to the rule (w)𝑤(w) (shown below left) yields the rule instance below right. As in the display setting, we not only want to provide a calculus for the minimal tense logic 𝖪𝗍subscript𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{K_{t}}, but also for extensions of 𝖪𝗍subscript𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{K_{t}} with (simplified) primitive tense axioms, i.e. for any tense logic 𝖪𝗍​𝖯subscript𝖪𝗍𝖯\\mathsf{K_{t}P}. To accomplish this goal, we define labeled versions of primitive tense structural rules, which have hitherto been undefined for labeled sequent calculi. Such rules are obtained in a similar fashion as in the display setting by means of transforming a simplified primitive tense axiom into a rule. This transformation is carried out via a translation function φw˙subscript𝜑˙𝑤\\varphi_{\\dot{w}}. We recursively define the translation function φw˙subscript𝜑˙𝑤\\varphi_{\\dot{w}} that maps formulae to schematic labeled sequents. φw˙​(⊤):=(∅⇒∅)assignsubscript𝜑˙𝑤top⇒\\varphi_{\\dot{w}}(\\top):=(\\emptyset\\Rightarrow\\emptyset) φw˙​(p):=λ˙pw˙assignsubscript𝜑˙𝑤𝑝superscriptsubscript˙𝜆𝑝˙𝑤\\varphi_{\\dot{w}}(p):=\\dot{\\lambda}_{p}^{\\dot{w}} φw˙​(A∧B):=φw˙​(A)⊗φw˙​(B)assignsubscript𝜑˙𝑤𝐴𝐵tensor-productsubscript𝜑˙𝑤𝐴subscript𝜑˙𝑤𝐵\\varphi_{\\dot{w}}(A\\land B):=\\varphi_{\\dot{w}}(A)\\otimes\\varphi_{\\dot{w}}(B) φw˙​(⟨𝖥⟩​A):=(R​w˙​u˙⇒∅)⊗φu˙​(A)assignsubscript𝜑˙𝑤delimited-⟨⟩𝖥𝐴tensor-product⇒𝑅˙𝑤˙𝑢subscript𝜑˙𝑢𝐴\\varphi_{\\dot{w}}(\\langle\\mathsf{F}\\rangle A):=(R\\dot{w}\\dot{u}\\Rightarrow\\emptyset)\\otimes\\varphi_{\\dot{u}}(A) with u˙˙𝑢\\dot{u} a new label variable φw​(⟨𝖯⟩​A):=(R​u˙​w˙⇒∅)⊗φu˙​(A)assignsubscript𝜑𝑤delimited-⟨⟩𝖯𝐴tensor-product⇒𝑅˙𝑢˙𝑤subscript𝜑˙𝑢𝐴\\varphi_{w}(\\langle\\mathsf{P}\\rangle A):=(R\\dot{u}\\dot{w}\\Rightarrow\\emptyset)\\otimes\\varphi_{\\dot{u}}(A) with u˙˙𝑢\\dot{u} a new label variable We note that each occurrence of λ˙pw˙superscriptsubscript˙𝜆𝑝˙𝑤\\dot{\\lambda}_{p}^{\\dot{w}} is taken to be a unique labeled sequent variable; e.g. both occurrences of λ˙pw˙superscriptsubscript˙𝜆𝑝˙𝑤\\dot{\\lambda}_{p}^{\\dot{w}} in φw˙​(p∧p)=λ˙pw˙⊗λ˙pw˙subscript𝜑˙𝑤𝑝𝑝tensor-productsuperscriptsubscript˙𝜆𝑝˙𝑤superscriptsubscript˙𝜆𝑝˙𝑤\\varphi_{\\dot{w}}(p\\land p)=\\dot{\\lambda}_{p}^{\\dot{w}}\\otimes\\dot{\\lambda}_{p}^{\\dot{w}} are taken to be unique labeled sequent variables. Labeled sequent variables obtained from the translation φw˙subscript𝜑˙𝑤\\varphi_{\\dot{w}} are annotated with label variables and atoms. This information is crucial for defining primitive tense structural rules in the labeled setting. First, the label variables tell us which labels must be fresh in a rule instance. Second, the atoms annotating labeled sequent variables tell us what substitutions are applicable, viz. labeled sequent variables annotated with the same atom must be instantiated with isomorphic labeled sequents (see Definition 18 below). These are restrictions on what substitutions may be applied to a primitive tense structural rule and they ensure the soundness of rule applications. Let λ1=ℛ1,Γ1⇒Δ1formulae-sequencesubscript𝜆1subscriptℛ1⇒subscriptΓ1subscriptΔ1\\lambda_{1}=\\mathcal{R}_{1},\\Gamma_{1}\\Rightarrow\\Delta_{1} and λ2=ℛ2,Γ2⇒Δ2formulae-sequencesubscript𝜆2subscriptℛ2⇒subscriptΓ2subscriptΔ2\\lambda_{2}=\\mathcal{R}_{2},\\Gamma_{2}\\Rightarrow\\Delta_{2} be two labeled sequent. They are isomorphic, written λ1≅λ2subscript𝜆1subscript𝜆2\\lambda_{1}\\cong\\lambda_{2}, iff there exists a function f:Lab​(λ1)→Lab​(λ2):𝑓→Labsubscript𝜆1Labsubscript𝜆2f:\\mathrm{Lab}(\\lambda_{1})\\to\\mathrm{Lab}(\\lambda_{2}) such that f𝑓f is bijective, R​w​u∈ℛ1𝑅𝑤𝑢subscriptℛ1Rwu\\in\\mathcal{R}_{1} iff R​f​(w)​f​(u)∈ℛ2𝑅𝑓𝑤𝑓𝑢subscriptℛ2Rf(w)f(u)\\in\\mathcal{R}_{2}, w:A∈Γ1:𝑤𝐴subscriptΓ1w:A\\in\\Gamma_{1} iff f​(w):A∈Γ2:𝑓𝑤𝐴subscriptΓ2f(w):A\\in\\Gamma_{2}, w:A∈Δ1:𝑤𝐴subscriptΔ1w:A\\in\\Delta_{1} iff f​(w):A∈Δ2:𝑓𝑤𝐴subscriptΔ2f(w):A\\in\\Delta_{2}. Let us now define primitive tense structural rules in the labeled setting. Every simplified primitive tense axiom can be transformed into a primitive tense structural rule, dubbed (p​tλ)𝑝subscript𝑡𝜆(pt_{\\lambda}). By extending 𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍subscript𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{G3K_{t}} with the set of (p​tλ)𝑝subscript𝑡𝜆(pt_{\\lambda}) rules corresponding to a set 𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{P} of (simplified) primitive tense axioms, we obtain a labeled calculus for a primitive tense logic 𝖪𝗍​𝖯subscript𝖪𝗍𝖯\\mathsf{K_{t}P}. Each simplified primitive tense axiom of the form shown below left corresponds to a primitive tense structural rule of the following form shown below right: The side condition ††{\\dagger} stipulates that for any instance of the rule under a substitution σ𝜎\\sigma, the following conditions must be satisfied: for each 1≤i≤m1𝑖𝑚1\\leq i\\leq m, if the label variable u˙˙𝑢\\dot{u} occurs in φw˙​(Bi)subscript𝜑˙𝑤subscript𝐵𝑖\\varphi_{\\dot{w}}(B_{i}), but does not occur in some labeled sequent variable, then u˙​σ˙𝑢𝜎\\dot{u}\\sigma must be fresh. for any two labeled sequent variables of the form λ˙pu˙superscriptsubscript˙𝜆𝑝˙𝑢\\dot{\\lambda}_{p}^{\\dot{u}} and λ˙pv˙superscriptsubscript˙𝜆𝑝˙𝑣\\dot{\\lambda}_{p}^{\\dot{v}} (i.e. for any two labeled sequent variables annotated with the same atom) occurring in the rule, λ˙pu˙​σ≅λ˙pv˙​σsuperscriptsubscript˙𝜆𝑝˙𝑢𝜎superscriptsubscript˙𝜆𝑝˙𝑣𝜎\\dot{\\lambda}_{p}^{\\dot{u}}\\sigma\\cong\\dot{\\lambda}_{p}^{\\dot{v}}\\sigma. for any labeled sequent variable λ˙pv˙superscriptsubscript˙𝜆𝑝˙𝑣\\dot{\\lambda}_{p}^{\\dot{v}}, if λ˙pv˙​σ≠(∅⇒∅)superscriptsubscript˙𝜆𝑝˙𝑣𝜎⇒\\dot{\\lambda}_{p}^{\\dot{v}}\\sigma\\neq(\\emptyset\\Rightarrow\\emptyset), then v˙​σ∈Lab​(λ˙pv˙​σ)˙𝑣𝜎Labsuperscriptsubscript˙𝜆𝑝˙𝑣𝜎\\dot{v}\\sigma\\in\\mathrm{Lab}(\\dot{\\lambda}_{p}^{\\dot{v}}\\sigma). Contrary to the display setting, each (p​tλ)𝑝subscript𝑡𝜆(pt_{\\lambda}) rule retains a copy of φw˙​(A)subscript𝜑˙𝑤𝐴\\varphi_{\\dot{w}}(A) in its premises, that is, the principal formulae are bottom-up preserved in rule applications. Formulating rules in this manner permits the qp-admissibility of contractions, so long as our calculus abides by the so-called ‘closure condition’ (cf. [5, p. 29]). To define the closure condition, let us take a (p​tλ)𝑝subscript𝑡𝜆(pt_{\\lambda}) rule as in Definition 19 above and suppose that we substitute certain label variables occurring in φw˙​(A)subscript𝜑˙𝑤𝐴\\varphi_{\\dot{w}}(A) by other label variables occurring in φw˙​(A)subscript𝜑˙𝑤𝐴\\varphi_{\\dot{w}}(A). If, after this substitution, all premises and the conclusion mutually contain (1) at least two copies of a schematic relational atom of the form (R​w˙​u˙⇒∅)⇒𝑅˙𝑤˙𝑢(R\\dot{w}\\dot{u}\\Rightarrow\\emptyset) or (2) at least two copies of a labeled sequent variable of the form λpw˙superscriptsubscript𝜆𝑝˙𝑤\\lambda_{p}^{\\dot{w}}, then we define a contraction of (p​tλ)𝑝subscript𝑡𝜆(pt_{\\lambda}) to be the rule obtained by deleting one of the duplicate copies, respectively. We then say that an extension of 𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍subscript𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{G3K_{t}} with a set of primitive tense structural rules and contractions thereof satisfies the closure condition iff the calculus is closed under the contraction of every primitive tense structural rule and every contraction thereof. We note that if we close the primitive tense structural rules of an extension of 𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍subscript𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{G3K_{t}} under contractions, then the resulting calculus is still finite. This follows from the fact that (1) we only consider extensions of 𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍subscript𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{G3K_{t}} with finitely many primitive tense structural rules, and (2) because each primitive tense structural rule has only finitely many contractions as only a finite number of label variable substitutions (as described above) are possible. To make the closure condition clearer, we provide an example of a primitive tense structural rule and a contraction of the rule. Let us consider the Euclidean axiom ⟨𝖯⟩​⟨𝖥⟩​p→⟨𝖥⟩​p→delimited-⟨⟩𝖯delimited-⟨⟩𝖥𝑝delimited-⟨⟩𝖥𝑝\\langle\\mathsf{P}\\rangle\\langle\\mathsf{F}\\rangle p\\rightarrow\\langle\\mathsf{F}\\rangle p (which is a simplified primitive tense axiom). The axiom’s corresponding primitive tense structural rule is as follows: \n\n  (Ru˙w˙⇒∅)⊗(Ru˙v˙⇒∅)⊗λ˙pv˙⊗(Rw˙z˙⇒)⊗λ˙pz˙⊗λ˙(R\\dot{u}\\dot{w}\\Rightarrow\\emptyset)\\otimes(R\\dot{u}\\dot{v}\\Rightarrow\\emptyset)\\otimes\\dot{\\lambda}_{p}^{\\dot{v}}\\otimes(R\\dot{w}\\dot{z}\\Rightarrow)\\otimes\\dot{\\lambda}_{p}^{\\dot{z}}\\otimes\\dot{\\lambda}\n   (e​u​c)𝑒𝑢𝑐(euc)\n           (R​u˙​w˙⇒∅)⊗(R​u˙​v˙⇒∅)⊗λ˙pv˙⊗λ˙tensor-product⇒𝑅˙𝑢˙𝑤⇒𝑅˙𝑢˙𝑣superscriptsubscript˙𝜆𝑝˙𝑣˙𝜆(R\\dot{u}\\dot{w}\\Rightarrow\\emptyset)\\otimes(R\\dot{u}\\dot{v}\\Rightarrow\\emptyset)\\otimes\\dot{\\lambda}_{p}^{\\dot{v}}\\otimes\\dot{\\lambda}\n If we substitute the label w˙˙𝑤\\dot{w} for u˙˙𝑢\\dot{u} and v˙˙𝑣\\dot{v}, then we obtain the following: \n\n  (Rw˙w˙⇒∅)⊗(Rw˙w˙⇒∅)⊗λ˙pw˙⊗(Rw˙z˙⇒)⊗λ˙pz˙⊗λ˙(R\\dot{w}\\dot{w}\\Rightarrow\\emptyset)\\otimes(R\\dot{w}\\dot{w}\\Rightarrow\\emptyset)\\otimes\\dot{\\lambda}_{p}^{\\dot{w}}\\otimes(R\\dot{w}\\dot{z}\\Rightarrow)\\otimes\\dot{\\lambda}_{p}^{\\dot{z}}\\otimes\\dot{\\lambda}\n  \n           (R​w˙​w˙⇒∅)⊗(R​w˙​w˙⇒∅)⊗λ˙pw˙⊗λ˙tensor-product⇒𝑅˙𝑤˙𝑤⇒𝑅˙𝑤˙𝑤superscriptsubscript˙𝜆𝑝˙𝑤˙𝜆(R\\dot{w}\\dot{w}\\Rightarrow\\emptyset)\\otimes(R\\dot{w}\\dot{w}\\Rightarrow\\emptyset)\\otimes\\dot{\\lambda}_{p}^{\\dot{w}}\\otimes\\dot{\\lambda}\n Since the schematic labeled sequent (R​w˙​w˙⇒∅)⇒𝑅˙𝑤˙𝑤(R\\dot{w}\\dot{w}\\Rightarrow\\emptyset) occurs twice, a contraction of (e​u​c)𝑒𝑢𝑐(euc) can be obtained by deleting the additional copy, yielding the following: \n\n  (Rw˙w˙⇒∅)⊗λ˙pw˙⊗(Rw˙z˙⇒)⊗λ˙pz˙⊗λ˙(R\\dot{w}\\dot{w}\\Rightarrow\\emptyset)\\otimes\\dot{\\lambda}_{p}^{\\dot{w}}\\otimes(R\\dot{w}\\dot{z}\\Rightarrow)\\otimes\\dot{\\lambda}_{p}^{\\dot{z}}\\otimes\\dot{\\lambda}\n   (e​u​c)′superscript𝑒𝑢𝑐′(euc)^{\\prime}\n           (R​w˙​w˙⇒∅)⊗λ˙pw˙⊗λ˙tensor-product⇒𝑅˙𝑤˙𝑤superscriptsubscript˙𝜆𝑝˙𝑤˙𝜆(R\\dot{w}\\dot{w}\\Rightarrow\\emptyset)\\otimes\\dot{\\lambda}_{p}^{\\dot{w}}\\otimes\\dot{\\lambda}\n We note that no contractions exist of the (e​u​c)′superscript𝑒𝑢𝑐′(euc)^{\\prime} rule as no substitution of label variables can produce duplications. As specified above, contractions are only possible when all premises and the conclusion share duplicate formulae of the form (R​w˙​u˙⇒∅)⇒𝑅˙𝑤˙𝑢(R\\dot{w}\\dot{u}\\Rightarrow\\emptyset) or λ˙pw˙superscriptsubscript˙𝜆𝑝˙𝑤\\dot{\\lambda}_{p}^{\\dot{w}}, yet, the conclusion of (e​u​c)′superscript𝑒𝑢𝑐′(euc)^{\\prime} is of a form that precludes this possibility. Let 𝖪𝗍​𝖯subscript𝖪𝗍𝖯\\mathsf{K_{t}P} be a primitive tense logic. We define 𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍​𝖯subscript𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍𝖯\\mathsf{G3K_{t}P} to be 𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍subscript𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{G3K_{t}} extended with a (p​tλ)𝑝subscript𝑡𝜆(pt_{\\lambda}) rule and all contractions thereof, for each simplified primitive tense axiom in 𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{P}. We indicate that a labeled sequent λ𝜆\\lambda is provable in 𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍​𝖯subscript𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍𝖯\\mathsf{G3K_{t}P} with a labeled proof ΠΠ\\Uppi by writing 𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍​𝖯,Π⊩λforcessubscript𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍𝖯Π𝜆\\mathsf{G3K_{t}P},\\Uppi\\Vdash\\lambda. The (l​s)𝑙𝑠(ls), (w)𝑤(w), (cl)subscript𝑐𝑙(c_{l}), and (cr)subscript𝑐𝑟(c_{r}) rules are qp-admissible in 𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍​𝖯subscript𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍𝖯\\mathsf{G3K_{t}P} and (c​u​t)𝑐𝑢𝑡(cut) is admissible. Follows from Lemma 2.3.4, Theorem 2.3.6, Theorem 2.3.8, and Theorem 2.3.10 of . The qp-admissibility of (l​s)𝑙𝑠(ls), (w)𝑤(w), (cl)subscript𝑐𝑙(c_{l}), and (cr)subscript𝑐𝑟(c_{r}) is proven in 𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍​𝖯subscript𝖦𝟥𝖪𝗍𝖯\\mathsf{G3K_{t}P} by showing that each rule can be permuted upward in any proof and deleted at initial rules (while preserving the quantity of the proof). Therefore, this method of proof, which relies on rule permutations, shows the existence of an algorithm that takes a proof with structural rules as input and returns a proof without such rules as output. Such proof transformations are computable in PTIMEPTIME\\mathrm{PTIME} in the size of the input proof. This is because if our input proof is ΠΠ\\Uppi, then there are most q​(Π)𝑞Πq(\\Uppi) occurrences of structural rules in ΠΠ\\Uppi, and for each such occurrence at most q​(Π)𝑞Πq(\\Uppi) many permutations need to be made, showing that the algorithm performs at most q​(Π)×q​(Π)≤s​(Π)2𝑞Π𝑞Π𝑠superscriptΠ2q(\\Uppi)\\times q(\\Uppi)\\leq s(\\Uppi)^{2} many permutations. Moreover, the width of the output proof will always be bounded by q​(Π)×w​(Π)=s​(Π)𝑞Π𝑤Π𝑠Πq(\\Uppi)\\times w(\\Uppi)=s(\\Uppi). This is straightforward to verify in the (l​s)𝑙𝑠(ls), (cl)subscript𝑐𝑙(c_{l}), and (cr)subscript𝑐𝑟(c_{r}) cases, which may reduce the length of labeled sequents when permuted upward; in the case of (w)𝑤(w), which weakens in a labeled sequent λ𝜆\\lambda, ℓ​(λ)≤w​(Π)ℓ𝜆𝑤Π\\ell(\\lambda)\\leq w(\\Uppi), so permuting numerous instances of (w)𝑤(w) upward may increase the length of the ‘longest’ labeled sequent occurring in ΠΠ\\Uppi, and thus, the width of the output proof will be at most q​(Π)×w​(Π)𝑞Π𝑤Πq(\\Uppi)\\times w(\\Uppi). Since (l​s)𝑙𝑠(ls), (w)𝑤(w), (cl)subscript𝑐𝑙(c_{l}), and (cr)subscript𝑐𝑟(c_{r}) are qp-admissible, this shows that the size of the output proof is polynomial in the size of the input proof and that the proof transformations eliminating (l​s)𝑙𝑠(ls), (w)𝑤(w), (cl)subscript𝑐𝑙(c_{l}), and (cr)subscript𝑐𝑟(c_{r}) instances are computable in PTIMEPTIME\\mathrm{PTIME}.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: who employed spotted formulae in the construction of sequent systems for modal logics.
