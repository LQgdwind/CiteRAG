      "content": "Paper Title: Multicriteria Scalable Graph Drawing via Stochastic Gradient Descent, (ùëÜ‚Å¢ùê∫‚Å¢ùê∑)¬≤\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany criteria associated with the readability of graph drawings have been proposed¬†. Most graph layout algorithms are designed to (explicitly or implicitly) optimize a single criterion.\nFor instance, a classic layout criterion is stress minimization ¬†, where stress is defined by ‚àëi<jwi‚Äãj‚Äã(|Xi‚àíXj|‚àídi‚Äãj)2subscriptùëñùëósubscriptùë§ùëñùëósuperscriptsubscriptùëãùëñsubscriptùëãùëósubscriptùëëùëñùëó2\\sum\\limits_{i<j}w_{ij}(|X_{i}-X_{j}|-d_{ij})^{2}. Here, XùëãX is a n√ó2ùëõ2n\\times 2 matrix containing coordinates for the nùëõn nodes, di‚Äãjsubscriptùëëùëñùëód_{ij} is typically the graph-theoretical distance between two nodes iùëñi and jùëój and wi‚Äãj=di‚Äãj‚àíŒ±subscriptùë§ùëñùëósuperscriptsubscriptùëëùëñùëóùõºw_{ij}=d_{ij}^{-\\alpha} is a normalization factor with Œ±ùõº\\alpha equal to 0,1010,1 or 222. Thus reducing the stress in a layout corresponds to computing node positions so that the actual distance between pairs of nodes is proportional to the graph theoretic distance between them. Optimizing stress can be accomplished by stress minimization, or stress majorization, which can speed up the computation¬†. In this paper we only consider drawing in the Euclidean plane, however, stress can be also optimized in other spaces such as the torus¬†. Stress minimization corresponds to optimizing the global structure of the layout, as the stress metric takes into account all pairwise distances in the graph. The t-SNET algorithm of Kruiger et al.¬† directly optimizes neighborhood preservation, which captures the local structure of a graph, as the\nneighborhood preservation metric only considers distances between pairs of nodes that are close to each other.\nOptimizing local or global distance preservation can be seen as special cases of the more general dimensionality reduction approaches such as multi-dimensional scaling¬† [ref]41. Purchase et al.¬† showed that the readability of graphs increases if a layout has fewer edge crossings. The underlying optimization problem is NP-hard and several graph drawing contests have been organized with the objective of minimizing the number of crossings in the graph drawings¬† . Recently several algorithms that directly minimize crossings have been proposed\n¬† . The negative impact on graph readability due to edge crossings can be mitigated if crossing pairs of edges have a large crossings angle¬†[ref]4   . Formally, the crossing angle of a straight-line drawing of a graph is the minimum angle between two crossing edges in the layout, and optimizing this property is also NP-hard.\nRecent graph drawing contests have been organized with the objective of maximizing the crossings angle in graph drawings and this has led to several heuristics for this problem¬† . The algorithms above are very effective at optimizing the specific readability criterion they are designed for, but they cannot be directly used to optimize additional criteria. This is a desirable goal, since optimizing one criterion often leads to poor layouts with respect to one or more other criteria: for example, algorithms that optimize the crossing angle tend to create drawings with high stress and no neighborhood preservation¬†. Davidson and Harel¬† used simulated annealing to optimize different graph readability criteria (keeping nodes away from other nodes and edges, uniform edge lengths, minimizing edge crossings). Huang et al.¬† extended a force-directed algorithm to optimize crossing angle and angular resolution by incorporating two additional angle forces. The authors show that in addition to optimizing crossing angle and angular resolution, the algorithm also improves other desirable properties (average size of crossing angles, standard deviation of crossing angles, standard deviations of angular resolution, etc.). In a force-directed method similar to the algorithm proposed by Huang et al.¬†, to optimize each criterion one needs to design a new force. The new force can be considered as a gradient update by hand, whereas (S‚ÄãG‚ÄãD)2superscriptùëÜùê∫ùê∑2(SGD)^{2} is a gradient descent based algorithm where the gradients are computed automatically using auto-differentiation tools. Recently, several approaches have been proposed to simultaneously improve multiple layout criteria. Wang et al.¬† propose a revised formulation of stress that can be used to specify ideal edge direction in addition to ideal edge lengths in a graph drawing. Wang et al.¬† extended that stress formulation to produce structure-aware and smooth fish-eye views of graphs.\nDevkota et al.¬† also use a stress-based approach to minimize edge crossings and maximize crossing angles.\nEades et al.¬†5 provided a technique to draw large graphs while optimizing different geometric criteria, including the Gabriel graph property. Although the approaches above are designed to optimize multiple criteria, they cannot be naturally extended to handle other optimization goals. Constraint-based layout algorithms such as COLA¬†2 1, can be used to enforce separation constraints on pairs of nodes to support properties such as customized node ordering or downward pointing edges. The coordinates of two nodes are related by inequalities in the form of xi‚â•xj+g‚Äãa‚Äãpsubscriptùë•ùëñsubscriptùë•ùëóùëîùëéùëùx_{i}\\geq x_{j}+gap for a node pair (i,j)ùëñùëó(i,j). Dwyer et al.¬†3 use gradient projection to handle these constraints, be moving nodes as little as needed to satisfy the inequalities/ equalities after each iteration of the layout method. The gradient projection method has been extended to also handle non-linear constraints¬†4. These hard constraints are powerful but a bit restrictive and are different from the soft constraints in our (S‚ÄãG‚ÄãD)2superscriptùëÜùê∫ùê∑2(SGD)^{2} framework.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: that are close to each other.\nOptimizing local or global distance preservation can be seen as special cases of the more general dimensionality reduction approaches such as multi-dimensional scaling¬† [ref]41.
