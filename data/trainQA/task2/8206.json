      "content": "Paper Title: Grounding is All You Need? Dual Temporal Grounding for Video Dialog\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSome SOTA methods utilize extra information of video, such as caption, subtitle, and so on. However, these additional data sources are not always accessible in real application. To make a fair comparison, we only take video content and dialog history as input. We mainly make the comparison with the following state-of-the-art methods: JST , VGD-GPT2 , SCGA [ref]14, MTN ,\nFA+HRED , Student-Teacher , BiST [ref]19, and COST .\nAmong them, Student-Teacher  and JST  utilize teacher model to obtain additional information from summary. SCGA [ref]14 and COST  employ extracted object features to interact with text. FA+HRED , MTN  and BiST [ref]19 use multiple attention for cross-modal fusion. VGD-GPT2  inherits the embedding and text generation capabilities of pre-trained model. The performances of other SOTA methods are reported according to their respective papers or by running their released codes. As shown in Tab. 1, DTGVD achieves the best performance across all metrics on AVSD@DSTC-7. Compared with the current SOTA method COST, DTGVD achieves 5.8% improvement (0.423 vs 0.400) in BLEU-4, and 5.5% improvement (1.145 vs 1.085) in CIDEr.\nOn AVSD@DSTC-8, results are reported in Tab. 2. DTGVD still shows performance improvement on 6 out of 8 metrics compared with other SOTA (1.076 vs 1.051 in CIDEr). Among these metrics, BLEU focuses on precision, ROUGE-L emphasizes recall, METEOR considers both, and CIDEr pays more attention to key information.\nDue to more accurate utilization of useful information in both video and history, the answers generated by DTGVD are more capable of filtering out irrelevant information and focusing on key information in relevant history. Therefore, it leads to a significant improvement in BLEU and CIDEr. For other existing SOTA methods, using the entire video and all history turns (or several recent history turns) often leads to the inclusion of interference information in the generated answers, resulting in significant deficiencies in BLEU and CIDEr. The removal of irrelevant information by DTGVD inevitably results in answers that focus more on key information, but lack some less useful words that can improve recall. This results in some “unreal” deficiencies in METEOR and ROUGE-L for DTGVD in AVSD@DSTC8.\nTherefore, we added Avg to represent the average of all metrics to reduce the impact of shortcoming of a single evaluation method. Avg results indicate that DTGVD has significant advantages on both datasets. Additionally, we conducted human evaluation comparing our model to the current SOTA model, COST , to further validate the evaluation results.\nIn terms of fluency, DTGVD scored 4.221 while COST scored 4.109. In terms of accuracy, DTGVD scored 3.678 while COST scored 3.237.\nThe greater enhancement in accuracy can be attributed to DTGVD’s refined emphasis on related segments within both text and video.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: real application.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
