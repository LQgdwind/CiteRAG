      "content": "Paper Title: Generative Densification: Learning to Densify Gaussians for High-Fidelity Generalizable 3D Reconstruction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS)  has been a massive success in high-quality 3D scene reconstruction and real-time novel view synthesis, representing a 3D scene with a set of learnable Gaussian primitives and exploiting a fast differentiable rasterization pipeline.\nSince its introduction, numerous studies have explored 3D-GS as a versatile 3D representation with various applications extending beyond the per-scene optimization.\nOne notable example is generalized feed-forward Gaussian models  [ref]5    [ref]3 [ref]7  , which generate 3D Gaussian primitives to reconstruct 3D scenes or objects in a single forward pass.\nBy leveraging 3D prior knowledge learned from large multi-view datasets (e.g., Objaverse  , RE10K ), these models can reconstruct the 3D scene or objects with the generated 3D Gaussians from only a single or a few images. While effective and promising, the feed-forward Gaussian models often face challenges in capturing high-frequency details primarily due to the limited number of Gaussians and the lack of a densification strategy tailored for these approaches.\nOne possible solution is to generate more Gaussians, but this does not fully address the problem.\nFor example, in the pixel-aligned Gaussian model [ref]3, a widely adopted architecture in the feed-forward models (see Sec. 2 for details), we can predict multiple Gaussians per pixel.\nHowever, this strategy uniformly increases the number of Gaussians across the entire 3D space, resulting in an excess of unnecessary small Gaussians that may degrade rendering quality and speed.\nIdeally, the scene details should be represented by numerous small Gaussians, while smoother regions can be covered by a few large Gaussians. In per-scene 3D-GS optimization, an adaptive densification strategy selectively increases the number of Gaussians to better reconstruct complex 3D geometry and fine details.\nSpecifically, every few optimization steps, it densifies only the Gaussians with large view-space positional gradients, replicating the existing Gaussians or splitting them into smaller ones when more Gaussians are required.\nThrough repeated optimization and densification processes, the Gaussians gradually become non-uniformly distributed, with numerous small Gaussians concentrated in detailed areas and a few large Gaussians scattered across smooth regions.\nThis simple heuristic algorithm has demonstrated its effectiveness across various real-world scenes and objects. A straightforward approach to extend the densification strategy to the feed-forward Gaussian models is to fine-tune the output Gaussians from the feed-forward models using the original 3D-GS optimization and densification procedure.\nHowever, directly applying the densification strategy used in per-scene optimization scenarios presents several challenges.\nFor example, it demands hundreds and thousands of optimization steps to converge and reconstruct the fine details, which significantly reduces generation speed.\nAdditionally, the per-scene 3D-GS optimization usually assumes many input images from various viewpoints, whereas the feed-forward models typically take just a few views or even a single view image.\nThus, the densification and extensive optimization to a few view images can easily lead to overfitting, compromising the feed-forward models’ ability to generalize and synthesize novel views effectively. In this paper, we propose Generative Densification (GD), an efficient generative densification strategy for generalized feed-forward Gaussian models, which is designed in accordance with the following principles: 1) adaptability, allowing the model to distinguish Gaussians that requires densification and those do not; and 2) generalizability, enabling the model to learn and leverage prior knowledge from large multi-view datasets.\nInspired by the 3D-GS densification strategy, our approach leverages view-space positional gradients to identify where additional Gaussians are needed.\nWe selectively densify the top KK Gaussians with large gradients, and the remaining (non-selected) Gaussians are used together with the densified ones to render high-fidelity images (Fig. 2).\nUnlike the 3D-GS densification strategy, the proposed GD densifies the selected Gaussians based on the learned prior knowledge for the purpose of generalizable 3D reconstruction.\nMore specifically, GD densifies the feature representations from the feed-forward models rather than the actual Gaussians, and the prior knowledge is embedded in these features for better generalization. We further propose to utilize an efficient point-level transformer  to implement GD.\nDue to the quadratic increase in memory and the unstructured nature of point-level 3D data, it is infeasible to apply naive self-attention on hundreds of thousands of input Gaussians.\nWhile local attention can be applied within groups of neighboring Gaussians, finding the neighbors by calculating and comparing distances between the Gaussians is computationally expensive.\nInstead, we sort the Gaussians in traversing order of space-filling curves  to rearrange them into non-overlapping groups and apply group-wise attention, enabling efficient operations directly in 3D space.\nAdditionally, while we selectively densify the Gaussians with large view-space positional gradients, multiple rounds of densification are unnecessary for all of them.\nTo optimize this process, we predict a confidence mask for each densification layer to filter out the Gaussians that do not require further densification. We integrated GD into two recent feed-forward Gaussian models: LaRa [ref]5 for object-level reconstruction and MVSplat [ref]7 for scene-level reconstruction.\nOn the large-scale Gobjaverse  and RE10K  datasets, two models incorporating our method achieved the best performance, significantly improving reconstruction quality compared to their respective baselines.\nQualitative analysis further highlights that the fine Gaussians generated by GD effectively capture thin structures and intricate details, which are often challenging for the coarse Gaussians to represent accurately (Generative Densification: Learning to Densify Gaussians for High-Fidelity Generalizable 3D Reconstruction).\nAdditionally, cross-dataset evaluations confirm that GD consistently improves image quality, demonstrating its robust generalizability across different datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: studies have explored 3D-GS as a versatile 3D representation with various applications extending beyond the per-scene optimization.\nOne notable example is generalized feed-forward Gaussian models  [ref]5    [ref]3 [ref]7  , which generate 3D Gaussian primitives to reconstruct 3D scenes or objects in a single forward pass.\nBy leveraging 3D prior knowledge learned from large multi-view datasets\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
