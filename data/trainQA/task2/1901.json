Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

This testbed currently provides seven multi-domain datasets (i.e. ColoredMNIST [ref]1, RotatedMNIST , VLCS , PACS , OfficeHome , and TerraIncognita , DomainNet ) and provides benchmarks results of 14 baseline approaches (i.e. ERM , IRM [ref]1, GroupDRO , Mixup , MLDG 7, CORAL 8, MMD 8, DANN , CDANN 9, MTL , SagNet 2, ARM , VREx 5, RSC 2). As shown in Table 4, we also report scores for our model evaluated in the setting of DomainBed. We observe in Table 4 that ours generally shows matched or better performance against alternative state-of-the-art methods, where ours is ranked 2nd places in terms of average of all seven benchmarks. Note that ours does not use IDCL and SWA (3.4) techniques, which we confirmed that further improvements are highly achievable combined with these techniques. We provide more detailed scores for each domain in the appendix. Note that DANN  and CORAL 8 are designed to take examples from the target domain during training – i.e. CORAL 8 is trained to minimize the distance between covariances of the source and target features. Note also that some studies 2  9 use the adversarial learning setting to obtain an unknown domain-invariant feature by fitting implicit generative models, such as GAN (generative adversarial networks). Though GAN is a powerful framework, the alternating gradient updates procedure is often highly unstable and often results in mode collapse 4.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: experiments using DomainBed , which is a unified testbed useful for evaluating domain generalization algorithms.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
