      "content": "Paper Title: Inexact bilevel stochastic gradient methods for constrained and unconstrained lower-level problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn bilevel stochastic optimization, fusubscript𝑓𝑢f_{u} and fℓsubscript𝑓ℓf_{\\ell} can be interpreted as expected values, namely, fu=𝔼​[fu​(x,y,ϑu)]subscript𝑓𝑢𝔼delimited-[]subscript𝑓𝑢𝑥𝑦superscriptitalic-ϑ𝑢f_{u}=\\mathbb{E}[f_{u}(x,y,\\vartheta^{u})] and fℓ=𝔼​[fℓ​(x,y,ϑℓ)]subscript𝑓ℓ𝔼delimited-[]subscript𝑓ℓ𝑥𝑦superscriptitalic-ϑℓf_{\\ell}=\\mathbb{E}[f_{\\ell}(x,y,\\vartheta^{\\ell})], where ϑusuperscriptitalic-ϑ𝑢\\vartheta^{u} and ϑℓsuperscriptitalic-ϑℓ\\vartheta^{\\ell} are random variables defined in a probability space (with probability measure independent from x𝑥x and y𝑦y) such that i.i.d. samples can be observed or generated.\nThe same applies to the functions possibly defining Y​(x)𝑌𝑥Y(x).\n(To keep the notation simple, we are using the same fusubscript𝑓𝑢f_{u} and fℓsubscript𝑓ℓf_{\\ell} for deterministic and random variants.) Having in mind ML applications, the methods that we are considering are Stochastic Approximation (SA) techniques, of the type of the stochastic gradient (SG) method   [ref]53 for single-objective optimization. In fact, the bilevel stochastic gradient (BSG) method can be seen as an SG method applied to (1.1), which leads to xk+1=xk−αk​gkBSGsubscript𝑥𝑘1subscript𝑥𝑘subscript𝛼𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑔𝑘BSGx_{k+1}=x_{k}-\\alpha_{k}g_{k}^{\\operatorname{BSG}}, where\nαksubscript𝛼𝑘\\alpha_{k} is the step size or learning rate and gkBSGsuperscriptsubscript𝑔𝑘BSGg_{k}^{\\operatorname{BSG}} is a stochastic gradient of f𝑓f. Such a stochastic gradient is obtained by sampling the gradients and Hessians in (1.2) at (xk,y~k)subscript𝑥𝑘subscript~𝑦𝑘(x_{k},\\tilde{y}_{k}), with y~ksubscript~𝑦𝑘\\tilde{y}_{k} denoting an approximation to the LL optimal solution. The stochastic gradient gkBSGsuperscriptsubscript𝑔𝑘BSGg_{k}^{\\operatorname{BSG}} is inexact when y~k≠y​(xk)subscript~𝑦𝑘𝑦subscript𝑥𝑘\\tilde{y}_{k}\\neq y(x_{k}), even in the full-batch (deterministic) case. In general, BSG methods have mainly been considered for the LL unconstrained case (i.e., Y​(x)=ℝm𝑌𝑥superscriptℝ𝑚Y(x)=\\mathbb{R}^{m}) and are commonly classified according to the approach used to compute the BSG direction gkBSGsuperscriptsubscript𝑔𝑘BSGg_{k}^{\\operatorname{BSG}} [ref]35. In particular, a first category, referred to as implicit differentiation, is composed of algorithms that compute the BSG direction by applying the implicit function theorem and either solving the adjoint equation  or using a truncated Neumann series to approximate the inverse Hessian ∇y​y2fℓ−1superscriptsubscript∇𝑦𝑦2superscriptsubscript𝑓ℓ1\\nabla_{yy}^{2}f_{\\ell}^{-1} . Note that using a truncated Neumann series requires ‖∇y​y2fℓ‖2<1subscriptnormsuperscriptsubscript∇𝑦𝑦2subscript𝑓ℓ21\\|\\nabla_{yy}^{2}f_{\\ell}\\|_{2}<1, which is a strong assumption. Therefore, a common approach is to first assume ∇yfℓsubscript∇𝑦subscript𝑓ℓ\\nabla_{y}f_{\\ell} Lipschitz continuous in y𝑦y with constant C0subscript𝐶0C_{0}, and then apply the truncated Neumann series to approximate [(1/C0)​∇y​y2fℓ]−1superscriptdelimited-[]1subscript𝐶0superscriptsubscript∇𝑦𝑦2subscript𝑓ℓ1[(1/C_{0})\\nabla_{yy}^{2}f_{\\ell}]^{-1}. However, this requires the knowledge of C0subscript𝐶0C_{0}, which is typically unknown in practice. A second category, referred to as iterative differentiation, includes all the approaches based on automatic differentiation through dynamic systems   .\nA general convergence theory for the two classes of algorithms was proposed in [ref]29, which also shows that computing the BSG direction by using automatic differentiation can be less computationally efficient than using an implicit differentiation method. Therefore, our paper focuses on the first category, which has been promoted in       (see also [ref]35  for recent reviews).\nThese existing approaches either focus on a specific problem structure or require the LL problem to be solved to optimality at each iteration or rely on a truncated Neumann series for the inverse Hessian approximation in the adjoint gradient, which has the issues mentioned before. Among all the algorithms proposed in the papers cited above, we emphasize StocBiO [ref]29. StocBiO employs a truncated Neumann series with automatic differentiation and a double-loop iterative scheme, which means that multiple iterations are required at the LL problem in order for the algorithm to converge, similar to the algorithms developed in our paper. DARTS  is an optimization technique related to the BSG method and has enjoyed great popularity in NAS.\nIt always considers an inexact solution to the LL problem, and it starts an iteration by applying one step of SG to the LL problem,\ny~k=yk−η​∇yfℓ​(xk,yk)subscript~𝑦𝑘subscript𝑦𝑘𝜂subscript∇𝑦subscript𝑓ℓsubscript𝑥𝑘subscript𝑦𝑘\\tilde{y}_{k}=y_{k}-\\eta\\nabla_{y}f_{\\ell}(x_{k},y_{k}), where η𝜂\\eta is a fixed step size. Then,\nit displaces the UL variables using\nxk+1=xk−η​gkDARTSsubscript𝑥𝑘1subscript𝑥𝑘𝜂superscriptsubscript𝑔𝑘DARTSx_{k+1}=x_{k}-\\eta\\,g_{k}^{\\operatorname{DARTS}}, where gkDARTSsuperscriptsubscript𝑔𝑘DARTSg_{k}^{\\operatorname{DARTS}} is computed by applying the chain rule to ∇xfu​(x,y−η​∇yfℓ​(x,y))subscript∇𝑥subscript𝑓𝑢𝑥𝑦𝜂subscript∇𝑦subscript𝑓ℓ𝑥𝑦\\nabla_{x}f_{u}(x,y-\\eta\\nabla_{y}f_{\\ell}(x,y)), leading to (when using full-batch gradients) However, in the full-batch (deterministic) case, gkDARTSsuperscriptsubscript𝑔𝑘DARTSg_{k}^{\\operatorname{DARTS}} may not be a descent direction.\nThe matrix-vector product in (1.5) is approximated by finite differences, rendering DARTS free of both second-order derivatives and matrix-vector products (see Section 5.2). All the papers cited above focus on the LL unconstrained case. A few approaches dealing with the LL constrained case have been very recently proposed to tackle bilevel problems with LL constraints. However, all these approaches are only applicable to linear constraints or constraints only depending on y𝑦y     . Among the algorithms proposed, we highlight SIGD , which determines a direction by applying the implicit function theorem (similar to the approach that we use) but can only be applied to bilevel problems with linear LL constraints in y𝑦y.\n\nReference markers found: [53]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]53: and random variants.)
