      "content": "Paper Title: Parameterized Complexity of Streaming Diameter and Connectivity Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph algorithms, such as to compute the diameter of an unweighted graph (Diameter) or to determine whether it is connected (Connectivity), often rely on keeping the entire graph in (random access) memory. However, very large networks might not fit in memory. Hence, graph streaming has been proposed as a paradigm where the graph is inspected through a so-called stream, in which its edges appear one by one . To compensate for the assumption of limited memory, multiple passes may be made over the stream and computation time is assumed to be unlimited. The complexity theory question is which problems remain solvable and which problems are hard in such a model, taking into account trade-offs between the amount of memory and passes. Many graph streaming problems require Ω​(n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(n) bits of memory   for a constant number of passes on n𝑛n-vertex graphs.\nAny p𝑝p-pass algorithm for Connectivity needs Ω​(n/p)Ω𝑛𝑝\\Omega(n/p) bits of memory . Single pass algorithms for Connectivity or Diameter need Ω​(n​log⁡n)Ω𝑛𝑛\\Omega(n\\log n) bits of memory on sparse graphs .\nA 222-approximation of Diameter requires Ω​(n3/2)Ωsuperscript𝑛32\\Omega(n^{3/2}) bits of memory on weighted graphs .\nA naive streaming algorithm for Connectivity or Diameter stores the entire graph, using 𝒪​(m​log⁡n)=𝒪​(n2​log⁡n)𝒪𝑚𝑛𝒪superscript𝑛2𝑛\\mathcal{O}(m\\log n)=\\mathcal{O}(n^{2}\\log n) bits and a single pass. For Connectivity, union-find yields a 111-pass, 𝒪​(n​log⁡n)𝒪𝑛𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n\\log n) bits of memory, algorithm . One of the possible underlying reasons why Diameter and Connectivity are hard is that classic algorithms for them rely on breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS). These seem difficult to execute efficiently in a streaming setting. It was a longstanding open problem to compute a DFS tree using o​(n)𝑜𝑛o(n) passes and o​(m​log⁡n)𝑜𝑚𝑛o(m\\log n) bits of memory. This barrier was recently broken , through an algorithm that uses 𝒪​(n/k)𝒪𝑛𝑘\\mathcal{O}(n/k) passes and 𝒪​(n​k​log⁡n)𝒪𝑛𝑘𝑛\\mathcal{O}(nk\\log n) bits of memory, for any k𝑘k.\nThe situation for computing single-source shortest paths seems similar , although good approximations exist even on weighted graphs (see e.g.  ).\nWe do know that DFS algorithms cannot be executed in logarithmic space . In streaming, any BFS algorithm that explores k𝑘k layers of the BFS tree must use at least k/2𝑘2k/2 passes or Ω​(n1+1/k/(log⁡n)1/k)Ωsuperscript𝑛11𝑘superscript𝑛1𝑘\\Omega(n^{1+1/k}/(\\log n)^{1/k}) space .\nHence, much remains unexplored when it comes to graph exploration- and graph distance-related streaming problems such as BFS/DFS, Diameter, and Connectivity. In particular, most lower bounds hold for general graphs. As such, a more fine-grained view of the complexity of these problems has so far been lacking. In this paper, we seek to obtain this fine-grained view using parameterized complexity [ref]27.\nThe idea of using parameterized complexity in the streaming setting was first introduced by Fafianie and Kratsch  and Chitnis et al. . Many problems are hard in streaming parameterized by their solution size   . Crucially, however, deciding whether a graph has a vertex cover of size k𝑘k has a one-pass, 𝒪~​(k2)~𝒪superscript𝑘2\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(k^{2})-memory kernelization algorithm by Chitnis et al. , and a 2ksuperscript2𝑘2^{k}-passes, 𝒪~​(k)~𝒪𝑘\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(k)-memory direct algorithm by Chitnis and Cormode .\nBishnu et al. [ref]11 then showed that knowing a vertex cover of size k𝑘k is useful in solving other deletion problems using p​(k)𝑝𝑘p(k) passes and f​(k)​log⁡n𝑓𝑘𝑛f(k)\\log n memory, notably H𝐻H-free deletion; this approach was recently expanded on by Oostveen and van Leeuwen . This leads to the more general question how knowing a (small) H𝐻H-free modulator, that is, a set X𝑋X such that G−X𝐺𝑋G-X has no induced subgraph isomorphic to H𝐻H (note that H=P2𝐻subscript𝑃2H=P_{2} in Vertex Cover [k𝑘k]), would affect the complexity of streaming problems and of BFS/DFS, Diameter, and Connectivity in particular.\nWe are not aware of any investigations in this direction. An important consideration is the streaming model\n(see     or the survey by McGregor ). In the Edge Arrival (EA) model, where each edge of the graph appears once in the stream, and the edges appear in some fixed but arbitrary order. Most aforementioned results use this model. In the Vertex Arrival (VA) model the edges arrive grouped per vertex, and an edge is revealed at its endpoint that arrives latest.\nIn the Adjacency List (AL) model the edges also arrive grouped per vertex, but each edge is present for both its endpoints. This means we see each edge twice and when a vertex arrives we immediately see all its adjacencies (rather than some subset dependent on the arrival order, as in the VA model).\nThis model is quite strong, but as we shall see, unavoidable for our positive results.\nWe do not consider dynamic streaming models in this paper, although they do exist.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: general graphs.
