      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Transferable Parameters for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOffice-31 [ref]41 is a standard UDA dataset consisting of three distinct domains, Amazon from the Amazon website, Webcam by the web camera, and DSLR by digital SLR camera (see Fig. 2). It has 4,652 images with 31 unbalanced classes. Office-Home  is a more challenging domain adaptation dataset consisting of 15,599 images with 65 unbalanced classes. It consists of four more distinct domains: Artistic images, Clip Art, Product images, and Real-world images (see Fig. 3). DomainNet  is the most challenging domain adaptation dataset consisting of six different domains: clipart collected from clipart images, real collected from photo-realistic or real-world images, sketch collected from the sketches of specific objects, infographic images with specific object, painting artistic depictions of objects in the form of paintings and quickdraw, and quickdraw collected from the drawings of game (see Fig. 4). This dataset contains about 600,000 images distributed in 345 categories. VisDA-2017  is a simulation-to-real dataset with two extremely distinct domains: Synthetic 2D renderings of 3D models generated from different angles and with different lighting conditions, and Real collected from photo-realistic or real-world image datasets (see Fig. 5). With 280,000 images in 12 classes, the scale of VisDA-2017 brings challenges to domain adaptation. We compare our designed TransPar algorithm with state-of-the-art methods: ResNet-50 , Deep Adaptation Network (DAN) , Domain Adversarial Network (DANN) [ref]11, Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation (ADDA) , Joint Adaptation Network (RTN) , Generate to Adapt (GTA) , Maximum Classifier Discrepancy (MCD) , Conditional Domain Adversarial Network (CDAN) [ref]13, and Margin Disparity Discrepancy based algorithm (MDD) . Note that TransPar-∗∗\\ast denotes that we have integrated our TransPar algorithm into an existing algorithm, e.g., TransPar-MDD, TransPar-DANN. We follow the commonly used experimental protocol of UDA from [ref]11 . We implement our algorithm in Pytorch . We report the average accuracies of five independent experiments. The base models depend on the specific algorithm or dataset, e.g., ResNet-50 for Office-31 and Office-Home, ResNet-101 for VisDA-2017 and DomainNet. The base models with parameters are pre-trained from ImageNet. The domain discriminator used for measuring the 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}-distance is a 222-layer fully-connected neural network. We set the early training epoch E′superscript𝐸′E^{\\prime} to 101010. We use 80% data to train the domain discriminator and 20% data to calculate the 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}-distance. We set M𝑀M to 0.1 to prevents all parameters from becoming inactive. We set the max epoch E𝐸E to 30. We use mini-batch SGD with the weight decay coefficient λ𝜆\\lambda of 0.75 according to MDD . The initial learning rate is 0.0010.0010.001. The weight of the entropy loss α𝛼\\alpha is set to 0.10.10.1 according to CDAN [ref]13. Data augmentation strategies include the random resized crop and the random horizontal flip. All the compared models are implemented according to the Transfer Learning Library (Dalib) .\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: Office-31 [ref]41 is a standard UDA dataset consisting of three distinct domains, Amazon from the Amazon website, Webcam by the web camera, and DSLR by digital SLR camera (see Fig. 2).

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
