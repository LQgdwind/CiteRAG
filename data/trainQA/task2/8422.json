      "content": "Paper Title: GP-FL: Model-Based Hessian Estimation for Second-Order Over-the-Air Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA standard framework for wireless FL consider first-order algorithms, where the clients transmit their local gradients, and the PS aggregates them gradient directly over the air using the AirComp technique. We refer to this framework as first-order AirComp. Similar to other first-order methods, first-order AirComp at best achieves linear convergence, which leads to a relatively large number of iteration rounds to reach the desired accuracy. We further note that the analog nature of AirComp-aided computation leads to extra aggregation error from the channel. This can be seen as zero-mean fluctuations, which adds to the noiseless aggregated gradient, i.e., the estimator that PS computes in perfect FL settings. As a result, the estimator of global gradient computed in first-order AirComp has higher variance as compared with FL with noiseless aggregation. This leads to further degradation in terms of convergence behavior. One potential solution is to incorporate second-order methods, e.g., Newton-type methods, into the wireless FL setting, as explored in [ref]20. Unlike first-order methods, second-order approaches benefit from a quadratic convergence rate by computing the update direction using both first and second-order derivatives of the loss function. The update direction computed in these methods is often called Newton direction. Integrating second-order information into FL requires further access to the second-order information at the PS. This information is obtained by clients sharing their local Hessian matrices with the PS, which imposes a significant communication burden, especially in wireless settings with strictly-restricted links. To mitigate this issue, various studies have explored ways to approximate the Hessian matrix from the first-order information and/or reduced second-order information. For instance, GIANT  estimates the Newton direction by utilizing the global gradient and local Hessians on each client, combined with a global backtracking line search across all clients. Although this approach reduces the communication overhead, it still requires partial sharing of second-order information resulting in higher communication load as compared to first-order methods. The study in [ref]22 suggests an alternative approach, in which each client the computation of Newton direction is offloaded to the clients: the PS and devices invoke the conjugate gradient descent algorithm to compute iteratively an estimate of the global Newton direction. Although the information shared per communication round in this approach is the same as that of the first-order methods, a single iteration of gradient descent (on the model parameters) requires at least two rounds of communication. To circumvent further this overhead, the recent study in  proposes a novel second-order method that eliminates the aggregation of local gradients, enabling a single communication round per iteration. Motivated by this work, the authors in [ref]20 develop a second-order wireless FL method, in which the clients compute their Newton directions locally and share them with the PS. The PS then estimates the global Newton direction from the aggregation of these local directions. This approach enables devices to communicate with the PS only once per iteration, reducing the communication overhead to that of the first-order methods. As a natural extension to available proposals, some recent studies have proposed integration of communication-efficient second-order FL algorithms into the analog computation framework  [ref]20. Experiments however show that, unlike their first-order counterparts, these second-order AirComp algorithms struggle to perform adequately. This observation can be intuitively explained as follows: the noisy aggregation of the second-order information in AirComp-aided approaches introduces significant biases to the estimate of the Newton direction, leading to suboptimal performance. The investigations reveal that such biases can severely deteriorates the convergence, and hence the overall efficiency, of these methods  [ref]20. This study aims to develop a novel second-order AirComp algorithm that addresses this challenge in a communication-efficient way.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: leads to further degradation in terms of convergence behavior.
