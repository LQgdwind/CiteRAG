Large language models (LLMs) are characterised by their size (containing tens of billions of parameters) and training on a vast corpus of text (usually scraped from the internet). When fine-tuned using reinforcement learning with human feedback, ‘chat’ models can be conditioned to respond to instructions in a conversational format [ref]39. Since the development of GPT-3 in 2020 [ref]10, LLMs have gained popularity at a seismic pace, and the ability of LLMs to write code  or solve word puzzles is impressive. Researchers from Microsoft have stated that GPT-4 [ref]11 “could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system”, and found that it could solve some reasoning tasks. Further, work from Webb et al.  has recently suggested that “large language models such as GPT-3 have acquired an\nemergent ability to find zero-shot solutions to a broad range of analogy problems”. To demonstrate this, they created a digit matrices problem set inspired by Raven’s Progressive Matrices. Each problem is governed by a set of transition rules which can be stacked up to depth 3, and they find that GPT-3 performance largely surpasses human performance. Many researchers also reject these claims, arguing that these examples do not accurately assess reasoning , that LLMs cannot even solve the letter-string analogies attacked by the Copycat computer program 30 years ago  , and that they still have “a poor grasp of reality” . Given this debate, it is important to evaluate these models and whether they can already be used to solve ARC, which presents a formidable challenge compared to existing reasoning tasks such as in . To do this, we conduct experiments on several state-of-the-art LLMs by a new scheme to translate ARC tasks into a textual domain. We then evaluated them in the same framework as our DreamCoder solution and existing work.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: of text (usually scraped from the internet).

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
