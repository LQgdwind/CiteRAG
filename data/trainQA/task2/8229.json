      "content": "Paper Title: Proof-theoretic Semantics for First-order Logic\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn model-theoretic semantics (M-tS), logical consequence is defined in terms of models; that is, abstract mathematical structures in which propositions are interpreted and their truth is judged. In the standard reading given by Tarski  , a proposition ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi follows model-theoretically from a context\nΓΓ\\Gamma iff every model of ΓΓ\\Gamma is a model of ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi; that is, In this setup,\nmeaning and validity are characterized is terms of truth. Proof-theoretic semantics (P-tS)    is an alternative approach to meaning and validity in which they are characterized in terms of proofs — understood as objects denoting collections of acceptable inferences from accepted premisses.\nTo be clear, P-tS is not about providing a proof system, but rather about expressing the meaning and validity in terms of proofs and provability. Schroeder-Heister  observes, since no formal system is fixed (only notions of inference) the relationship between semantics and provability remains the same as it has always been: soundness and completeness are desirable features of formal systems. The semantic paradigm underlying much of P-tS is inferentialism, the view that meaning is explained in terms of the inferential connections (as opposed to reference) — see Brandom . This may be viewed as a particular instantiation of the meaning-as-use paradigm by Wittgenstein  in which ‘use’ in logic is understood as as inferential role. Heuristically, what differs is that (pre-logical) proofs in P-tS serve the role of truth in M-tS. This shift has substantial and subtle mathematical and conceptional consequences, as discussed below. To illustrate the paradigmatic shift from M-tS to P-tS, consider\nthe proposition ‘Tammy is a vixen’. What does it mean? Intuitively, it means, somehow, “‘Tammy is female” and “Tammy is a fox”’. On inferentialism, its meaning is given by the rules, These merit comparison with the laws governing conjunction (∧\\land), which justify the sense in which the above proposition is a conjunction, There are several branches of research within P-tS — see, for example, the discussion on proof-theoretic validity in the Dummett-Prawitz tradition by Schroeder-Heister  — see also Gheorghiu and Pym . This paper is concerned with a formalism called base-extension semantics, following in the tradition of Sandqvist  9  8. In general, a B-eS is determined by a judgement called support defined inductively according\nto the structure of formulae with the base case (i.e., the support of\natoms) given by proof in a base (a collection of inference rules over atoms — see below); this is analogous to satisfaction in M-tS, with the base case given by truth at a\nworld. In B-eS, a formula ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi follows from a context ΓΓ\\Gamma iff every ℬℬ\\mathscr{B} supporting ΓΓ\\Gamma also supports ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi; that is, Schroeder-Heister  has observed that both M-tS and P-tS observe the ‘standard dogma’ of semantics in which consequence is understood as the transmission of some categorical notion. The broad scope of P-tS offers alternate understanding of semantics altogether, but they are not directly relevant to the work in this paper. Though B-eS is closely\nrelated to M-tS (esp. possible world semantics in the sense of Beth \nand Kripke 0 — see, for example, Goldfarb 6,\nMakinson 2, and Stafford and Nascimento  3), it remains subtle.\nThis seen especially in the contrast between the incompleteness results for intuitionistic logics by Piecha et al. 5 4 7, Goldfarb 6, Sandqvist 8 , Stafford ) and the completeness results by Sandqvist , Gheorghiu et al. 0 1, and Stafford and Nascimento  3. Sandqvist 8 9 initiated B-eS as a way to present classical logic (CL) without prior commitment to bivalance, ‘understood as a property guaranteed to attach to a sentence or its negation regardless of the prospects for speakers to determine it as so doing.’ He references Dummett  to explain the importance of this project: In the resolution of the conflict between [the view that generally accepted classical modes of inference ought to be theoretically accommodated, and the demand that any such accommodation be achieved without recourse to bivalence] lies, as I see it, one of the most fundamental and intractable problems in the theory of meaning; indeed, in all philosophy. This is part of a bigger programme on the meaning of the logical signs and logic as a subject, as expressed by Dummett [ref]5. While Sandqvist 8 proves soundness and completeness of classical logic with respect to his B-eS, the work is relatively obscure as it is situated in the context of constructive mathematics. Indeed, in 9, Sandqvist reports both results but only presents the proof of soundness. Makinson 2 has given an alternate, simpler proof of completeness for classical propositional logic (CPL) by directly relating the proposed B-eS to the logic’s extant truth-functional semantics — note, he reverses the terms ‘soundness’ and ‘completeness’ for reasons he discusses. Eckhardt and Pym  [ref]6 have used this approach to systematically develop the B-eS for normal modal logic. Later, Sandqvist  gave a B-eS for intuitionistic propositional logic (IPL), but not first-order intuitionistic logic (IL). He introduced a new method for proving completeness that works by setting up a simulation between the semantics and provability in Gentzen’s 0 𝖭𝖩𝖭𝖩\\mathsf{NJ} (cf. Gheorghiu and Pym 4 3 for simulation approaches in M-tS). We provide more details below — see also Section 5. Gheorghiu et al. 0 1 2 developed this method in the context of substructural logics and logic programming. In this paper, we provide an alternate, elementary proof of soundness and completeness of both first-order classical and intuitionistic logic using the simulation technique for completeness. We believe this proof to be clearer than the one by Sandqvist 8 and more native than the one by Makinson 2. It is more native in the sense that it does not presuppose the truth-functional reading of classical logic. Moreover, one gets classical and intuitionistic logic simultaneously by paramterizing over the notion of ‘base’. We prove soundness in the standard way; that is, by showing that the B-eS respects all the laws of some complete description of classical logic. This is also the approach taken by Sandqvist 8 9 and Makinson 2. We prove completeness through a strategy deployed by Sandqvist  for IPL. The approach to completeness proceeds by generating a special kind of base that simulates (perhaps, more precisely, emulates) a complete description of classical logic and then shows that this simulation also completely describes the semantics. The details are below along a more detailed heuristic. This simulation-style proof typically proceeds relative to a natural deduction presentation of the logic in the sense of Gentzen 0. Using natural deduction for such a simulation proof for classical logic seems unviable as it appears to demand a notion of base that would not validate Pierce’s Law (thereby not being sound for classical logic) — see Sandqvist . In this paper, we break the dogma of natural deduction for such proofs and situate the treatment of classical logic entirely within a Frege-Hilbert axiomatization of it. In doing so, we show that the simulation approach to completeness may be deployed for logics that do not admit an especially tractable structural proof theory. Nascimento 3 has given an alternative P-tS for first-order classical and intuitionistic logic that is closely related to their M-tS. This P-tS enriches the structure of B-eS by working over ‘multibases’ — sets of bases — and has more complex side conditions for dealing with quantifiers. We believe the work in this paper offers a simpler account of the inferential content of quantifiers. Notations. We briefly outline some of the notations used throughout the paper for quick reference; the details are given below. Conventions: x,y,z,…𝑥𝑦𝑧…x,y,z,\\ldots denote variables, t,s,r,…𝑡𝑠𝑟…t,s,r,\\ldots denote terms P,Q,…𝑃𝑄…P,Q,\\ldots denote either predicates or atomic formula ϕ,ψ,χitalic-ϕ𝜓𝜒\\phi,\\psi,\\chi denote formulae, ℙ,ℚ,ℝ,…ℙℚℝ…\\mathbb{P},\\mathbb{Q},\\mathbb{R},\\ldots denote (possibly empty, possibly infinite) sets of atoms Γ,Δ,Ξ,…ΓΔΞ…\\Gamma,\\Delta,\\Xi,\\ldots denote (possibly empty, possibly infinite) sets of formulae, and ℬ,𝒞,𝒟,…ℬ𝒞𝒟…\\mathscr{B},\\mathscr{C},\\mathscr{D},\\ldots to denote atomic systems The sets of all variables, terms, atoms, and formulae are 𝒱𝒱\\mathcal{V}, 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T}, 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}, and ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}, respectively; the subsets containing only closed elements (where appropriate) are denoted cl​(𝒯)cl𝒯\\textsc{cl}(\\mathcal{T}), cl​(𝒜)cl𝒜\\textsc{cl}(\\mathcal{A}), cl​(ℱ)clℱ\\textsc{cl}(\\mathcal{F}), respectively. We write 𝖥𝖵𝖥𝖵\\mathsf{FV} to denote the function that takes a term, atom, or formula and returns the set of its free variables. We write [x↦t]delimited-[]maps-to𝑥𝑡[x\\mapsto t] to denote a substitution function that replaces all free occurrences of x𝑥x by t𝑡t. We use ⊥,∧,∨,→,∀,∃bottom→for-all\\bot,\\land,\\lor,\\to,\\forall,\\exists as the logical signs. We do not regard ⊥bottom\\bot as an atomic formula; intuitively, it has logical structure that renders it logically/semantically complex even thought it is indeed syntactically atomic.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: and intractable problems in the theory of meaning; indeed, in all philosophy.
