      "content": "Paper Title: SD-Conv: Towards the Parameter-Efficiency of Dynamic Convolution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNetwork architectures measured against ImageNet  have fueled much progress in computer vision researches across a broad array of problems, including transferring to new datasets  , object detection [ref]24, image segmentation [ref]18 and perceptual metrics of images . Many previous works have proved that better network architectures learn better features to be transferred across vision-based tasks  . Therefore, we further evaluate the effectiveness of our network on downstream vision tasks, including CIFAR-10 [ref]29, CIFAR-100 [ref]29, Oxford-IIIT Pets , Birdsnap , Food-101 , Oxford 102 Flowers 2, Stanford Cars , SUN397 0. These tasks span several domains, difficulties, and data sizes. We transfer all parameters of the upstream model except the last (fully connected) layer, which is adjusted to the number of classes in the downstream task, using Kaiming uniform initialization . We finetune the pretrained ImageNet model following two strategies, linear finetuning and full finetuning. For linear finetuning, we only train the linear classifier “on the top” of a fixed representation on downstream tasks, while we re-initialize the final layer and train the whole model for full finetuning. For both strategies, we take top-1 classification accuracy as the metric to compare different structures, which is shown in Figure 4. The results clearly show that the sparse dynamic convolution achieves consistent improvement compared to dynamic convolution on downstream tasks, suggesting that pruning redundant information in the weights is beneficial to dynamic convolution architectures in transfer settings.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: Network architectures measured against ImageNet  have fueled much progress in computer vision researches across a broad array of problems, including transferring to new datasets  , object detection [ref]24, image segmentation [ref]18 and perceptual metrics of images .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
