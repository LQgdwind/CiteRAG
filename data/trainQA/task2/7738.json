Although showing great potential in mobile deployment, traditional blockchains (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum) are resource-intensive  since every participant performs the consensus mechanism, saves the entire ledger copy, and synchronizes the network-wide messages.\nHence, the second research direction is blockchain optimization, making it affordable for resource-constrained mobile devices.\nFor instance, Zaman et al.  present a lightweight mobile-oriented consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Sincerity, which reduces the overall consensus costs by encouraging collaboration among devices.\nFurthermore, Xu et al.  jointly consider the computation, storage, and communication resources consumed by blockchain and propose the resource-efficient consensus mechanism, ledger pruning, and fast synchronization, respectively.\nThe emerging sharding technique has also been used in mobile blockchain, alleviating the overhead on each device .\nThese methods aim to refine the architectural design of blockchains, called Layer-1 methods.\nAccordingly, the optimizations by building additional infrastructures, such as micropayment channels , atop blockchains are Layer-2 methods.\nFinally, assisted by mobile edge computing, the computation-intensive tasks of mobile devices can be offloaded to the edge servers with sufficient physical resources  . Insights: Motivated by this, we pay great attention to optimizing the architecture of ProSecutor, making it adapt to the mobile environment when meeting the functional goals.\nHence, we propose the reputation roll-up and the duplex transfer channels to improve the efficiency of the two most frequently executed operations in ProSecutor, namely reputation update and fee-ownership transfer.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: Two categories of research exist in the field of mobile-oriented blockchains.\nFirstly, as a secure computing platform, blockchain can help mobile networks in various aspects, including key management [ref]25, resource management , task offloading , mobile crowdsensing , and data/resource trading .\nThe general idea is to use blockchains to provide an immutable and traceable ledger and save all the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
