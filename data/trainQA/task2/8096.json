      "content": "Paper Title: HYGENE: A Diffusion-based Hypergraph Generation Method\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we detail our experimental setup, covering datasets and evaluation metrics.\nThen, we compare our approach against the following baselines: HyperPA [ref]12, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) [ref]30, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) [ref]31, and a standard 2D diffusion model  trained on incidence matrix images, where hyperedge membership is represented by white pixels and absence by black pixels.\nFinally, we ablate on the spectrum-preserving coarsening and the upper bound for the number of hyperedges defined in Proposition 6. Our goal is threefold: (i) proving that HYGENE can generate the desired hyperedge distribution, (ii) proving that HYGENE can closely mimic a range of strict structural properties, and (iii) proving the importance of our components, i.e., spectrum-preserving coarsening and upper bounding the size of hyperedge clusters during coarsening.\nDetailed numerical results are available in Appendix F, and Appendix G provides several visualizations of our generated hypergraphs. We also commit to release the code open-source upon acceptance of the article. Datasets.\nWe evaluate our method on four synthetic hypergraph datasets: Erdős–Rényi (ER) , Stochastic Block Model (SBM) , Ego , and Tree .\nFurthermore, we also test HYGENE on topologies of low-poly feature-less versions of three classes of ModelNet40  converted to hypergraphs: plant, piano, and bookshelf.\nEach dataset is split into 128128128 training, 323232 validation, and 404040 test hypergraphs.\nMore details can be found in Appendix C.1. Metrics.\nOur metrics measure: (i) overall structural similarities like Node Num (difference in the number of nodes), Node Deg (difference in node degrees), and Edge Size (difference in the size of the hyperedges); (ii) topological properties by computing the average difference of the Spectral properties.\nFor datasets with specific structural requirements, Valid metrics assess the fraction of generated samples satisfying these properties.\nLower values indicate better performance for all metrics except Valid, where higher is better.\nMore details can be found in Appendix C.2. Comparison with the Baselines.\nTables 1 and 2 show the comparison of HYGENE against our baselines.\nWe observe that the proposed method effectively captures the edge size distribution and successfully imitates structural properties across datasets.\nThis is particularly evident in the Ego dataset, where our approach uniquely generates correct ego hypergraphs with a high success rate of 90%.\nIn some cases, HyperPA has a similar or better performance compared to HYGENE, but this baseline requires to know a-priori the true node degree and hyperedge distributions on a per-hypergraph basis, whereas our model only requires the desired number of nodes. The primary advantage of HYGENE over other baseline approaches lies in its comprehension of hypergraph structure.\nThis is particularly evident in the Valid metrics, where only HYGENE achieves satisfactory results.\nIndeed, node degrees and hyperedge sizes can be replicated by merely outputting the correct density of white pixels on the incidence matrix images.\nThis explains the satisfactory results sometimes achieved by these baselines for Node Deg and Edge Size.\nHowever, the underlying structure cannot be captured this way, and our baselines fail the Valid metrics. While one might consider using graph generators to produce hypergraph representations, this approach is infeasible because: (i) generating the clique expansion and recovering the associated hypergraph is an NP-hard problem as it requires the enumeration of all cliques; and (ii) for the bipartite representation, determining which side corresponds to nodes and which to hyperedges is non-trivial.\nAdditionally, we empirically observe that graph-based models often struggle to generate valid bipartite graphs.\nFor example, we only obtained 30% of correct bipartite graphs for both models by  and . Ablation Studies. Table 3 shows the results of our ablation studies.\nFirst, we observe that not enforcing an upper limit on the hyperedge cluster sizes makes the hyperedge generation task more difficult: for the four datasets, Node Deg greatly increases.\nThis is especially harmful to the Valid Tree and the Ego’s Spectral metrics as their structure requires very specific sparsity properties.\nFor the four datasets, the model overestimates the correct number of hyperedges and produces denser hypergraphs. Then, we also observe that the effects of spectrum-preserving coarsening are more subtle.\nSBM and Ego hypergraphs suffer the most from its absence. This is expected since failing to preserve their structure during coarsening reduces the available information the model possesses during generation.\nTree hypergraphs are not heavily impacted due to their relative absence of global structure, whereas ER hypergraphs suffer in the Node Deg and Edge Size metrics as the model struggles to correctly generate the hyperedges.\nThis is also expected since the spectrum of the hypergraph contains information on the hyperedge distribution. Limitations.\nThe mesh datasets reveal that HYGENE faces difficulties in accurately producing the specified number of nodes and hyperedges. The model appears to sample from the underlying distribution of hypergraph sizes rather than adhering to the node count directive provided during the generation process.\nNotably, the Node Num metric approximates the standard deviation (s​t​d𝑠𝑡𝑑std) of node counts for each dataset.\nWe hypothesize it stems from an inability to correctly estimate the number of hyperedges. The model then discards the excess nodes by disconnecting them to keep the targeted properties in the remainder of the hypergraph.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: In this section, we detail our experimental setup, covering datasets and evaluation metrics.\nThen, we compare our approach against the following baselines: HyperPA [ref]12, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) [ref]30, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) [ref]31, and a standard 2D diffusion model  trained on incidence matrix images, where hyperedge membership is\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
