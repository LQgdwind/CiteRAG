      "content": "Paper Title: What Should AI See? Using the Public’s Opinion to Determine the Perception of an AI\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhen human beings and robots interact in public space, robots should take the ethical values of humans into account. As robots are programmed, this requires anticipation of situations where robots could be in conflict with those values and also anticipation of the decision space for such a situation. Ultimately, an algorithmic approach to find and execute a compliant decision is needed. This particularly applies to the case of automated driving, where wrong decisions of the robotic car could be harmful or even deadly to humans. Approaching what has been said above, software engineers encounter various problems: In the stage of programming, software engineers might not be aware of the consequences that certain technical settings imply. Ethical problems might just be disregarded. In light of existing safety by design procedures in industry, this could be seen as an organizational task to enable software designers to develop ethics by design . There is no unique ethical system the software developer could refer to. Neither the existing normative theories of ethics need to come to the same decision    nor is it clear, who should apply any of these ethical systems: the software engineer, the software company, a philosopher with a PhD degree in ethics, bodies of technical standardization, politicians, judges, or the public? Also the relevance of representation  and regional variations in ethical decision making [ref]6 might play a central role. Whoever makes the decision requires an understanding of the technical matters that determine that decision. What communication strategies could enable e.g. citizens to come to a qualified decision? The perception of a robot and its representation of the world fundamentally differs from human perception. Due to this circumstance, the application of ethical systems developed by and for humans is not straightforward. For instance, the technical perception of a robotic car is usually based on deep neural networks (DNN) that interpret various sensors based on probabilities . Concerning this last point, from a technical point of view, DNNs in computer vision output probabilities given high resolution images. Coming to conclusions on the basis of probabilities itself involves ethical decisions, since the consequences of e.g. the confusion of a pedestrian with the street could be deadly, whereas the opposite confusion would trigger an unnecessary emergency braking. The perception of the street scene derived from the predicted probabilities therefore changes if the cost of confusion is determined in different ways  . In particular, different configuration of confusion costs that prioritize the safety of the passengers of the self-driving car over the safety of other external road users may lead to significant changes in perception. Just leaving confusion costs aside and just choosing the class with the highest probability using the maximum a posteriori probability principle, also known as the Bayes decision rule, does not avoid the ethical problem, since this amounts to costs of confusion treating any type of confusion the same. Such a cost structure deviates from common ethical intuition. Nevertheless, this “robotistic” decision rule is standard in present artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, which gives a good illustration to the first point of disregarded ethical problems mentioned above. In particular, this problem is not explicitly mentioned in any of the recommendations of ethics commissions in autonomous driving on German , European 0, or international level 1 2. Elaborating further on , where the ethical problem of decision rules is described and the decision space is presented, in this article we discuss a participatory approach to determine costs of confusions. Between June 2019 and November 2020, participants in our online survey111Visit http://www-ai.math.uni-wuppertal.de/~chan/poll/ or http://uni-w.de/1hx for the online survey entered 5045 proposals as to how severe confusions of random instances adhering to one semantic category (e.g. human) with other semantic categories (e.g. road) should be judged. The presented instances are extracted from the popular computer vision dataset called Cityscapes 3, which is commonly used to train an AI for the perception of street scenes. With our survey, we present an approach to use the public’s opinion to determine what an AI system will see. In this article, we experiment with this specific solution strategy to problem point 2) and we also position this approach in the field of the ethics of AI, where participatory approaches are recognized as a crucial ingredient for developing trustworthy technologies. As a further contribution to the second point, we use personal information provided by the survey participants to conduct significance tests for the difference of confusion costs between groups, similar to [ref]6. More precisely, we employ statistical tests to compare the variation within groups to the variation between groups by means of simulation based F𝐹F-tests that are tailored to the data structure of confusion costs. The different confusion cost structures lead to differences in the consequences with regard to human instances in safety critical zones in front of a self-driving car. These are evaluated using software developed in 4. This allows us to explore the extent to which the judgment of different groups of people and also the “robotistic” view can potentially lead to consequences with ethical significance. In general, however, direct statistical assessment of safety of AI systems in automated driving is known to be difficult in practice 5. Concerning point 3), we put the online survey in the perspective of current research on human-machine-interaction (HMI) by evaluating the feedback of the survey participants. We also involve industry leaders who give a comment on how our conducted participatory approach can contribute to an actual industrial solution. Our article does not intend to deliver any solution to the problem of defining confusion costs, i.e. to determine the perception of an AI applied in automated driving. In particular, we do not recommend or disrecommend to use the confusion cost matrices obtained from our survey in automated driving. Rather we construct and confront interdisciplinary perspectives on a problem of practical ethics, which emerges from the application of AI in safety critical applications, and investigate potential tensions as well as concordance between those.\nIt should also be clear that in this work we only investigate one AI perception modality, namely camera based semantic segmentation. Autonomous vehicles, however, are complex systems with various levels of redundancy within and across sensor modalities, including camera, radar, lidar, and ultrasonic detectors. It is beyond the scope of this work to evaluate the consequences of different choices of the cost structure of confusions on the level of such complex systems. We provide an overview of the structure of this article in Fig. 1. This work is organized as follows: In Section II we give a mathematical definition of cost-based decision rules and thereby define the space of alternatives. In the subsequent Section III we present our survey-based approach and the survey design. Section IV presents statistical evidence for the difference between certain groups of people as well as the robotistic view, and also evaluates to what extent these differences are safety-relevant. Section V considers the relevant HMI aspects of the survey and explores the difficulties that emerge from just asking the people from the people’s perspective.\nSection VI places this article’s approach in the field of ethical discussions on the application of AI, with special emphasis on automated driving. Similarities and Dissimilarities to the infamous trolley problem are discussed and the applicability of existing ethical guidelines are probed.\nSection VII discusses the usefulness and the feasibility of participation based approaches from an industrial point of view and relates such approaches to ethical, legal and technical regulatory frameworks.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: with a PhD degree in ethics, bodies of technical standardization, politicians, judges, or the public?
