Their proposed SDS loss provides a way to assess the similarity between an image and a caption: where pϕsubscript𝑝italic-ϕp_{\\phi} is the distribution learned by the frozen, pretrained Imagen model. q𝑞q is a unimodal Gaussian distribution centered at a learned mean image g​(θ)𝑔𝜃g(\\theta).\nDreamFusion  proposed an approach to use a pretrained pixel-space text-to-image diffusion model (Imagen ) as a loss function. However, diffusion models trained on pixels have traditionally been used to sample only pixels.\nWe want to create what look like good sketches that match the text prompts when rendered from a set of vector strokes.\nSuch models can be specified as a differentiable image parameterization, where a differentiable rasterizer ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} transforms parameters θ𝜃\\theta to create a sketch 𝒮=ℛ​(θ)𝒮ℛ𝜃\\mathcal{S}=\\mathcal{R}(\\theta). Inspired by DreamFusion , we extend score distillation sampling (SDS) loss to use a pretrained latent diffusion model [ref]30 as a prior for optimizing curve parameters.\nIntuitively, score distillation converts diffusion sampling into an optimization problem that allows the raster image to be represented by a differentiable rasterizer.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: joint embedding model (e.g. CLIP) and an optimization-based approach to train a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) .\nSuch models can be specified as a differentiable image parameterization (DIP) [ref]22, where a differentiable generator g𝑔g transforms parameters θ𝜃\\theta to create an image 𝒙=g​(θ)𝒙𝑔𝜃\\bm{x}=g(\\theta).\nIn DreamFusion , θ𝜃\\theta be parameters of a 3D volume and g𝑔g is a\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
