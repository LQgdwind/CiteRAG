      "content": "Paper Title: BRNES: Enabling Security and Privacy-aware Experience Sharing in Multiagent Robotic and Autonomous Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExperience sharing (ES)  has become increasingly significant in the multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL)  paradigm due to its efficacy in accelerating learning performance. As the popularity of ES processes increases, so do concerns about their security and privacy. Namely, advisors’ shared experience shapes the learning behavior and outcomes of an advisee . A shared but malicious experience could mislead an advisee to take incorrect measures during the experience harvesting (EH) phase of ES  . Likewise, as the shared experience is computed based on the inputs (e.g., reward signal) that commonly rely on advisors’ data, an inference attack on those may leak advisors’ private information during the experience giving (EG) phase of ES [ref]5 . These security (adversarial manipulation) and privacy (adversarial inference) threats, unfortunately, overlooked by many related studies     0; can bring down catastrophic consequences on MARL-based safety-critical applications in domains such as robotics , cyber-physical systems 1, automotive industries 2, etc. For example, false advising from an advisor car in autonomous driving may make lane-changing ambiguous and lead to severe road accidents for an advisee car 3, whereas an inference attack from an advisee may reveal sensitive data of the advisors [ref]5 4.\nTherefore, to facilitate a secure and private MARL for next-generation robotic and autonomous systems, a study of the adversarial manipulation and inference threats posed by the current ES process is non-trivial. Particularly, from a security perspective, false advising\nthreat is prominent in the decentralized MARL settings, where there is no central authority to ensure the consensus on advice integrity and agents’ authenticity, and thus susceptible to Byzantine general problems 5. Researchers in\n address this false advising threat from Byzantine advisors in a MARL platform by adopting differential privacy (DP) 6 at the advisee’s end. However, a strategic attacker can exploit the DP-noise to conduct optimal false data injection (or simply false advising) attacks and hamper the learning outcomes significantly 7 8. To tackle this, we propose to incorporate the experience, whether it is differentially private or not, into the advisee’s learning through a weighted experience aggregation technique. From a privacy perspective, we argue that inference attackers, disguised as advisees, could try to infer advisors’ sensitive information by recursively querying their experience for every state-action pair. For example, the advisors’ experience in Q-value sharing frameworks (e.g., 9  0) can reflect their rewarding strategy that builds their decision-making criteria, and movement trajectory that carries important contextual information, such as users’ preference, next course of actions, etc.\n[ref]5. To protect such sensitive information in untrusted environments, unlike , we propose to adopt local differential privacy (LDP) 1 during ES. LDP perturbs advisors’ experience before sharing it, making it harder for inference attackers to obtain sensitive information. Different from the above-mentioned works, our paper presents a novel Byzantine Robust Neighbor Experience Sharing (BRNES) framework that addresses the security and privacy threats in the ES process from two adversarial perspectives: (1) false advising during the advisee’s EH, and (2) inference attack during the advisor’s EG. Therefore, our contribution in this paper is twofold: in decentralized EH, we address the security attacks from Byzantine attackers, and in EG, we address the privacy attacks from inference attackers. To ensure the framework is Byzantine robust, we develop an adaptive heuristic neighbor zone selection process for each advisee that limits the possibility of a Byzantine advisor deterministically appearing in the vicinity of any targeted advisee significantly due to the inherent randomness in the process. Additionally, to further limit the false advising impacts from Byzantine advisors, we leverage a weighted experience aggregation technique that prevents the direct integration of advisors’ experience. To prevent inference attackers from inferring advisors’ sensitive data, we leverage the provable privacy guarantee offered by the LDP mechanism.\nIn summary, our contributions are: to enable security and privacy-aware ES in MARL, we propose a novel framework (BRNES) that addresses adversarial manipulation and inference problems in existing multiagent robotic and autonomous systems and fills two important research gaps in the literature- (1) the absence of a Byzantine robust decentralized EH mechanism, and (2) the lack of a private EG process. to achieve Byzantine robustness, we formulate a novel adaptive heuristic neighbor zone selection strategy and leverage the weighted experience aggregation technique. to make EG privacy-protected, we leverage the provable privacy guarantee offered by the LDP technique.  comparing to the state-of-the-art (SOTA), we show that our framework is 1.411.411.41x faster than DA-RL 0 and 8.328.328.32x faster than AdhocTD  under adversarial presence.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: based on the inputs (e.g., reward signal) that commonly rely on advisors’ data, an inference attack on those may leak advisors’ private information during the experience giving (EG) phase of ES [ref]5 .
