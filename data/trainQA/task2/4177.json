      "content": "Paper Title: Reinforcement Learning-enhanced Shared-account Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCross-domain Recommendation (CR) that aims at improving recommendations by concerning data from multiple domains has been proven helpful for cold-start and sparsity issues [ref]3 [ref]4.\nTraditional methods for CR can be categorized into knowledge aggregation-based methods and knowledge transferring-based methods. In aggregation-based methods, the efforts are making at designing aggregating functions that can take into account both domains  . In transferring-based methods, the studies are mainly focused on sharing or transferring domain information between two domains  .\nHowever, these two kinds of methods are all shallow methods, which hinders them to learn high-level abstractions from different domains.\nIn light of this, deep neural network-based methods have gradually attracted the attention of researchers 6 7 8 9 [ref]4 .\nFor example, Liu et al.  propose a distribution alignment-based method to make CR for the cold-start items in the target domain. But their method needs items’ auxiliary information as input and can only make recommendations for a single target.\nIn light of the limitations of single-target CR, Zhu et al. [ref]32 first propose a graphical and attentional framework for dual-target CR to improve the recommendation accuracy on both domains. Then, they extend [ref]32 in , and further devise a unified framework for multi-types of CSRs via a personalized training strategy.\nHowever, the above methods all ignore the fact that irrelevant domain information, even if they are given lower attention weights, may still dilute the domain knowledge. Moreover, these methods do not consider the shared-account scenario, which may further amplify the noisy interactions and prevent the cross-domain recommendation.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Cross-domain Recommendation (CR) that aims at improving recommendations by concerning data from multiple domains has been proven helpful for cold-start and sparsity issues [ref]3 [ref]4.\nTraditional methods for CR can be categorized into knowledge aggregation-based methods and knowledge transferring-based methods.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
