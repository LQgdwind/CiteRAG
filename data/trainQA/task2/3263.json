      "content": "Paper Title: A Heterogeneous In-Memory Computing Cluster For Flexible End-to-End Inference of Real-World Deep Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAnalog in-memory computing (AIMC) performs data processing in situ within memory arrays. Matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) operands can be mapped on the cross-bars of a non-volatile (NV) memory array and the dot product operation is performed entirely in the analog domain, making IMC devices promising candidates to accelerate DNN workloads, and overcome the well-known memory bottleneck affecting traditional AI digital accelerators . Both charge-based memory technologies (e.g. SRAM, DRAM, and flash) and resistance-based memory technologies (e.g. RRAM, PCM, and STT-MRAM) can serve as elements for such computational units . Several demonstrations of AIMC-based architectures have appeared in the field of Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference acceleration, showing outstanding peak energy efficiency in the order of hundreds of TOPS/W  . Industry interest in this technology is growing  [ref]4.\nFrom a research perspective, several prototypes claimed tens to hundreds of TOPS/W by exploiting many different approaches, with a quite diverse set of choices in terms of numerical precision and underlying memory technologies  . However, several fundamental challenges are still open to achieve the claimed levels of efficiency at full-application scale: the intrinsic variability of analog computing both in the charge-based and resistive domain ; difficulties in dealing with low-precision computations that are often the only ones supported by AIMC-based architectures ; the necessity of specialized training . Most prominently, a key issue is the limited flexibility of IMC arrays, which are extremely efficient on MVM or similar vector operations, but they are not flexible enough to sustain other types of workloads. To tackle this limitation, a prominent solution is to couple either general-purpose processors  or specialized digital accelerators  with analog in-memory computing cores. This allows extending the functionality of In-Memory Accelerators (IMA), creating heterogeneous analog/digital computing fabrics, connected to the system bus . However, this integration poses severe concerns at the system level, mainly on two aspects: bandwidth and flexibility. First, IMC acceleration moves the challenge towards ensuring efficient data movement within the system. In the case of volatile technologies, such as SRAM-based IMC, the weights of the DNN must be stored in non-volatile memory (external or internal to the system). This requires additional energy and time to move the data that must be stored into the cells of the IMA, anytime the cross-bar is programmed . When considering non-volatile technologies, such as Flash, ReRAM or PCM-based IMC arrays, weights are directly stored into the cross-bar, with no need for marshaling operations. However, previous concerns continue to affect the activations that must be moved at the boundaries of the IMC array, to perform MVMs. Taking this into account, efficient integration of IMC into heterogeneous systems requires an optimized interface design between the highly parallel IMC inputs/outputs, the programmable cores, and the rest of the system: low bandwidth and high communication latency between the processor and the IMA might create a major bottleneck . Second, as a consequence of Amdahl’s effect, accelerating MVM operators with an IMA moves the performance bottleneck on all the other computation needed to accomplish a certain task, which must be performed on the digital part of the system. Complex real-world neural networks mix MVMs with other workloads such as residuals, activation functions, or depth-wise convolutions; coupling the IMA with a single core, as has recently been proposed , will likely hit Amdahl’s effect caused by the single-core bottleneck, hindering the whole computation performance. In this work, we address the system-level challenges of analog IMC by exploiting extreme heterogeneity.\nThe main contributions of this paper are the following:\n We design a heterogeneous tightly-coupled shared-memory cluster that integrates 8 fully programmable RISC-V processors, an analog in-memory computing accelerator (IMA), and a dedicated digital block to accelerate depth-wise convolutions; we present a post place&route silicon-ready implementation targeting GlobalFoundries 22nm FDX technology;\n We optimize the interfaces between the analog IMA and the rest of the system to match the computing and IO requirements of the IMA, achieving performance as high as 958 GOPS on MVMs, more than 90% of its peak theoretical throughput, surpassing by one order of magnitude other approaches where the IMA is connected through a low-bandwidth, high-latency system bus ; We benchmark the system on a bottleneck layer, representative of modern DNNs exploiting heavily heterogeneous layers such as point-wise, depth-wise convolutions and residuals, in terms of performance and energy efficiency. The analog/digital synergistic approach demonstrates full mitigation of Amdahl’s effect, showing 2.6×2.6\\times better performance and 2.8×2.8\\times better energy efficiency compared to executing the layers on our previous work that integrates only 8 programmable cores and the IMC analog array [ref]8; We scale up the proposed system to analyze the challenges and the hardware resources necessary to enable end-to-end inference of a MobileNetV2. Our architectural paradigm executes inference in 10m​s𝑚𝑠ms with an energy of 482μ​J𝜇𝐽\\mu J, improving upon fully digital state-of-the-art solutions (SoA)  by 10×10\\times in latency, reducing the energy consumption by 2.5×2.5\\times. Compared to SoA analog/digital architectures , our solution shows two orders of magnitude improvements in terms of execution latency. The manuscript is organized as follows: in Sec. II we review the state-of-the-art; in Sec. 1 we outline the background, and in Sec. IV we present the heterogeneous cluster architecture. Then, in Sec. V and Sec. VI we report the experimental results, discussions, and explorations. Finally in Sec. VII we compare with state-of-the-art solutions.\nSec. VIII concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: in the field of Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference acceleration, showing outstanding peak energy efficiency in the order of hundreds of TOPS/W  .
