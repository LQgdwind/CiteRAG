      "content": "Paper Title: Unleashing Unlabeled Data: A Paradigm for Cross-View Geo-Localization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGround images (Grds) and Satellite images (Sats) are usually captured by different sensors with huge perspective differences and different environmental conditions, making CVGL challenging. In order to simplify CVGL, many works leverage two assumptions in popular datasets   . 1) Localization Alignment : the localization of Grds is aligned to a known position of Sats. 2) Orientation Alignment [ref]34: the geographical orientation of Grds is aligned to Sats. By leveraging these alignments, some works    3   implicitly enhance the high-level features supervised by ground-truth correspondences. Recently, some methods [ref]33    improve the spatial alignments of input images by the explicit polar transform for better performance, but the transformed images suffer from severe distortions that also need to be corrected by full supervisions. To make CVGL more practical, some methods try to get rid of one of two assumptions. Firstly,  [ref]33 [ref]55    have achieved good results without relying on Localization Alignment, but they still rely highly on ground-truth correspondences or GPS labels . Secondly, although some works   [ref]34 8 make efforts to remove the Orientation Alignment, they need to align the rotation angle of ground images and polar transformed images  [ref]33 [ref]34 with known cross-view image pairs [ref]55. Different from existing works, in this paper, we no longer rely on ground-truth labels and instead propose a more challenging and practical setting called Unsupervised CVGL (UCVGL) to unleash unlabeled data.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: to simplify CVGL, many works leverage two assumptions in popular datasets   . 1) Localization Alignment : the localization of Grds is aligned to a known position of Sats. 2) Orientation Alignment [ref]34: the geographical orientation of Grds is aligned to Sats. By leveraging these alignments, some works    3   implicitly enhance the high-level features supervised by ground-truth\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
