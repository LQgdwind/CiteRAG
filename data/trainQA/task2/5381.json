To address\nthese concerns, the literature\nputs forward various explainable AI approaches to render\nNNs more transparent, including model-agnostic approaches  ,\nand approaches tailored to the structure of NNs  .\nHowever, they fail to capture the actual mechanics of the NNs\nand thus\nit is hard to evaluate how faithful\nthese approaches are to the NNs\n  [ref]45 [ref]43. Some works advocate the use of formal, interpretable approaches for explainability .\nSpecifically for NNs, recent work  proposes\nregularizing the training procedure of NNs so that they can be well\napproximated by interpretable decision trees.\nWhile this is an interesting direction,\nevaluating the faithfulness of the decision trees to the NN\nremains a challenge.\nOther recent work unearths formal relationships between\nNNs in the form of\nmulti-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and symbolic reasoning with\nquantitative argumentation frameworks (QAFs)\n [ref]40      or weighted conditional\nknowledge bases  .\nThe formal relationships indicate that these approaches may pave the way towards potentially\nmore faithful explanations than approximate abstractions such as decision trees.\n In this paper, we provide explanations for MLPs leveraging on their formal relationships with QAFs in [ref]40.\nIntuitively, QAFs\nrepresent arguments and\nrelations of attack or support between them as a graph, where nodes\nrepresent arguments and edges\nrelations.\nVarious QAF formalisms have been studied over the\nyears, e.g. by        .\nAs it turns out, every MLP\ncorresponds to a QAF of a particular form\nunder a particular\nsemantics\n [ref]40.\nThis formal relationship between MLPs and QAFs\nsuggests that QAFs are\nwell suited to create faithful explanations for MLPs.\nHowever,\njust reinterpreting an MLP as a\nQAF\nwould not give us a comprehensible explanation\nbecause the QAF has the same size and density as the\noriginal MLP.\nIn order to create\nfaithful and comprehensible argumentative\nexplanations, we propose a two-step method. We first sparsify the MLP,\nwhile maintaining as much of its mechanics as\npossible.\nThen, we\ntranslate the sparse MLP into a QAF.\nWe call our method SpArX (Sparse Argumentative eXplanations for MLPs).\nIn principle, any existing\ncompression method for NNs can be used for sparsification (e.g. 0).\nHowever, existing methods are not designed for\nmaintaining the mechanics of NNs towards explainability.\nWe thus make the following contributions: We propose a novel clustering method for summarizing neurons based on their output-similarity.\nThe clustered neurons’ parameters result from aggregating the\noriginal parameters so\nthat their output\nis similar to the outputs of neurons that they\nsummarize.\n We propose two families of\naggregation\nfunctions for aggregating the neurons in a cluster: the first gives\nglobal explanations (explaining the MLP for all inputs) and the second gives\nlocal explanations (explaining the MLP for a target input). We conduct\nseveral experiments demonstrating\nthe viability of our SpArX method for MLPs and its competitiveness with respect to other methods in terms of (i) conventional notions of input-output faithfulness\nof explanations and (ii) novel notions of structural faithfulness, while (iii) shedding some light on the tradeoff between\nfaithfulness and comprehensibility understood in terms of a notion of cognitive complexity, important towards human usability of explanations with SpArX. The code is publicly available111https://github.com/H-Ayoobi/SpArX. Overall, we show that formal relationships between black-box machine learning (with NNs) and interpretable symbolic reasoning in\nQAFs can provide faithful and comprehensible explanations.\n This is an extended version of , including Supplementary Material (SM) with proofs and additional details.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: ,\nand approaches tailored to the structure of NNs  .\nHowever, they fail to capture the actual mechanics of the NNs\nand thus\nit is hard to evaluate how faithful\nthese approaches are to the NNs\n  [ref]45 [ref]43.
