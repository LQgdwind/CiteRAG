      "content": "Paper Title: How Expressive are Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Time Series Forecasting?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved considerable success in static graph representation learning for many tasks [ref]1. Many existing studies, such as STGCN [ref]2 and Graph WaveNet , have successfully extended GNNs to time series forecasting. Among these methods, either first-order approximation of ChebyConv  or graph diffusion  is typically used to model time series relations, where a strong assumption of local homophiles is made . Thus, they are only capable of modeling positive correlations between time series that exhibit strong similarities, and we denote this branch of methods as message-passing-based spatial-temporal GNNs (MP-STGNNs). Nevertheless, how to model real-world multivariate time series with complex spatial dependencies that evolve remains an open question. This complexity is depicted in Figure 1, in which differently signed relations between time series are evident. Recently, Cao et al. [ref]7 introduced the concept of spectral-temporal GNNs (SPTGNNs), which sheds light on modeling differently signed time series correlations by approximating graph convolutions with a broad range of graph spectral filters beyond low-pass filtering  . Though StemGNN [ref]7 has achieved remarkable improvements in time series forecasting, the theoretical foundations of SPTGNNs remain under-researched. There are several unresolved fundamental questions: Q1. What is the general form of SPTGNNs? Q2. How expressive are SPTGNNs? Q3. When will they fail to generalize well? Q4. How to design provably expressive SPTGNNs? We establish a series of theoretical results (summarized in Figure 2) to answer these questions. We begin by formulating a general framework of SPTGNNs (Q1; subsection 3.1), and then prove its universality of linear models (i.e., linear SPTGNNs are powerful enough to represent arbitrary time series) under mild assumptions through the lens of discrete-time dynamic graphs (DTDGs)   and spectral GNNs . We further discuss related constraints from various aspects (Q3; subsection 3.2) to make our theorem useful in practice on any valid instantiations. After this, we extend the color-refinement algorithm on DTDGs and prove that the expressive power of SPTGNNs is theoretically bounded by the proposed temporal 1-WL test (Q2; subsection 3.2). To answer the last question (Q4; subsection 3.3), we prove that under mild assumptions, linear SPTGNNs are sufficient to produce expressive time series representations with orthogonal function bases and individual spectral filters in their graph and temporal frequency-domain models. Our results, for the first time, unravel the learning capabilities of SPTGNNs and outline a blueprint for designing powerful GNN-based forecasting models. Drawing from and to validate these theoretical insights, we present a simple SPTGNN instantiation, named TGC (short for Temporal Graph GegenConv), that well generalizes related work in time series forecasting. Though our primary goal is not to achieve state-of-the-art performance, our method, remarkably, is very efficient and significantly outperforms numerous existing models on several time series benchmarks and forecasting settings with minimal designs. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that: (1) Our approach excels at learning time series relations of different types compared to MP-STGNNs; (2) Our design principles, e.g., orthogonal bases and individual filtering, are crucial for SPTGNNs to perform well; (3) Our instantiation (TGC) can be readily augmented with nonlinearities and other common model choices. Finally, and more importantly, our findings pave the way for devising a broader array of provably expressive SPTGNNs.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved considerable success in static graph representation learning for many tasks [ref]1.
