      "content": "Paper Title: Evaluating k-NN in the Classification of Data Streams with Concept Drift\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nData stream environments are related to large amounts of data that may be infinite and continuously flow rapidly.\nLearning from such stream environments typically requires online methods and is often restricted in memory consumption and run-time.\nIn addition, the reading and processing of each instance are often limited to single access, an arrangement called single-pass processing.\nFinally, changes in the data distribution are expected, a phenomenon known as concept drift¬† [ref]2 . Concept drift can be categorized in several ways, and the most common one is based on the speed of the changes.\nSuch drifts are named abrupt when the changes between concepts are sudden or rapid, and are considered gradual when the transition from one concept to the next one occurs over a larger number of instances    . In the real-world, concept drifts occur for several reasons, including attacks and intrusion, mechanical or technical equipment failure, seasonal changes, movement detected from sensors, changes in the characteristic of spam messages in an e-mail, and others.\nConsequently, it is essential to detect and adapt these concept drifts swiftly. Different approaches have been proposed to learn from data streams containing concept drift  .\nA common instrumentation to tackle concept drift regards ensembles that may adopt a base learner together with different strategies or weighting functions to estimate the resulting classification.\nExamples of such ensembles include Dynamic Weighted Majority (DWM) , Diversity for Dealing with Drifts (DDD) 0, Adaptable Diversity-based Online Boosting (ADOB) 1, Boosting-like Online Learning Ensemble (BOLE) 2, Fast Adaptive Stacking of Ensembles (FASE) 3, Online AdaBoost-based M1 (OABM1) and M2 (OABM2) 4.\nIn addition, some ensemble algorithms reuse previous classifiers on recurring concepts, e.g.¬†Recurring Concept Drifts (RCD)  and Enhanced Concept Profiling Framework (ECPF) 5. Another common approach is based on concept drift detectors, lightweight methods that monitor the prediction results of a base learner and are meant to identify concept drifts in the distribution of the data explicitly.\nMany concept drift detection methods have been proposed in the literature [ref]2 6, with current emphasis on Drift Detection Method (DDM) ,\nReactive Drift Detection Method (RDDM) 7, Drift Detection Methods based on Hoeffding‚Äôs Bounds (HDDM)  with versions HDDM A and HDDM W, Fast Hoeffding Drift Detection Method (FHDDM) , Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test Drift Detector (WSTD) 8 and Fisher Test Drift Detector (FTDD) 9.\nIt is also worth pointing out that concept drift detectors have often been used as auxiliary methods in ensembles  0 2 3 4 5, as well as to form ensembles that share a single base classifier  , a comparatively less explored arrangement. In this work, we target a roughly overlooked approach for classifying data streams: kùëòk-Nearest Neighbors (kùëòk-NN) .\nkùëòk-NN is a lazy and instance-based classifier: in the training step, instances are buffered for posterior querying and distance computation in the test step.\nWhen using kùëòk-NN in data streams, two issues arise  .\nFirst, how to choose kùëòk, the number of nearest buffered instances used for prediction.\nIntuitively, larger values of kùëòk reduce the impact of noisy data, yet, render the class boundaries less distinct.\nSecond, it is not possible to buffer instances indefinitely, as it jeopardizes both run-time and memory consumption constraints.\nThis is probably the main reason why kùëòk-NN is overlooked in data stream mining, frequently simply dismissed based on the argument that it is too slow, and why bayesian  and decision tree  models are usually preferred, even though they can become very slow too. This article aims to analyze in-depth the general performance of kùëòk-NN applied to data stream environments, surveying its advantages and limitations as well as discussing the reasons for its low popularity in this context.\nFor this purpose, large-scale experiments were conducted using several artificial dataset generators, configured with both abrupt and gradual drift versions of several sizes, comparing kùëòk-NN to the two most commonly used base classifiers in the data stream area ‚Äî Naive Bayes (NB)  and Hoeffding Tree (HT)  , and run in the Massive Online Analysis (MOA) framework¬†.\nMore specifically, these experiments were designed to answer the following research questions: RQ1: What is the impact of the neighborhood (kùëòk) on the accuracy of kùëòk-NN? RQ2: Does the accuracy of kùëòk-NN benefit from concept drift detection? If so, how much does it improve with different values of kùëòk? RQ3: What is the impact of the neighborhood (kùëòk) on the run-time of kùëòk-NN? RQ4: How does concept drift detection impact the run-time of kùëòk-NN for different values of kùëòk? RQ5: What is the impact of the window size (wùë§w) on the accuracy of kùëòk-NN? RQ6: How does drift detection affect the accuracy of kùëòk-NN given different wùë§w values? RQ7: What is the impact of the window size (wùë§w) on kùëòk-NN‚Äôs run-time? RQ8: How does concept drift detection impact the run-time of kùëòk-NN for different values of wùë§w? RQ9: How does kùëòk-NN compare to NB and HT in terms of accuracy? RQ10: How does kùëòk-NN compare to NB and HT regarding run-time? The remainder of the document is organized into six sections.\nSection¬†2 reviews the main concepts and approaches involving data stream classification and concept drift.\nSection¬†3 shows the configuration of the experiments, also including descriptions of the datasets used in the tests.\nSection 4 analyses the accuracy and run-time results of kùëòk-NN varying k, evaluates them statistically and answers research questions RQ1‚ÄìRQ4.\nSection 5 addresses the accuracy and run-time results of kùëòk-NN varying wùë§w, evaluates them statistically, and answers research questions RQ5‚ÄìRQ8.\nSection 6 compares the best configurations of kùëòk-NN with NB and HT and answers RQ9 and RQ10.\nFinally, Section¬†7 concludes this article and proposes future work.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: of each instance are often limited to single access, an arrangement called single-pass processing.\nFinally, changes in the data distribution are expected, a phenomenon known as concept drift¬† [ref]2 .
