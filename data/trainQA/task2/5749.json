      "content": "Paper Title: Going faster to see further: GPU-accelerated value iteration and simulation for perishable inventory control using JAX\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\ndemonstrated that value iteration could be effectively run in parallel on a GPU soon after the introduction of CUDA. Subsequent research has evaluated the performance of GPU-accelerated value iteration on problems from economics and finance [ref]5 [ref]1    and route-finding and navigation    . We have only identified a single study that applied this approach to an inventory control problem: [ref]45 implemented a custom value iteration algorithm in CUDA to find replenishment policies for a subset of perishable inventory problems originally described by . Previous studies have reported impressive reductions in wall time achieved by running value iteration on GPU. The GPU-accelerated method in [ref]45 was up to 11.7Ã—\\times faster than a sequential CPU-based method written in C. Despite this, the approach has not been widely adopted. The majority of the aforementioned studies focus on implementing value iteration using CUDA or OpenCL, a multi-platform alternative to CUDA, and comparing the performance of a GPU-accelerated method with a CPU-based method, instead seeking to use GPU-acceleration to solve problems for which value iteration is otherwise impractical or infeasible. One of the main barriers to entry for other researchers may be the perceived difficulty of GPU programming. Writing efficient code using CUDA or OpenCL requires careful consideration of memory access, balancing resource usage when mapping parallel processes to the hardware, and interaction between the CPU and GPU . There have been efforts to make GPU-accelerated value iteration more accessible.  created a solver framework using his CUDA implementation of value iteration as a back-end, but this does not appear to be publicly available. More recently,  created a toolkit in MATLAB to solve infinite horizon value iteration problems which automatically uses a GPU when available and appropriate. This toolkit requires the state-transition matrix to be provided as an input, which is not practical for some of the larger problems we consider due to memory limitations. Our approach is broadly similar to that of  and  who used machine learning frameworks to implement GPU-accelerated value iteration for economics models. A key observation made by  is that their TensorFlow implementation is an order of magnitude faster than their custom CUDA C++ implementation on a GPU. This demonstrates that the comparative accessibility provided by a machine learning framework need not come at the cost of poorer performance. TensorFlow, like PyTorch and JAX, translates the high level API instructions into highly-optimized CUDA code. Experts in GPU programming may be able achieve better performance than a machine learning framework by working at the level of CUDA or OpenCL. Researchers without that expertise are likely to both save development time and achieve performance benefits by working at a higher level of abstraction using a machine learning framework and relying on it to make best use of the available hardware. Due to the computational challenges of using dynamic programming methods to find policies for perishable inventory management, research has focused on approximate solutions. One straightforward way to make a dynamic programming approach more computationally tractable is to reduce the size of the state space by aggregating stock items into batches. The solution to the down-sized dynamic program can then by factored up to give an approximate solution to the the original problem (e.g.  ). An alternative approach is to use a heuristic policy with a small number of parameters, such as a base-stock policy. Research in this area has concentrated on both identifying suitable structures for heuristic policies (see  for an early example, and  for a recent example), and finding suitable parameters for those policies in specific situations - commonly using stochastic mixed integer linear programming (e.g.   ) or simulation optimization (e.g.  ). Recently, reinforcement learning methods have also been used to find approximate polices for managing perishable inventory    . Of these other approaches to the problem, we focus on simulation optimization in addition to value iteration because GPU-accelerated simulation is feasible using available software libraries but not yet widely adopted. Applied research on specific mixed integer linear programs often relies on commercial solver software such as IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio or Gurobi Optimizer which do not currently support GPU-acceleration. Adapting mixed integer programming solution strategies to suit the architecture of GPUs is the subject of active research . The use of GPU-acceleration supported by machine learning frameworks is already widespread in reinforcement learning research. Simulation optimization can be used to solve optimization problems where the objective function cannot be computed exactly, but can be estimated using simulation. Sampling error in the objective function can be reduced by running simulations for a longer period, or by running additional simulations. The relevance of parallel computing to simulation optimization is well recognised  , but we have identified few simulation optimization studies using GPUs to run multiple simulations in parallel. In inventory management,  exhaustively evaluated the possible order quantities for a newsvendor problem using parallel simulations on GPU. More recently, 8 used simulation optimization to solve a chemical process monitoring problem using GPU-acceleration for both the simulation and the metaheuristic search process that proposed candidate solutions. Similar to the value iteration studies discussed above, both of these projects used custom CUDA code which may explain the limited subsequent adoption despite the established reductions in wall time relative to CPU baselines. Following recent work in the reinforcement learning community  6 we implemented our simulators using the Python library gymnax 7, which enabled us to write our simulation operations using JAX and readily evaluate each of numerous policies on thousands of simulated years in parallel on GPU.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: effectively run in parallel on a GPU soon after the introduction of CUDA.
