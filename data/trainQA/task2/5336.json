Full-data setting has aroused wide concerns in the area of MRC in recent years. Popular benchmark SQuAD [ref]21 [ref]22, which is sourced from from Wikipedia articles, contains over 100,000 questions. It forms an abundant database for the model training. Similarly, HotpotQA [ref]23 includes 113K questions with a variety of reasoning strategies. It stresses more on the multi-hop reasoning abilities of the model. RACE dataset  is specially designed to improve the reading skills for both middle school and high school students, which contains about 9.7K examples. Also, some domain-specific datasets like NewsQA , TextbookQA , PubMedQA , aim at the area of journalism, education and biology respectively. All of them have rich training examples to improve the model capability. However, such full-data setting encourages the models to depend on the ideal scenes with abundant training data, which may not fit in some real cases. Based on such concern, some previous works focus on the low-resource setting MRC, including few-shot or zero-shot setting. For example, to evaluate the robustness of the model,  reconstructs the data from knowledge sources for zero-shot commonsense QA. Also,  proposes a neuro-symbolic approach to boost the performance of zero-shot commonsense QA. Both of the methods are not exposed to the training data, forming a zero-shot setting. However, they rely on the extra knowledge bases, which limits their applications. There are also some works related to the few-shot\nQA. In , a new pretraining strategy is proposed to explore the realistic few-shot setting. Also,  tackles the few-shot\nchallenge on the task of Visual Question Answering. However, all of the above methods simply obtain the few-shot splits according to the amount, which treat all the samples equally. To sum up, current MRC benchmarks mainly focus on the common types of questions. However, in reality, it is more challenging when faced with some uncommon types of questions. To make up for these drawbacks, we attend to the reasoning types in the logical reasoning tasks and propose the first benchmark for zero-shot logical reasoning based on type attributes.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: into two settings: full-data setting and low-resource (i.e., few-shot, zero-shot) setting. Full-data setting has aroused wide concerns in the area of MRC in recent years. Popular benchmark SQuAD [ref]21 [ref]22, which is sourced from from Wikipedia articles, contains over 100,000 questions. It forms an abundant database for the model training. Similarly, HotpotQA [ref]23 includes 113K\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
