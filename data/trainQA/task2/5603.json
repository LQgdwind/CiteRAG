      "content": "Paper Title: VQA with Cascade of Self- and Co-Attention Blocks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVQA, being a multimodal task, requires an unified representation of the text and image modalities. Initial VQA models [ref]2 2   adopted simple fusion based approaches. These models first obtained feature representations of individual modality using corresponding pre-trained networks and then combined them to obtain a joint representation using a fusion schema. Simple fusion schemes include concatenation or element-wise summation or multiplication. Fukui et al.  proposed bi-linear pooling to capture interaction of components of the two modalities in a better way. Seeing the advantage of the bilinear pooling based fusion methods, further variants of bilinear pooling with lesser complexity or faster convergence were proposed. MFB 9, MLB , MFH  were proposed to obtain a representation providing better interaction of the two modalities. Introduction of attention mechanism in  equipped neural models with a systematic procedure to assign relative weights of importance to sequential inputs. Shi et al. in  have introduced image attention guided by question to focus on salient image regions relevant to the given question. This helped in obtaining improved feature representations. This led to the development of several attention based approaches for VQA 645. Studies in 64 have shown that applying attention multiple times helps in obtaining enriched representation embedded with fine-grained information. Authors in 9 have proposed that attention on textual features in context of visual features along with visual attention plays a key role in VQA models. Such two way attention mechanism is referred to as dual attention or co-attention or cross-modality attention in the literature. We have also used these terms interchangeably. Kim et al.  have proposed bilinear interaction based attention for dual modality. Do et al.  have proposed an approach by exploiting knowledge distillation with a teacher and student model. Mishra et al.  have proposed co-attention based multistage model for VQA. In another work, the authors  have proposed question categorization and dual attention for VQA. RAMEN 0 is an unified model that uses high level reasoning and can deal with VQA datasets based on both real-world and synthetic images. Another class of attention mechanism uses intra-modal attention (self-attention) along with cross-modal attention (co-attention) to learn better feature representation. Gao et.al.  have proposed DFAF that combines self-attention and co-attention. Multi-modal Latent Interaction (MLIN) 0 used multi-modal reasoning through summarization, interaction, and aggregation. Yu et al. 8 have proposed an encoder-decoder based dense attention mechanism. These models are relatively dense than the previous approaches and hence, are referred to as dense attention based models. Authors in 2 have proposed transformer based attention models for multimodality tasks. These models are pretrained for multiple tasks on huge datasets, that could be further exploited for downstream tasks. The proposed model falls in the category of dense attention based methods. It uses a cascade of attention blocks to obtain a multi-modal feature representation. Here, each attention block comprises of intra-modality and cross-modality interactions. The proposed method is described next.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: VQA, being a multimodal task, requires an unified representation of the text and image modalities.
