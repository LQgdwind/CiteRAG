      "content": "Paper Title: Family Ties: Relating Poncelet 3-Periodics by their Properties\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBelow we show that the orthic triangles of Family II 3-periodics are the image of the poristic family [ref]19 under a variable rigid rotation about X3subscript𝑋3X_{3}. Family II 3-periodics conserve the product of cosines, given by: CAS-assisted simplification.\n∎ The orthic triangle has vertices at the feet of a triangle’s altitudes . Let Rhsubscript𝑅ℎR_{h} denote its circumradius. A known property is that Rh=R/2subscript𝑅ℎ𝑅2R_{h}=R/2 [28, Orthic Triangle, Eqn. 7]. Therefore, it is invariant over family II 3-periodics. Referring to Figure 6 (left): The inradius rhsubscript𝑟ℎr_{h} of family II orthic triangles is invariant and given by rh=a​b/(a+b)subscript𝑟ℎ𝑎𝑏𝑎𝑏r_{h}=ab/(a+b). rh=2​R​∏i=13cos⁡θisubscript𝑟ℎ2𝑅superscriptsubscriptproduct𝑖13subscript𝜃𝑖r_{h}=2R\\prod_{i=1}^{3}{\\cos\\theta_{i}} [28, Orthic Triangle, Eqn. 5]. Referring to Lemma 1 completes the proof.\n∎ Let (ℰI​I,ℰI​I′′)subscriptℰ𝐼𝐼subscriptsuperscriptℰ′′𝐼𝐼(\\mathcal{E}_{II},\\mathcal{E}^{\\prime\\prime}_{II}) denote the confocal pair which is an affine image of a circle-inellipse concentric pair. Let α,β𝛼𝛽\\alpha,\\beta and α′′,β′′superscript𝛼′′superscript𝛽′′\\alpha^{\\prime\\prime},\\beta^{\\prime\\prime} denote the semi-axes of ℰI​Isubscriptℰ𝐼𝐼\\mathcal{E}_{II}, and ℰI​I′′subscriptsuperscriptℰ′′𝐼𝐼\\mathcal{E}^{\\prime\\prime}_{II}, respectively. The invariant product of cosines for family II triangles is identical to the one obtained from excentral triangles of 3-periodics in (ℰI​I,ℰ′′I​I)subscriptℰ𝐼𝐼subscriptsuperscriptℰ′′𝐼𝐼(\\mathcal{E}_{II},\\mathcal{E^{\\prime\\prime}}_{II}). Excentrals in the confocal pair conserve the product of cosines [12, Corollary 2]. Recall that for any triangle: where θi′superscriptsubscript𝜃𝑖′\\theta_{i}^{\\prime} are the angles of the excentral triangle.\nPlugging a=α′′𝑎superscript𝛼′′a={\\alpha^{\\prime\\prime}} and b=αβ​β′′𝑏𝛼𝛽superscript𝛽′′b=\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\beta^{\\prime\\prime} into (1) yields four times the above identity when r/R𝑟𝑅r/R is computed as in (3), completing the proof.\n∎ Family II 3-periodics are always acute. Since X3subscript𝑋3X_{3} is the common center and is internal to the caustic, it will be interior to Family II 3-periodics, i.e., the latter are acute.\n∎ Let ℐ′superscriptℐ′\\mathcal{I}^{\\prime} be a (moving) reference frame centered on X3subscript𝑋3X_{3} with one axis oriented toward X5subscript𝑋5X_{5} (or X4subscript𝑋4X_{4} as these 3 are collinear). Referring to Figure 4 (right): With respect to ℐ′superscriptℐ′\\mathcal{I}^{\\prime}, family II 3-periodics are the excentral triangles to the poristic family (modulo a rigid rotation about X3subscript𝑋3X_{3}). Equivalently, family II orthics are identical (up to said variable rotation) to the poristic triangles. X5subscript𝑋5X_{5} of a reference triangle is X3subscript𝑋3X_{3} of the orthic triangle . Since the family is always acute (Lemma 2), X4subscript𝑋4X_{4} of the reference is X1subscript𝑋1X_{1} of the orthic triangle . By Proposition 7, d′=|X5−X3|superscript𝑑′subscript𝑋5subscript𝑋3d^{\\prime}=|X_{5}-X_{3}| is invariant, i.e., the distance between X1subscript𝑋1X_{1} and X3subscript𝑋3X_{3} of the orthic triangle is invariant. The claim follows from noting X3,X5,X4subscript𝑋3subscript𝑋5subscript𝑋4X_{3},X_{5},X_{4} are collinear  and that the orthic inradius and\ncircumradius are invariant, Proposition 9.\n∎ Recall from [10, Thm.2]: The X3subscript𝑋3X_{3}-centered inconic to the poristic excentral triangles is a rigidly-rotating ellipse with axes R+d′𝑅superscript𝑑′R+d^{\\prime} and R−d′𝑅superscript𝑑′R-d^{\\prime}.\n Which makes sense when one considers the rotating reference frame. Also recall from [10, Thm.1] that: The MacBeath Inconic to the excentrals is stationary with axes R𝑅R and R2−d′⁣2superscript𝑅2superscript𝑑′2\\sqrt{R^{2}-d^{\\prime 2}}. Therefore its focal length is simply 2​d′=|X4−X3|2superscript𝑑′subscript𝑋4subscript𝑋32d^{\\prime}=|X_{4}-X_{3}|. Furthermore, because poristic triangles are the image of billiard 3-periodics under a (varying) affine transform [10, Thm.4], Family II 3-periodics will share all scale-free invariants with billiard excentrals, such as product of cosines, ratio of area to its orthic triangle, etc., see .\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: Below we show that the orthic triangles of Family II 3-periodics are the image of the poristic family [ref]19 under a variable rigid rotation about X3subscript𝑋3X_{3}.
