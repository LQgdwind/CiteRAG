      "content": "Paper Title: Selective Learning: Towards Robust Calibration with Dynamic Regularization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we first present several closely related research topics, including confidence calibration, uncertainty estimation, and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We then summarize how proposed method DReg differs from previous regularization-based approaches in above research topics. Confidence calibration. A well-calibrated classifier can be approached through two main orthogonal methods: post-hoc calibration and regularization-based calibration. In post-hoc calibration, after the classifier is trained, its predicted confidence is adjusted by training extra parameters on a validation set to improve calibration without modifying the original model [ref]2 . An example is temperature scaling [ref]2, where a temperature parameter is trained on the validation set to scale the predicted probability distribution. On the other hand, regularization-based calibration avoids classifier miscalibration by incorporating regularization techniques during the training of deep neural networks[ref]2  [ref]5. This includes strategies such as training with strong weight decay [ref]2, label smoothing [ref]5, penalizing confidence [ref]6, focusing on under-confident samples    , and constraining the norm of logits  . Note that among the two main orthogonal methods of post-hoc calibration and regularization-based calibration, the main research focus of this paper is on the latter. Uncertainty estimation. The primary goal of uncertainty estimation is to obtain the reliability of the model. Traditional uncertainty estimation methods utilize ensemble learning   and Bayesian neural networks     to obtain the distribution of predictions, from which uncertainty can be estimated using the variance or entropy of the distribution. Recently, several regularization-based uncertainty estimation methods have been proposed. These methods typically obtain uncertainty by applying regularization to neural networks using either additional out-of-distribution dataset  or training set samples . Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. OOD detection aims to distinguish potential out-of-distribution samples during test time to avoid unreliable predictions. One of the primary approaches is to modify the loss function during training, thereby constraining the deep neural network to effectively identify potential OOD samples. Specifically, existing methods usually impose constraints on the model, such as having a uniform prediction distribution    or higher energy    , particularly on the additional outlier training set. Comparison with existing methods. The core principle shared by regularization-based approaches in above topics is to impose regularization on neural networks during training to prevent overfitting. These methods can be roughly categorized into two types: (1) standard training without additional training data – These methods aim to simultaneously achieve accurate classification and regularize the model to maximize prediction entropy on the training dataset. However, as shown in the introduction, there is an underlying trade-off between achieving high accuracy and high entropy, making it challenging to effectively balance these two objectives. (2) training utilizing additional outlier data – Methods along this line leverage external additional outlier datasets to regularize the model. The prohibitively large sample space of outliers requires additional sample selection strategies to obtain outliers that can effectively regularize the behavior of the model . However, the artificially designed sample selection strategies may introduce biases into the distribution of outlier samples, resulting in a failure to characterize the true distribution of OOD data encountered at test time. Besides, how to effectively utilize outlier samples to improve calibration is still an open problem. In contrast to the aforementioned methods, DReg aims to explore and leverage information from naturally occurring challenging samples within the training set that have a high probability of being similar to ones encountered at test time. In this way, DReg eliminates the need for additional external outlier datasets and the corresponding sample selection strategies, while avoiding the trade-off between model performance and regularization DReg.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: calibration, after the classifier is trained, its predicted confidence is adjusted by training extra parameters on a validation set to improve calibration without modifying the original model [ref]2 .
