      "content": "Paper Title: Search For Deep Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs), a class of deep learning models designed for performing information interaction on non-Euclidean graph data, have been successfully applied to applications of various domains such as recommender systems [ref]44 [ref]25, physics  2 4 and natural language processing   . Although GNNs and their variants   [ref]40  have shown convincing performance in a variety of graph datasets, the design of graph convolutional layers often require domain knowledge and laborious human involvement. Moreover, unlike most CNN models in computer vision tasks, GNNs often show poor transferability toward different scenarios, and require additional manual adjustments when dealing with new tasks. Meanwhile, emerged as a powerful tool for automatic neural network optimization, neural network architecture search (NAS)      has been widely applied for discovering high-performance network architectures in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Recently, GraphNAS  has made the first attempt to apply NAS method to graph data by utilizing existing GNN layers to build the final architecture while leveraging the power of RNN with policy gradient to adaptively optimize the model, followed by several related works as Auto-GNN  and SNAG . However, both the hand-crafted and NAS-designed GNN models are constrained by “over-smooth” problem  thus share a simple and shallow architecture. For example, GCN , GAT [ref]40 and GraphNAS  only stack 2 layers for the transductive learning tasks, while SNAG chooses 3 layers. Although achieving their best performance, such a shallow structure limits the model’s ability to extract information from high-order neighbors, and the potential power brought by structure diversity is underutilized. Some recent works have made efforts to explore different GNN structures, such as Inception-like module 1, DenseNet-like snowball structure , as well as deeper GNN models  . Although these works show possible benefits brought by GNN structural diversity and depth, the structurally diversified GNN design space is not fully explored. In this work, we aim at digging deeper into the potential benefits of GNN architectures’ diversity and depth, and propose a novel GNN generation pipeline to automatically search for high-performance GNN models. As is mentioned in , GNN architecture search suffers from an exponentially growing search space, especially when the layer number increases. To cope with such problem, we propose a two-stage search space that incorporates various flexible model structures such as inception-like module and residual connection, while also greatly reduces the number of candidate models when the overall depth grows. Besides, to further alleviate the “over-smooth” problem in deep GNN layers, we apply initial residual connection  and identity mapping  to our basic graph convolutional layers. Finally, our search space still contains billions of possible GNN architectures even after pruning. To effectively explore our proposed search space, we apply the deep-q-learning algorithm (DQN)  with epsilon-greedy strategy, accompanied with reward reshaping technique  and experience replay  that further accelerate and stabilize the search process. Highlights of our work are listed as follows: Deep and flexible GNN architecture: We extend the initial residual connection and identity mapping to various GNN layers thus achieve deep and high-performance GNN models. To fully exploit structural diversity, we also incorporate flexible GNN stacking rules in our search space, which could emulate efficient structures such as residual and inception-like modules. Two-stage search space: We propose a block-wise GNN architecture generation pipeline, and divide the overall search space into two stages, as block-wise and architecture-wise search, which greatly reduces the exponentially growing search space and improves search efficiency. Transfererble GNN blocks: Unlike most current GNN structure, our generated GNN block in the first-stage space could be easily transferred to other datasets without researching, while retaining high accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: of deep learning models designed for performing information interaction on non-Euclidean graph data, have been successfully applied to applications of various domains such as recommender systems [ref]44 [ref]25, physics  2 4 and natural language processing   .
