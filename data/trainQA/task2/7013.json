      "content": "Paper Title: Client-side Gradient Inversion Against Federated Learning from Poisoning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInversion attacks typically consist of two types: model inversion attack (MIA) and gradient inversion attack (GIA). In these attacks, the adversary aims to reconstruct original training data by utilizing either gradient information or a publicly available model. Typical MIA¬†[ref]11 attempts to fit real confidence score distribution to extract training data from DNN based on black-box access. More advanced model inversion attack can only use label¬†[ref]16 or exploit GAN¬† to launch the attack. GIA usually poses a greater threat compared to MIA due to its ability to reconstruct user‚Äôs private input with higher precision. The adversary‚Äôs goal in a GIA attack is to find an input (x,y)ùë•ùë¶(x,y) such that it can produce the same gradient as a certain local gradient update (or equivalently model update), which can be observed by the server during FL training. It is generally achieved by optimizing the l2subscriptùëô2l_{2} distance¬† or cosine similarity¬† between the gradient associated with (x,y)ùë•ùë¶(x,y) and server‚Äôs observation. Inferring the true value of yùë¶y (i.e., label inference) is essential in the effectiveness of GIAs, including reducing the search space and stabilizing the optimization processing, which finally improves inversion performance. In particular, iDLG¬† and GradInversion¬†[ref]36 developed successful zero-shot label inference methods based on the feature of cross-entropy loss and the final layer gradient. By assuming knowledge of batch normalization layers as a prior, GradInversion¬†[ref]36 makes an amazing effect on image gradient inversion. Some researchers also demonstrated other methods to invert gradients besides optimization methods. One of the successful methods based on mathematical analysis to infer input¬†. In such attacks, the adversary generally plays as server side and sends malicious parameters to clients¬†  or change framework structure¬† to capture some features. Another successful method is based on generative models. These methods ¬†   can produce realistic data, but the data is different from the inputs.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: and gradient inversion attack (GIA).
