      "content": "Paper Title: Channel Pruning Guided by Spatial and Channel Attention for DNNs in Intelligent Edge Computing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPruning approaches. The pruning approaches for DNNs can be generally classified as two categories, i.e., non-structured pruning and structured pruning. Early studies   [ref]27  are mainly based on weight pruning, resulting in non-structured sparsity in the pruned model. The runtime acceleration is difficult to be achieved because of irregular memory access [ref]29, unless using specialized hardware and libraries. Pioneered by [ref]29 [ref]12, structured pruning overcomes this problem by removing whole filters or channels and producing a non-sparse compressed model [ref]29 [ref]27 . Structured pruning can be classified into four types according to pruning granularities, including layer pruning, filter pruning, channel pruning and kernel pruning. It is noteworthy that channel pruning and filter pruning are correlated, because pruning the channel of current layer will cause the corresponding filter of the upper layer to be removed [ref]12. In this paper, we focus on channel pruning, which targets at removing a certain number of channels and the relevant filters to compress DNN models. ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-norm based work  used the ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-norm of filters as the pruning criterion. Network Slimming  adopted the Batch Normalization (BN) layers to scale different channels, and identified the channels with relatively smaller scale factors as the unimportant ones to be pruned. Some studies proposed to prune the channels that have the smallest impact on the feature reconstruction error between the original model and the pruned model. The work in  proposed a greedy search based method to minimize the reconstruction error, and another work [ref]12 retained the representative channels by solving a lasso regression problem about the reconstruction error. Both of them only considered local statistics of two consecutive layers, i.e., prune one layer to minimize the next layer’s reconstruction error. Considering the effect of potential error propagation in the entire network, NISP  proposed to minimize the reconstruction errors using the global importance scores propagated from the second-to-last layer before classification. It must be noted that a good metric for channel pruning should take not only the channel importance from a global view but also the correlation between different channels  . Attention mechanisms. The attention mechanism can effectively help to improve the classification performance of DNNs , by enhancing the representation of feature map with more important information and suppressing the interference of unnecessary information  . Attention has been widely used in recent applications, e.g., neural machine translation , image captioning , object detection , and generative modeling . To improve the performance of image classification, SENet (Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks)  proposed a light-weight gating mechanism to exploit the channel-wise relationships. It is actually an attention mechanism applied along the channel dimension, but neglects the importance of the spatial dimension. The SGE (Spatial Group-wise Enhance) module  is designed to enhance the ability of each of its feature groups to express different semantics while suppressing possible noise and interference. It is essentially a spatial attention module that misses the spatial attention. Both CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module)  and BAM (Bottleneck Attention Module)  exploit both spatial-wise and channel-wise attention, and verify that combining both is superior to using either of them. The structure design of these two modules are different. CBAM sequentially apply channel and spatial attention, while BAM computes the two attentions in a simultaneous way. Attention-based pruning methods. In recent years, attention mechanisms have also been introduced for improving the performance of model pruning. For example, the work in  proposed to apply the SENet model to evaluate channel importance, so that the redundant channels with least importance can be identified and removed. However, the limitation of SENet itself makes the scale value generated by this model can not fully reflect the channel importance and improve the pruning performance. PCAS  designed a new attention model and evaluated the importance of channels based on attention statistics. Actually, the module in PCAS is only a channel attention module, and has two fully connected layers that incur additional overhead and complexity. Moreover, the operations of dimensionality reduction bring side effect   on channel attention prediction. To address these problems, we propose a new attention module that exploits both spatial and channel-wise attention based on an efficient structure design, and verify its superior performance over state-of-the-art solutions in the process of channel pruning.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: Pruning approaches.
