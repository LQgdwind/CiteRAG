      "content": "Paper Title: HistGen: Histopathology Report Generation via Local-Global Feature Encoding and Cross-modal Context Interaction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHistopathology tissue analysis reveals critical details about tumor characteristics and is considered the gold standard in cancer diagnosis and prognosis .\nIn the last decade, the increasing availability of digital WSIs has given rise to computational pathology (CPath), promoting diagnostics with computer-assisted tools.\nRecent success of deep learning has notably advanced this field, outperforming experienced pathologists on specific tasks   6.\nHowever, pathologists are still required to compile findings and craft reports for each WSI, a task that is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and error-prone.\nThus, the automated generation of pathology reports holds immense potential in facilitating the report-writing process and alleviating the heavy workloads for pathologists. Additionally, these automated reports can underscore abnormalities and offer diagnostic rationales, aiding pathologists in their analyses.\n Contrasting with the field of radiology report generation [ref]8 [ref]7 , WSI report generation faces unique challenges. A primary obstacle is the lack of recognized benchmark datasets; existing datasets predominantly focus on patch-level images and captions   , neglecting comprehensive, global descriptions of entire WSIs.\nAdditionally, the gigapixel size of WSIs poses unique challenges for the visual encoding stage of report generation and hinders the direct adoption of existing report generation methods.\nMoreover, the contrast between enormous informative WSI patches of dense visual signals and succinctly summarized diagnostic reports of discrete textual tokens underscores the need for cross-modal interactions.\nFurther, prevalent WSI analysis methods rely on multiple instance learning (MIL), necessitating pre-trained feature extractors, which we empirically identify as a critical bottleneck, impeding optimal performance in WSI report generation.\n Related Work: Multiple instance learning in CPath. Given the gigapixel size of WSIs and GPU memory limitations , MIL framework is prevalently used for WSI analysis. This method tiles a WSI into patches, using a pre-trained feature extractor to convert them into feature vectors, which are then aggregated into a WSI-level representation for prediction    6  .\nSeveral works   used max-pooling to locate the most suspicious instances for slide-level prediction. To engage information of all patches, a side network was employed in  to compute attention score of each patch and use it as the weight for aggregation. Li et al.  utilized cosine distance between instances as the weighting factor for aggregation. Shao et al. 6 further adopted transformer layers to explore the long-range instance correlations.\nHowever, recent studies in MIL mainly focus on WSI-level prediction tasks, with WSI report generation under-explored along this research direction, which is the focus of this work. Image captioning and report generation. Image captioning   8  and radiology report generation [ref]8 [ref]7 are the most relevant fields to this work. These tasks require models to generate descriptive captions or diagnostic reports for input natural or radiology images.\nVarious studies   adopted the CNN-RNN framework for image encoding and caption decoding. Recent advent of Transformer 8 enabled capturing long-range dependencies, with further explorations proposed to bridge encoding and decoding stages . This concept is similarly applied in radiology report generation [ref]8 [ref]7.\nHowever, the gigapixel size of WSIs requires immense computational capacity, making the direct application of these methods to WSI data impractical. Pioneering efforts in WSI report generation have been made 5 4 , yet they mainly involve simple combinations of existing MIL and captioning models (e.g.,  combined TransMIL 6 with a transformer decoder), neglecting the connections between visual and textual modalities along with their distinct characteristics. Contribution: Building on the success of image captioning     and radiology report generation [ref]8 [ref]7 , and addressing unique challenges in WSI data, we present HistGen, a MIL-based histopathology report generation framework, designed to address WSI report generation from a cross-modal interaction perspective by aligning WSIs and diagnostic reports across local and global granularity.\nOur primary contributions are summarized as follows: We curate a benchmark WSI-report dataset of around 7,800 pairs by building a report collection and cleaning pipeline based on the TCGA platform 7. A local-global hierarchical visual encoder is proposed for effective encoding and aggregation of extensive WSI patch features in a region-to-slide manner. We develop a cross-modal context module to enable interactions between visual encoding and textual decoding, leveraging cross-modal information. Further, we pre-train a general-purpose MIL feature extractor on over 55,000 WSIs to boost MIL feature encoding. With extensive experimental validation, our framework outperforms SOTA methods on WSI report generation by a large margin. Moreover, experiment results on cancer subtyping and survival analysis tasks exhibit superior transfer learning capability of HistGen, with it achieving SOTA on both tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Additionally, these automated reports can underscore abnormalities and offer diagnostic rationales, aiding pathologists in their analyses.\n Contrasting with the field of radiology report generation [ref]8 [ref]7 , WSI report generation faces unique challenges.
