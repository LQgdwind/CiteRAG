      "content": "Paper Title: Programming Language Case Studies Can Be Deep\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe design of HCPL is informed by a number of concepts in pedagogy scholarship.\nA main strategy for helping students navigate the technical breadth of the course is by providing flexibility and transparency in the evaluation process.\nAn early iteration of the course took a fully project-based  approach, before pivoting to a blend of autograding and completion111Completion grading is a grading scheme where full points are awarded on all problems that are completed, irrespective of any quality assessment grading with peer-review elements in subsequent instances of the course. These pedagogical design decisions are informed by the philosophy of ungrading   , which views rating and ranking of students as fundamentally detrimental to the process of learning, aiming instead to maximize intrinsic motivation, often through choice and ownership.\nIn ungrading contexts, a common challenge is student self-regulation , a trait which is associated with future student success but can rarely be cultivated by a single course.\nIn response to this challenge, the present iteration of the HCPL course uses autograding as a means of providing external regulation of students, under the hypothesis that once students have fulfilled one set of classwork obligations thanks to external regulation, they are more likely to fulfill their completion-graded assignments as well.\nSee prior work  for further discussion of the relationship between HCPL and ungrading, including student reactions to the practice, both positive and negative. HCPL is not the only open-access PL textbook nor the only to provide open-access companion materials, but the choice of open access was an intentional one.\nOpen education   4  is the long-running movement to make educational as widely available as possible through the reduction of barriers.\nThe use of open access and even, in part, the use of autograding are intended to enable an open education experience, e.g., for self-study outside a university setting. The HCPL course is potentially challenging to execute for instructors because of its technical breadth.\nOne strategy for coping with its breadth is to keep an explicit focus methodology, and bring students back to the different methodologies used.\nIn written tasks from completion-graded assignments, the literatures on reflective journals  and autoethnography  can both guide classroom practice.\nIn the social science modules of HCPL, key techniques include the use of thematic analysis  [ref]11 and personas ; ample resources are available for both. Other teaching methods in HCPL have their origins in the humanities and have seeped into CS over time.\nIn particular, the use of dialogues between archetypes has thousands of years of methodological precedent in the form of Socratic dialectic  , though our dialogues by comparison are intended to reveal a multitude of co-existing perspectives instead of guiding a student to a specific truth known by a teacher.\nIn the modern era, Proofs and Refutations 7 is a well-known use of dialectic to teach computer scientists about mathematical proof, which is at the heart of PL theory.\nEducators firmly within the humanities can dive into more specific methodologies not addressed in depth by the HCPL text, such as codework 9, poetry in the medium of code. The HCPL approach is also indebted to the literature of PL pedagogy specifically, not limited solely to Krishnamurthy’s essay on the role of paradigms in PL education 5.\nFor example, recent scholarship on social issues education for CS students has advocated integration across the curriculum instead of standalone courses ; HCPL’s coverage of gender and disability issues implements this approach.\nThe use and discussion of toy teaching languages in HCPL is informed by the lessons learned by other PL education researchers; classroom discussions of the transition from a teaching language to a production quality language are partially inspired in particular by A Data-Centric Introduction to Computing’s  explicit coverage of this transition process. Like any new course design, the development of HCPL was motivated by the dearth of existing courses that filled its interdisciplinary niche. At the same time, the few prior courses that filled this niche are thus all the more important.\nIn particular, the work of Michael Coblenz, Jonathan Aldrich, and their collaborators  directly influenced the first iteration of the HCPL course, an influence which thus carries through indirectly in the book.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: the literatures on reflective journals  and autoethnography  can both guide classroom practice.\nIn the social science modules of HCPL, key techniques include the use of thematic analysis  [ref]11 and personas ; ample resources are available for both. Other teaching methods in HCPL have their origins in the humanities and have seeped into CS over time.\nIn particular, the use of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
