      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Vision-and-Language Navigation with Image-Text Pairs from the Web\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent works have demonstrated that high-capacity models trained under self-supervised objectives on large-scale web data can learn strong, generalizable representations for both language and images [ref]7  [ref]18  6  . We build upon these works as a basis for transfer and describe them briefly here. Language Modeling with BERT.\nThe BERT [ref]7 model is a large transformer-based  architecture for language modeling. The model takes as input sequences of tokenized words augmented with positional embeddings and outputs a representation for each. For example, a two sentence input could be written as where CLS, and SEP are special tokens. To train this approach, [ref]7 introduce two self-supervised objectives ‚Äì masked language modelling and next sentence prediction. Given two input sentences from a text corpus, the masked language modelling objective masks out some percentage of tokens and tasks the model to predict their values given the remaining tokens as context. The next sentence prediction objective requires the model to predict whether the two sentences follow each other in the original corpus or not. BERT is then trained under these objectives on large language corpuses from the web (Wikipedia and BooksCorpus¬†). This model forms the basis for both our approach and the visiolinguistic representation learning discussed next. Visiolinguistic Representations Learning with ViLBERT.\nExtending BERT, ViLBERT¬†[ref]18 (and a number of similar approaches  [ref]18  6  ) focuses on learning joint visiolinguistic representations from paired image-text data, specifically web images and their associated alt-text collected in the Conceptual Captions dataset . ViLBERT is composed of two BERT-like processing streams that operate on visual and textual inputs, respectively. The input to the visual stream is composed of image regions (generated by an object detector¬† 2 pretrained on Visual Genome¬†) that act as ‚Äúwords‚Äù in the visual domain. Concretely, given a single image IùêºI consisting of a set of image regions {v1,‚Ä¶,vk}subscriptùë£1‚Ä¶subscriptùë£ùëò\\{v_{1},\\dots,v_{k}\\} and a text sequence (i.e. a caption) w1,‚Ä¶,wLsubscriptùë§1‚Ä¶subscriptùë§ùêøw_{1},\\dots,w_{L}, we can write the input to ViLBERT as the sequence where IMG, CLS, and SEP are special tokens marking the different modality sub-sequences. The two streams are connected using co-attention¬† transformer layers, which attend from the visual stream over language stream and vice versa. Notably, the language stream of ViLBERT is designed to mirror BERT such that it can be initialized by a pretrained BERT model. After processing, the model produces a contextualized output representation for each input token. In analogy to the training objectives in BERT, ViLBERT introduces the masked multimodal modelling and multimodal alignment tasks. In the first, a random subset of language tokens and image regions are masked and must be predicted given the remaining context. For image regions, this amounts to predicting a distribution over object classes present in the masked region. Masked text tokens are handled as in BERT. The multimodal alignment objective trains the model to determine if an image-text pair matches, i.e. if the text describes the image content. Individual token outputs are used to predict masked inputs in the masking objective, and the IMG and CLS tokens are used for the image-caption alignment objective. We build upon this model extensively in this work.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Recent works have demonstrated that high-capacity models trained under self-supervised objectives on large-scale web data can learn strong, generalizable representations for both language and images [ref]7  [ref]18  6  .
