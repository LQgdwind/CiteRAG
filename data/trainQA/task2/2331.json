      "content": "Paper Title: Structured Denoising Diffusion Models in Discrete State-Spaces\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDiffusion generative models were first proposed by Sohl-Dickstein et al.  and have gained renewed attention recently due to strong results on image and waveform generation  . Recent works have proposed improvements for diffusion model training, including importance sampling of the ELBO, better noise schedules  and implicit diffusion models [ref]44. Several works have also drawn connections to score matching  1 , leading to improved sampling algorithms in the continuous-time limit . While most works have considered continuous diffusion models, discrete diffusion-like models were described in  and applied to text generation and image segmentation data in . Some works [ref]31  have dealt with discrete data by embedding it in continuous space and leveraging Gaussian diffusion, but have not applied this to text. Seff et al.  also considered generation of discrete structured objects using a diffusion-like Markov corruption process. For text, denoising autoencoders have a long history both in representation learning   and more recently as generative models . These closely resemble our absorbing state diffusion variants for a particular schedule and transition matrix (see Section 4), although our framing allows us to compute log-likelihoods and experiment with alternative transition matrices. Other works have considered non-autoregressive translation and speech transcription via insertion and deletion  , masking , and iteratively-refined sequence alignments  .\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: and waveform generation  .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
