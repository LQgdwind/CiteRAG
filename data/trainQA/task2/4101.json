      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Attention-based Representations from Multiple Patterns for Relation Prediction in Knowledge Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets. The experiments are based on six widely used datasets: WN18, WN18RR, FB15k, FB15k-237, UMLS, and Kinship. Details and statistics about them can be found in¬†A. WN18¬†3 is a subset from WordNet¬†, a KG containing lexical relations among English words. FB15k¬†3 is a subset from Freebase¬†, a KG containing human knowledge facts. WN18RR¬†1 and FB15k-237¬†2 are subsets of WN18 and FB15k, respectively, where the original inverse relations were removed. UMLS¬†3 is built upon data from the Unified Medical Language System¬†, a biomedical ontology. Kinship¬†3 contains information regarding kinship relationships among members of an Australian tribe¬†[ref]48. We used the originally provided data splits for WN18, WN18RR, FB15k, and FB15k-237, and for UMLS and Kinship, we use the data splits provided by¬†0. Baselines. When experimenting with WN18, WN18RR, FB15k, and FB15k-237, we compare √ÜMP, and its variations, with six models that have results also targetting at the relation prediction task: TransE¬†3, ComplEx¬†4, SimplE¬†, RotatE¬†5, QuatE¬†6 are the models representing the state-of-the-art in embedding-based models, while PathCon¬†6 is the state-of-the-art closer to our model, using entities context and relational path as features in the learning process. We reused the results reported in¬†6. We trained from scratch UMLS, and Kinship with PathCon¬†6 as this is the most similar method to √ÜMP and the SOTA in the relation prediction task. Implementation details. We implemented √ÜMP333https://github.com/MeLLL-UFF/AEMP using PyTorch¬† and trained using a single Nvidia V100 GPU. B shows the hyperparameters‚Äô search space, which were varied in the experiments. In our best experimentation settings, we have a learning rate of 10‚àí3superscript10310^{-3} with Adam¬† optimizer. To avoid overfitting, we employ L2 regularization using L2 weight loss of 10‚àí7superscript10710^{-7}. We adopt a batch size of 128, 25 training epochs, hidden states of 64 dimensions, and 0.2 as the random attention context selection criteria. Finally, on WN18, WN18RR, UMLS, and Kinship benchmarks, we employed three-hops entities context and semantic path length up to three; on FB15k and FB15k-237 benchmarks, we employed two-hops entities‚Äô context and semantic path length up to two, due to hardware limitations and the size of each benchmark. Evaluation protocol. We evaluate all models on their capabilities of completing missing facts on KGs, assessing them under the relation prediction task. As described in Section¬†1, the task aims to infer a new fact f=(h,r,t)ùëì‚Ñéùëüùë°f=(h,r,t) by predicting a relation rùëür given a pair of entities (h,t)‚Ñéùë°(h,t). We report results from Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank (MR), and correctly predicted relations (Hit ratio) in the top 1 and 3 rank evaluation metrics. A lower value of MR points out better results, while the other metrics target higher values. The results are the average and standard deviation values from five independent executions.\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: UMLS¬†3 is built upon data from the Unified Medical Language System¬†, a biomedical ontology. Kinship¬†3 contains information regarding kinship relationships among members of an Australian tribe¬†[ref]48. We used the originally provided data splits for WN18, WN18RR, FB15k, and FB15k-237, and for UMLS and Kinship, we use the data splits provided by¬†0. Baselines.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
