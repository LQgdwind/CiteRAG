Table I lists the complexity of constructing a 𝒫​(N,K,m)𝒫𝑁𝐾𝑚\\mathcal{P}(N,K,m) polar code by each of these algorithms. For each evaluation point, the number of simulated transmissions is such that the number of observed frame errors is at least 500500500 and the number of total simulated transmissions is at least 106superscript10610^{6}. The hyper-parameters adopted in the implementation of Tal-Vardy, GenAlg, the tabular RL method, and the IMP algorithm are: Tal-Vardy : The fidelity parameter is set as μ=2​⌊log⁡N⌋𝜇2𝑁\\mu=2\\lfloor\\log N\\rfloor. GenAlg [ref]35: The hyper-parameters are consistent with the ones adopted in [ref]35: the population size is S=20𝑆20S=20, and the number of truncated parents is T=5𝑇5T=5. The number of Monte-Carlo simulations for each iteration’s FER estimates is set such that either the number of observed frame errors reaches 103superscript10310^{3} or the number of simulated frames reaches 106superscript10610^{6}. The maximum number of population update iterations is Np​o​p=1000subscript𝑁𝑝𝑜𝑝1000N_{pop}=1000. Tabular RL method [ref]38: The discount rate is set to 111. The trace decay factor λ𝜆\\lambda, the neighborhood update rate κ𝜅\\kappa, and the exploration rate ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon for the ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-greedy policy are initialized as λ=0.8𝜆0.8\\lambda=0.8, κ=1𝜅1\\kappa=1, and ϵ=0.5italic-ϵ0.5\\epsilon=0.5, respectively. As the training proceeds, λ𝜆\\lambda, κ𝜅\\kappa, and ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon are updated gradually towards 0.90.90.9, 00, and 15​N15𝑁\\frac{1}{5N} for length-N𝑁N polar codes, respectively. The maximum number of training episodes is 2×1052superscript1052\\times 10^{5}. IMP algorithm: The maximum message passing iterations M𝑀M is set to 333. For initialization operations, dloc=4subscript𝑑loc4d_{\\mathrm{loc}}=4 and dtype=28subscript𝑑type28d_{\\mathrm{type}}=28, so d(0)=32superscript𝑑032d^{(0)}=32. After each message passing iteration, is d(i)=64superscript𝑑𝑖64d^{(i)}=64, i∈{1,2,3}𝑖123i\\in\\{1,2,3\\}. The global features 𝒈Csubscript𝒈𝐶\\bm{g}_{C} and 𝒈Vsubscript𝒈𝑉\\bm{g}_{V} both have dimension dpool=1subscript𝑑pool1d_{\\mathrm{pool}}=1. The post-processing MLP has two hidden layers with size   , respectively. With these specifications, the IMP model contains 7.5×1047.5superscript1047.5\\times 10^{4} real-valued trainable coefficients. The CRC generator polynomial remains constant during training and evaluation. For the reward generation, Pe​(ℐN,t,N,m,L,γ)subscript𝑃𝑒subscriptℐ𝑁𝑡𝑁𝑚𝐿𝛾P_{e}\\left(\\mathcal{I}_{N,t},N,m,L,\\gamma\\right) and Pe​(ℐN,t+1,N,m,L,γ)subscript𝑃𝑒subscriptℐ𝑁𝑡1𝑁𝑚𝐿𝛾P_{e}\\left(\\mathcal{I}_{N,{t+1}},N,m,L,\\gamma\\right) in (18) are estimated at each step t𝑡t by a Monte-Carlo simulation with at most 100100100 observed frame errors and at most 105superscript10510^{5} frames in total. The DQL algorithm with a replay buffer of size 104superscript10410^{4} and a target Q-value network  that updates every 222 episodes is used. During training, the exploration rate is initialized as 0.50.50.5, and exponentially decayed to 15​N15𝑁\\frac{1}{5N} with 0.9990.9990.999 decay rate. The discount factor β𝛽\\beta is initialized as 0.80.80.8, which increases linearly to 111 in 202020 episodes and remains at 111 afterwards. The IMP models are trained for Ttrain=105subscript𝑇trainsuperscript105T_{\\mathrm{train}}=10^{5} episodes on N=64𝑁64N=64 cases, and Ttrain=5×105subscript𝑇train5superscript105T_{\\mathrm{train}}=5\\times 10^{5} episodes on N=128𝑁128N=128 cases, respectively, before fine-tuning. The number of additional episodes for fine-tuning the IMP model is Ttune=100subscript𝑇tune100T_{\\mathrm{tune}}=100. The remainder of this section evaluates the IMP algorithm in three aspects: Section V-A shows that IMP-based polar codes outperform the state-of-the-art constructions in many cases when the IMP model is fine-tuned for the evaluation case; Section V-B verifies the generalization capability of a trained IMP model to different design SNRs and list sizes; and Section V-C illustrates that a trained IMP model directly applies to polar-code construction tasks with different rates and blocklengths, and yet still provides good polar codes.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: IMP performance evaluation compares its resultant polar codes’ FER under CA-SCL decoding to polar codes given by 5G NR standard , Tal-Vardy’s algorithm , the  genetic algorithm (GenAlg) [ref]35, the nested polar-code construction method [ref]37, and the tabular RL algorithm [ref]38 for the AWGN channel with BPSK modulation.
