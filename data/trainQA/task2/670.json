      "content": "Paper Title: Combining Deep Reinforcement Learning and Search for Imperfect-Information Games\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAt a high level, ReBeL resembles past RL+Search algorithms used in perfect-information games  [ref]56 [ref]1  [ref]50. These algorithms train a value network through self play. During training, a search algorithm is used in which the values of leaf nodes are determined via the value function. Additionally, a policy network may be used to guide search. These forms of RL+Search have been critical to achieving superhuman performance in benchmark perfect-information games. For example, so far no AI agent has achieved superhuman performance in Go without using search at both training and test time. However, these RL+Search algorithms are not theoretically sound in imperfect-information games and have not been shown to be successful in such settings. A critical element of our imperfect-information RL+Search framework is to use an expanded notion of “state”, which we refer to as a public belief state (PBS). PBSs are defined by a common-knowledge belief distribution over states, determined by the public observations shared by all agents and the policies of all agents. PBSs can be viewed as a multi-agent generalization of belief states used in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) . The concept of PBSs originated in work on decentralized multi-agent POMDPs    and has been widely used since then in imperfect-information games more broadly    . ReBeL builds upon the idea of using a PBS value function during search, which was previously used in the poker AI DeepStack . However, DeepStack’s value function was trained not through self-play RL, but rather by generating random PBSs, including random probability distributions, and estimating their values using search. This would be like learning a value function for Go by randomly placing stones on the board.\nThis is not an efficient way of learning a value function because the vast majority of randomly generated situations would not be relevant in actual play. DeepStack coped with this by using handcrafted features to reduce the dimensionality of the public belief state space, by sampling PBSs from a distribution based on expert domain knowledge, and by using domain-specific abstractions to circumvent the need for a value network when close to the end of the game. An alternative approach for depth-limited search in imperfect-information games that does not use a value function for PBSs was used in the Pluribus poker AI to defeat elite humans in multiplayer poker  . This approach trains a population of “blueprint” policies without using search. At test time, the approach conducts depth-limited search by allowing each agent to choose a blueprint policy from the population at leaf nodes. The value of the leaf node is the expected value of each agent playing their chosen blueprint policy against all the other agents’ choice for the rest of the game.\nWhile this approach has been successful in poker, it does not use search during training and therefore requires strong blueprint policies to be computed without search. Also, the computational cost of the search algorithm grows linearly with the number of blueprint policies.\n\nReference markers found: [56]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]56: At a high level, ReBeL resembles past RL+Search algorithms used in perfect-information games  [ref]56 [ref]1  [ref]50.
