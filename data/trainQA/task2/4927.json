      "content": "Paper Title: Holistic Interaction Transformer Network for Action Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPerson and Object Detector: We extract keyframes from each video in the dataset and use detected person bounding boxes from  for inference. As object detector, we employ Faster-RCNN  with ResNet-50-FPN [ref]21  backbone. The model is pretrained on ImageNet , and fine-tuned on MSCOCO [ref]22. Keypoints Detection and Processing: For keypoints detection, we adopt a pose model from Detectron ¬†[ref]9. The authors use a Resnet-50-FPN backbone pretrained on ImageNet for object detection and fine-tuned on MSCOCO keypoints using precomputed RPN  proposals. Each keyframe from the target dataset is passed through the model, which outputs 17 keypoints for each detected person, corresponding to the COCO format. We further post-process the detected pose coordinates, so they match the groundtruth person bounding boxes (during training) and the bounding boxes from  (during testing). For person hands location, we are only interested in the keypoints referring to the person‚Äôs wrists; therefore, we make a bounding box out of these two keypoints to highlight the person‚Äôs hands and everything in between. Backbone: We employ SlowFast networks  as our video backbone. Our experiments and ablation study use SlowFast with a ResNet-50 instantiation pretrained on Kinetics-700 . For AVA and MultiSports, we use the more powerful SlowFast-Resnet-101 pretrained on K700. Training and Evaluation: The input videos are sampled 32 frames per clip, with Œ±=4ùõº4\\alpha=4 and œÑ=1ùúè1\\tau=1, meaning the SlowFast backbone has a temporal stride of 4 for the slow path while the fast path takes the entire 32 frames as input. During training, random jitter augmentation is applied to the ground-truth human bounding boxes. For object boxes, we use the ones with detection score ‚â•0.25absent0.25\\geq 0.25 and whose I‚Äão‚ÄãUùêºùëúùëàIoU with any person bounding box in the same frame is positive. This is to ensure that only the objects with relatively high confidence scores and those with which humans directly interact are included in our sample. The network is trained on the J-HMDB dataset for 7K iterations, with the first 700 iterations serving as linear warm-up. No weight decay was used. We use SGD as optimizer and a batch size of 8 to train the model on one 11GB GPU. We train on the UCF101-24 dataset for 50k iterations, adopting linear warm-up during the first 1k iterations. The starting learning rate of 0.0002 is reduced by a factor of 10 at iterations 25k and 35k. During inference, we predict action labels for human bounding boxes provided by  for both datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: and Object Detector: We extract keyframes from each video in the dataset and use detected person bounding boxes from  for inference. As object detector, we employ Faster-RCNN  with ResNet-50-FPN [ref]21  backbone. The model is pretrained on ImageNet , and fine-tuned on MSCOCO [ref]22.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
