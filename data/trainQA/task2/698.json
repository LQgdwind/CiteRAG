      "content": "Paper Title: Fluid Composition of Intermittent IoT Energy Services\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe describe a scenario where a number of people gather in different places, i.e., confined areas (e.g., coffee shops, restaurants, movie theatres) within the downtown of any major city (see Figure 1).\nWe assume that city dwellers will use their wearables to harvest energy . Note that existing wearable technology allows for the harvesting of several microwatts to a few watts [ref]8 . Users wearing a harvester on each leg can generate enough power to charge up to four smartphones by walking for one hour at a comfortable pace e.g., PowerWalk333https://www.bionic-power.com/. This provides an opportunity for IoT devices to share spare energy wirelessly with nearby devices. The distance between IoT devices exchanging energy may reach five meters to ensure a successful wireless transmission . The IoT devices and wearables are assumed to be equipped with wireless energy transmitters and receivers using products such as Energous and Wi-Charge. We will use the following scenario: An IoT user in a food court needs to recharge their smartphone to be able to run some important applications, e.g., make a call or use email. The IoT user launches the following request: User xùë•x requires an amount of energy Eùê∏E in the location LùêøL during the period [s‚Äãt,e‚Äãt]ùë†ùë°ùëíùë°[st~{},~{}et]. All energy requests are processed by a centralized edge-based IoT coordinator, i.e., a router in a confined area (see Fig. 1). Multiple IoT energy service providers are advertising their energy services in the food court at the same time. The advertisement presents information about the provided service, e.g., the service location, start time and end time, the provided energy amount. Note that, the wireless energy transfer can be performed only in a predefined range between the providing and the consuming IoT devices . A neighboring energy service may drop out temporarily at any moment due to the mobility of device owners, e.g., an IoT user may go out to have a phone call and come back (see Figure 2 (a)). Therefore, the intermittent mobility of IoT devices affects the validity of any composition of available IoT energy services as the delivery of the expected amount of energy may not be guaranteed. The component services may not provide the exact advertised energy amount because of their disconnections. Typically, people develop certain routines in confined areas . They tend to define a set of preferences inside a specific confined place. For example, a user may select a preferred seat in the food court. They would sit and chat for a while. The user then would go to order food, they would wait in the line, order, and come back to their seat. The user goes back to receive the order. Finally, they leave the food court after finishing the food. The place preferences and habits build a mobility pattern for IoT users in confined areas. Capturing the mobility of energy providers permits us to estimate the real availability of crowdsourced energy services. Several prediction models are proposed to capture the indoor mobility patterns of the crowds . Estimating the availability of intermittent services within the range of the consumer allows the selection of a high-accurate composition of crowdsourced energy services in a dynamic environment. The effective availability of intermittent services is affected by the frequency and the length of the temporary disconnections (see Figure 2 (b). The reactive composition which considers all the disconnections and switches at every disconnected service to a new one provides a high-accurate solution. However, the reactive composition lacks runtime efficiency  in the highly dynamic crowdsourced environment. The reactive composition is also costly in terms of time and energy for every new connection establishment . An edge-based IoT coordinator requires a lightweight composition framework to deal with dynamic IoT energy services. We formulate our composition problem as ‚Äùfinding the optimal composition that solves the trade-off between effectiveness and runtime efficiency.‚Äù\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: city (see Figure 1).\nWe assume that city dwellers will use their wearables to harvest energy .
