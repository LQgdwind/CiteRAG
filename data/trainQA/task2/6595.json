      "content": "Paper Title: Influential Simplices Mining via Simplicial Convolutional Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGRAPHS have been widely studied in network science for providing a flexible, intuitive, and powerful way to represent and analyze complex systems, leading to fruitful applications across diverse domains, including sociology, biology, and technology.\nNevertheless, pairwise graph structures inherently fail to model higher-order interactions that are prevalent in empirical networks . Moreover, the functionality of many networked systems is influenced or determined by higher-order interactions as shown in many recent studies, which transpire not merely between pairs of nodes but also involve larger assemblies of nodes simultaneously .\nExamples of such higher-order group dynamics include recommendations from multiple friends in social networks , group hunting behaviors in ecological competitive networks , and coordinated neuronal activity during information transmission in brain networks [ref]4.\nConsequently, the study of higher-order group dynamics in complex systems has gained increasing attention in recent years [ref]5 . Simplicial complexes (SCs), which are derived from algebraic topology, serve as a potent tool for studying the higher-order interactions .\nIdentifying vital simplices is conducive to influencing and controlling the dynamic behavior of complex systems.\nSpecifically, as infection of vital simplices can lead to more individuals being infected in epidemic contagion , removal of vital simplices can cause the entire network to disintegrate more quickly in network dismantling .\nGenerally, by discovering vital simplices, researchers can identify the central structures that are critical for the overall network’s functioning, robustness, and stability. However, it remains elusive how to characterize simplices influence and identify vital simplices of order hℎh (termed hℎh-simplices), despite the relative maturity of research on vital nodes (0-simplices) identification.\nGeneralized degree 0 is used to measure the importance of simplices, which is a direct extension of degree in pairwise networks.\nIn addition to this, few metrics can be used to directly characterize the influence of simplices.\nAn indirect and trivial way to quantify simplices’ influence involves using average node-level metrics, such as defining the degree of a triangle as the average of its three nodes’ degrees.\nSpecifically, there are generally three categories of methods mainly employed to identify vital nodes: neighborhood-based centralities, path-based centralities, and iterative refinement centralities 1. Notably, we find significant differences between identifying vital simplices and individual nodes.\nThe influence exerted by a collective entity can at times surpass the cumulative impact of its individual constituents, while at other times it can be comparatively weaker.\nThis phenomenon is exemplified by familiar adages like \"Two heads are better than one\" and \"Many hands make light work,\" which highlight the potential synergy and enhanced performance achieved through collective efforts. Conversely, the proverbial warning \"Too many cooks spoil the broth\" draws attention to situations in which collective action may be weaker or less effective compared to individual actions.\nThis phenomenon can be observed in various empirical contexts. For example, specific drug combinations can achieve optimal therapeutic effects; the cooperation of renowned actors can produce unsuccessful movies, while lesser-known actors’ co-appearances might create popular films; different basketball player combinations have a significant impact on net points scored; a unanimous consent agreement may not be reached even if the key members are persuaded. It is worth noting that the notion of influential simplices or nodes can vary depending on the specific context, such as the need to identify simplices that can best protect the population in an epidemic or those whose damage would result in the most extensive cascading failures 2.\nThus, finding a universal index that accurately quantifies the importance of simplices across all scenarios is not feasible, and there is a need for more flexible and efficient approaches that can adapt to diverse contexts based on the given objectives.\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a promising solution by providing adaptability and the ability to learn task-specific embeddings. GNNs have received fruitful achievements in recent years across various graph learning tasks, including vital node identification and influence maximization 3 4.\nThe strength of GNNs stems from their ability to capture both node features and graph topology information simultaneously.\nZhao et al. 3 initially propose the infGCN model, which addresses influence maximization problems as classification tasks and employs GCN 5 to resolve this task.\nKumar et al. 4 introduce SGNN for vital node identification tasks by incorporating node features discovered by struc2vec into GNNs.\nGNNs can tailor the learning of different embeddings according to the specific objectives at hand. This adaptability enables GNNs to effectively address diverse contexts.\nIn general, GNNs’ ability to capture both node features and graph topology information, coupled with their flexibility in learning task-specific embeddings, make them valuable tools for identifying influential simplices or nodes in various scenarios. Nonetheless, the intrinsic limitations of GNNs hinder their applicability to vital simplices identification problems.\nSpecifically, traditional GNNs only consider pairwise node attributes, neglecting the higher-order interactions within the network, which renders them inadequate for learning and modeling the complex mechanisms underlying the network.\nMoreover, GNNs are incapable of directly learning embeddings for simplices, and acquiring such embeddings through readout operations often results in information loss.\nAdditionally, GNNs need K𝐾K message-passing operations for a node to receive information from nodes located K𝐾K hops away due to the coupling between input and computational graphs 5. Apart from the ensuing computational cost, deep GNNs often exhibit issues such as over-smoothing and over-squeezing of node representations.\nConsequently, GNNs are prone to learn the local properties while missing long-range information. In this paper, we present novel higher-order presentations: hierarchical bipartite graphs and higher-order hierarchical (HoH) Laplacians, where targeted simplices are grouped into a hub layer and can interact with other simplices.\nSubsequently, we propose a higher-order convolutional network, named ISMnet, to identify vital hℎh-simplices, which incorporates real simplex influence scores derived from samples or propagation simulations.\nISMnet employs learnable graph convolutional operators within each HoH Laplacian domain to capture higher-order interactions among simplices.\nBy modifying the hub layer, ISMnet can identify influential simplices of varying orders, enabling adaptability to different objectives and direct learning of task-specific embeddings for hub simplices.\nEmpirical results demonstrate that ISMnet significantly outperforms existing methods in ranking both 0-simplices (nodes) and 222-simplices, highlighting its effectiveness in identifying influential simplices in SCs. Our main contributions are four-fold as follows:\n An inconsistency is detected between mining influential nodes and mining influential simplices, highlighting the need for specialized methods for the latter task. The task of identifying influential simplices in the simplicial complex is formulated as a graph representation learning problem for the first time. We introduce an influential simplices mining neural network (ISMnet) model, which can adaptively adapt to different objectives and can capture both long-range interactions and higher-order effects. Extensive experiments on synthetic and empirical networks reveal the proposed method’s commendable performance in influential simplices mining issues. In general, this novel framework excels in identifying influential simplices and promises to serve as a potent tool in higher-order network analysis.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: from multiple friends in social networks , group hunting behaviors in ecological competitive networks , and coordinated neuronal activity during information transmission in brain networks [ref]4.\nConsequently, the study of higher-order group dynamics in complex systems has gained increasing attention in recent years [ref]5 .
