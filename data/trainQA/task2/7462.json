In the typical model of mechanism design, the valuation distribution is common knowledge,\nand\nif samples are available from this distribution, it is natural to formulate the mechanism design problem as a machine learning problem; indeed, a number of works have considered the learning-theoretic properties of various classes of mechanisms   . More recently, Dütting et al.  introduce differentiable economics: the use of rich, flexible function approximators, trained via stochastic gradient descent, for strategyproof auction design. One of their architectures, RegretNet, works for multi-bidder auctions, with strategyproofness constraints approximately enforced via a penalty term. Another architecture, RochetNet, is always strategyproof but only well-defined for single-bidder auctions.\nThis single bidder fits with the present setting, where we seek the optimal design\ngiven knowledge of a distribution on the possible types of a\nsingle trader who will interact\nwith the market maker, and we make use of the RochetNet approach in the present paper.\nSeparately, Shen et al.  consider MenuNet, an architecture which takes a similar approach to RochetNet and is also limited to single-bidder settings, and to which they apply to a broader class of value models beyond additive and unit-demand.\nCurry et al.  present a direct generalization of these two approaches, appealing to affine maximizers to give an architecture that is always strategyproof and well defined for many-bidder auctions (although it may not always be able to represent the optimal mechanism).\nThere are followups improving on the architecture of RegretNet  [ref]39   and the Curry et al.  approach .\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: problem of optimal mechanism design has motivated the use of automated mechanism design: the use of computational techniques to search for high-performing mechanisms on specific problem instances [ref]9   [ref]45.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
