      "content": "Paper Title: Trust Your Robots! Predictive Uncertainty Estimation of Neural Networks with Sparse Gaussian Processes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany researchers explored the idea of robotic introspection [ref]2, i.e. robots that reason about ”when they don’t know” in order to avoid catastrophic failures. So far, many proposed methods used the robots’ past experiences of failures   , or detect the inconsistencies within the predictors  . These works provide strong evidence that introspection improves the reliability of the robots. Other methods are based on uncertainty estimation , where learning algorithms such as DNNs use probability theory to express their own reliability 7 8 9. Commonly, these works use a technique called MC-dropout . However, the intense computational burden in estimating uncertainty via sampling or ensembles  limits their applicability in real-time systems 1  . Several techniques without sampling or ensembles have been presented for run-time efficiency. These methods often use either Dirichlet distributions or functional Bayesian Neural Networks  [ref]24. Unfortunately, the applicability of Dirichlet distributions is limited to classification, while functional Bayesian Neural Networks face hurdles in scaling to large datasets without approximations [ref]24. We recommend the recent works of He et al. [ref]25 and Adlam et al. , who use NTK-based GPs for uncertainty estimation of DNNs and provide useful insights. However, we focus on a technique that can be readily deployed on a real-time system such as a MAV. Hence, we take a different path to ensembles of infinite width DNNs [ref]25 . We find uncertainty propagation techniques    to be practical as these methods are training-free, i.e. assume existing and already well-trained DNNs. In addition, our theoretic contribution (section 3.2) extends on how DNNs are related to GPs (pioneered by Neal 0 and others 1 0 2), where we derive a relationship between DNNs and MoE-GPs as opposed to a single GP. Theoretic insights that connect DNNs and sparse GPs may pave the way towards their application, as GPs alone do not scale to big data required by DNNs. Lastly, we extend previous works on MoE-GPs (section 3.3). MoE-GPs are efficient but suffer from non-smooth uncertainty estimates 3. Park and Apley 4 show an elegant solution called patchwork kriging. By augmenting data at the boundaries between GP experts, the experts are forced to produce similar predictions at their boundaries. Yet, as patchwork kriging is limited to low-dimensional inputs 4, we propose several techniques that extend it to higher dimensions, like images (assuming the NTK).\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Many researchers explored the idea of robotic introspection [ref]2, i.e. robots that reason about ”when they don’t know” in order to avoid catastrophic failures.
