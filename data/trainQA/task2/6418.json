      "content": "Paper Title: SPRINT: Scalable Policy Pre-Training via Language Instruction Relabeling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate our approach on two image-based environments (see Figure¬†4): ALFRED-RL, an RL benchmark we develop upon , and a real robot kitchen with a Jaco 2 robot arm. ALFRED-RL. Our goal is to compare different pre-training approaches on a diverse set of semantically meaningful, long-horizon tasks. Yet, existing multi-task RL environments typically evaluate only on short-horizon or semantically meaningless tasks¬† [ref]7. Thus, we introduce a new RL benchmark based on the ALFRED household task simulator¬†. While ALFRED abstracts away low-level agent control into discrete actions like ‚Äúpick up‚Äù or ‚Äúturn left,‚Äù its 100+ rich indoor scenes with many interactable objects allow to evaluate an agent‚Äôs capabilities for solving long-horizon household tasks from a rich task distribution. The original benchmark focuses on imitation learning, but we extend it to support training RL agents through a gym interface with egocentric RGB observations and an action space consisting of 12 discrete\naction choices and 82 interactable object types¬†. We create three evaluation task sets that test progressively more challenging axes of generalization: EVALINSTRUCT uses unseen human-generated instructions on familiar scenes, EVALLENGTH uses tasks that are longer than any observed in pre-training, testing ‚Äústitching‚Äù capabilities, and EVALSCENE uses tasks in unseen floorplans.\nFor more details about ALFRED-RL and evaluation set construction, see Appendix, Section¬†C-A2. Real-World Robot Kitchen Manipulation.\nTo evaluate pre-training approaches on end-to-end low-level robot control, we design a set of stylized kitchen manipulation tasks with a Kinova Jaco 2 robot arm. The policy‚Äôs inputs are RGB images from a wrist-mounted and a third-person camera and it produces continuous end-effector (3-dim) displacement actions and a discrete gripper open/stay/close action at a control frequency of 10Hz. We collect a dataset of 329 long-horizon trajectories via human teleoperation with the setup from , each consisting of multiple language-annotated sub-trajectories like ‚Äúpick up the apple fruit,‚Äù, ‚Äúplace the black bowl in the dish rack,‚Äù etc. For evaluation, we construct three long-horizon tasks, sequencing 2 to 8 ‚Äúprimitive skills‚Äù like the ones mentioned above, in environment configurations that are unseen in the pre-training data. We collect 25 demonstrations for each of the three tasks to evaluate offline fine-tuning performance of different pre-trained policies. Comparisons. We compare SPRINT¬†against common policy pre-training approaches, behavioral cloning and offline goal-conditioned RL: Language-conditioned BC (L-BC)¬†[ref]64 [ref]8: Behavior cloning (BC) conditioned on the individual language instructions; Episodic Transformers (ET)¬†: BC conditioned on sequences of language instructions ‚Äì ET is the best-performing end-to-end learned policy on the ALFRED leaderboard that does not use privileged domain knowledge like hand-engineered policies or voxel maps; Actionable Models (AM)¬†: Goal-conditioned offline RL with randomly sampled goal observations from the same training data as SPRINT.\nWe also evaluate SayCan¬†: Top-down LLM planning over pre-trained, language-conditioned policies. All methods use the same architectures, hyperparameters, and training data ùíüLsuperscriptùíüùêø\\mathcal{D}^{L} where possible.\nIn ALFRED-RL, all methods use the same transformer-based architecture inspired by ¬† , and on the real robot, they use an RNN architecture with ‚Äúaction chunking‚Äù¬† first proposed by .\nFor more implementation details, see appendix Section¬†B.\nAll results are means and standard deviations over 3 seeds.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: approaches on a diverse set of semantically meaningful, long-horizon tasks.
