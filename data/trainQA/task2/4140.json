      "content": "Paper Title: FETILDA: An Effective Framework For Fin-tuned Embeddings For Long Financial Text Documents\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnstructured data such as text is growing very fast in different domains.\nEspecially, textual data from financial documents has been found to be\nbeneficial in making predictions . Utilizing such large\nvolumes of textual data requires natural language processing (NLP) and\nmachine learning (ML) techniques. These techniques summarize the text as (a\nset of) numeric feature vectors, which are called representations or\nembeddings, and which can in turn serve as inputs to machine learning models\nto predict some target variables. The traditional approach for text-based learning is via the Term Frequency -\nInverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method , which can\nrepresent the document as a long numeric vector of TF-IDF scores for each\nword. However, TF-IDF does not attempt to directly extract the latent\nsemantic information within the text. The current progress in text\nrepresentations was initiated by word embedding methods, such as word2vec\n and GloVe , which\ncapture both the lexical and semantic information of a document to some\nextent. The main idea is to learn word representations based on the context\nof each word. However, these methods learn only a single, static\nrepresentation for each word, and do not take into consideration the\nphenomenon of polysemy, where a word can change its meaning depending on the\ncontext (for example, the the word ‘bank’ in the financial context has a\nvery different meaning compared to the ‘bank’ of a river). The\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-trained language models, such as GPT\n[ref]5 and BERT [ref]6 are built on top of the very effective\nTransformer-based attention model , which can\nlearn contextual word embeddings. These embeddings are dynamic\nin terms of the surrounding block or context of the word, so that\nthe same word can get different representations that are most effective in\ncapturing the lexical and semantic information. These models have shown SOTA\nperformance on a variety of downstream tasks such as question answering,\ntext classification, and regression. While much progress has been made in NLP, our focus in this paper is on the\nrelatively under-examined area of financial text documents. Specifically, we\nare focusing on the 10-K financial reports that companies in the US submit\nannually to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These reports\ndescribe a company’s activities, progress, and risks in the interest of the\ncompany’s stakeholders. The detailed content of these reports is helpful in\nevaluating the status of the company as well as predicting future metrics\nfrom forward-looking statements. One of the key parts of 10-K reports is\nItem 7, namely, the Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MDA) section.\nAnother key part is Iten 1A, namely, the Risk Factors section. Textual data\ncontained in these 10-K reports are predictive of the volatilities that\ncompanies have in the stock market, and can be helpful in predicting\nfailures of financial institutions, as well\n . But, in these approaches, they use\nan expert-generated sentiment dictionary by Loughran and McDonald (L&M)\n to generate the vector of features. For\nexample, Kogan et al. 0 utilized the MDA section to\npredict the return volatility of stocks using the L&M word list. In\naddition, the L&M word list was expanded using word2vec\n. Then, it was used in Tsai and Wang\n1. As mentioned above, moving beyond the static embedding methods, it is\nimportant that we take into consideration the contextual information of\nwords, since specific words can have different meanings in the financial\ncontext than those in the general context, the nuances of which may not be\napparent to laypersons. For this, we can utilize the recent contextual\nlanguage models to represent long documents, such as the 10-K reports, in\norder to construct effective models for conducting predictive analyses.\nHowever, extracting “good” representations for such long documents remains\na challenging task: the length of the 10-K documents poses both a\nmethodological and ontological burden. Methodologically, financial reports\nare significantly longer, compared to the maximum length of a textual\nsequence that BERT [ref]6-based models can handle. For instance, the\nManagement Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section of the 10-K reports that\ncompanies publish annually is usually around 12,000 word-tokens. BERT-based\nmodels have a restriction on the maximum number of tokens, around 512, with\nsome newer models, such as Longformer 2 and BigBird\n3, reaching up to 4,096 tokens. Ontologically, the challenge is\nthe classic machine learning task of extracting or learning informative\nfeatures that can represent the input well. This question becomes quite\ncomplex in the context of representing a long document. Contextual word\nembeddings are well suited for this given their ability to “understand”\ndifferent meanings for a word in different contexts. However, it remains an\nopen question as to how to combine the various contextual word embeddings\ninto an effective document level embedding. An additional challenge is that the SOTA language models are pre-trained on\nmassive and generic corpuses, e.g., from web crawls, wiki media, and so on.\nHowever, to be effective for the financial context, it is important for LMs\nto learn domain-adapted and task-specific representations of long documents\nin order to meaningfully support predictive analyses. This can usually be\nachieved either by pre-training (from scratch) a domain-specific language\nmodel on a huge financial corpus to adapt to its particular domain, or by\nfine-tuning a pre-trained LM on a specific financial dataset for the\ndownstream tasks, or by combining the two approaches of adapting the LM to a\nparticular financial domain followed by fine-tuning on downstream tasks.\nRecently there have been several attempts at pre-training BERT on large\nfinancial corpuses to adapt it for tasks in the financial domain. Liu et\nal.4, Yang et al. 5, Araci 6, and DeSola et\nal.7, each pre-trained the BERT model from scratch on\nfinancial corpora, such as financial news, corporate reports, financial\nwebsites, and so on. Incidentally, all four approaches are called FinBERT! To address the long document representation challenge within the context of\nfinancial disclosure documents, we propose a novel framework called\nFin-tuned Embeddings of Texts In Long Document Analysis (FETILDA).\nOur approach is particularly designed for downstream predictive or\nregression tasks, where the input document representations are combined with\nother numeric attributes (if available) to predict a target response\nvariable of interest, such as key performance indicators (e.g., return on\nassets, earnings per share), stock volatility, and so on. FETILDA comprises\na novel chunk-based deep learning framework, where a long document is split\ninto several smaller chunks and then each chunk is processed using an\nappropriate language model (e.g., BERT [ref]6, FinBERT 5 or\nLongformer 2). The layers of the LM can remain frozen, or\nthey may be unfrozen for fine-tuning, or only the last layer can be frozen.\nThe chunk level representations are then pooled together using a Bi-LSTM\nmodel equipped with self-attention mechanism. The pooled chunks are then\naggregated into a document level representation, which serves as input for a\nfully connected linear neural network for target variable prediction. We can\nalso use the document representations as inputs to Support Vector and\nKernel regression models. We evaluate our framework using two different\ncorpuses: i) 10-K reports submitted annually to the SEC by US banks for the\nperiod from 2006 to 2016, ii) 10-K reports for all US companies from 1996 to\n2013 8. We have conducted extensive experiments using these\ndatasets and applied our framework to different predictive analysis\nregression tasks: i) predictive metrics of a bank’s financial performance,\nsuch as Return on Assets (ROA), Earnings Per Share (EPS), Return on Equity\n(ROE), Tobin’s Q Ratio (TQR), Leverage Ratio (LR), Tier 1 Capital Ratio\n(T1CR), Z-Score (Z) and Market to Book Ratio (MBR); ii) analysis of a\ncompany’s stock market volatility. Our results compared against the\ndifferent baseline methods show that FETILDA performs significantly better\nand yields SOTA results for long financial text regression tasks. In\nsummary, our main contributions are: We propose a SOTA deep learning framework for long document regression\ntasks in the financial domain. Our FETILDA approach is designed to learn\neffective document level representations via a sequential chunking\napproach combined with an attention mechanism. As such our approach\ncombines the best of both the attention-based Transformer model and\nBi-LSTM recurrent networks. We conduct an extensive set of experiments to quantitatively showcase\nthe effectiveness of our FETILDA approach. We applied the model on two\ndifferent 10-K datasets, and on 9 different regression tasks. We show\nthat FETILDA outperforms several different baseline methods, and\nachieves state-of-the-art results on long financial documents.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: (for example, the the word ‘bank’ in the financial context has a\nvery different meaning compared to the ‘bank’ of a river).
