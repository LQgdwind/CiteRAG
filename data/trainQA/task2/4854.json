      "content": "Paper Title: Sustainable Online Reinforcement Learning for Auto-bidding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn addition, to avoid IBOO, one may consider training auto-bidding policies with traditional RL algorithms based on the data collected by some safe policies directly from the RAS. However, this approach will suffer from extrapolation errors that can seriously degrade the policy’s performance in RAS 1 . As shown in Fig. 2(c), the expected cumulative rewards of traditional RL method  training with a fixed data buffer are lower than those of traditional RL method training with RAS and VAS.\nThough we can leverage offline RL techniques 1  [ref]30 [ref]31 to mitigate this challenge,\nwe cannot guarantee that the collected data contains sufficient transitions from high-reward regions . This will strain the capacity of the offline RL algorithms to train near-optimal auto-bidding policies. Thus, extra data collections with different behavior policies (presumably better behavior policies) from the RAS are required. The policies trained by the offline RL methods cannot be directly used as behavior policies for data collections in the RAS, since\nthe performance variance of the trained policies can be large .\nOff policy evaluations (OPEs) have been recently studied for selecting policies with good performance without applying them to real-world environments  . However, existing OPEs in auto-bidding are usually conducted in the VAS and can be inaccurate (see the last paragraph in this section).\nTherefore, we may still have little confidence to widely apply the policies trained by offline RL methods to advertisers for further online explorations in the RAS, even though they are proven to perform well by OPE.\nNote that there exist some safe online RL methods for safely exploring in the environments      .\nHowever, they are either developed based on the constraints that are not suitable for the auto-bidding problem or designed for systems with specific assumptions.\nRecently, with the development of offline RL methods, many algorithms for efficient online explorations on the premise of having an offline dataset   have emerged. However, they often focus on the efficiency of RL training process rather than the safety of explorations. Safe Online RL.\n realize safe explorations by adding a safety layer at the end of the actor network. However, the safety layer needs to be trained by a prior dataset and can be inaccurate at states outside the dataset.  uses offline safety tests to examine the safety of the latest policy and directly applies it to explore online if it passes the tests. However, as we stated in Appendix G.2, there is no such reliable offline safety tests in auto-bidding. Besides,  realizes safe explorations by gradually increasing the attraction regions of the initial safe policy. However, it leverages the assumption that the environment is a linear model, which is not suitable for auto-bidding. As for this paper, based on the proved Lipschitz property of Q functions, we design the exploration policy by offsetting the actions to the promising directions relative to an initial safe policy. Extrapolation Error.\nExtrapolation error means the misestimation of the states and actions outside the fixed dataset. A typical misestimation happens to the Q function in the standard RL algorithm. The fixed dataset cannot contain all the data from the environment, since the amount of all the data can usually be infinite. Hence, the trained Q function can only be accurate at the states and actions inside the dataset and can be inaccurate (usually overestimated) at those outside the dataset. This will make the actor network learn actions that extremely deviate from the behavioral actions and often bias towards bad actions. Hence, the policy performance can be seriously degraded.\nOffline RL algorithms usually address this challenge in three ways, including policy constraint methods,\nwhere explicit or implicit constraints are directly imposed to policies,\nsuch as BCQ 1, BEAR [ref]30, and conservative regularization methods,\nwhere penalties for out-of-distribution (OOD) actions are imposed to the Q function,\nsuch as CQL , BRAC , as well as modifications of imitation learning method  such as ABM [ref]31, CRR , BAIL. OPE in Auto-bidding.\nGenerally, the OPE used in auto-bidding is evaluate the auto-bidding policies in a VAS which is built based on the historical data of hundreds of advertisers. In the VAS, as we can know all the impression opportunities as well as their values and market prices in advance, we can calculate the optimal bids using linear programming . Hence, the optimal accumulated rewards can be obtained. We define the ratio between the accumulated reward of the evaluated policy and the optimal accumulated rewards as R/R∗𝑅superscript𝑅R/R^{*}, which acts an important metric in the OPE of auto-bidding. The range of R/R∗𝑅superscript𝑅R/R^{*} is   . The closer the value of R/R∗𝑅superscript𝑅R/R^{*} to 1, the better the performance of the evaluated auto-bidding policy. However, due to the IBOO, this common OPE method is not very accurate. Specifically, a low value of R/R∗𝑅superscript𝑅R/R^{*} (below 0.70.70.7) can indicate a poor performance of the evaluated auto-bidding policy, while a large value of R/R∗𝑅superscript𝑅R/R^{*} (above 0.80.80.8) does not indicate that the evaluated auto-bidding can certainly perform well in the RAS. Nonetheless, auto-bidding policies with higher R/R∗𝑅superscript𝑅R/R^{*} are more likely to perform well in the RAS than those with lower R/R∗𝑅superscript𝑅R/R^{*}.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: rewards of traditional RL method  training with a fixed data buffer are lower than those of traditional RL method training with RAS and VAS.\nThough we can leverage offline RL techniques 1  [ref]30 [ref]31 to mitigate this challenge,\nwe cannot guarantee that the collected data contains sufficient transitions from high-reward regions . This will strain the capacity of the offline RL\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
