      "content": "Paper Title: Personal Privacy Protection via Irrelevant Faces Tracking and Pixelation in Video Live Streaming\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo our best knowledge, face pixelation in video live streaming is not studied before. Referring to existing techniques, we first tried to implement FPVLS in an end-to-end manner by replacing the 2D deep CNN with its extension 3D CNN [ref]16. Taking an entire video as input, 3D CNN handles spatial-temporal information simultaneously and achieves great success in video segmentation   and action recognition areas [ref]16 . However, tested on the live streaming dataset we collected, 3D CNN models are quite time-consuming and extremely sensitive to video quality and length. Furthermore, without sufficient training data, as designed to cope with high-level abstractions of video contents, 3D CNN cannot precisely handle the pixelation task on the individual frame-level. Therefore, the face mosaics generated by the 3D CNN model constantly blinking during streaming. The other proper way for realization is the multi-object tracking (MOT) or multi-face tracking (MFT) algorithms we discussed in the Introduction. Current offline pixelation methods, including YouTube Studio and Microsoft Azure, are mainly implemented on MFT. Although MOT and MFT are claimed to be thoroughly studied , their tracking accuracy is still challenging in unconstrained videos. Reviewing state-of-the-art trackers, we find two main categories: offline and online trackers. The former category assumes the object detection in all frames has already been conducted, and clean tracklets are established by linking different detection in offline mode . This property of offline trackers allows global optimization for the path  but makes them incapable of dealing with online tasks. State-of-the-art online MOT algorithms [ref]10 [ref]9    combine continuous motion prediction, online learning, and the correlation filter to find an operator that gradually updates the tracker at each timestamp. KCF [ref]10 and ECO [ref]9 are the representatives of this kind. Within the same shot, these trackers assume a predictable position for targets in the adjacent frames. Although this assumption is generally applicable in conventional videos, it does not hold in video live streaming due to the frequent camera shakes. Tests of such tracking algorithms are always established on high-resolution music video datasets in the absence of massive camera moves and motion blur . Moreover, MOT sometimes encounters the size issue when directly applied to the face tracking field. The faces’ size may be so small (12*12 pixels) that the online-learned operator is not robust enough to progressively locate the time-invariant feature of the face. Therefore, the correlation filter based MOT algorithms also suffer drastic drifting issues on the face pixelation tasks. State-of-the-art MFT algorithms adopt the tracking-by-detection structure    . IOU tracker  and POI tracker  are the outstanding ones. IOU tracker applies detection networks on the current frame. The bounding boxes with the most considerable IoU value will be assigned to the corresponding trajectory, referring to the tracking list. IOU tracker is agile in processing frames, but heavily relies on the detection results and does not consider the temporal connection between frames. Thereby, false positives and false negatives in detection are hard to be eliminated and cause instant drifting mosaics. POI tracker replaces the correlation filters with deep embedding networks. Online POI tracker applies detection networks in all frames and divides the tracking video into multiple disjoint segments. They then use the dense neighbors (DN) search to associate the detection responses into short tracklets in each segment. Several nearby segments are merged into a longer segment, and the DN search is applied again in each longer segment to associate existing tracklets into longer tracklets. To some degree, the POI tracker shares a cognate idea with our raw face trajectory generation stage in the video segment, detection, and embedding aspects. However, POI uses a DN search instead of clustering algorithms and do not further apply refinement. Therefore, the POI tracker will also be profoundly affected by inaccurate detection contains frequent false positives and negatives. Besides, widely accepted solutions of MOT and MFT   in unconstrained videos assume some priors, including the number of people showing up in the video, initial positions of the people, no fast motions, no camera movements, and high recording resolution. The state-of-the-art studies on MFT  manage to exclude as many priors as possible but still require the full-length video in advance for analysis.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: in video live streaming is not studied before.
