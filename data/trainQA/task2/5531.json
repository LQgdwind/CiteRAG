      "content": "Paper Title: Generation of Highlights from Research Papers Using Pointer-Generator Networks and SciBERT Embeddings\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently transformer architectures have significantly improved the performance of various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Inspired by the original transformer [ref]45,\nlanguage models such as ELMo [ref]46, BERT [ref]20, GPT family  and BART  have emerged and produced state-of-the-art performance on various tasks. However, they require enormous amounts of data and compute resources for pre-training. This large computation consumes a lot of energy and has a high carbon footprint. It has an adverse financial and environmental impact  . The expression to calculate carbon footprint C𝐶C (in gram carbon dioxide equivalent or gCO2e) as given in the equation 18 is taken from . We modified Equation 18 to Equation V-C: where t𝑡t is the running time (in hours), ncsubscript𝑛𝑐n_{c} is the number of cores, Pcsubscript𝑃𝑐P_{c} is the power draw of a computing core, ucsubscript𝑢𝑐u_{c} is the core usage factor (between 0 to 1), ng​p​usubscript𝑛𝑔𝑝𝑢n_{gpu} is the number of GPUs, Pg​p​usubscript𝑃𝑔𝑝𝑢P_{gpu} is the power drawn by the GPU, ug​p​usubscript𝑢𝑔𝑝𝑢u_{gpu} is the GPU usage factor (between 0 to 1), Pmsubscript𝑃𝑚P_{m} is the power draw of a memory unit (in watt). The power draw of memory is considered as 0.3725 W per GB  . We trained all the models on Tesla P100-PCIE Colab Pro+ that supports GPU.\nThe efficiency coefficient of the data center is known as PUE (power usage effectiveness). Google uses ML to reduce its global yearly average PUE to 1.10 . We use average worldwide value as carbon intensity (CI) of 475 gCO2e KW/hour.\nGross CO2 emission during training for T5 pre-trained model  was 46.7 tCOe2subscript𝑒2{}_{2}e , any transformerbigbig{}_{\\text{big}} model training required 192 lbsCOe2subscript𝑒2{}_{2}e  and BERT base model with GPU required 1438 lbsCO2e .\nWe measure memory and compute power consumption and emission of CO2 footprint using the WandB tool 101010https://wandb.ai/site. The quantitative results are shown in Table VIII. In our proposed model, we require SciBERT embeddings of the input documents as input. So as a pre-processing step before model training, we encode the documents with SciBERT: this is a one-time operation and not repeated in every epoch.\nTable VIII clearly shows that our proposed model (third column) has fewer trainable parameters, and lower computational overhead and smaller carbon footprint per epoch than those of the other models.\nWe have graphically compared the % of GPU utilization, % of CPU utilization, GPU Power usage, GPU memory allocated, memory used by process and required process CPU threads of the models over the training duration in Figure VIII.\nThe figure shows that GPU and CPU utilization, GPU power usage, and the process memory used by our proposed model are lower than those used in fine-tuning the large pre-trained summarization models. While our model consumes a large memory for a short time, the other models typically have a larger memory consumption that remains steady for a longer duration. Our model exploits more CPU threads than GPT-2 but fewer threads than other compared models. We believe that researchers should give attention to energy-friendly models and algorithms rather than only to performance metrics. In this context, our model is a better alternative to large pre-trained transformers. \n\n\n\n\n\nFactors\n\nSub-Factor\n\n\nPGM + Coverage + SciBERT\n\n\n\nProphetNet-large-uncased-cnndm\n\n\n\nGPT-2\n\n\n\nDistilbart-CNN-12-6\n\n\n\nT5-base\n\n\nTotal trainable parameters\n\n\n21.5M\n\n\n\n391M\n\n\n\n117M\n\n\n\n305M\n\n\n\n220M\n\n\n\n\nColab Notebook\n\nAvail.
