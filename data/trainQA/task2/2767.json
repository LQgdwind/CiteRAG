      "content": "Paper Title: Distribution Knowledge Embedding for Graph Pooling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMultivariate Gaussian distribution for describing samples has been applied to a large number of recognition tasks. However, it will not work well when the samples are relatively sparse, which means that it is not robust to high dimensional features with a small number of samples. The node samples are sparse in most of graph-level tasks, we thus introduce the robust variant of DKEPool to tackle this problem by considering the robust estimation of the covariance component [ref]21 [ref]22   in the high dimensional feature space. Wang et al. [ref]21 proposed a regularized maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) method based on von Neumann divergence [ref]28 for the robust estimation of covariance matrix (RE-COV). Then, Li et al. [ref]22 proposed a matrix power normalized covariance (MPN-COV) method to amount to RE-COV for end-to-end training. Due to the limited support of eigen-value decomposition and singular value decomposition on GPU, Li et al.  proposed a fast end-to-end training method based on Newton-Schulz iteration, called iterative matrix square root (iSQRT) normalization of covariance.\nFor the covariance matrix 𝚺𝚺\\bm{\\Sigma}, its robust estimation is represented as 𝚺^^𝚺\\hat{\\bm{\\Sigma}}. Initializing 𝒀0=𝚺subscript𝒀0𝚺\\bm{Y}_{0}=\\bm{\\Sigma} and 𝒁0=𝑰subscript𝒁0𝑰\\bm{Z}_{0}=\\bm{I}, and the Newton-Schulz iteration in iSQRT takes the following form: where 𝒀ksubscript𝒀𝑘\\bm{Y}_{k} is the resulting robust estimation of the covariance component after k𝑘k iterations, i.e. 𝚺^=𝒀k^𝚺subscript𝒀𝑘\\hat{\\bm{\\Sigma}}=\\bm{Y}_{k}. Note that the derivation of backward propagation in iSQRT222Interested readers please refer to   for details. is not straightforward, even though autograd toolkits provided by some deep learning frameworks can accomplish this task automatically, e.g., autograd of PyTorch. The partial derivatives of the loss function l𝑙l with respect to 𝒀ksubscript𝒀𝑘\\bm{Y}_{k} and 𝒁ksubscript𝒁𝑘\\bm{Z}_{k} are as follows: In this work, we adopt the iSQRT to improve our proposed framework due to its friendly performance on GPU  and its original version considered in the Gaussian setting [ref]21. The robust DKEPool can be represented as: the above equation Eq.(12) is the robust variant of our proposed DKEPool resulting from iSQRT. The difference between Eq.(6) and Eq.(12) only exists in the covariance component.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: The node samples are sparse in most of graph-level tasks, we thus introduce the robust variant of DKEPool to tackle this problem by considering the robust estimation of the covariance component [ref]21 [ref]22   in the high dimensional feature space.
