      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Inter- and Intraframe Representations for Non-Lambertian Photometric Stereo\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n∗ indicates that we use all 96 images to estimate the normal map of Bear. The result shown in SI-18 [ref]11 (Bear 4.1) was achieved by discarding the first 20 input images. In this subsection, we compared our proposed MT-PS-CNN model with a number of state-of-the-art photometric stereo solutions including IK-12[ref]47, IA-14, ST-14, HI-17, TM-18, CH-18, SI-18[ref]11, and JU-19[ref]32. The source codes or evaluation results of these methods are publicly available. Quantitative evaluation results using the DiLiGenT benchmark dataset are provided in Table 4. When the number of input\nimages is 96, our proposed MT-PS-CNN model achieved the lowest average MAE (7.56∘superscript7.567.56^{\\circ}) on 10 real-world objects of DiLiGenT. It is worth mentioning that such improvements are particularly obvious for objects with complex geometry (e.g., Buddha, Reading, and Harvest). Figs. 7 and 8 show some qualitative results on two real-world DiLiGenT and Light Stage Data Gallery datasets, respectively. Our proposed MT-PS-CNN model is capable of predicting a surface normal map with rich details. Moreover, it can generate more accurate surface normal estimation results in the highlighted regions with complex geometry compared with the state-of-the-art PS-FCN method (CH-18) . Table 5 shows the parameter number and running time of MT-PS-CNN and two representative deep learning-based photometric stereo approaches on a PC with GeForce GTX 1080Ti and 96 GB RAM. We repeat the estimation process 10 times and compute the average running time (the forward time of the network). For a fair comparison, different methods are applied for the normal estimation of the croped BallPNG in DiLiGenT, and the input number is 96. Following the setting in SI-18 [ref]11, we set the number of different rotations for the rotational pseudoinvariance to 1. Our proposed MT-PS-CNN model achieves the highest normal estimation accuracy using significantly fewer parameters and runs much faster. Thus, our model is more suitable for real-time implementation in memory-restricted devices. Another noticeable advantage of the proposed MT-PS-CNN is that it performs robustly when the number of input images significantly changes. In Table 6, we show the normal estimation results (the average MAE of 10 objects in the DiLiGenT dataset) of different deep-learning-based photometric stereo methods using 96, 16, 10, 8 and 6 input images. Note that JU-19[ref]32 is designed to decrease the demands on the number of images for the photometric stereo task by learning the most informative images under different illumination conditions; thus, it performs the best based on 6 and 8 input images. However, its performance is suboptimal when processing dense input images. In comparison, our proposed method performs consistently well based on images captured in both sparse and dense lighting distributions. As illustrated in Table 7, MT-PS-CNN performs significantly better than other alternatives for objects with complex geometry (e.g., Buddha, Reading, and Harvest), which represents a more challenging normal estimation task. We also validate the effectiveness of our proposed MT-PS-CNN model on images captured using our own photometric stereo data acquisition system. Fig. 9 shows the comparative performance of PS-FCN , CNN-PS [ref]11 and the proposed MT-PS-CNN. It is observed that the PS-FCN model utilizes intraframe information to effectively suppress interference of specular highlights. However, some important details (e.g., scratches on the steel surface) are adversely smoothed out, as shown in Fig. 9. In comparison, the CNN-PS model generates a normal map with rich textures/details, but its performance is significantly affected by specular highlights due to the lack of consideration of spatial information. Our proposed MT-PS-CNN model utilizes both inter- and intraframe information and thus can combine the advantages of the above two methods.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: ∗ indicates that we use all 96 images to estimate the normal map of Bear.
