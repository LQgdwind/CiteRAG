      "content": "Paper Title: Discrete Cycle-Consistency Based Unsupervised Deep Graph Matching\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate our framework in four settings. As a baseline, we build it on top of the supervised BBGM method . That is, we reuse its network and the respective QAP solver  within our unsupervised framework. We refer to the respective algorithm as CL-BBGM.\nUsing BBGM as a baseline allows us to compare our method directly to the competing SCGM method [ref]27 that uses BBGM as a backbone. Our second setting is a modification of CL-BBGM, referred to as CL-BBGM (SCGM), where we start with the weights learned in unsupervised fashion by SCGM [ref]27 with BBGM as a backbone.\nOur third setup is the network described in Section 5 paired with the state-of-the-art QAP solver . We term it as CLUM, which stands for Cycle-Loss-based Unsupervised Graph Matching. Our fourth algorithm, referred to as CLUM-L, is a variant of CLUM with a LAP solver in place of the QAP one. The edge costs generated by the network are ignored in this case. We compare our method to the so far only existing unsupervised methods GANN [ref]42 and SCGM [ref]27. As mentioned in Section 1, SCGM is not stand-alone and requires a supervised graph matching algorithm as a backbone. Following the original SCGM paper [ref]27, we show results with backbones BBGM and NGMv2. We also provide published results of several supervised methods for reference, see Table 1.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: QAP solver  within our unsupervised framework. We refer to the respective algorithm as CL-BBGM.\nUsing BBGM as a baseline allows us to compare our method directly to the competing SCGM method [ref]27 that uses BBGM as a backbone. Our second setting is a modification of CL-BBGM, referred to as CL-BBGM (SCGM), where we start with the weights learned in unsupervised fashion by SCGM [ref]27\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
