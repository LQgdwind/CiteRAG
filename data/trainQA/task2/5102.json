      "content": "Paper Title: Minimizing the Accumulated Trajectory Error to Improve Dataset Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nModern deep learning has achieved astounding successes in achieving ever better performances in a wide range of fields by exploiting large-scale real-world data and well-constructed Deep Neural Networks (DNN)   . Unfortunately, these achievements have come at a prohibitively high cost in terms of computation, particularly when it relates to the tasks of data storage, network training, hyperparameter tuning, and architectural search. A series of model distillation studies     has thus been proposed to condense the scale of models by distilling the knowledge from a large-scale teacher model into a compact student one. Recently, a similar but distinct task, dataset distillation 5 2  [ref]1 0 4 9  6 3 7 6 has been considered to condense the size of real-world datasets. This task aims to synthesize a large-scale real-world dataset into a tiny synthetic one, such that a model trained with the synthetic dataset is comparable to the one trained with the real dataset. Dataset distillation can expedite model training and reduce cost. It plays an important role in some machine learning tasks such as continual learning 0 8 9 9, neural architecture search 7  8 0 8, and privacy-preserving tasks 7  , etc. Wang et al. 5 was the first to formally study dataset distillation. The authors proposed a method DD that models a regular optimizer as the function that treats the synthetic dataset as the inputs, and uses an additional optimizer to update the synthetic dataset pixel-by-pixel. Although the performance of DD degrades significantly compared to training on the real dataset, 5 revealed a promising solution for condensing datasets. In contrast to conventional methods, they introduced an evaluation standard for synthetic datasets that uses the learned distilled set to train randomly initialized neural networks and the authors evaluate their performance on the real test set. Following that, Such et al. 1 employed a generative model to generate the synthetic dataset. Nguyen et al. 4 reformulated the inner regular optimization of DD into a kernel-ridge regression problem, which admits closed-form solution. In particular, Zhao and Bilen 0 pioneered a gradient-matching approach DC, which learns the synthetic dataset by minimizing the distance between two segments of gradients calculated from the real dataset 𝒯𝒯{\\mathcal{T}}, and the synthetic dataset 𝒮𝒮{\\mathcal{S}}. Instead of learning a synthetic dataset through a bi-level optimization as DD does, DC 0 optimizes the synthetic dataset explicitly and yields much better performance compared to DD. Along the lines of DC 0, more gradient-matching methods have been proposed to further enhance DC from the perspectives of data augmentation 8, feature alignment 4, and long-range trajectory matching [ref]1. However, these follow-up studies on gradient-matching methods fail to address a serious weakness that results from the discrepancy between training and testing phases.\nIn the training phase, the trajectory of the weights generated by 𝒮𝒮{\\mathcal{S}} is optimized to reproduce the trajectory of 𝒯𝒯{\\mathcal{T}} which commenced from a set of weights that were progressively updated by 𝒯𝒯{\\mathcal{T}}. However, in the testing phase, the weights are no longer initialized by the weights with respect to 𝒯𝒯{\\mathcal{T}}, but the weights that are continually updated by 𝒮𝒮{\\mathcal{S}} in previous iterations. The discrepancy of the starting points of the training and testing phases results in an error on the converged weights. Such inaccuracies will accumulate and have an adverse impact on the starting weight for subsequent iterations. As demonstrated in Figure 1, we observe the loss difference between the weights updated by 𝒮𝒮{\\mathcal{S}} and 𝒯𝒯{\\mathcal{T}}. We refer to the error as the accumulated trajectory error, because it grows as the optimization algorithm progresses along its iterations. The synthetic dataset 𝒮𝒮{\\mathcal{S}} optimized by the gradient-matching methods is able to generalize to various starting weights, but is not sufficiently robust to mitigate the perturbation caused by the accumulated trajectory error of the starting weights. To minimize this source of error, the most straightforward approach is to employ robust learning, which adds perturbations to the starting weights intentionally during training to make 𝒮𝒮{\\mathcal{S}} robust to errors. However, such a robust learning procedure will increase the amount of information of the real dataset to be distilled. Given a fixed size of 𝒮𝒮{\\mathcal{S}}, the distillation from the increased information results in convergence issues and will degrade the final performance. We demonstrate this via empirical studies in subsection 3.2. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to minimize the accumulated trajectory error that results in improved performance. Specifically, we regularize the training on the real dataset to a flat trajectory that is robust to the perturbation of the weights. Without increasing the information to be distilled in the real dataset, the synthetic dataset will enhance its robustness to the accumulated trajectory error at no cost. Thanks to the improved tolerance to the perturbation of the starting weights, the synthetic dataset is also able to ameliorate the accumulation of inaccuracies and improves the generalization during the testing phase. It can also be applied to cross-architecture scenarios. Our proposed method is compatible with the gradient-matching methods and boost their performances.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our solution minimizes the accumulated error and outperforms the vanilla trajectory matching method on various datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, subsets of the TinyImageNet, and ImageNet. For example, we achieve performance accuracies of 43.2% with only 101010 images per class and 50.7%percent50.750.7\\% with 505050 images per class on CIFAR-100, compared to the previous state-of-the-art work from [ref]1 (which yields accuracies of only 40.1% and 47.7% respectively). In particular, we significantly improve the performance on a subset of the ImageNet dataset which contains higher resolution images by more than 4%.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: proposed to condense the scale of models by distilling the knowledge from a large-scale teacher model into a compact student one.
