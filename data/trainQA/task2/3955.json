      "content": "Paper Title: Scalable & Efficient Training of Large Convolutional Neural Networks with Differential Privacy\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe straightforward yet highly inefficient way of per-sample gradient clipping is to use batch size 1 and compute gradients with respect to each individual loss. Recently, more advanced methods have significantly boosted the efficiency by avoiding such a naive approach. The most widely applied method is implemented in the Opacus library , which is fast but memory costly as per-sample gradients 𝒈i=∂ℒi∂𝐖subscript𝒈𝑖subscriptℒ𝑖𝐖\\bm{g}_{i}=\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}_{i}}{\\partial\\mathbf{W}} are instantiated to compute the weighted gradient ∑iCi⋅𝒈isubscript𝑖⋅subscript𝐶𝑖subscript𝒈𝑖\\sum_{i}C_{i}\\cdot\\bm{g}_{i} in (2.1). A more efficient method, FastGradClip [ref]32, is to use a second back-propagation with weighted loss ∑iCi⋅ℒisubscript𝑖⋅subscript𝐶𝑖subscriptℒ𝑖\\sum_{i}C_{i}\\cdot\\mathcal{L}_{i} to indirectly derive the weighted gradient. In all above-mentioned methods and The method in [ref]39 also extends the outer product trick (similar to Opacus, see (2.4)) in  to convolution layer, but does not use the ghost clipping trick., the per-sample gradients are instantiated, whereas this can be much inefficient and not necessary according to the ‘ghost clipping’ technique, as to be detailed in Section 3. In other words, ghost clipping proves that the claim ‘DP optimizers require access to the per-sample gradients’ is wrong. Note that ghost clipping is firstly proposed by  for linear layers, and then extended by  to sequential data and embedding layers for language models. However, the ghost clipping has not been extended to convolutional layers, due to the complication of the convolution operation and the high dimension of data (text data is mostly 2D, yet image data are 3D and videos are 4D). We give more details about the difference between this work and  in Appendix F. In fact, we will show that even the ghost clipping alone is not satisfactory for CNNs: e.g. it cannot fit even a single datapoint into the memory on VGGs and ImageNet dataset. Therefore, we propose the mixed ghost clipping, that narrows the efficiency gap between DP training and the regular training.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: are instantiated to compute the weighted gradient ∑iCi⋅𝒈isubscript𝑖⋅subscript𝐶𝑖subscript𝒈𝑖\\sum_{i}C_{i}\\cdot\\bm{g}_{i} in (2.1).
