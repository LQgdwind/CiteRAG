There are numerous research work aiming to develop novel methods for estimating performance of configurable software systems from a limited number of measurement data. Siegmund et al.  proposes to use linear regression combined with different sampling techniques to build a performance influence model for configurable software systems. Guo et al. [ref]51 suggests to use decision trees to model configurable software performance, and later it was extended to combine with various machine learning hyperparameter tuning technique to become more data-efficient . Zhang et al.  uses Fourier learning as the learning methodology whilst also providing a theoretical analysis on the accuracy of the proposed model. Recently, Ha et al.  proposes to use deep sparse neural network to model the configurable software system performance. Whilst these work can give good scalar predictions for the configurable software systems performance, their limitation is that they cannot provide the confidence intervals of these scalar predictions. In terms of generating the confidence intervals for configurable software performance, Dorn et al.  tackled this problem for the first time. The key idea is to use a Lasso regression model to model the relationship between the configuration options and the system performance. Bayesian inference is then performed via probabilistic programming to infer the posterior distribution of the model’s parameters, thus, infer the posterior distribution of the scalar prediction. Our work also aims to generate confidence intervals of configurable software performance, however, we use deep neural networks to model the configurable software performance. We also suggest a new technique for uncertainty calibration of the generated confidence intervals. We have compared the two methods in Section V. Our experimental results show that our method not only can generate better scalar predictions, but also the confidence intervals of these scalar predictions. The work in  investigates a new method of transferring knowledge among similar configurable software systems, thus helps to improve the accuracy of the prediction model whilst only requiring a minimal number of data. The work in  proposes a sequential model-based method to find the configuration with the highest/lowest performance value using the least number of measurement data. In [ref]53, a new sampling method is proposed to select the measurement data in a cost-efficient manner whilst still achieving high model prediction accuracy. The work in  devises a distance-based sampling strategy based on a distance metric and the configurations’ probability distribution across the configuration. More recently, there are new approaches aiming to construct the prediction models of configurable software systems in a white-box manner, that is, using some internal information of the software systems to aid with the performance prediction modeling process [ref]54 . Unlike the above work, we aim to build a prediction model that can provide both scalar predictions and their confidence intervals in a black-box manner.\n\nReference markers found: [51]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]51: measurement data.
