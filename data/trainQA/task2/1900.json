      "content": "Paper Title: Coresets for (𝑘,ℓ)-Median Clustering under the Fréchet Distance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAt the present time even efficient approximation algorithms are often incapable of handling massive data sets, which have become common. Here, we need efficient methods to reduce data while (approximately) maintaining the core properties of the data. A popular approach to this topic are ε𝜀\\varepsilon-coresets; see for example [ref]27  for comprehensive surveys. An ε𝜀\\varepsilon-coreset is a small (weighted) set that aggregates certain properties of a given (massive) data set up to some small error. ε𝜀\\varepsilon-coresets are very popular in the field of clustering, cf.     and they are becoming a topic in other fields, too, cf.  .\nThe technique for computing an ε𝜀\\varepsilon-coreset for a given data set highly depends on the application at hand, but mostly ε𝜀\\varepsilon-coresets are computed by filtering the given data set. While ε𝜀\\varepsilon-coresets can be computed efficiently for k𝑘k-clustering of points in the Euclidean space, less is known for clustering of curves. In particular, only little effort (cf. ) has been made in designing methods for computing ε𝜀\\varepsilon-coresets for (k,ℓ)𝑘ℓ(k,\\ell)-clustering of polygonal curves in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} under the Fréchet distance. This type of clustering, which has recently drawn increasing popularity due to a growing number of applications, see 2   [ref]6, is an adaption of the Euclidean k𝑘k-clustering: we are given a set of polygonal curves and seek to compute k𝑘k center curves that minimize either the maximum Fréchet distance (center objective), or the sum of Fréchet distances (median objective), among the given curves and their closest center curve. In addition, we restrict the complexity—the number of vertices—of each center curve to be at most ℓℓ\\ell to suppress overfitting, a problem specific for sequential data. This means that input curves and center curves are in general of different complexities, which is the reason why we need a specialized algorithm for computing ε𝜀\\varepsilon-coresets and can not apply ε𝜀\\varepsilon-coreset algorithms for discrete metric spaces (cf. ) on the input. The Fréchet distance is a natural dissimilarity measure for curves that is a pseudo-metric and can be computed efficiently . Unlike other measures for curves, like the dynamic time warping distance (or the discrete version of the Fréchet distance), it takes the whole course of the curves into account, not only the pairwise distances among their vertices. This can be particularly useful, e.g. when the input consists of irregularly sampled trajectories, cf. 2. Unfortunately, since the Fréchet distance is a bottleneck distance measure, i.e., it boils down to a single distance between two points on the curves, it is sensitive to outliers, which may negatively affect its applications. In clustering, we can counteract by choosing an appropriate clustering objective and indeed, the (k,ℓ)𝑘ℓ(k,\\ell)-median objective is a good choice, because the median is a robust measure of central tendency. However, the state of the art (k,ℓ)𝑘ℓ(k,\\ell)-median clustering algorithms (cf. 2 ) have exponential running time dependencies and cannot be used in practice, while the practical algorithms for (k,ℓ)𝑘ℓ(k,\\ell)-clustering (cf.  [ref]6) rely on the (k,ℓ)𝑘ℓ(k,\\ell)-center objective, which is not robust and therefore amplifies the sensitivity on outliers. In this work, we present an algorithm for computing ε𝜀\\varepsilon-coresets for (k,ℓ)𝑘ℓ(k,\\ell)-median clustering under the Fréchet distance and improve an (1,ℓ)1ℓ(1,\\ell)-median clustering algorithm by Buchin et al. , using ε𝜀\\varepsilon-coresets and rendering it much more practical.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: common.
