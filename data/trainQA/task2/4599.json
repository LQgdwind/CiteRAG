      "content": "Paper Title: On the existence of strong proof complexity generators\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe class of gadget generators was introduced in  and it is defined as follows.\nGiven any p-time function define a gadget generator based on f𝑓f where as follows: The input x¯∈{0,1}n¯𝑥superscript01𝑛\\overline{x}\\in{\\{0,1\\}^{n}} is interpreted as ℓ+2ℓ2\\ell+2 strings where v∈{0,1}ℓ𝑣superscript01ℓv\\in\\{0,1\\}^{\\ell} and ui∈{0,1}ksuperscript𝑢𝑖superscript01𝑘u^{i}\\in{\\{0,1\\}^{k}} for all i𝑖i. The output y¯=G​a​df​(x¯)¯𝑦𝐺𝑎subscript𝑑𝑓¯𝑥\\overline{y}=Gad_{f}(\\overline{x}) is the\nconcatenation of ℓ+1ℓ1\\ell+1 strings ws∈{0,1}k+1superscript𝑤𝑠superscript01𝑘1w^{s}\\in\\{0,1\\}^{k+1} where we put Clearly we may fix f𝑓f w.l.o.g. to be the\ncircuit value function C​Vℓ,k​(v,u)𝐶subscript𝑉ℓ𝑘𝑣𝑢CV_{\\ell,k}(v,u)\nwhich from a size ℓℓ\\ell description v𝑣v of a circuit (denoted also v𝑣v) with k𝑘k inputs\nand k+1𝑘1k+1 outputs and from u∈{0,1}k𝑢superscript01𝑘u\\in{\\{0,1\\}^{k}} computes\nthe value of v𝑣v on u𝑢u, an element of {0,1}k+1superscript01𝑘1\\{0,1\\}^{k+1}. It was shown in  (see also [22, L.19.4.6])\nthat if we replace the hardness of a generator by a stronger condition\nthen it suffices to consider circuits v𝑣v of size\n≤k1+ϵabsentsuperscript𝑘1italic-ϵ\\leq k^{1+\\epsilon}, any fixed ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0.\nThe proof of this fact in  used the notion of iterability\nmentioned earlier, as it was\nat hand. However, the same argument gives Theorem 4.1 using\nthe presumably weaker notion\nof ⋁\\bigvee-hardness from Section 3; the proof in  was only sketched so we give it here. Recall that a pps P𝑃P simulates Q𝑄Q iff\nfor all σ∈TAUT𝜎TAUT\\sigma\\in\\mbox{TAUT} it holds that\nsP​(σ)≤sQ​(σ)csubscript𝑠𝑃𝜎subscript𝑠𝑄superscript𝜎𝑐s_{P}(\\sigma)\\leq s_{Q}(\\sigma)^{c}. Notation: In the rest of paper we shall ease on the notation and we\nwill denote the gadget generator G​a​df𝐺𝑎subscript𝑑𝑓Gad_{f} based on\nf=C​Vk2,k𝑓𝐶subscript𝑉superscript𝑘2𝑘f=CV_{k^{2},k} by Gads​qsubscriptGad𝑠𝑞{\\mbox{Gad}_{sq}} (s​q𝑠𝑞sq stands for square).  Let P𝑃P be a pps simulating EF and having the following properties.\nThere is c≥1𝑐1c\\geq 1 such that whenever σ∈TAUT𝜎TAUT\\sigma\\in\\mbox{TAUT}\nand σ′superscript𝜎′\\sigma^{\\prime} is obtained from σ𝜎\\sigma by substituting for some atoms\nconstants 00 or 111 then sP​(σ′)≤sP​(σ)csubscript𝑠𝑃superscript𝜎′subscript𝑠𝑃superscript𝜎𝑐s_{P}(\\sigma^{\\prime})\\leq s_{P}(\\sigma)^{c}, and for all α,β𝛼𝛽\\alpha,\\beta: sP​(β)≤(sP​(α)+sP​(α→β))csubscript𝑠𝑃𝛽superscriptsubscript𝑠𝑃𝛼subscript𝑠𝑃→𝛼𝛽𝑐s_{P}(\\beta)\\leq(s_{P}(\\alpha)+s_{P}(\\alpha\\rightarrow\\beta))^{c}. Assume that there exists a\np-time function g:{0,1}∗→{0,1}∗:𝑔→superscript01superscript01g:{\\{0,1\\}^{*}}\\rightarrow{\\{0,1\\}^{*}} that stretches\nall size n𝑛n inputs to size m:=m​(n)>nassign𝑚𝑚𝑛𝑛m:=m(n)>n and is ⋁\\bigvee-hard for P𝑃P. Then\nthe gadget generator based on C​Vk2,k𝐶subscript𝑉superscript𝑘2𝑘CV_{k^{2},k} is ⋁\\bigvee-hard (and hence also hard) for P𝑃P\nas well. Proof : Assume P𝑃P and g𝑔g satisfy the hypotheses of the theorem; w.l.o.g.\nwe may assume that m​(n)=n+1𝑚𝑛𝑛1m(n)=n+1.\nLet Cksubscript𝐶𝑘C_{k} be a canonical circuit of size polynomial in k𝑘k that computes gksubscript𝑔𝑘g_{k}\nand let Cksubscript𝐶𝑘C_{k} be encoded by a string ⌈Ck⌉subscript𝐶𝑘\\lceil C_{k}\\rceil of size ℓ≤kaℓsuperscript𝑘𝑎\\ell\\leq k^{a}, some\nconstant a≥1𝑎1a\\geq 1. Claim 1: GadfsubscriptGad𝑓{\\mbox{Gad}_{f}} with f:=C​Vka,kassign𝑓𝐶subscript𝑉superscript𝑘𝑎𝑘f:=CV_{k^{a},k} is ⋁\\bigvee-hard for P𝑃P.\n Note that the τ𝜏\\tau formula for GadfsubscriptGad𝑓{\\mbox{Gad}_{f}} and b=(b1,…,bt)∈{0,1}n+1𝑏superscript𝑏1…superscript𝑏𝑡superscript01𝑛1b=(b^{1},\\dots,b^{t})\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n+1} is a\nt𝑡t-size disjunction, t=ka+1𝑡superscript𝑘𝑎1t=k^{a}+1, of τ𝜏\\tau-formulas for\nC​Vka,k𝐶subscript𝑉superscript𝑘𝑎𝑘CV_{k^{a},k} and bisuperscript𝑏𝑖b^{i}, i≤t𝑖𝑡i\\leq t. Substitute there for (atoms defining)\nthe gadget v:=⌈Ck⌉assign𝑣subscript𝐶𝑘v:=\\lceil C_{k}\\rceil.\nUsing that E​F𝐸𝐹EF has p-size proofs888When C​Vℓ,k𝐶subscript𝑉ℓ𝑘CV_{\\ell,k} is defined naturally by induction on the size of the circuit and the encoding ⌈Ck⌉subscript𝐶𝑘\\lceil C_{k}\\rceil uses log\\log-size addresses of subcircuits it would suffice to assume P≥R​(log)𝑃𝑅P\\geq R(\\log), cf. [ref]22 for the proof system.\nof and P≥E​F𝑃𝐸𝐹P\\geq EF, any proof of the original disjunction for GadfsubscriptGad𝑓{\\mbox{Gad}_{f}} is turned into a polynomially longer P𝑃P-proof of a disjuction of τ𝜏\\tau-formulas for g𝑔g, contradicting the hypothesis. Claim 2: Gads​qsubscriptGad𝑠𝑞{\\mbox{Gad}_{sq}} is ⋁\\bigvee-hard for P𝑃P.\n Note that GadfsubscriptGad𝑓{\\mbox{Gad}_{f}} in Claim 1 is computed in time O​(k2​a)𝑂superscript𝑘2𝑎O(k^{2a}) which is ≤n2−δabsentsuperscript𝑛2𝛿\\leq n^{2-\\delta}\nfor some δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0. Hence we may perform the same construction as in Claim 1 but using\nGadfsubscriptGad𝑓{\\mbox{Gad}_{f}} instead of g𝑔g now. q.e.d. Note that a circuit of size s𝑠s can be encoded by 10​s​log⁡s10𝑠𝑠10s\\log s bits\nso Gads​qsubscriptGad𝑠𝑞{\\mbox{Gad}_{sq}} uses as gadgets circuits of size a little bit less than quadratic.\nObserve also that\nGads​qsubscriptGad𝑠𝑞{\\mbox{Gad}_{sq}} is computed in time smaller than n3/2superscript𝑛32n^{3/2}. The next statement shows that non-uniformity is irrelevant in the presence of strong fdp.\nIt is proved analogously as Theorem 4.1 by taking for gadgets\ncircuits needed to compute the generator. Assume a pps P𝑃P satisfies the hypotheses of Theorem 4.1\nand that it admits a ⋁\\bigvee-hard proof complexity generator\ncomputed in non-uniform p-time (i.e. by p-size circuits).\nThen Gads​qsubscriptGad𝑠𝑞{\\mbox{Gad}_{sq}} is ⋁\\bigvee-hard for P𝑃P. It is known that gadget generators (and Gads​qsubscriptGad𝑠𝑞{\\mbox{Gad}_{sq}} in particular) are hard for many proof systems\nfor which we know any super-polynomial lower bound, cf. [ref]22. Our\nworking hypothesis is that the generator Gads​qsubscriptGad𝑠𝑞{\\mbox{Gad}_{sq}} satisfies Conjecture 1.1.\nBut when working with the generator we encounter\nthe same difficulty as in the case of the truth-table generator tts,ksubscripttt𝑠𝑘{\\mbox{{\\bf tt}}}_{s,k}: we know nothing non-trivial\nabout circuits of sub-quadratic size.\nFurthermore, the experience with\nlengths-of-proofs lower bounds we have so far suggests that it is instrumental to have hard examples\nwith some clear combinatorial structure.\nHence to study the hardness of Gads​qsubscriptGad𝑠𝑞{\\mbox{Gad}_{sq}} it may be advantageous to consider\ngadgets (i.e. sub-quadratic circuits) of a special form (technically that would be a substitution instance of Gads​qsubscriptGad𝑠𝑞{\\mbox{Gad}_{sq}}). One such specific generator was defined in [22, pp.431-2]\nand denoted nwk,csubscriptnw𝑘𝑐\\mbox{nw}_{k,c} there; its gadget is essentially a slightly over-determined\nsystem of sparse equations for a generic function hℎh.\nNamely the gadget consists of: k+1𝑘1k+1 sets J1,…,Jk+1⊆{x1,…,xk}subscript𝐽1…subscript𝐽𝑘1subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑘J_{1},\\dots,J_{k+1}\\subseteq\\{x_{1},\\dots,x_{k}\\}, each of size 1≤c≤log⁡k1𝑐𝑘1\\leq c\\leq\\log k, together with 2csuperscript2𝑐2^{c} bits defining\ntruth table of a Boolean function hℎh\nwith c𝑐c inputs. Given gadget v𝑣v and u∈{0,1}k𝑢superscript01𝑘u\\in{\\{0,1\\}^{k}},\nf​(v,u)∈{0,1}k+1𝑓𝑣𝑢superscript01𝑘1f(v,u)\\in\\{0,1\\}^{k+1} are the k+1𝑘1k+1 values hℎh computes on values that u𝑢u gives to variables in sets J1,…,Jk+1subscript𝐽1…subscript𝐽𝑘1J_{1},\\dots,J_{k+1}.\nThis generator for one fixed, non-uniform gadget was the original suggestion for Conjecture 1.1 in \nbut the gadget generator construction allows to avoid the non-uniformity and consider generic case.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: by induction on the size of the circuit and the encoding ⌈Ck⌉subscript𝐶𝑘\\lceil C_{k}\\rceil uses log\\log-size addresses of subcircuits it would suffice to assume P≥R​(log)𝑃𝑅P\\geq R(\\log), cf.
