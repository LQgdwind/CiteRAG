      "content": "Paper Title: Prescriptive Process Monitoring: Quo Vadis?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPrescriptive process monitoring methods prescribe actions to take, i.e., interventions. These interventions can be categorized according to the process perspective of the prescribed intervention. Our review indicates that interventions commonly concern control flow and resource perspectives. A common intervention perspective is control flow, such as prescribing the next task to perform  [ref]18 [ref]6 . More specifically, in de Leoni et al. , the next best task is prescribed to the professional who helps a customer in finding a new job, whereas in Weinzierl et al. , the next step is presented to the end-user. Following the prescribed intervention can improve execution time, customer satisfaction or service quality. In other studies, a sequence of next steps is prescribed as an intervention. For instance, in one method, the appropriate treatment of a blood infusion is prescribed for patients based on their personal information [ref]10, whereas another method prescribes steps to be taken in a trauma resuscitation process . Such interventions aim to improve treatment quality. Another group of methods focuses on the resource perspective, e.g., which resource should perform the next task. For instance, Wibisono et al.  prescribe which police officer is best suited for the next task in a driving license application process based on their predicted performance. In another method, a mechanic is recommended to carry out car repairs because s/he is predicted to finish it within a defined time given their schedule and experience . Some papers propose prescribing multiple interventions for one case   . For example, an intervention to make an offer to a client is prescribed together with a suggestion for a specific clerk to carry out the task . Similarly, in an IT service management process, recommending the next task and the specialist to perform it can help to resolve open cases quicker . When reviewing the identified papers, we noted that interventions could be divided into two aspects; intervention frequency and intervention basis. Intervention frequency captures when interventions are prescribed. In this sense prescriptive monitoring methods can be continuous or discrete. If the method is continuous, it prescribes an intervention for multiple or all activities of an ongoing case. For example, the best-suited resource for each next task is prescribed . Discrete interventions, in comparison, prescribe actions to be taken only when a need is detected. For instance, in Metzger et al. , interventions are triggered only when it is detected that the probability of a negative outcome exceeds a defined threshold. The intervention basis describes whether a method is prediction-based or similarity-based. Prediction-based methods predict the outcomes of an ongoing case and then prescribe an intervention. Similarity-based methods in comparison provide recommendations solely based on an analysis of historical traces. For instance, one method predicts the possible outcomes if a task is performed as the next step . The next step is prescribed based on which option leads to a greater metric improvement. In contrast to this method, a set of actions are prescribed based on the similarity rate of a current ongoing case and similar previous cases in another method .\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: Our review indicates that interventions commonly concern control flow and resource perspectives.
