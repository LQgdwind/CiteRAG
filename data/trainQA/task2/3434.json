Many methods such as NTS-Net, FDL[ref]10, StackedLSTM find strong discriminative preselected boxes through Region Proposal Network (RPN), then resize the preselected boxes to a fixed size, and use these local strong features to identify, that is to say, these methods will actually divide the identification task into two stages. Mix+[ref]39 uses the attention map to find the regions with strong discrimination and uses this map to complete the mixed reinforcement. CCFR[ref]40 recognizes the global features through these regional features, and learn better local region features by triplet loss and scale-separated NMS. Attention mechanisms are also widely used in FGVC tasks, such as MACN, WS-DAN and CAL to learn the location of objects, and extract the characteristics of a specific location in a feature map through the attention-map. In addition to being used to learn location information, the attention mechanism can also improve the expressiveness of features. For example, MAMC and API-Net learn unique features by simultaneously training the differences between a pair of similar images through the attention mechanism, and CAP fuses different local features through the attention mechanism. The above methods all show that the attention mechanism is a very powerful method. Since the release of Vision Transformer(ViT), the ViT architecture has performed quite well in the field of image recognition, so many approaches are proposed to apply this architecture to the FGVC task. For example, FFVT, AFTrans, RAMS-Trans and TransFG use ViT as the backbone network, and use the attention-map generated by the image in self-attention as the search for strong discriminative regions. Finally, the features of these regions are processed to complete the recognition task. This approach is similar to the aforementioned method based on the convolutional network. As shown in the left part of Fig.3, the difference is that the strength of the attention map is used instead of the response of the feature map.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: The main purpose of FGVC is to locate highly discriminatory regions.
