      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Space Partitions for Path Planning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe test LaP3 on a diverse set of environments to evaluate its performance in different settings. Baselines. We compare LaP3 to several baselines. LaMCTS is the original LaMCTS algorithm using CMA-ES as an inner solver, like LaP3. Random Shooting (RS)¬† samples random trajectories and returns the best one. Cross-Entropy Methods (CEM)¬† use the top-kùëòk samples to fit a local model to guide future sampling. A related approach, Covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES)¬†, tracks additional variables for improved local model fitting. Voronoi optimistic optimization applied to trees (VOOT)¬†2 is a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù MCTS method for continuous action spaces that builds a tree on actions at each timestep. iLQR¬†6 is a seminal gradient-based local optimization approach used extensively in controls. Finally, proximal policy optimization (PPO)¬† is a standard reinforcement learning algorithm. LaP3 does not require substantially more tuning effort than CEM or CMA-ES, the best-performing among our baselines experimentally.\nThe only additional hyperparameter tuned in LaP3 is the Cpsubscriptùê∂ùëùC_{p} controlling exploration when selecting regions to sample from, which is dependent on the scale of the reward function. However, our Cpsubscriptùê∂ùëùC_{p} only varies by a factor of up to 10 across our diverse environments, and performance is not overly sensitive to small changes (Appendix F.5). We use MiniWorld¬† for continuous path planning and MiniGrid¬†[ref]6 for discrete.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: varies by a factor of up to 10 across our diverse environments, and performance is not overly sensitive to small changes (Appendix F.5). We use MiniWorld¬† for continuous path planning and MiniGrid¬†[ref]6 for discrete.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
