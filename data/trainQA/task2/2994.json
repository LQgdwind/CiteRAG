      "content": "Paper Title: Regular Decision Processes for Grid Worlds\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe typical MDP context is well studied and there is an abundance of algorithms and representations   0 . Endowing MDPs with non-Markovian goal and reward functions has a history with seminal work on model-based settings  5 and more recently several subclasses are considered (e.g. probabilistic vs. deterministic)  . The most recent addition to the field are the general regular decision processes  we employ here. One aim of all these methods is to scale MDPs to more complex problems. However, another main reason to utilize temporal logics for reward specifications is that it opens up many new possibilities for reward function engineering, resulting in more intuitive and technically useful ways to specify tasks and goals. A more general view, based on automata as transducers  improves on the technical part by merging the non-Markovian parts into a single structure. The use of temporal logics   in model-free RL settings is a recent trend , and comes with additional requirements since the model of the environment is unknown. Many ideas here come from constrained or safe  forms of RL, where the policy space is restricted either before learning, or during action selection, based on a notion what are (un)desired actions. Safety issues have obvious connections with model checking  and some recent RL approaches instantiate that connection for safe RL  . Very recently, several approaches have appeared combining formal temporal logic with RL 2  [ref]10   . Some focus more on the representational devices such as reward machines , some study additional mechanisms such as shaping to aid in the more complex learning process 7, and others introduce variants such as geometric LTL to capture a different semantics of goals 5. Overall, variations exist in different logics, different underlying automata (e.g. DFA vs Mealy) and inference algorithms, and different RL algorithms to solve the resulting extended MDPs. The meaning of ”model-free” has variations here, since one can can assume that nothing is known, or that at least the reward formula is (which is quite believable when we want an agent to adhere to certain rules or restrictions). In the latter case one can use the monitor automata states as extra state information and apply any form of deep function approximation . In general, reward and transition functions may need to be learned from traces for fully general RL systems. In the temporal logic settings we describe, this typically amounts to automaton induction algorithms that can work on examples of traces (positive or negative) in deterministic or even probabilistic settings, which contains notoriously hard settings, but some promising work is emerging  0 . In the context of RDPs, initial work with a Mealy machine representation shows promise [ref]1. In addition, temporal logic allows for declarative and intuitive models, hence in terms of explainability in RL many possibilities are left, and only some work is just emerging .\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: connections with model checking  and some recent RL approaches instantiate that connection for safe RL  .
