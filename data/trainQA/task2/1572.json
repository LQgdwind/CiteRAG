      "content": "Paper Title: Rethinking the Implementation Tricks and Monotonicity Constraint in Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMulti-agent cooperative games have many complex real-world applications such as, robot swarm control [7; 36; 15], autonomous vehicle coordination [3; 40], and sensor networks , a complex task always requires multi-agents to accomplish together. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), is used to solve the multi-agent systems tasks [ref]36. In multi-agent systems, a typical challenge is a limited scalability and inherent constraints on agent observability and communication. Therefore, decentralized policies that act only on their local observations are necessitated and widely used [ref]39. Learning decentralized policies is an intuitive approach for training agents independently. However, simultaneous exploration by multiple agents often results in non-stationary environments, which leads to unstable learning. Therefore, Centralized Training and Decentralized Execution (CTDE) [ref]10 allows for independent agents to access additional state information that is unavailable during policy inference. Many CTDE learning algorithms have been proposed for the better sample efficiency in cooperative tasks. Among them, several value-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance [20; 32; 37; 21] on such benchmark environments, e.g., Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) , Predator-Prey (PP) [2; 17]. To enable effective CTDE for multi-agent Q-learning, the Individual-Global-Max (IGM) principle  of equivalence of joint greedy action and individual greedy actions is critical. The primary advantage of the IGM principle is that it ensures consistency of policy with centralized training and decentralized execution. To ensure IGM principle, QMIX  was proposed for factorizing the joint action-value function with the Monotonicity Constraint , however, limiting the expressive power of the mixing network. To improve the performance of QMIX, some variants of QMIX 111These algorithms are based on the mixing network from QMIX, so we call the variants of QMIX., including value-based approaches [37; 21; 32; 25] and a policy-based approach [ref]39, have been proposed with the aim to relax the monotonicity constraint of QMIX. However, while investigating the codes of these variants, we find that their performance is significantly affected by their code-level optimizations (or implementation tricks). Therefore, it is left unclear whether monotonicity constraint indeed impairs the QMIX’s performance. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the code-level optimizations and the monotonicity constraint in cooperative MARL. Firstly, we investigate the effects of code-level optimizations, which enable QMIX to solve the most difficult challenges in SMAC. Afterward, we normalize the optimizations of QMIX and its variants; specifically, we perform the same hyperparameter search pattern for all algorithms, which includes using or removing a certain optimization and a grid hyperparameter search; the experiment results (Sec. 5.2.1) demonstrate that QMIX outperforms the other variants. Secondly, to study the impact of the monotonicity constraint, we propose a policy-based algorithm, RIIT; the experimental results (Sec. 5.2.2) show that the monotonicity constraint improves sample efficiency in SMAC and DEPP. Lastly, to generalize cooperative tasks beyond SMAC and DEPP, we give a strict definition of purely cooperative tasks and a discussion about why monotonicity constraints work well in purely cooperative tasks. To our best knowledge, this work is the first to analyze the monotonicity constraint and code-level optimizations in MARL. Our analysis shows that QMIX works well if a multi-agent task can be interpreted as purely cooperative, even if it can also be interpreted as competitive.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: 40], and sensor networks , a complex task always requires multi-agents to accomplish together.
