We evaluate our method‚Äôs robustness to image corruption using the standard benchmarks Pascal-C, COCO-C, and Cityscapes-C [ref]25. For Pascal-C, we used VOC07 trainval split as the source training data. For COCO-C and Cityscapes-C, we divided the train split and used the first half as source training data. There are Nc=15subscriptùëÅùëê15N_{c}=15 different corruption types for each dataset. Thus, we applied each corruption type on the VOC12 trainval or on the second half of COCO-C and Cityscapes-C train as unlabeled target data. Precisely, we applied each corruption type with middle severity onto each image using the imagecorruptions library [ref]25. More details are given in [ref]2. Metrics. For image corruption benchmark, we followed the evaluation protocol from [ref]13 [ref]25  and measured the mean performance under corruption (mPC), relative performance under corruption (rPC), and the relative robustness œÑcsubscriptùúèùëê\\tau_{c} of the adapted model averaged over NcsubscriptùëÅùëêN_{c} corruption types: where APcleanxsuperscriptsubscriptAPcleanùë•\\text{AP}_{\\text{clean}}^{x} and APc,sxsuperscriptsubscriptAPùëêùë†ùë•\\text{AP}_{c,s}^{x} denote the average precision of the test data with corruption type cùëêc and severity level sùë†s. The relative robustness œÑcsubscriptùúèùëê\\tau_{c} quantifies the effect of adaptation on the performance under distribution shift (mPC). Baselines. We use the following baselines which were proposed to improve the robustness to image corruptions: Stylize¬†, BN-Adapt¬†, DeepAugment¬†, STAC¬†, and DT+PL¬†. Unless specified, we employed weak data augmentations such as RandomHorizontalFlip and RandomCrop for all baselines. Main results. Table 4, 5 and 6 show the results of Yolov5m model for Pascal-C, COCO-C, and Cityscapes-C, respectively. We report the results with different model sizes in [ref]2. We used the large model Yolov5x model as a teacher. An ablation study on Pascal-C is provided in Table 7 and will be discussed later. Unlabeled target samples improved robustness to image corruption. The source models suffered from performance drop due to image corruptions. By adapting the models with SimROD, the mean performance under corruption mPC50superscriptmPC50\\text{mPC}^{50} was significantly improved by +21.62, +6.43, and +6.48 absolute percentage points on Pascal-C, COCO-C, and Cityscapes-C, respectively. Our method outperformed the Stylize, DeepAugment, BNAdapt baselines on all metrics. In fact, STAC, which also used unlabeled target samples, achieved the second best performance. This shows that augmentation or batch norm adaptation is not sufficient to fix the domain shift on all possible corruptions. Instead, using unlabeled samples from target domain is more effective to combat image corruptions. Pseudo-label refinement ensured performance close to Oracle. Moreover, Tables 4, 5 and 6 show that the performance of our unsupervised method was close to that of the Oracle, which uses ground-truth labels for target domain data. This was possible because the adapted teacher produces highly accurate pseudo-labels, which could be used along with DomainMix augmentation to effectively adapt the student model. Ablation Study. Next, we present an ablation study using the Yolov5m model on Pascal-C in Table 7 to gain some insights about the contributions of the three parts of our method. First, BN-Adapt improved the mean performance under corruption by 10.82% AP50. Applying DomainMix augmentation on top of BN-Adapt improved the performance by 2.18%. Next, the teacher-guided (TG) pseudo-label refinement was particularly useful in adapting small models. When using our full method, the performance increased by 10.8% compared to BN-Adapt. Compared to self adaptation, TG improved the Yolov5 model‚Äôs performance mPC by +3.7 %. Finally, the gradual adaptation (GA) also played an important role in refining pseudo-labels and in improving the model‚Äôs robustness. For example, if we did not use GA and skipped the BN adaptation in the first phase, the performance dropped by 1.95% compared to the full method. Our method organically integrates these parts to tackle UDA for object detection. While the parts may appear simple, their synergy helped mitigate the challenging issues of domain shift and pseudo-label noise. Qualitative analysis Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of our method by showing the pseudo-labels generated with our method on the unlabeled target training images on Comic dataset. As seen in Figure 4(a), our method generated highly accurate pseudo-labels despite the domain shift. In contrast, STAC and DT+PL generated sparse labels since they missed to detect many objects. The performance difference transferred to the quality of predictions on the test set as shown in Figure 4(b).\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: Datasets.
