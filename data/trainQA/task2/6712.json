      "content": "Paper Title: BAGM: A Backdoor Attack for Manipulating Text-to-Image Generative Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany current, popular state-of-the-art image synthesis models are based on diffusion probabilistic model architectures  [ref]7  [ref]17  [ref]19. The foundational framework proposed by Sohl-Dickstein et al. [ref]17 was inspired by thermodynamics, physics and quasi-static processes, building a generative Markov chain to convert a known distribution into a target sample [ref]17. The rapid growth of generative models has resulted in variations of diffusion models including latent diffusion 0, semantic diffusion 1, and stochastic differential equations [ref]19. These are some of the more well established approaches in literature, however, the volume of unique diffusion models is extensive as reported in  [ref]7. Generally, diffusion models can be represented by the objective function 0 1: Croitoru et al. categorise diffusion models into “at least three” categories : (i) denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), inspired by [ref]17 , (ii) noise conditioned score networks (NCSNs) [ref]19 and, (iii) stochastic differential equation (SDE) approaches 2. Diffusion models operate with a coupled approach, comprising a forward process (encoder) and a reverse process (decoder)  [ref]7   [ref]19 2. The former process generates noise from data, and the latter performs the reverse. To help describe the forward and reverse processes, and objective functions of each category, let us define some terms that translate across the three diffusion model categories: p​(xt)𝑝subscript𝑥𝑡p(x_{t}) = data distribution at index ‘t𝑡t’ given T𝑇T total steps 𝐈𝐈\\mathbf{I} = identity matrix βtsubscript𝛽𝑡\\beta_{t} = model hyper-parameters at step t𝑡t 𝒩​(x;μ,Σ)𝒩𝑥𝜇Σ\\mathcal{N}(x;\\mu,\\Sigma) = normal distribution that produces x𝑥x given a mean ‘μ𝜇\\mu’ and covariance ‘ΣΣ\\Sigma’ ∇xlog⁡p​(x)subscript∇𝑥𝑝𝑥\\nabla_{x}\\log p(x) = gradient of the log density w.r.t. the input ωtsubscript𝜔𝑡\\omega_{t} = Gaussian noise applied at step t𝑡t γ𝛾\\gamma = magnitude of an update in an NCSN model ℒm​o​d​e​lsubscriptℒ𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙\\mathcal{L}_{model} = model objective function λ(.)\\lambda(.) = weight function 𝔼𝔼\\mathbb{E} = expected value K​L𝐾𝐿KL = Kullback-Liebler divergence pθsubscript𝑝𝜃p_{\\theta} = some neural network/model f​(x,t)𝑓𝑥𝑡f(x,t) = compute the drift coefficient in SDE model 𝔻​(t)𝔻𝑡\\mathbb{D}(t) = compute the diffusion coefficient in SDE model ω^^𝜔\\hat{\\omega} = Brownian motion applied in reverse SDE operation A summary of forward processes, reverse processes, and objective functions for the three groups of diffusion models is reported in Table I. Readers should note that the formulae defined in Table I are not representative of all models associated with each category. They aim to provide readers with a foundational understanding of each method. We refer readers to  [ref]7  [ref]17  [ref]19 2 for further elaboration.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Many current, popular state-of-the-art image synthesis models are based on diffusion probabilistic model architectures  [ref]7  [ref]17  [ref]19.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
