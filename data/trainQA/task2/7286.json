      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey of Advances in Optimization Methods for Wireless Communication System Design\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn various real-world applications, signals are (approximately) sparse or have a sparse representation under a certain basis. By exploiting the inherent sparsity of the true signal, CS enables the reconstruction of the original signal from only a small number of observations (e.g., from an underdetermined linear system), thereby significantly reducing the burden of sample acquisition, data storage, and computation. Mathematically, the reconstruction process of the sparse signal can be formulated as the following optimization problem: Here, 𝒙∈ℝn𝒙superscriptℝ𝑛\\bm{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n} is the sparse signal to be recovered, ‖𝒙‖0subscriptnorm𝒙0\\|\\bm{x}\\|_{0} denotes the ℓ0subscriptℓ0\\ell_{0}-norm that counts the numbers of nonzero entries in 𝒙𝒙\\bm{x}, and 𝒚=𝐀​𝒙𝒚𝐀𝒙\\bm{y}=\\mathbf{A}\\bm{x} is an underdetermined system with the observation 𝒚∈ℝm𝒚superscriptℝ𝑚\\bm{y}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m}, the sensing matrix 𝐀∈ℝm×n𝐀superscriptℝ𝑚𝑛\\mathbf{A}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}, and m≪nmuch-less-than𝑚𝑛m\\ll n.\nIt is generally NP-hard to solve problem (27) . An alternative model that enables the design of computationally efficient recovery algorithms is given by where the nonconvex term ‖𝒙‖0subscriptnorm𝒙0\\|\\bm{x}\\|_{0} in (27) is replaced by the convex term ‖𝒙‖1subscriptnorm𝒙1\\|\\bm{x}\\|_{1} in (28).\nIn practice, the measurements may include some noise, i.e., 𝒚=𝐀​𝒙+𝐳𝒚𝐀𝒙𝐳\\bm{y}=\\mathbf{A}\\bm{x}+\\mathbf{z} with ‖𝐳‖2≤ϵsubscriptnorm𝐳2italic-ϵ\\|\\mathbf{z}\\|_{2}\\leq\\epsilon. In this case, the reconstruction problem can be formulated as The above constrained problem can be further recast into the unconstrained problem where λ>0𝜆0\\lambda>0 is a parameter that trades off the data fidelity term ‖𝐀​𝒙−𝒚‖22superscriptsubscriptnorm𝐀𝒙𝒚22\\|\\mathbf{A}\\bm{x}-\\bm{y}\\|_{2}^{2} and the sparsity term ‖𝒙‖1subscriptnorm𝒙1\\|\\bm{x}\\|_{1}.\nProblems (29) and (30) are connected in that for any ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon, there exists a λ𝜆\\lambda such that the two problems have the same solutions . Two fundamental questions for the above reconstruction problems are (i) under what conditions can the formulations (27) and (28) precisely recover any k𝑘k-sparse signal 𝒙𝒙\\bm{x} (i.e., ‖𝒙‖0≤ksubscriptnorm𝒙0𝑘\\|\\bm{x}\\|_{0}\\leq k) and (ii) how large is the recovery error when there is some noise in the measurements. These questions have been extensively studied, yielding numerous remarkable and insightful results. One of the most well-known recovery conditions is characterized by the restricted isometry property (RIP)  of the sensing matrix 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}. Specifically, a matrix 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} is said to satisfy the RIP of order k𝑘k if there exists a constant δk∈(0,1)subscript𝛿𝑘01\\delta_{k}\\in(0,1) such that holds for all k𝑘k-sparse vector 𝒙𝒙\\bm{x}. Intuitively, RIP can be viewed as a characteristic that preserves the geometry (i.e., the distance) between sparse vectors. A smaller δksubscript𝛿𝑘\\delta_{k} implies better preservation capability, making 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} a more effective sensing matrix. An intriguing recovery result characterized by RIP is that when 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} satisfies RIP of order 2​k2𝑘2k with δ2​k<1subscript𝛿2𝑘1\\delta_{2k}<1, any k𝑘k-sparse signal can be exactly recovered by the ℓ0subscriptℓ0\\ell_{0} minimization problem (27). Furthermore, if δ2​k<2−1subscript𝛿2𝑘21\\delta_{2k}<\\sqrt{2}-1, the solution of the ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} minimization problem (28) is the same as that of (27), i.e., the k𝑘k-sparse signal can also be recovered from (28). When the measurements are corrupted with noise, the recovery error is in the order of 𝒪​(ϵ)𝒪italic-ϵ\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon) for problem (29) .\nThe upper bound on the above RIP constant can be further improved; see, e.g., . It is worth mentioning that the RIP can be satisfied with high probability for a wide class of random matrices, including the i.i.d. Gaussian/Bernoulli matrices  and the partial Fourier matrix , when the number of measurements satisfies Finally, we remark that there are also many other important conditions based on which recovery results are established, including spark , null space property , mutual coherence , etc. Interested readers are referred to a comprehensive review of these conditions in . We next review some popular sparse signal recovery algorithms in the literature. Depending on the design principles, these algorithms can be broadly categorized into three classes: optimization-based approaches, greedy approaches, and Bayesian approaches. Optimization-based approaches. Various first-order optimization algorithms have been developed to solve large-scale convex ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} minimization problems (28)–(30). Some notable ones include, but are not limited to, the Bregman iterative algorithm  for solving problem (28); the NESTA algorithm  for solving problem (29); the PG algorithm (which will be reviewed in detail in Section III-C) , the accelerated PG algorithm , the split Bregman algorithm  (which is equivalent to the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm ), the shrinkage and subspace optimization-based algorithm , and the iterative reweighted least squares (LS) algorithm  for solving problem (30).\nThere are also some elegantly designed second-order algorithms for sparse optimization, e.g., the semismooth Newton algorithm  for solving problem (30), which achieves high computational efficiency by carefully utilizing the sparsity in the solution; and the inexact proximal regularized Newton method  for solving sparse optimization problems with more general loss functions and regularizers. Greedy approaches. In contrast to the aforementioned optimization-based approaches to solving ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} minimization problems, the greedy approaches iteratively identify the support and coefficients of the signal 𝒙𝒙\\bm{x} by some carefully designed criteria, yielding a suboptimal solution of the original ℓ0subscriptℓ0\\ell_{0} minimization problem. Well-known greedy approaches include the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)  and its variants    . The greedy approaches are typically more computationally efficient than optimization-based approaches, especially when the number of measurements m𝑚m is much smaller than the signal dimension n𝑛n. Bayesian approaches. Bayesian approaches view the CS problem and perform sparse signal recovery from a statistical perspective. In the Bayesian framework, a prior distribution is assigned to the unknown signal to capture its inherent structure. A notable Bayesian approach is the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm . Significantly, the AMP algorithm can approach the Bayes-optimal MSE performance when the sensing matrix 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} has zero-mean sub-Gaussian i.i.d. elements [ref]129. There are also various extensions of AMP such as orthogonal AMP (OAMP) [ref]130 and vector AMP (VAMP) [ref]131, which are applicable to a more general class of random matrices. A remarkable property of the AMP-type algorithm is that its asymptotic behavior can be precisely characterized by a scalar equation termed state evolution. This nice property facilitates high-dimensional performance analysis not only for the algorithm itself but also for (the solutions of) various models including (30) [ref]129.\n\nReference markers found: [129]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]129: message passing (AMP) algorithm .
