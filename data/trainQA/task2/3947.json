      "content": "Paper Title: Parallel and Distributed Graph Neural Networks: An In-Depth Concurrency Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe also summarize parallelism related optimizations. Frameworks that enable data parallelism use different forms of graph\npartitioning. The primary goal is to minimize the edges crossing graph\npartitions in order to reduce communication. Here, some designs (e.g.,\nDeepGalois , DistGNN ) use vertex\ncuts. Others (e.g., DGCL , QGTC [ref]225)\nincorporate METIS partitioning [ref]125.\nROC  proposes an interesting scheme, in which it uses\nonline linear regression to effectively repartition the graph across\ndifferent training iterations, minimizing the execution time.\nSimilar approaches are employed by I-GCN  and Point-X . There are numerous other schemes used for reducing communication\nvolume.\nFor example, DeepGalois  and DGCL \nuse message combination and aggregation, DGCL also\nbalances loads on different interconnect links,\nDistGNN  delays updates to optimize communication, Min et\nal.  use zero copy in the CPU–GPU setting (GPU threads\naccess host memory without requiring much CPU interaction) and computation &\ncommunication overlap, and GNNAdvisor  and\n2PGraph  renumber nodes to achieve more locality .\nGNNAdvisor also provides locality-aware task\nscheduling .\n2PGraph also increases the amount of\nlocality with cluster based mini-batching (it increases the number of sampled\nvertices that belong to the same neighborhood in a mini-batch), a scheme\nsimilar to the approach taken by the Cluster-GCN model . Moreover, there are many interesting operator related optimizations.\nA common optimization is operator fusion (sometimes referred to as “kernel\nfusion” ), in which one merges the execution of\ndifferent operators, for example Aggregate and UpdateVertex    . This enables better on-chip data\nreuse and reduces the number of invoked operators. While most systems fuse\noperators within a single GNN layer, QGTC offers operator fusion also across\ndifferent GNN layers [ref]225.\nOther interesting schemes include operator\nreorganization [ref]251, in which one ensures that\noperators first perform neural operations (e.g., MLP) and only then the updated\nfeature vectors are propagated. This limits redundant computation. Many systems come with optimizations related to the used graph\nrepresentation. For example, PCGCN  provides a hybrid\nrepresentation, in which it uses CSR to maintain sparse parts of the adjacency\nmatrix, and dense bitmaps for dense edge blocks.\nFurther, many designs focus on ensuring cache friendlines:\nDistGNN  uses tiling (referred to as “blocking”),\nPaGraph  and 2PGraph  provide\neffective feature caching, and Lin et al.  propose\nlossy compression to fit into GPU memory. Some systems hybridize various aspects of GNN computing.\nFor example, Dorylus  executes graph-related sparse operators\n(e.g., Aggregate) on CPUs, while dense tensor related operators\n(e.g., UpdateVertex) run on Lambdas.\nfuseGNN  dynamically switches between incorporated\nexecution paradigms: dense operators such as UpdateVertex are executed with the\nGL paradigm and the corresponding GEMM kernels, while sparse computations such\nas Aggregate use the graph-related paradigms such as SAGA.\nGcod  proposes an algorithm and accelerator codesign approach for GCNs. Many other schemes exist.\nFor example, Zhang et al. [ref]251 reduce memory\nconsumption (intermediate data are\nrecomputed in the backward pass, instead of being cached), while He et\nal.  incorporate serverless\ncomputing  for more efficient GNNs.\n\nReference markers found: [225]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]225: The primary goal is to minimize the edges crossing graph\npartitions in order to reduce communication.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
