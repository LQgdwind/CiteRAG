      "content": "Paper Title: Meta-Gradient Reinforcement Learning with an Objective Discovered Online\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent advances in supervised and unsupervised learning have been driven by a transition from handcrafted expert features to deep representations ; these are typically learned by gradient descent on a suitable objective function to adjust a rich parametric function approximator. As a field, reinforcement learning (RL) has also largely embraced the transition from handcrafting features to handcrafting objectives: deep function approximation has been successfully combined with ideas such as TD-learning  , Q-learning  2, double Q-learning 5 , n-step updates  , general value functions  , distributional value functions  , policy gradients [ref]42  and a variety of off-policy actor-critics   .\nIn RL, the agent doesn’t have access a differentiable performance metric, thus choosing the right proxy is of particular importance: indeed, each of the aforementioned algorithms differs fundamentally in their choice of objective, designed in each case by expert human knowledge. The deep RL version of these algorithms is otherwise very similar in essence: updating parameters via gradient descent on the corresponding objective function. Our goal is an algorithm that instead learns its own objective, and hence its own deep reinforcement learning algorithm, solely from experience of interacting with its environment. Following the principles of deep learning, we parameterise the objective function by a rich function approximator, and update it by meta-gradient learning   1   8  9 – i.e. by gradient descent on the sequence of gradient descent updates resulting from the choice of objective function – so as to maximise a naive outer loss function (such as REINFORCE) with minimal initial knowledge. Importantly, and in contrast to the majority of recent work on meta-learning 1  9, our meta-gradient algorithm learns online, on a single task, during a single “lifetime\" of training. This online approach to meta-learning confers several advantages. First, an online learning algorithm can be applied to any RL environment, and does not require a distribution of related environments, nor the ability to reset and rerun on different environments. Second, an online learning algorithm can adapt the objective function as learning progresses, rather than assume a global, static “one-size-fits-all\" objective. Our hypothesis is that an online meta-gradient learning agent will, over time, learn to learn with greater efficiency, and in the long-run this will outperform a fixed (handcrafted) objective. We show in toy problems that our approach can discover how to address important issues in RL, such as bootstrapping and non-stationarity. We also applied our algorithm for online discovery of an off-policy learning objective to independent training runs on each of 57 classic Atari games. Augmented with a simple heuristic to encourage consistent predictions, our meta-gradient algorithm outperformed the median score of a strong actor-critic baseline on this benchmark.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: has been successfully combined with ideas such as TD-learning  , Q-learning  2, double Q-learning 5 , n-step updates  , general value functions  , distributional value functions  , policy gradients [ref]42  and a variety of off-policy actor-critics   .\nIn RL, the agent doesn’t have access a differentiable performance metric, thus choosing the right proxy is of particular importance: indeed,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
