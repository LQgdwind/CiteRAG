      "content": "Paper Title: The Evolution of Out-of-Distribution Robustness Throughout Fine-Tuning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe ability to generalize to data not seen during training is essential for the widespread trust and adoption of machine learning models.\nHowever, the vast majority of models show a significant drop in performance from in-distribution (ID) data to out-of-distribution (OOD) data  [ref]33 [ref]3      .\nCommon examples include data captured in a different environment, like time of day or geographical location 7; noise or small corruptions of the input data  ; or adversarial examples created to explicitly fool neural networks into making incorrect predictions  [ref]3. Although the performance gap on OOD shifts is pervasive, it follows an intriguing pattern: there is a clear linear relationship between a model’s final performance on ID and OOD data [ref]41 [ref]33  .\nIn other words, given a model’s performance on an ID test set, a linear fit can accurately predict what the performance drop will be on the OOD test set.\nThis also implies that a certain amount of improvement on OOD accuracy can be explained by an improvement on ID accuracy.\nThe linear relationship holds across a wide range of models and is well-established for several robustness benchmarks, including image classification on both synthetic and natural distribution shifts   [ref]33 [ref]41,\n2D object detection , and question-answer models in NLP .\nRecently,  provided a theoretical analysis for why the linear fit occurs in practice, which relies on an assumption of similarity of model predictions that was empirically investigated in .\nSince even the highest-performing models will still have a gap between ID and OOD accuracy, the linear relationship reveals that our current methods are insufficient for addressing OOD shift. Models which lie above the linear fit are said to exhibit effective robustness (ER) [ref]41, which measures the model’s OOD accuracy relative to the fit (see Figure 1(a) for an illustration). Models with nonzero ER deviate in their OOD behavior in a manner that is qualitatively and quantitatively different from what we can currently achieve. Understanding why some models exhibit ER is therefore important for trying to close the gap between ID and OOD performance for state-of-the-art models. Models with high ER (>1%absentpercent1>1\\%) are exceedingly rare;\nthe most notable example is the recently proposed zero-shot CLIP model , and only a handful of the 204 ImageNet models evaluated in [ref]41 were found to have non-zero ER.\nThough most of these effectively robust models identified so far were pre-trained on large datasets, the majority of models pre-trained this way exhibit no ER, and we currently do not have a good understanding of when and why additional data helps, or what type of data might be most effective. In this work, we present an empirical study of the evolution of ER throughout fine-tuning.\nBy studying the evolution, we find intriguing properties that are missed by focusing only on models at convergence: pre-trained models exhibit ER, while randomly-initialized models do not (see Figure 1). Summary of Contributions: (Section 5.1, 5.3) We identify pre-trained, fine-tuned models as an entire class of effectively robust models (that match the ER of CLIP ) and investigate how details such as model size, dataset size, and example difficulty influence ER. (Section 5.4) We analyze properties of pre-trained models at the peak of their ER, including particular metrics defined in previous theoretical work . We find that effectively robust models make remarkably dissimilar predictions compared to standard models, and are able to correctly classify 10% of the examples that no other model gets correct. (Section 5.5) We find that pre-trained models gradually lose their ER throughout fine-tuning, even as both the ID and OOD accuracies of the model simultaneously increase. We discuss several potential solutions to mitigate this problem, but find that none of them are able to maintain high ER at high ID accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: trust and adoption of machine learning models.\nHowever, the vast majority of models show a significant drop in performance from in-distribution (ID) data to out-of-distribution (OOD) data  [ref]33 [ref]3      .\nCommon examples include data captured in a different environment, like time of day or geographical location 7; noise or small corruptions of the input data  ; or adversarial\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
