      "content": "Paper Title: Multimodal Representations Learning Based on Mutual Information Maximization and Minimization and Identity Embedding for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe conventional sentiment analysis tasks are always defined as identifying the emotional state of a single utterance. However, human perception of the world is based on the time domain and the expression of human emotion is temporal continuity, so only from a single utterance to recognize emotions will lose the contextual information of emotions. Therefore, the recently proposed emotion recognition works are trying to utilize contextual information of emotion to improve performance. In order to utilize the role of inter-speaker dependency relations, Conversational Memory Network (CMN), proposed by Hazarika et al. [ref]8 for dyadic conversational videos, employed gated recurrent units to model the history information of each speaker into memories. Later, based on CMN, Hazarika et al. [ref]25 proposed Interactive COnversational memory Network (ICON) which modeled the inter and intra-speaker emotional influences into global memories. Based on [ref]8 [ref]25, DialogueRNN  focused on using the speaker information to model emotional influence dynamically. Ghosal et al.  proposed DialogueGCN which introduced a graph neural network in emotion recognition to model inter and intra-dependency. Proposed by Ghosal et al. [ref]10, COSMIC modeled interactions between the interlocutors within a conversation based on different elements of commonsense. Recently, Shen et al.  combined the advantages of graph-based neural models and recurrence-based neural models to design a directed acyclic neural network to model the intrinsic structure of dialogue. The methods mentioned above demonstrate that contextual information and speaker information in dialogue are beneficial to emotion recognition. However, the performance of existing methods can be compromised when faced with problems such as lack of future information in real environments and dramatic affective variability in conversation.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: utilize contextual information of emotion to improve performance.
