      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Contour Tracking of Live Cells by Mechanical and Cycle Consistency Losses\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMechanical-Linear Loss. Similar to linear spring force from the mechanical model , the mechanical-linear loss measures the average distance A=∑i=0N−1‖pt+1i+1−pt+1i‖2𝐴superscriptsubscript𝑖0𝑁1subscriptnormsubscriptsuperscript𝑝𝑖1𝑡1subscriptsuperscript𝑝𝑖𝑡12A=\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\|p^{i+1}_{t+1}-p^{i}_{t+1}\\|_{2} between adjacent predicted contour points and forces every distance between adjacent points to be the same as the average distance. Here, each predicted contour point is pt+1i=ϕ​(Ot→t+1​(pti))subscriptsuperscript𝑝𝑖𝑡1italic-ϕsubscript𝑂→𝑡𝑡1subscriptsuperscript𝑝𝑖𝑡p^{i}_{t+1}=\\phi(O_{t\\rightarrow t+1}(p^{i}_{t})). The mechanical-linear is different from Snake  algorithm’s tension term, which simply minimizes the distance between adjacent points. Photometric Loss. Inspired by UFlow , we implemented photometric loss that minimizes the forward-then-backward tracked point’s pixel intensity to match its original point’s pixel intensity. Similar to the cycle consistency loss, forward and backward consistency losses are combined. But photometric loss measures the difference in pixel intensity, not the distance. Retrieving a point’s pixel intensity is denoted as γ𝛾\\gamma. Segmentation To provide an ordered sequence of contour points Ctsubscript𝐶𝑡C_{t} as input to our contour tracker, the cell body is segmented first.\nConfocal fluorescence live cell videos  have a distinct boundary between the cell body and dark background, so conventional image thresholding is enough to obtain their segmentation masks. However, the live cell videos taken with phase contrast microscope [ref]13 have challenging visual features such as halo and shade-off artifacts. As a result, a specialized deep segmentation model [ref]13 for phase contrast live cell videos is adopted. Both datasets used in our paper are not manually segmented, so their segmentation masks contain some noise. Labeling Tool We developed the labeling tool in Python to expedite the labeling process, as shown in Fig. S.1.1. It is available as an executable application in Windows 10/11. The labeling tool loads images with contour tracking points marked on the contour of the image.\nA user can click on the main view to create a tracking point, indicated by the blue circle.\nScrolling up or down zooms in or out at the location of the user’s cursor. The zoomed-in window is shown on the left pane of the GUI.\nPrev or next button on the bottom changes the frame such that the user can view how points move in consecutive frames and label tracking points. Created tracking points can be dragged to change their locations.\nPress the save button to save tracking points labeled at the current frame, or press the clear button to remove all labeled tracking points. Training Details In this section, we provide training details about our contour tracker and two compared methods, UFlow , and PoST .\nOur contour tracker, UFlow and PoST are all trained from scratch except for the ImageNet  pre-trained VGG16 encoder and ResNet50 encoder in our contour tracker and PoST, respectively.\nThe architecture of UFlow  is kept the same, but we modified PoST  to improve its performance since their original architecture did not perform well in our dataset.\nOur contour tracker, UFlow , and PoST  are trained by unsupervised learning with cycle consistency loss. But our contour tracker is also trained with mechanical-normal loss.\nUFlow  only takes images as input, while PoST  and our contour tracker take both images and contour points as input for training and inference.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: between the cell body and dark background, so conventional image thresholding is enough to obtain their segmentation masks.

Both datasets\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
