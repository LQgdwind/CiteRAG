      "content": "Paper Title: DRL: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Intelligent Robot Control– Concept, Literature, and Future\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn terms of experiments and application of DRL would almost look like this work  which is applying DQN  for intelligent robot control in discrete action space.\nThis work is important ONLY because it is showing the first application of DQN  to a practical example of robotics. Undoubtedly, the most inspiring works in this aspect for considering DRL framework for intelligent robot control are being done in Pieter Abbeel’s group https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/ for applying AI, specifically deep learning and more specifically deep RL or DRL to the robots and making them learn.\nThe very important point on his page https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/ is offering two new courses: Advanced Robotics https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/cs287-fa15/ DRL http://rll.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/ If check out this link https://www.youtube.com/user/pabbeel/feed, you will see the latest demonstration of DRL applied to robotics.\nAlso you can listen to his talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evq4p1zhS7Q which I found the latest and the most important one in terms of addressing the issues and my comments mentioned above along with his new podcast named Robot Brains. Another industrial application of DRL is presented in this work .\nDRL introduces a cognitive control architecture for robotics (or intelligent robot control or cognitive robot control) used for laser welding as a complex industrial process.\nThis is a perfect example of applying DRL to an industrial application with high importance in terms of the final accuracy, robustness, safety and flexibility.\nThis work  shows the earlier work in this respect done around 2014 and almost at the beginning of DRL big boost .\nThis is the earlier work  and as an incremental work , it is explaining the continuation of this work  in this aspect. There is a very similar work  with the same application and also using ANN with BP (Back Propagation)  for learning and optimized using GA (Genetic Algorithm).\nThis work is basically proposing a DL (Deep Learning) approach using PCA for feature extraction layer as an unsupervised learner and ANN using BP optimized with GA for the classification layer (function approximation) as supervised learning. This work  is also an interesting application of DRL framework to energy domain in smart grids for complex decision making processes. Although this work is applied to a dataset, but still the application domain is very new and problematic.\nTwo RL approaches have been used with deep DBN (Deep Belief Network) 4 as DL approach.\nThe very interesting point of this work is the addition transfer learning on top the DRL to transfer the learned knowledge to other tasks. This work [ref]54 is a perfect example of DRL applied to other domains such as finances.\nRNN and RL are used for DRL also they introduced RL and RNN as both being biologically inspired approaches.\nAlso the interesting aspect is that they introduce DRL as a framework, composed of DL for temporal difference learning of the market, and RL makes it possible to explore the unknown environment to collect as much reward as possible (maximized the total expected reward).\nThe proposed DRL framework in this work [ref]54 is applied and verified in both stock and commodity market. Another similar application in the residential load control is .\nThis work is proposing DRL framework for high-dimensionality problem (Big Data problem) with partial observability (occlusion or lack of data problem), also known as partially observable Markov decision processes environment (POMDP).\nCNN for learning the Q-network as DQN as DRL framework is proposed. This work  is demonstrating a very simple DRL framework for speech to action.\nIt is explained and written in a very simple language for understanding the complication of DRL.\nThis is also another general application domain of DRL such as restaurant domain applications for creating an intelligent dialogue system for interacting with customers. Yamins and DiCarlo’s work [ref]57 is published in Nature journal and it is completely discussing the strong biological foundation of DL as it is name as HCNN (Hierarchical CNN).\nIt is beautifully comparing computational and cognitive neuroscience in terms of their conclusion of visual cortex and other part of brains working the same as the recent DL approaches as computational neural networks.\nIt introduces DRL as goal-driven deep networks and back it up biologically throughout the whole paper very strongly. This work [ref]58 is a great work dealing with the precision of DRL framework applied to the robot manipulation task.\nProf. Levine is an active researcher in this field in terms of application of DRL frameworks to Robotics and other possible domains as shown below: http://iplab.dmi.unict.it/icvss2016/Abstracts/Levine.pdf:\nDeep Learning for Robotics– Learning Actionable Representations;\n https://archive.org/details/Redwood_Center_2015_11_04_Sergey_Levine_and_Chelsea_Finn\n: This is an important lecture presenting his work.; https://sites.google.com/site/brainrobotdata/home\n: this is the link the Google Brain Robotic Grasping project in which he is the leading researcher;\nThis project is very important in a sense that it shows how much Google is investing in such DRL frameworks at the moment specifically for robotic domain applications. https://research.googleblog.com/2016/03/deep-learning-for-robots-learning-from.html: this shows the demonstration of robotic grasping and how they are practicing.\nIt is literally like an elementary school of robots learning how to grasp and manipulate the objects. The latest publication related to the grasping school for robots is shown in these two works  and .\nThis literally discusses the large-scale application of DRL framework for schooling the robots how to do an accurate, complex, robust grasping and manipulation of the objects using ONLY one RGB-D camera. This work of his  is a very important work in terms of end-to-end training for a very deep network for control policy and its application to many manipulation tasks.\nThe DRL framework in this work is an end-to-end network using vision and generating the torques command for different complex task in manipulation domain. Based on the above links, we can simply conclude that Google and Nvidia are heavily investing into the idea of DRL framework, specifically in robotics domain and graphical domain for intelligence robot control using real and simulated environments.\n\nReference markers found: [54]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]54: deep DBN (Deep Belief Network) 4 as DL approach.\nThe very interesting point of this work is the addition transfer learning on top the DRL to transfer the learned knowledge to other tasks. This work [ref]54 is a perfect example of DRL applied to other domains such as finances.\nRNN and RL are used for DRL also they introduced RL and RNN as both being biologically inspired approaches.\nAlso the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
