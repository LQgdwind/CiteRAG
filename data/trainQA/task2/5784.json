Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

However, very few studies have evaluated the performance of SOT-MRAM as on-chip memory in system-level for AI accelerators.  and  demonstrated the performance improvement of SOT-MRAM as L2 data cache compared to SRAM L2 cache on MiBench, SPEC2000 and SPEC2006 benchmarks. SOT-MRAMs have also been explored in the context of DL accelerators as a promising technology for In-Memory Computing (IMC) or Computing-In Memory (CIM)  [ref]42 [ref]43. IMC/CIM over conventional AI accelerator has pros and cons, and the detailed comparison between these two domains is outside the scope of this work. Our work, where we use SOT-MRAM as the cache storage element, differs from crossbar-based in-memory computing.\nWhile the scope of SOT-MRAM has been explored both as regular CPU cache and IMC for DL accelerator to some extent, to the best of our knowledge, unlike IMC,\nthis is the first work that presents a comprehensive analysis of SOT-MRAM as on-chip memory for application in AI/DL accelerators.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: SOT-MRAMs have been widely studied as the next generation of STT-MRAM to leverage all benefits of MRAMs as embedded memory [ref]17.
