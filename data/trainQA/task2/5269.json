      "content": "Paper Title: Solving Modal Logic Problems by Translation to Higher-order Logic\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe embedding of non-constant domain FOML is, in its current form, incomplete with respect to\nQMLTP semantics.\nThis is because properties of the eiwœÑsuperscripteiwùúè\\text{eiw}^{\\tau} predicate are underspecified, even\nif the additional axioms described in  are included .\nWhile adding the further required additional axioms constraining eiwœÑsuperscripteiwùúè\\text{eiw}^{\\tau} can remedy the\nincompleteness, it is also likely that the resulting HOL problems are harder to solve.\nAn empirical in-depth evaluation of different embeddings for non-constant domain FOML is further\nwork.\nAn idea to remedy a possible degradation in reasoning performance with complete (but complicated)\nembeddings might be using a portfolio approach, in which different embeddings are run sequentially\nor in parallel.\nA complete embedding for non-constant domain FOML is particularly interesting for model finding\n(as typically used for disproving) in this context.\nPrevious experiments  already provide evidence that THF model finders have strong\nperformance on translated problems. As noted in a footnote in Section¬†0.3, the development of TPTP\nWorld standards for writing ATP solutions beyond common derivations (e.g., CNF refutations) and\nmodels (e.g., finite models) is still necessary.\nIn the context of the embedding approach, a particular issue is converting the THF proofs\nback to meaningful proofs in the original non-classical logic.\nIndeed, this is a common problem for ATP systems that translate proof obligations to\nanother logic, e.g., provers that translate to propositional logic and rely on a SAT solver\nto confirm provability -- an example is the Satallax system for higher-order logic ,\nwhich employs the MiniSat system .\nIf Satallax were to be used as the backend ATP system in the embedding approach there would\nbe two levels of proof to invert. The TPTP problem library v9.0.0 will include modal logic problems.\nIt is expected to be released in the first half of 2024.\nCollecting modal logic problems for the TPTP is work for the immediate future.\nIn parallel, the tool chains that support use of these problems will be refined and made easily\naccessible.\nIn particular, the TPTP4X utility  will be extended to output formats for existing\nnon-classical ATP systems, to provide those systems with a bridge to the TPTP problems until they\nadopt the TPTP language natively.\nContemporary systems to bridge to include, e.g., KSP¬† ,\nnanoCoP 2.0 , MleanCoP , MetTeL2 [ref]52, LoTREC ,\nand MSPASS . Building general support for non-classical logics in the TPTP World is current and ongoing work.\nWhile many decisions have been finalized, it is an ongoing effort to ensure that the language for\nnon-classical formulae, and the supporting tools, will gain approval and adoption in the\nnon-classical automated reasoning community.\nTo that end, stakeholders are encouraged to provide constructive feedback now, before it becomes\ntoo hard to make further changes.\n\nReference markers found: [52]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]52: to provide those systems with a bridge to the TPTP problems until they\nadopt the TPTP language natively.\nContemporary systems to bridge to include, e.g., KSP¬† ,\nnanoCoP 2.0 , MleanCoP , MetTeL2 [ref]52, LoTREC ,\nand MSPASS .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
