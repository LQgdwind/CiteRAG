      "content": "Paper Title: Stochastic Collapse: How Gradient Noise Attracts SGD Dynamics Towards Simpler Subnetworks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo study the dynamics of SGD we will approximate555As discussed in Li et al. [ref]39, Eq. 3 is an order 1 weak approximation of Eq. 2. its trajectory with a stochastic differential equation (SDE), a common analysis technique applied in many works [ref]40 [ref]39    [ref]5.\nSGD can be interpreted as full-batch gradient descent plus a per-step gradient noise term introduced by the random minibatch.\nLet ξi​(θ)subscript𝜉𝑖𝜃\\xi_{i}(\\theta) represent the per-sample gradient noise at θ𝜃\\theta. It is easy to check that 𝔼​[ξi​(θ)]=0𝔼delimited-[]subscript𝜉𝑖𝜃0\\mathbb{E}[\\xi_{i}(\\theta)]=0 for all θ𝜃\\theta.\nThis motivates studying the SDE, which we refer to as stochastic gradient flow (SGF), Here Btsubscript𝐵𝑡B_{t} denotes a standard d−limit-from𝑑d-dimensional Wiener process and Σ​(θt)=𝔼​[ξi​(θ)​ξi​(θ)⊺]Σsubscript𝜃𝑡𝔼delimited-[]subscript𝜉𝑖𝜃subscript𝜉𝑖superscript𝜃⊺\\Sigma(\\theta_{t})=\\sqrt{\\mathbb{E}[\\xi_{i}(\\theta)\\xi_{i}(\\theta)^{\\intercal}]}.\nThe drift term of this SDE is the negative full-batch gradient −∇ℒ​(θt)∇ℒsubscript𝜃𝑡-\\nabla\\mathcal{L}(\\theta_{t}), while the diffusion is determined by a spatially-dependent diffusion matrix D​(θt)=η2​β​Σ​(θt)​Σ​(θt)⊺𝐷subscript𝜃𝑡𝜂2𝛽Σsubscript𝜃𝑡Σsuperscriptsubscript𝜃𝑡⊺D(\\theta_{t})=\\frac{\\eta}{2\\beta}\\Sigma(\\theta_{t})\\Sigma(\\theta_{t})^{\\intercal}.\nAlthough this SDE cannot be interpreted as the continuous-time limit of SGD, it matches the first and second moments of the SGD process.\nSee Appendix D for further discussions on the relationship between SGD and SGF.\nAdditionally, SGF preserves all affine invariant sets of SGD: All affine invariant sets of SGD are also affine invariant sets of SGF. 666See App. C for the definition of invariant sets for continuous processes and the formal statement. Like deterministic dynamical processes, the stochastic processes of SGF can be attracted toward the invariant sets.\nTo describe this attraction, we adopt the concept from stochastic control theory . An invariant set A⊂ℝd𝐴superscriptℝ𝑑A\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{d} of a stochastic process {θt∈ℝd:t≥0}conditional-setsubscript𝜃𝑡superscriptℝ𝑑𝑡0\\{\\theta_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}:t\\geq 0\\} is stochastically attractive777This property is called stochastic stability in . if for any ρ>0𝜌0\\rho>0 and ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0, there exists δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0 such that for any θ∈ℝd𝜃superscriptℝ𝑑\\theta\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d} with the Euclidian distance d​(θ,A)<δ𝑑𝜃𝐴𝛿d(\\theta,A)<\\delta, Intuitively, a set is stochastically attractive if there always exists a close initial condition that guarantees all future iterates remain close to the set with high probability.\nUnderstanding when the dynamics are attracted by a particular invariant set becomes fundamental for understanding the implicit bias of SGD.\nTo gain insight into this process lets consider a canonical example in one-dimension. Geometric Brownian motion.\nGeometric Brownian Motion (GBM) is a linear stochastic process given by the SDE, d​θt=μ​θt​d​t+ζ​θt​d​Bt𝑑subscript𝜃𝑡𝜇subscript𝜃𝑡𝑑𝑡𝜁subscript𝜃𝑡𝑑subscript𝐵𝑡d\\theta_{t}=\\mu\\theta_{t}dt+\\zeta\\theta_{t}dB_{t}, where μ∈ℝ𝜇ℝ\\mu\\in\\mathbb{R} represents the drift rate, ζ∈ℝ𝜁ℝ\\zeta\\in\\mathbb{R} the volatility rate. Denote θ0∈ℝsubscript𝜃0ℝ\\theta_{0}\\in\\mathbb{R} as the initialization.\nThe set A={0}𝐴0A=\\{0\\} is an invariant set of GBM, which, depending on the relationship between μ𝜇\\mu and ζ𝜁\\zeta, can be stochastically attractive.\nAs the trajectory of GBM approaches the invariant set, its movement diminishes.\nTo account for this effect, we take the logarithmic transformation zt=log⁡(θt)subscript𝑧𝑡subscript𝜃𝑡z_{t}=\\log(\\theta_{t}), where we assume without loss of generality that θ0>0subscript𝜃00\\theta_{0}>0.\nThe stochastic process ztsubscript𝑧𝑡z_{t} obeys the transformed SDE,\nd​zt=(μ−ζ2/2)​d​t+ζ​d​Bt𝑑subscript𝑧𝑡𝜇superscript𝜁22𝑑𝑡𝜁𝑑subscript𝐵𝑡dz_{t}=\\left(\\mu-\\zeta^{2}/2\\right)dt+\\zeta dB_{t},\nwhich has an additional drift term −ζ2/2superscript𝜁22-\\zeta^{2}/2 from Itô’s lemma that attracts the process towards the invariant set.\nThe total drift is now determined by a competition between the original drift rate μ𝜇\\mu and the additional attractive force driven by the diffusion.\nThis competition controls whether the invariant set A={0}𝐴0A=\\{0\\} of GBM is stochastically attractive (i.e. when μ<ζ2/2𝜇superscript𝜁22\\mu<\\zeta^{2}/2 the invariant set is attractive). Stochastic attraction in one-dimension.\nStochastic attractivity is a local property and thus we might expect SGF to act like GBM around an invariant set, enabling us to derive broader conclusions about stochastic attraction.\nIf we consider SGF with a smooth loss and diffusion in one-dimension, where without loss of generality we assume A={0}𝐴0A=\\{0\\} is an invariant set, we can Taylor expand the gradient and the diffusion around the set, yielding geometric Brownian motion near the set: Here we use ℒ′​(0)=D​(0)=D′​(0)=0superscriptℒ′0𝐷0superscript𝐷′00\\mathcal{L}^{\\prime}(0)=D(0)=D^{\\prime}(0)=0, which is a consequence of {0}0\\{0\\} being an invariant set.\nFrom Eq. 5 we can formulate a necessary/sufficient condition for stochastic attractivity in one-dimension: Let A={0}∈ℝ𝐴0ℝA=\\{0\\}\\in\\mathbb{R} be an invariant set of {θt∈ℝ:t≥0}conditional-setsubscript𝜃𝑡ℝ𝑡0\\{\\theta_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}:t\\geq 0\\} obeying Eq. 3.\nSuppose ℒ′​(θ):ℝ→ℝ,D​(θ):ℝ→ℝ:superscriptℒ′𝜃→ℝℝ𝐷𝜃:→ℝℝ\\mathcal{L}^{\\prime}(\\theta):\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R},D(\\theta):\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R} are C2superscript𝐶2C^{2} functions such that D′′​(0)>0superscript𝐷′′00D^{\\prime\\prime}(0)>0. Define rate of attractivity α=ℒ′′​(0)+12​D′′​(0)𝛼superscriptℒ′′012superscript𝐷′′0\\alpha=\\mathcal{L}^{\\prime\\prime}(0)+\\frac{1}{2}D^{\\prime\\prime}(0). A𝐴A is stochastically attractive if α>0𝛼0\\alpha>0, while it is not stochastically attractive if α<0𝛼0\\alpha<0. 888When α=0𝛼0\\alpha=0, higher-order derivatives of the loss and diffusion determine the attractivity of A𝐴A. One of the most surprising implications of Theorem 4.1 is that SGF can potentially converge to a saddle-point or local maxima of a loss landscape, an observation previously made by Ziyin et al. .\nTo see this, recall that D​(θ)≥0𝐷𝜃0D(\\theta)\\geq 0 by definition, and D​(0)=0𝐷00D(0)=0 as {0}0\\{0\\} is an invariant set. As a result, D′​(0)=0superscript𝐷′00D^{\\prime}(0)=0 and D′′​(0)≥0superscript𝐷′′00D^{\\prime\\prime}(0)\\geq 0 by the continuity assumption of D𝐷D.\nThe collapsing condition, therefore crucially depends on the curvature of the loss function ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} at θ=0𝜃0\\theta=0.\nWhen D′′​(0)superscript𝐷′′0D^{\\prime\\prime}(0) is strictly positive, the collapsing condition can still be satisfied with negative curvature provided that ℒ′′​(0)>−12​D′′​(0)superscriptℒ′′012superscript𝐷′′0\\mathcal{L}^{\\prime\\prime}(0)>-\\frac{1}{2}D^{\\prime\\prime}(0).\nGiven that D𝐷D is proportional to η/β𝜂𝛽\\eta/\\beta, the learning rate to batch size ratio determines the maximum attainable steepness for an invariant set to be attractive. An illustrative example.\nConsider SGF in a double-well potential ℒ​(θ)=14​(θ2−μ)2ℒ𝜃14superscriptsuperscript𝜃2𝜇2\\mathcal{L}(\\theta)=\\frac{1}{4}(\\theta^{2}-\\mu)^{2} with multiplicative diffusion999Here we build on a substantial literature, originating from the seminal work by Kramers , that investigates the escape rate between minima of a particle in a double-well potential with constant diffusion ., such that the dynamics are d​θt=−(θt3−μ​θt)​d​t+ζ​θt​d​Bt𝑑subscript𝜃𝑡superscriptsubscript𝜃𝑡3𝜇subscript𝜃𝑡𝑑𝑡𝜁subscript𝜃𝑡𝑑subscript𝐵𝑡d\\theta_{t}=-(\\theta_{t}^{3}-\\mu\\theta_{t})dt+\\zeta\\theta_{t}dB_{t} where μ,ζ>0𝜇𝜁0\\mu,\\zeta>0.\nThe minima of the potential are located at θ=±μ𝜃plus-or-minus𝜇\\theta=\\pm\\sqrt{\\mu}, while\nθ=0𝜃0\\theta=0 is a local maximum and forms an invariant set.\nThis example is special as the dynamics have an analytical steady-state distribution ps​s​(θ)subscript𝑝𝑠𝑠𝜃p_{ss}(\\theta), given any initialization.\nThus, determining the stochastic attractivity of {0}0\\{0\\} can be achieved by examining the steady-state distribution.\nAs in GBM, we assume, without loss of generality, that θ0>0subscript𝜃00\\theta_{0}>0 and consider the logarithm process zt=log⁡(θt)subscript𝑧𝑡subscript𝜃𝑡z_{t}=\\log(\\theta_{t}).\nIn this new coordinate, the noise term is constant, which allows us to determine the steady-state distribution.\nTransforming back to the original coordinate, we find that ps​s​(θ)subscript𝑝𝑠𝑠𝜃p_{ss}(\\theta) is given by a Gibbs distribution ps​s​(θ)∝e−κ​Ψ​(θ)proportional-tosubscript𝑝𝑠𝑠𝜃superscript𝑒𝜅Ψ𝜃p_{ss}(\\theta)\\propto e^{-\\kappa\\Psi(\\theta)} for a modified potential101010The interpretation of a modified potential determined by the gradient noise that drives the learning dynamics was explored in  and [ref]5. Stochastic collapse is when the partition function for this modified loss diverges. Ψ​(θ)=θ2/2−(2​μ/ζ2−2)​log⁡(θ)Ψ𝜃superscript𝜃222𝜇superscript𝜁22𝜃\\Psi(\\theta)=\\theta^{2}/2-(2\\mu/\\zeta^{2}-2)\\log(\\theta) with constant κ=2/ζ2𝜅2superscript𝜁2\\kappa=2/\\zeta^{2} and partition function Z=∫−∞∞e−κ​Ψ​(θ)​𝑑θ𝑍superscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝑒𝜅Ψ𝜃differential-d𝜃Z=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}e^{-\\kappa\\Psi(\\theta)}d\\theta.\nWhen μ≤ζ2/2𝜇superscript𝜁22\\mu\\leq\\zeta^{2}/2, the partition function diverges and ps​s​(θ)subscript𝑝𝑠𝑠𝜃p_{ss}(\\theta) collapses to a Dirac delta distribution at θ=0𝜃0\\theta=0.\nThis transition agrees with the collapsing condition from Theorem 4.1. Stochastic attraction in high-dimensions.\nTo extend the collapsing condition derived in Theorem 4.1 to high-dimensional cases, a natural idea would be to consider all one-dimensional slices of parameter space orthogonal to the invariant set.\nHowever, one challenge is that some of these slices might satisfy the collapsing condition while others do not.\nThis can result in complex dynamics near the boundary of the invariant set making it difficult to derive a necessary and sufficient condition for attractivity in high-dimensions.\nNonetheless, we can derive a sufficient condition: Let A⊂ℝd𝐴superscriptℝ𝑑A\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{d} be a dAsubscript𝑑𝐴d_{A}-dimensional affine subset, and\na stochastic process {θt∈ℝd:t≥0}conditional-setsubscript𝜃𝑡superscriptℝ𝑑𝑡0\\{\\theta_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}:t\\geq 0\\} obey Eq. 3 in Acsubscript𝐴𝑐A_{c}, open c𝑐c-neighborhood of A𝐴A with some c>0𝑐0c>0.\nSuppose ℒ:Ac→ℝ:ℒ→subscript𝐴𝑐ℝ\\mathcal{L}:A_{c}\\to\\mathbb{R} is a C3superscript𝐶3C^{3}-function whose first and second-order derivatives are L𝐿L-Lipschitz continuous. D:Ac→ℝd×d:𝐷→subscript𝐴𝑐superscriptℝ𝑑𝑑D:A_{c}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times d} is the diffusion matrix such that the second-order derivatives of its elements are L𝐿L-Lipschitz continuous.\nFurthermore, we assume that all the elements of D:Ac→ℝd×d:𝐷→subscript𝐴𝑐superscriptℝ𝑑𝑑\\sqrt{D}:A_{c}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times d} are L𝐿L-Lipschitz continous.\nLet D⟂=P⟂​D​P⟂subscript𝐷perpendicular-tosubscript𝑃perpendicular-to𝐷subscript𝑃perpendicular-toD_{\\perp}=P_{\\perp}DP_{\\perp} where P⟂:ℝd→ℝd:subscript𝑃perpendicular-to→superscriptℝ𝑑superscriptℝ𝑑P_{\\perp}:\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{d} projects to the normal space of A𝐴A.\nIf there exists δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0 such that ∇n^2n^⊺​D​n^⊺>δsubscriptsuperscript∇2^𝑛superscript^𝑛⊺𝐷superscript^𝑛⊺𝛿\\nabla^{2}_{\\hat{n}}\\hat{n}^{\\intercal}D\\hat{n}^{\\intercal}>\\delta and for any unit normal vector n^∈ℝd^𝑛superscriptℝ𝑑\\hat{n}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d} perpendicular to A𝐴A and θ∈A𝜃𝐴\\theta\\in A, then A𝐴A is stochastically attractive. To prove Theorem 4.2 (see App. E), we consider a family of distance measures between θtsubscript𝜃𝑡\\theta_{t} and the invariant set A𝐴A.\nEq. 6 ensures that one of the distance measures is super-martingale in a neighborhood of the invariant set, allowing us to apply a version of Doob’s maximal inequality (Lemma 1 in ).\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: To study the dynamics of SGD we will approximate555As discussed in Li et al.
