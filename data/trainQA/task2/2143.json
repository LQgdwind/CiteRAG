      "content": "Paper Title: NAAQA: A Neural Architecture for Acoustic Question Answering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nQuestion answering (QA) tasks are examples of constrained and limited scenarios for research in reasoning. The agent’s task in QA is to answer questions based on context. Text-based QA uses text corpora as context      [ref]6. In visual question answering (VQA) the questions are related to a scene depicted in still images    0 1 2 3. Finally, video question answering attempts to use both the visual and acoustic information in video material as context 4 5 6 7 8 9. The use of the acoustic channel is usually limited to linguistic information that is expressed in text form, either with manual transcriptions (e.g. subtitles) or by automatic speech recognition 0. In most studies, reasoning is supported by spatial and symbolic representations in the visual domain 1 2. However, reasoning and logic relationships can also be studied via representations of sounds 3. Including the auditory modality in studies on reasoning is of particular interest for research in artificial intelligence 4, but also has implications in real world applications 5.\nIn 6, audio was used in combination with video and depth information to recognize human activities. It was shown that sound can be more discriminative than the corresponding visual cues. As an example, imagine using an espresso machine. Besides possibly a display, all information about the different phases of producing coffee, from grinding the beans, to pressing the powder into the holder and brewing the coffee with high pressure hot water are conveyed by the sounds.\nDetection of abnormalities in machinery where the moving parts are hidden, or the detection of threatening or hazardous events are other examples of the importance of the audio information for cognitive systems. The audio modality provides important information that can be leveraged in the context of QA reasoning. Audio allows QA systems to answer relevant questions more accurately, or even to answer questions that are not approachable from the visual domain alone.\nIn 7, we introduced the AQA task and proposed a new database (CLEAR) to promote research in AQA. The agent’s goal, in the proposed task, was to answer questions related to acoustic scenes composed by a sequence of elementary musical sounds. The questions foster reasoning on the properties of the elementary sounds and their relative and absolute position in the scene.\nTo build CLEAR, we were inspired by the work of Johnson et al.  for VQA. Similarly, we tested an architecture built for VQA and based on FiLM layers 8 on the newly proposed AQA task.\n9 9 later proposed to extend the questions to more acoustically realistic situations by developing a new database called DAQA. To evaluate the results, they proposed the MALiMo network which relies on several FiLM layers. The works cited above use neural network architectures that are largely inspired by image processing research.\nHowever, the structure of acoustic data is fundamentally different from that of visual data. This is illustrated for example in 0 where two standard data sets in computer vision (MNIST) and speech technology (Google Speech Commands) are compared via T-SNE 1.\nA legitimate question is whether it is possible to obtain better results (in terms of accuracy and network complexity) by adapting the first layers of the architectures to take into account intrinsic characteristics of acoustic signals.\nEven within the AQA domain, the properties of acoustic data may vary significantly depending on the nature of the auditory scenes (e.g. CLEAR vs DAQA). It is, therefore interesting to evaluate the impact of the dataset on system performance. To answer the above questions, we present a study that evaluates the impact of audio pre-processing, of acoustic feature extraction and of dataset characteristics on the performance neural architectures for AQA.\nWhen considering performance, we focus both on accuracy and complexity of the models.\nWe provide a detailed analysis of our results based on question type to improve interpretability.\nThe main contributions can be summarized as follows: We introduce CLEAR2 a more challenging version of the CLEAR dataset, which comprises scenes of variable duration and different elementary sounds for the training and test sets. We propose a highly optimized FiLM-based architecture (NAAQA) inspired by VQA tasks containing new feature extraction modules that are tailored to acoustic inputs. We study the effect of time and frequency coordinate maps for acoustic data at different levels in the architecture. We evaluate the generality of the methods by testing NAAQA on a regenerated a version of the DAQA dataset (DAQA′) and by adding a MALiMo module (from 9) into our NAAQA architecture. We provide a detailed analysis of our experimental results that helps interpretability of the model.\n On the CLEAR2 dataset NAAQA outperforms the VQA baseline (which is 4 times more complex in terms of number of parameters) by 17.2 percent points in the accuracy score. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reports on recent related work, Section 3 describes both our CLEAR2 dataset and the DAQA′ dataset, Section 4 presents the QA models we have tested, Section 5 gives details on the experimental settings, Section 6 presents and discusses the results and, finally, Section 7 concludes the paper. Some extra information is reported in the supplementary material.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: tasks are examples of constrained and limited scenarios for research in reasoning.
