      "content": "Paper Title: TEA: Temporal Excitation and Aggregation for Action Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAction recognition is a fundamental problem in video-based tasks. It becomes increasingly demanding in video-based applications, such as intelligent surveillance, autonomous driving, personal recommendation, and entertainment .\nThough visual appearances (and its context) is important for action recognition, it is rather important to model the temporal structure. Temporal modeling normally presents (or is considered) at different scales: 1) short-range motion between adjacent frames and 2) long-range temporal aggregation at large scales. There are lines of works considering one or both of those aspects, especially in the current era of deep CNNs  3           9   6 2. Nevertheless, they still leave some gaps, and the problem is far from being solved, i.e., it remains unclear how to model the temporal structure with significant variations and complexities effectively and efficiently. For short-range motion encoding, most of the existing methods 3 [ref]44 extract hand-crafted optical flow  first, which is then fed into a 2D CNN-based two-stream framework for action recognition. Such a two-stream architecture processes RGB images and optical flow in each stream separately. The computation of optical flow is time-consuming and storage demanding. In particular, the learning of spatial and temporal features is isolated, and the fusion is performed only at the late layers. To address these issues, we propose a motion excitation (ME) module. Instead of adopting the pixel-level optical flow as an additional input modality and separating the training of temporal stream with the spatial stream, our module could integrate the motion modeling into the whole spatiotemporal feature learning approach. Concretely, the feature-level motion representations are firstly calculated between adjacent frames. These motion features are then utilized to produce modulation weights. Finally, the motion-sensitive information in the original features of frames can be excited with the weights. In this way, the networks are forced to discover and enhance the informative temporal features that capture differentiated information. For long-range temporal aggregation, existing methods either 1) adopt 2D CNN backbones to extract frame-wise\nfeatures and then utilize a simple temporal max/average pooling to obtain the whole video representation [ref]44 1. Such a simple summarization strategy, however, results in temporal information loss/confusion; or 2) adopt local 3D/(2+1)D convolutional operations to process local temporal window  . The long-range temporal relationship is indirectly modeled by repeatedly stacking local convolutions in deep networks. However, repeating a large number of local operations will lead to optimization difficulty 5, as the message needs to be propagated through the long path between distant frames. To tackle this problem, we introduce a multiple temporal aggregation (MTA) module. The MTA module also adopts (2+1)D convolutions, but a group of sub-convolutions replaces the 1D temporal convolution in MTA. The sub-convolutions formulate a hierarchical structure with residual connections between adjacent subsets. When the spatiotemporal features go through the module, the features realize multiple information exchanges with neighboring frames, and the equivalent temporal receptive field is thus increased multiple times to model long-range temporal dynamics. The proposed ME module and MTA module are inserted into a standard ResNet block 5 6 to build the Temporal Excitation and Aggregation (TEA) block, and the entire network is constructed by stacking multiple blocks. The obtained model is efficient: benefiting from the light-weight configurations, the FLOPs of the TEA network are controlled at a low level (only 1.06×\\times as many as 2D ResNet). The proposed model is also effective: the two components of TEA are complementary and cooperate in endowing the network with both short- and long-range temporal modeling abilities. To summarize, the main contributions of our method are three-fold: 1. The motion excitation (ME) module to integrate the short-range motion modeling with the whole spatiotemporal feature learning approach. 2. The multiple temporal aggregation (MTA) module to efficiently enlarge the temporal receptive field for long-range temporal modeling. 3. The two proposed modules are both simple, light-weight, and can be easily integrated into standard ResNet block to cooperate for effective and efficient temporal modeling.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: i.e., it remains unclear how to model the temporal structure with significant variations and complexities effectively and efficiently.
