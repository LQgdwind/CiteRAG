      "content": "Paper Title: Delving into the Estimation Shift of Batch Normalization in a Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBatch normalization (BN) suffers from small-batch-size problem, since the estimation of population statistics could be inaccurate.\nTo address this issue, a variety of batch-free normalization (BFN) are proposed [ref]1  , e.g., layer normalization (LN) [ref]1 and group normalization (GN) [ref]1. These works perform the same normalization operation for each sample during training and inference. Another way to reduce the discrepancy between training and inference is to combine the estimated population statistics with mini-batch statistics for normalization during training      .\nThese work may outperform BN trained with a small batch size, where estimation is the main issue  7, but they usually have inferior performance when the batch size is moderate. Some works focus on estimating corrected normalization statistics during inference only, either for domain adaptation , corruption robustness  [ref]31 , or small-batch-size training   . These strategies do not affect the training scheme of the model.\nLi et al.  propose adaptive batch normalization (AdaBN) for domain adaptation, where the estimation of BN statistics for the available target domain is modulated during test. This idea is further exploited to improve robustness under covariate shift of the input data with corruptions  .\nAnother line of works correct the normalization statistics for small-batch-size training by optimizing    the\nsample weight during inference, seeking for that the normalized output by population statistics are similar to those observed using mini-batch statistics during training.\nBesides, there are works considering the prediction-time batch settings  [ref]31 for deep generative model  and preventing covariate shift of the test data [ref]31, where the mini-batch statistics from the test data are used for inference. Compared to the works shown in above, our work focuses on investigating the estimation shift of BN in a network. Our observation, that the estimation shift of BN can be accumulated in a network, provides clues to explain why a network with stacked BNs has significantly degenerated performance under small-batch-size training, and why the population statistics of BN in each layer needs to be adapted if there exists covariate shift for input data during test.\nBesides, we design XBNBlock with BN and BFN mixed to block the accumulation of estimation shift of BNs. Researches have also be conducted to build a normalization module in a layer by combining different normalization strategies.\nLuo et al. propose switchable normalization (SN) 7, which switches among the different normalization methods by learning their importance weights, computed by a softmax function. This idea is further extended by introducing the sparsity constraints , whitening operation , and dynamic calculation of the importance weights . Other methods address the combination of normalization methods in specific scenarios, including image style transfer , image-to-image translation , domain generalization  and meta-learning scenarios . Different from these methods which aim to build a normalization module in a layer, our proposed XBNBlock is a building block with BN and BFN mixed in different layers. Furthermore, our observation, that a BFN can block the accumulation of estimation shift of BNs in a network, provides a new view to explain the successes of above methods combining BN with other normalization methods. Our work is closely related to IBN-Net , which carefully integrates instance normalization (IN)  and BN as building blocks, and can be wrapped into several deep networks to improve their performances.\nNote that IBN-Net carefully designs the position of an IN and its channel number, while the design of our XBNBlock is simplified. Moreover, IBN-Net is motivated by that IN can learn style-invariant features  thus benefiting generalization, while our XBNBlock is motivated by that a BFN can relieve the estimation shift of BN, thus avoiding its degenerated test performance if inaccurate estimation exists.\nHere, we highlight our observation that a BFN (e.g., IN) can block the accumulation of estimation shift of BNs also provide a reasonable explanation to the success of IBN-Net in its test performance, especially in the scenarios with distribution shift .\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: (BN) suffers from small-batch-size problem, since the estimation of population statistics could be inaccurate.\nTo address this issue, a variety of batch-free normalization (BFN) are proposed [ref]1  , e.g., layer normalization (LN) [ref]1 and group normalization (GN) [ref]1.
