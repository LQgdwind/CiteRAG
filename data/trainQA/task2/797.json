      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Structural Evolution of Small Molecules\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis stage of the framework entails using the large-scale dataset of the previous step to pretrain a model that would be a prior for initializing the agent network/policy. This pretraining step aims to enable the model to learn the SMILES syntax to attain a high rate of valid generated SMILES strings. Since the SMILES string is a sequence of characters, we represent the prior model as a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). The architecture of the generator at this stage of the workflow is depicted in Figure 3(b). The generator takes as input the output of an encoder that learns the embedding of SMILES characters, as shown in Figure 1(b). For each given SMILES string, the generator is trained to predict the next token in the sequence using the cross-entropy loss function. According to the findings of , regular RNNs cannot effectively generate sequences of a context-free language due to the lack of memory. To this end,  proposed the use of a Stack-RNN architecture, which equips the standard RNN cell with a stack unit to mitigate this problem. Since the SMILES encoding of a compound is a context-free language, we follow  to use the Stack-RNN for generating SMILES as it ensures that tasks such as noting the start and end parts of aromatic moieties, and parentheses for branches in the chemical structure are well addressed. We note that while  used a single layer Stack-RNN, we adopt a multi-layer Stack-RNN structure in our study. We reckon that the multi-layer Stack-RNN could facilitate learning better representations at multiple levels of abstraction akin to multi-layer RNNs. The stack unit enables the model to persist information across different time steps. Three differentiable operations could be performed on the stack at each time step: POP, PUSH, and NO-OP. The POP operation deletes the entry at the top of the stack, the PUSH operation updates the top of the stack with a new record, and the NO-OP operation leaves the stack unchanged for the next time step. In , the entry at the top of stack s𝑠s at time step t𝑡t is indexed as st​[ref]0subscript𝑠𝑡delimited-[]0s_{t}[ref]0 and is updated as where ht∈ℝm×1subscriptℎ𝑡superscriptℝ𝑚1h_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times 1} is the RNN hidden vector of a sequence at time step t𝑡t, D∈ℝw×m𝐷superscriptℝ𝑤𝑚D\\in\\mathbb{R}^{w\\times m}, w𝑤w is the dimension of the stack, and at∈ℝ3subscript𝑎𝑡superscriptℝ3a_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3} is a vector whose elements map to the stack control operators PUSH, POP, and NO-OP, respectively. Here, atsubscript𝑎𝑡a_{t} is computed as where A∈ℝ3×m𝐴superscriptℝ3𝑚A\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3\\times m}. Intuitively, if at​[P​U​S​H]=1subscript𝑎𝑡delimited-[]𝑃𝑈𝑆𝐻1a_{t}[PUSH]=1 then st​[ref]0subscript𝑠𝑡delimited-[]0s_{t}[ref]0 is updated with D​ht𝐷subscriptℎ𝑡Dh_{t}; if at​[P​O​P]=1subscript𝑎𝑡delimited-[]𝑃𝑂𝑃1a_{t}[POP]=1 then the top of the stack is updated with the second entry of the stack and at​[N​O−O​P]=1subscript𝑎𝑡delimited-[]𝑁𝑂𝑂𝑃1a_{t}[NO-OP]=1 leaves the stack unchanged. Regarding the remaining entries of the stack, thus indexes i>0𝑖0i>0, the update rule is Subsequently, the RNN cell’s hidden vector htsubscriptℎ𝑡h_{t} is updated as where σ​(x)=1/(1+e​x​p​(−x))𝜎𝑥11𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑥\\sigma(x)=1/(1+exp(-x)), U∈ℝm×d𝑈superscriptℝ𝑚𝑑U\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times d}, R∈ℝm×m𝑅superscriptℝ𝑚𝑚R\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times m}, P∈ℝm×w𝑃superscriptℝ𝑚𝑤P\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times w}, st−1​[ref]0∈ℝw×1subscript𝑠𝑡1delimited-[]0superscriptℝ𝑤1s_{t-1}[ref]0\\in\\mathbb{R}^{w\\times 1}, d𝑑d is the dimension of encoded representation of token xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x_{t}, and m𝑚m is dimension of the hidden state.\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: updates the top of the stack with a new record, and the NO-OP operation leaves the stack unchanged for the next time step.
