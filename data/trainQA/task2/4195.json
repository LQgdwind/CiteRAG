      "content": "Paper Title: TCJA-SNN: Temporal-Channel Joint Attention for Spiking Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe performance of two TCJA-SNN variants is compared with some SOTA models in Tab. III and Tab. IV. We train and test two variants with SpikingJelly  package based on PyTorch  framework, resulting in enhanced performance across all tasks.\nSome studies [ref]16 [ref]43 [ref]12 substitute binary spikes with floating-point spikes in whole or in part and retain the same temporal forward pipeline as SNN to obtain improved classification accuracy.\nThus, we devise two variants to validate the efficiency of TCJA-SNN by utilizing the TET loss function. On CIFAR10-DVS, we obtain 3.4% advantage over the prior method with binary spikes.\nOn N-Caltech 101, with only 14 time steps, we get a 15.7% increase over the prior best work. On DVS128, we get an accuracy of 99.0%, which is higher than TA-SNN [ref]12 using three times fewer simulation time steps. Furthermore, by using a basic 7-layer CNN on the static dataset Fashion MNIST, our method can achieve the highest classification accuracy with the fewest simulation time steps.\nOverall, with binary spikes, TCJA-SNN simulates no-more time steps while getting higher performance. Furthermore, our method can achieve higher classification accuracy by adopting the non-binary spike technique. \n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nBinary Spikes\nCIFAR10-DVS\nN-Caltech 101\nDVS128\n\nTùëáT Step\nAcc.\nTùëáT Step\nAcc.\nTùëáT Step\nAcc.\n\nSLAYER¬†NeurIPS-2018\n‚úì\n-\n-\n-\n-\n1600\n93.4\n\nHATS¬†CVPR-2018\nN/A\nN/A\n52.4\nN/A\n64.2\n-\n-\n\nDART¬†TPAMI-2019\nN/A\nN/A\n65.8\nN/A\n66.8\n-\n-\n\nNeuNorm¬†AAAI-2019\n‚úì\n230-292\n60.5\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nRollout¬†Front.
