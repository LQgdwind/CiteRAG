Our proposed WorseNet-based modules are evaluated on four popular benchmark datasets, which are MNIST , Fashion-MNIST , SVHN  and CIFAR-10 . Note that it is necessary for the oracle to manually generate the candidate label sets for these datasets, which are supposed to be used for single-classification problems. Recall that we introduce two different candidate label generation approaches, i.e., USS and FPS. For FPS, we set q∈{0.3,0.5}𝑞0.30.5q\\in\\{0.3,0.5\\} to represent different ambiguity degrees. For MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, we adopt a 3-layer MLP and a simple CNN-based network denoted as C-Net (similar to the network used in  [ref]7) as the backbones for the predictor. For SVHN and CIFAR-10, we follow most works [ref]6 [ref]31  and choose ResNet18  and VGG11  as the base models. Note that WorseNet w𝑤w follows the identical architecture to the predictor f𝑓f. Compared methods and training settings. We compare our proposed modules with ten approaches which contains seven model-driven methods: 1) Random Sampling (RS), 2) MCU, 3) MMU, 4) EU, 5) Coreset , 6) BALD [ref]7, 7) BADGE [ref]31, and three data-driven methods: 8) LL4AL [ref]6, 9) VAAL  and 10) TA-VAAL . For the seven model-driven methods, we adopt the Adam optimizer  with a learning rate of 0.0010.0010.001 to train f𝑓f. We take a mini-batch size of 256256256 images and train all seven methods for 200200200 epochs. For three data-driven methods, we strictly follow the reported training hyper-parameters in their papers [ref]6  . Besides, we simply adopt ResNet18 as the backbone for f𝑓f and w𝑤w in these three data-driven methods. For the ALPL setting, we construct an initial labeled set 𝕃𝕃{\\mathbb{L}} with the size b0=20subscript𝑏020b_{0}=20, and acquire b=100𝑏100b=100 instances (b=1000𝑏1000b=1000 for SVHN and CIFAR-10) from 𝕌𝕌{\\mathbb{U}} in each query round, following prior works  [ref]7 . We repeat the query process 101010 times such that the overall budget size B=1000𝐵1000B=1000 (B=10000𝐵10000B=10000 for SVHN and CIFAR-10). Note that we directly adopt RC loss on these ten methods to build the baselines (see Section 4 for more details). To guarantee comparison fairness, we repeatedly conduct all experiments 5 times and report the average test accuracy using the model achieving the maximum performance on a validation set, which is constructed by randomly selecting 100100100 instances from the training datasets. Here the validation performance of w𝑤w is measured by Eq. (9). All the implemented methods are trained on 2 RTX3090 GPUs each with 24 GB memory. Experiment results. As shown in Table 1, following the default settings, our proposed WorseNet shows its effectiveness and superiority in addressing ALPL on these four benchmark datasets. Firstly, WP can bring a constant gain to the classifier regardless of the backbone and the adopted AL methods. Moreover, the improvement by WP shall be witnessed in both USS and FPS cases, validating that our WP does not rely on any data generation assumption. Our approach could also deliver promising performance with full access to the datasets, which means that WP is also an effective way to address PLL. Particularly, we would like to highlight\na counter-intuitive phenomenon that RS may perform better than some methods in some cases. RS (70.73%) performs far better than EU (64.58%) and Coreset (53.17%) in Fashion-MNIST. This counter-intuitive could also be seen in  [ref]6  [ref]31. This phenomenon can be attributed to the instability caused by a relatively small number of labeled samples. For three WS-based selectors, i.e., WS-MMU, WS-MCU, and WS-EU, they are found to better elate the performance of the classifier in ALPL when compared to the original version. Additionally, these three improved uncertainty-based approaches show competitive performance compared with the other ten AL methods, and such performance could be further improved by reusing WP to reach state-of-the-art performance in ALPL. As shown in Figure 3, we select 6 classes and visualize the selected samples of EU and WS-EU. Compared to EU, our WS module could enforce the selector to select more representative and diverse samples. Specifically, our proposed selectors are able to select more samples (marked by the red circle) that nearby the class boundary. Besides, more samples near the center of the class cluster are also selected to ensure the accuracy (marked by the blue circle), illustrating that our WS could help ALPL to select more representative samples with partial labels. Overall, the experimental results on four benchmark datasets reasonably verify the generalization\nand effectiveness in addressing ALPL.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: to represent different ambiguity degrees.
