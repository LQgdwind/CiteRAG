      "content": "Paper Title: Topological Optimal Transport for Geometric Cycle Matching\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe past few years have seen increasing efforts in addressing the problem of matching topological features across different systems, and many solutions have been proposed, including some inspired by techniques in optimal transport  [ref]27 . Perhaps, the simplest approach is to straightforwardly use the matching induced by Wasserstein-like distances on persistence diagrams, such as the bottleneck distance and the dW,pPDsuperscriptsubscript𝑑W𝑝PDd_{\\mathrm{W},p}^{\\mathrm{PD}} Wasserstein distances . More nuanced solutions rely on statistical considerations  8 , on the existence of maps between the initial data  , or, when such a map is unknown, on leveraging the algebraic topology of the PH construction to define a notion of dissimilarity between the underlying complexes . In our case, the topological feature coupling πesuperscript𝜋𝑒\\pi^{e} yields a matching between homology classes which is informed by proximity of points creating the corresponding geometric cycles. Figure 6 shows comparisons between the Wasserstein matching on persistence diagrams (PD Wasserstein) and joint geometric-topological matching (TpOT). Similarly to Figure 4, the first examples concerns mapping classes between point clouds X𝑋X (Figure 6(A)) and X′superscript𝑋′X^{\\prime} (Figure 6(B)) having almost identical persistence diagrams (Figure 6(C)). In this case, joint matching of geometric and topological features by TpOT allows us to preserve spatial proximity between representative cycles, see Figure 6(C). This can be particularly important when homology classes in a persistence diagram are indistinguishable, as shown in the example in Figure 6(D-G). Here the TpOT matching (Figure 6(G)) correctly maintains spatial proximity between representative cycles, in contrast with PD Wasserstein matching (Figure 6(F)) which is essentially random. Finally, we consider the problem of tracking topological features as a system evolves over time. Figure 7(A) shows a piecewise linear spatial curve forming a trefoil knot as it undergoes thermal relaxation. The simulation consists of 202020 steps and it was generated using KnotPlot . At each time tisubscript𝑡𝑖t_{i}, the knot takes a spatial configuration Cisubscript𝐶𝑖C_{i}, that can be represented as the point cloud Xisubscript𝑋𝑖X_{i} of its vertices. At each step, we interpret Xisubscript𝑋𝑖X_{i} as the topological network obtained by computing 1-dimensional PH and PH-hypergraph. We can then match homology classes between consecutive persistence diagrams Di,Di+1subscript𝐷𝑖subscript𝐷𝑖1D_{i},D_{i+1} using PD Wasserstein distance and dTpOTsubscript𝑑TpOTd_{\\rm TpOT}, respectively, see Figure 7(B). The TpOT matching significantly improves the accuracy of generator matchings compared to PD Wasserstein, as shown in Figure 7(B). Since the ground truth correspondence of points in the curve is known, in Figure 7(C) we show the correlation between generators and their images under the PD Wasserstein as well as TpOT matchings. We find that the TpOT matching provides a clear improvement over the PD Wasserstein matchings, which appears to be close to random. Consider two point clouds, and the convex G​W𝐺𝑊GW geodesic connecting them (see ). Consider now the Vietoris-Rips filtration along the geodesic path. A natural question is whether the path induced by the persistent diagrams follows a convex geodesic. A counterexample to this question is given by Figure 3, as the GW-mapping between points suggests that the GW-geodesic “breaks” the loops, and thus, the four persistent homology classes. This can be verified by computing the path of Vietoris-Rips PDs obtained by inputting the various interpolation metrics. The same question applies for T​p​O​T𝑇𝑝𝑂𝑇TpOT-geodesics. In this context, the answer depends on whether the G​W𝐺𝑊GW-term contributes to cycle matching or not. When it doesn’t (e.g. Figure 3(E)), persistent diagrams computed from Vietoris-Rips filtration along the TpOT-geodesic do indeed follow the convex-geodesic in the persistent diagram space. When GW contributes (e.g. Figure 4 and Figure 6), then the persistent diagram path is non geodesic.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: efforts in addressing the problem of matching topological features across different systems, and many solutions have been proposed, including some inspired by techniques in optimal transport  [ref]27 .
