However, in our setting, we work with a slightly different σ𝜎\\sigma-algebra to account for the feedback graph, and explicitly leverage the bound on the number of possible successor states S^^𝑆\\widehat{S}. We detail this deviation from the previous works for events 𝖤Rsuperscript𝖤R\\mathsf{E}^{\\text{R}} and 𝖤REsuperscript𝖤RE\\mathsf{E}^{\\mathrm{RE}} in Lemma 10 (below), and the rest follow analogously. Further, we bound the probability of occurrence of the event 𝖤Nsuperscript𝖤N\\mathsf{E}^{\\mathrm{N}} in Lemma 12. The proof significantly deviates from the prior work, as in our case, the number of observations for any state-action pair is different from the number of visits of the agent to that pair due to the feedback graph. Finally, the bound for the probability of occurrence of 𝖤Varsuperscript𝖤Var\\mathsf{E}^{\\text{Var}} is given in Lemma 11. Taking a union bound for all the above failure probabilities, and setting δ′=δ|𝒳|​(7+4​S^+5​H)superscript𝛿′𝛿𝒳74^𝑆5𝐻\\delta^{\\prime}=\\frac{\\delta}{|\\mathcal{X}|(7+4\\widehat{S}+5H)}, we get a bound on the probability of occurrence of the event ℙ​(E)ℙ𝐸\\mathbb{P}(E).\n∎ Let the data be generated by sampling with a feedback graph from an MDP with arbitrary, possibly history-dependent policies.

More formally, let k=⌈jH⌉𝑘𝑗𝐻k=\\lceil\\frac{j}{H}\\rceil and h=jmodHℎmodulo𝑗𝐻h=j\\mod H be the episode and the time index when the algorithm plays the jthsuperscript𝑗thj^{\\text{th}} action. Then everything in episodes 1​…​k−11…𝑘11\\dots k-1 is ℱjsubscriptℱ𝑗\\mathcal{F}_{j}-measurable as well as everything up to sk,h,ak,hsubscript𝑠𝑘ℎsubscript𝑎𝑘ℎs_{k,h},a_{k,h} and 𝒪¯k,h​(G)subscript¯𝒪𝑘ℎ𝐺\\bar{\\mathcal{O}}_{k,h}(G) (which x𝑥x are observed at k,h𝑘ℎk,h) but not 𝒪k,h​(G)subscript𝒪𝑘ℎ𝐺\\mathcal{O}_{k,h}(G) (the actual observations) or sk,h+1subscript𝑠𝑘ℎ1s_{k,h+1}. We will use a filtration with respect to the stopping times of when a specific state-action pair is observed. To that end,\nconsider a fixed x∈𝒳𝑥𝒳x\\in\\mathcal{X}. Define to be the index j𝑗j of ℱjsubscriptℱ𝑗\\mathcal{F}_{j} where x𝑥x\nwas observed for the ithsuperscript𝑖thi^{\\text{th}} time. Note that, for all i𝑖i, τisubscript𝜏𝑖\\tau_{i} are\nstopping times with respect to (ℱj)j=1∞superscriptsubscriptsubscriptℱ𝑗𝑗1(\\mathcal{F}_{j})_{j=1}^{\\infty}.

Intuitively, it captures all information available at time τisubscript𝜏𝑖\\tau_{i} [29, Sec. 3.3]. Since τi≤τi+1subscript𝜏𝑖subscript𝜏𝑖1\\tau_{i}\\leq\\tau_{i+1},\nthe sequence (ℱτi)i=1∞superscriptsubscriptsubscriptℱsubscript𝜏𝑖𝑖1(\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_{i}})_{i=1}^{\\infty} is a filtration as well. Consider a fixed x∈𝒳𝑥𝒳x\\in\\mathcal{X} and number of observations n𝑛n. Define Xi=𝟏​{τi<∞}​(ri−ϵ¯i​(x)−r​(x))subscript𝑋𝑖1subscript𝜏𝑖subscript𝑟𝑖subscript¯italic-ϵ𝑖𝑥𝑟𝑥X_{i}={\\bf 1}\\{\\tau_{i}<\\infty\\}(r_{i}-\\bar{\\epsilon}_{i}(x)-r(x)) where risubscript𝑟𝑖r_{i} is the ithsuperscript𝑖thi^{\\text{th}} observation with bias ϵ¯i​(x)subscript¯italic-ϵ𝑖𝑥\\bar{\\epsilon}_{i}(x) of x𝑥x. By construction (Xi)i=1∞superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑋𝑖𝑖1(X_{i})_{i=1}^{\\infty} is adapted to the filtration (ℱix)i=1∞superscriptsubscriptsubscriptsuperscriptℱ𝑥𝑖𝑖1(\\mathcal{F}^{x}_{i})_{i=1}^{\\infty}. Further, recall that r​(x)=𝔼​[r|(s,a)=x]−ϵ¯i𝑟𝑥𝔼delimited-[]conditional𝑟𝑠𝑎𝑥subscript¯italic-ϵ𝑖r(x)=\\mathbb{E}[r|(s,a)=x]-\\bar{\\epsilon}_{i} is the immediate expected reward in x𝑥x and hence, we one can show that (Xi)i=1∞superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑋𝑖𝑖1(X_{i})_{i=1}^{\\infty} is a martingale with respect to this filtration. It takes values in the range [−r,1−r]𝑟1𝑟[-r,1-r].\nWe now use a Hoeffding bound and empirical Bernstein bound on ∑i=1nXisuperscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛subscript𝑋𝑖\\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i} to show that the probability of 𝖤Rsuperscript𝖤R\\mathsf{E}^{\\mathrm{R}} and 𝖤REsuperscript𝖤RE\\mathsf{E}^{\\mathrm{RE}} is sufficiently large. We use the tools provided by Howard et al.  for both concentration bounds.\nThe martingale ∑i=1nXisuperscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛subscript𝑋𝑖\\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i} satisfies Assumption 1 in Howard et al.  with Vn=n/4subscript𝑉𝑛𝑛4V_{n}=n/4 and any sub-Gaussian boundary (see Hoeffding I entry in Table 2\ntherein). The same is true for −∑i=1nXisuperscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛subscript𝑋𝑖-\\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}. Using the sub-Gaussian boundary in Corollary 22 in Dann et al. 5, we get that holds for all n∈ℕ𝑛ℕn\\in\\mathbb{N} with probability at least 1−2​δ′12superscript𝛿′1-2\\delta^{\\prime}. It therefore also holds for all random n𝑛n including the number of observations of x𝑥x after k−1𝑘1k-1 episodes. Hence, the condition in 𝖤Rsuperscript𝖤𝑅\\mathsf{E}^{R} holds for all k𝑘k for a fixed x𝑥x with probability at least 1−2​δ′12superscript𝛿′1-2\\delta^{\\prime}. An additional union bound over x∈𝒳𝑥𝒳x\\in\\mathcal{X} gives ℙ​(𝖤R)≥1−2​|𝒳|​δ′ℙsuperscript𝖤𝑅12𝒳superscript𝛿′\\mathbb{P}(\\mathsf{E}^{R})\\geq 1-2|\\mathcal{X}|\\delta^{\\prime}. We can proceed analogously for 𝖤REsuperscript𝖤RE\\mathsf{E}^{\\text{RE}}, except that we use the uniform empirical Bernstein bound from Theorem 4 in Howard et al.  with the sub-exponential uniform boundary in Corollary 22 in Dann et al. 5 which yields with probability at least 1−2​δ′12superscript𝛿′1-2\\delta^{\\prime} for all n∈ℕ𝑛ℕn\\in\\mathbb{N}. Here, Vn=∑i=1nXi2≤nsubscript𝑉𝑛superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛superscriptsubscript𝑋𝑖2𝑛V_{n}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}^{2}\\leq n.

We next bound Vnsubscript𝑉𝑛V_{n} in the above by the de-biased variance estimate Applying the definition of event 𝖤Rsuperscript𝖤R\\mathsf{E}^{\\mathrm{R}}, we know that |r​(x)−r¯τn​(x)|≤ϕ​(n)𝑟𝑥subscript¯𝑟subscript𝜏𝑛𝑥italic-ϕ𝑛|r(x)-\\bar{r}_{\\tau_{n}}(x)|\\leq\\phi(n) and thus\nVn/n≤2​Var¯τn​(r|x)+2​ϕ​(n)2subscript𝑉𝑛𝑛2subscript¯Varsubscript𝜏𝑛conditional𝑟𝑥2italic-ϕsuperscript𝑛2V_{n}/n\\leq 2\\overline{\\operatorname{Var}}_{\\tau_{n}}(r|x)+2\\phi(n)^{2}. Plugging this back into (41) yields This is the condition of 𝖤REsuperscript𝖤RE\\mathsf{E}^{\\text{RE}} which holds for all n𝑛n and as such k𝑘k as long as 𝖤Rsuperscript𝖤R\\mathsf{E}^{\\text{R}} also holds. With a union bound over 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}, this yields ∎ Let the data be generated by sampling with a feedback graph from an MDP with arbitrary (and possibly history-dependent) policies.

Then by construction Xisubscript𝑋𝑖X_{i} is a sequence of i.i.d. random variables in   .
