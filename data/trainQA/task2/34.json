      "content": "Paper Title: A Study of the Tasks and Models in Machine Reading Comprehension\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs shown in the figure, a conceptual architecture of simple-reasoning MRC models consists of five layers, which are separately: \nInput Layer. This layer maps the words in each given context-question pair to the lexical embeddings, which are usually assigned the corresponding word vectors provided by a pre-trained Word2Vec  or GloVe [ref]19. For out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words with low frequency, their lexical embeddings are usually assigned the same random or zero vector. To better deal with OOV words, it is a common practice to append a character-level embedding to the lexical embedding of each word, which is usually obtained by processing the corresponding character vectors with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Besides, some MRC models, such as DrQA [ref]20, R.M-Reader , and SAN , also append binary features to the lexical embedding of each context word indicating whether this word and its variants appear in the question. \nFeature Extraction Layer. This layer maps the lexical embeddings to the contextual embeddings, which is aimed at extracting contextual features from the context and the question separately. A common practice for implementing this layer is to process the lexical embeddings of the context and those of the question separately with a shared bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)  or bidirectional GRU (BiGRU) , and thereby concatenate the outputs from both directions. To improve the training and inference efficiency, some MRC models, such as QANet [ref]25, replace all recurrent structures with feed-forward structures. \nMutual-matching Layer. This layer matches the contextual embeddings of the context with those of the question to generate the coarse memories of the context, which is also known as question-aware context representations. Mutual-matching attention is the substantial component of this layer, which fuses the contextual embeddings of the question into those of the context according to their mutual similarities. The fusion results are usually passed through a BiLSTM or BiGRU to form the coarse memories of the context. Some MRC models, such as SLQA+ , also generate the coarse memories of the question in a symmetrical manner, which can be seen as context-aware question representations. \nSelf-matching Layer. This layer matches the coarse memories of the context with themselves to generate the refined memories of the context, which is the self-aware context representations. Self-matching attention is the substantial component of this layer, which fuses the coarse memories of the context into themselves according to their self similarities. The fusion results are usually passed through a BiLSTM or BiGRU to form the refined memories of the context. \nOutput Layer. This layer predicts certain distributions, such as the distributions over the candidate answers, the context words, and so on, as outputs, the format of which depends on the specific MRC task to address. \nThe above architecture is just a general framework for constructing simple-reasoning MRC models, which is more or less different from those applied in practice. For example, Match-LSTM , RaSoR , DCN , BiDAF , MEMEN , DrQA [ref]20, FastQA , and QANet [ref]25 have no self-matching layer, while DrQA and FastQA even have no mutual-matching layer.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: Layer. This layer maps the words in each given context-question pair to the lexical embeddings, which are usually assigned the corresponding word vectors provided by a pre-trained Word2Vec  or GloVe [ref]19. For out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words with low frequency, their lexical embeddings are usually assigned the same random or zero vector. To better deal with OOV words, it is a common practice to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
