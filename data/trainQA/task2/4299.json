      "content": "Paper Title: Securing Optimized Code Against Power Side Channels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCompiler backend optimizations, like instruction selection,\ninstruction scheduling, and register allocation are known to be\nhard combinatorial problems.\nHence, solving such problems completely does not scale for large sizes.\nTherefore, popular compilers, like GCC [ref]43 and\nLLVM , use heuristics that throughout the\nyears have proved to improve program performance.\nHowever, these heuristics do not guarantee finding the optimal\nsolution to these backend optimizations. For critical code and code aimed for compiler-demanding architectures,\ncombinatorial methods may find an optimized version of the code that\nleads to reduced power consumption and/or high performance benefits.\nDifferent works     aim to optimize\ncritical code at different levels, like\nloops ,\nlocally  or at function\nlevel .\nThe optimization goals range from execution time, code size, or\nestimated energy\nconsumption   .\nThe main drawback of these approaches is\nscalability .\nHowever, a recent work, Unison ,\nallows the optimization of functions of up to almost 1000\ninstructions. A different combinatorial approach for generating optimal\nprogram code is superoptimization .\nGiven a code sequence, superoptimization approaches attempt to\nfind an equivalent code sequence that reduces the overall execution\ntime and is provably equivalent to the initial code.\nSouper , a state-of-the-art superoptimization\napproach, performs middle-end optimizations to LLVM IR code.\nMiddle-end optimizations typically do not take decisions on the\nregister allocation or the instruction scheduling.\nInstead, they enable algorithmic-level code optimizations.\nCrow  is an approach based on Souper that\nperforms software diversification as a security mitigation approach.\nEldib and Wang \npropose a high-level program synthesis approach to automatically\ngenerate masked implementations.\nHowever, the backend compiler transformations that follow these\nmiddle-end transformations, may introduce TBLs. To summarize, many combinatorial compiler backend techniques allow\nlow-level code optimization but, to our knowledge, none of them\nconsiders the preservation of security properties against TBLs.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: scheduling, and register allocation are known to be\nhard combinatorial problems.\nHence, solving such problems completely does not scale for large sizes.\nTherefore, popular compilers, like GCC [ref]43 and\nLLVM , use heuristics that throughout the\nyears have proved to improve program performance.\nHowever, these heuristics do not guarantee finding the optimal\nsolution to these backend\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
