      "content": "Paper Title: Few-shot Link Prediction on N-ary Facts\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe utilized the PyTorch library to implement the proposed method and performed all experiments on four NVIDIA Tesla K80s. A grid search was employed to determine the optimal hyperparameter configuration. For FLEN, we set the embedding size to 100, the batch size of tasks per epoch t​b​a​t​c​h𝑡𝑏𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎtbatch to 1024, the batch size of query instances per task q​b​a​t​c​h𝑞𝑏𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎqbatch to 3, the max epoch number n​e​p​o​c​h𝑛𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑐ℎnepoch to 300000, the hyper-parameter margin μ𝜇\\mu to 5, the layer number of GRAN to 2, the step size of the gradient β𝛽\\beta to 1. Additionally, the learning rate is 5​e−45superscript𝑒45e^{-4} for F-WD50K and 1​e−41superscript𝑒41e^{-4} for others. The hyper-parameter relation weight τ𝜏\\tau is 0.4 for F-JF17K and 0.9 for others. The maximum number of background facts per entity L𝐿L is 10 for F-JF17K, 20 for F-WD50K, and 30 for the F-WikiPeople. We pre-train embeddings with background data by HINGE [ref]12 and optimize the model with Adam . Evaluation metrics are MRR and Hits@k , with k = 1, 5, 10. MRR is the average of the reciprocal rank of the correct answer. Hits@k is the proportion of the correct answer ranked in the top k. Higher MRR and Hits@k indicate better performance. During training, FLEN will be evaluated on 𝒯v​a​l​i​d​a​t​i​o​nsubscript𝒯𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛\\mathcal{T}_{validation} every 1000 epochs, and the current model parameters and corresponding performance will be recorded. After training is complete, the model with the best performance on Hits@10 will be selected as the final model. To determine the number of training epochs, we use early stopping with patience of 10 epochs. This means that we stop the training process when the performance on Hits@10 has continuously dropped 10 times. Since there is no model designed for few-shot link prediction on n-ary facts currently, FLEN is compared to 15 different models from two relevant categories: link prediction on n-ary facts and few-shot link prediction on binary facts. The representative or state-of-the-art methods for link prediction on n-ary facts are m-TransH , HypE [ref]8, PolygonE [ref]25, NeuInfer , HINGE [ref]12, RAM , Hy-Transformer , GRAN , StarE . The representative or state-of-the-art methods for few-shot link prediction on binary facts are GMatching, FSRL , FAAN , MetaR, MetaP , GANA . For brevity, link prediction on n-ary facts models is denoted as n-ary models, and few-shot link prediction on binary facts models is denoted as binary models. Most binary models require pre-trained embeddings for the input KGs, we also use HINGE [ref]12 to obtain the pre-trained embeddings for a fair comparison.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: and 0.9 for others.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
