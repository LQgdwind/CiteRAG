In addition to supervised classification, MIAs have also been explored in other domains, including contrastive learning , generative models  , federated learning 0, graph neural networks , and recommender systems . Defenses against membership inference attacks.\nThese defenses can be divided into provable and practical defenses.\nThe former can provide rigorous privacy guarantee, such as DP-SGD , PATE 2.\nNevertheless, these defenses often incur severe accuracy drop when used with acceptable provable bounds 5 3.\nAnother line of practical defenses aim to achieve empirical privacy without severely degrading accuracy.\nCommon regularization techniques such as dropout 9, weight decay 4 are shown to be able to reduce privacy leakage, but with limited effectiveness 7 6.\nOther defenses enforce specific optimization constraint during training to mitigate MIAs  6, or perform output obfuscation  .\nKnowledge distillation is used by different techniques to mitigate MIAs, including PATE 2, DMP 6, SELENA  and KCD .\nHowever, existing defenses are often biased towards either privacy or utility. In contrast, HAMP both achieves strong membership privacy and high accuracy, which offers a much better privacy-utility trade off. Other privacy attacks.\nIn addition to membership privacy, common ML models are found to leak different private properties      .\nModel extraction attacks can duplicate the functionality of a proprietary model  .\nModel inversion attacks are capable of inferring critical information in the input features such as genomic information  .\nProperty inference attacks are constructed to infer sensitive properties of the training dataset .\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Membership inference attacks.\nDepending on the adversary capabilities, MIAs can be divided into black-box 7    8 [ref]8  7 and white-box attacks   0.\nThe former has access only into the output of the target model while the latter has visibility into information such as the internal model gradients to facilitate\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
