      "content": "Paper Title: Low-complexity Deep Video Compression with A Distributed Coding Architecture\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLearning-based Compression.\nCompared with standard codecs, recent learning-based image and video compression methods have made significant progresses in terms of RD performance. Most deep image compression methods employ an auto-encoder style network with various types of entropy models for high compression performance  [ref]24  [ref]22 [ref]26 . In addition, other techniques such as generalized divisive normalization (GDN) , latent residual prediction and round-based training [ref]22 have been proposed to improve the coding gains. We consider these existing works to be important building blocks for our framework. Existing learning-based video compression methods     mainly follow the predictive coding architecture. They suffer from high encoding complexity due to heavy motion-related operations. By contrast, our method achieves a better trade-off between RD performance and encoding complexity, which is suitable for computation resource-constrained situations and complements current learning-based video compression approaches. Moreover, different from orthogonal works that apply model quantization to reduce the complexity of learning-based image codecs  0 1, our work aims at reducing the encoding complexity by changing the coding architecture. Distributed Video Coding.\nOver the past few decades, various handcrafted tools have been proposed to improve the compression performance of WZ video coding, including the application of different transformation 2, more accurate correlation noise estimation 3 and the refinement of SI 4 5. Recent works have introduced DNNs to boost the performance 6  . However, only some of the main modules are replaced by DNNs, which hinders WZ video codecs from enjoying the benefits of end-to-end optimization. By contrast, all key components in our proposed framework are implemented with DNNs and jointly optimized to significantly improve the RD performance.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: significant progresses in terms of RD performance.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
