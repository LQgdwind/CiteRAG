      "content": "Paper Title: A Comprehensive Survey of Continual Learning: Theory, Method and Application\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe above strategies basically focus on learning all incremental tasks with a shared set of parameters (i.e., a single model as well as one parameter space), which is a major cause of the inter-task interference. In contrast, constructing task-specific parameters can explicitly resolve this problem.\nPrevious work generally separates this category into parameter isolation and dynamic architecture, depending on whether the network architecture is fixed or not.\nHere, we instead focus on the way of implementing task-specific parameters, extending the above concepts to parameter allocation, model decomposition and modular network (see Fig. 8). Parameter allocation features an isolated parameter subspace dedicated to each task throughout the network, where the architecture can be fixed or dynamic in size.\nWithin a fixed network architecture, Piggyback , HAT , SupSup , MEAT , WSN  and H2 90 explicitly optimize a binary mask to select dedicated neurons or parameters for each task, with the masked regions of the old tasks (almost) frozen to prevent catastrophic forgetting.\nPackNet [ref]291, UCL , CLNP , AGS-CL  and NISPA  explicitly identify the important neurons or parameters for the current task and then release the unimportant parts to the following tasks, which can be achieved by iterative pruning [ref]291, activation value   , uncertainty estimation , etc.\nSince the network capacity is limited, “free” parameters tend to saturate as more incremental tasks are introduced. Therefore, these methods typically require sparsity constraints on parameter usage and selective reuse of the frozen old parameters, which might affect the learning of each task.\nTo alleviate this dilemma, the network architecture can be dynamically expanded if its capacity is not sufficient to learn a new task well, such as DEN , CPG  and DGMa/DGMw .\nThe dynamic architecture can also be explicitly optimized to improve parameter efficiency and knowledge transfer, such as by reinforcement learning (RCL , BNS ), architecture search (LtG , BNS ), variational Bayes (BSA ), etc. As the network expansion should be much slower than the task increase to ensure scalability, constraints on sparsity and reusability remain important. Model decomposition separates a model explicitly into task-sharing and task-specific components, where the task-specific components are often expandable.\nFor a regular network, the task-specific components could be parallel branches (ACL , ReduNet , EPIE-Net ), adaptive layers (GVCL , DyTox ), masks or mask generators for intermediate features (CCLL , CCG , MARK 76).\nNote that the feature masks for model decomposition do not operate in parameter space and are not binary for each task, thus fundamentally different from the binary masks for parameter allocation.\nBesides, the network parameters themselves can be decomposed into task-sharing and task-specific elements, such as by additive decomposition (APD ), singular value decomposition (RCM 98), filter atom decomposition (FAS ) and low-rank factorization (IBP-WF , IRU 78).\nAs the number of task-specific components usually grows linearly with incremental tasks, their resource efficiency determines the scalability of this sub-direction. Modular network leverages parallel sub-networks or sub-modules to learn incremental tasks in a differentiated manner, without pre-defined task-sharing or task-specific components. As an early work, Progressive Networks  introduces an identical sub-network for each task and allows knowledge transfer from other sub-networks via adaptor connections.\nExpert Gate 4 and a subsequent work  employ a mixture of experts 84 to learn incremental tasks, expanding one expert as each task is introduced. PathNet 17 and RPSNet  pre-allocate multiple parallel networks to construct a few candidate paths, i.e., layer-wise compositions of network modules, and select the best path for each task.\nMNTDP  and LMC  attempt to find the optimal layout from previous sub-modules and potentially new sub-modules.\nSimilar to parameter allocation, these efforts are intentional to construct task-specific models, while the combination of sub-networks or sub-modules allows explicit reuse of knowledge.\nIn addition, the sub-networks can be encouraged to learn incremental tasks in parallel.\nModel Zoo  expands a sub-network to learn each new task with experience replay of the old tasks, and ensembles all sub-networks for prediction.\nCoSCL  and CAF  ensembles multiple continual learning models and modulates the predictive similarity between them, proving to be effective in resolving the discrepancy of task distribution and improving the flatness of loss landscape. In a broader sense, sampling parameters from task-conditioned parameter distributions (MERLIN , PR 61, PGMA 70, HNET ), as well as stabilizing important parameters with weight regularization, can be seen as a form of deriving task-specific/adaptive parameters.\nIn contrast to other directions, most architecture-based approaches amount to de-correlating incremental tasks in network parameters, which can almost avoid catastrophic forgetting but affect scalability and inter-task generalizability. In particular, task identities are often required to determine which set of parameters to use, thus greatly constraining their applications.\nTo overcome this limitation, task identities can be inferred from the responses (e.g., predictive uncertainty) of each task-specific model 4 61 .\nThe function of task-identity prediction can also be learned explicitly from incremental tasks, using other continual learning strategies to mitigate catastrophic forgetting  90    61 . Besides, the design and choice of a basic architecture can largely impact the continual learning performance. For example, wider networks tend to be more robust to catastrophic forgetting due to more orthogonality and sparsity in gradient directions, as well as a lazier training regime  .\nBatch Normalization (BN) layers 80 tend to introduce biased moments towards the current task, resulting in sub-optimal performance of the previous tasks   .\nDropout  in a stable network behaves like a gating mechanism to create task-specific pathways and thus can mitigate catastrophic forgetting .\n\nReference markers found: [291]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]291: H2 90 explicitly optimize a binary mask to select dedicated neurons or parameters for each task, with the masked regions of the old tasks (almost) frozen to prevent catastrophic forgetting.\nPackNet [ref]291, UCL , CLNP , AGS-CL  and NISPA  explicitly identify the important neurons or parameters for the current task and then release the unimportant parts to the following tasks, which can be\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
