Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: LAViTeR: Learning Aligned Visual and Textual Representations Assisted by Image and Caption Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVilBERT [ref]26 and LXMERT  are the two pioneering works in image-text joint representation learning, utilizing two streams of Transformers to images and text independently. Those image and text representations then fused by a self-attention mechanism in the later stage. After those two pioneered work, single-stream architecture has also been proposed using a single Transformer to jointly learn image-text embedding, such as UNITER , VisualBERT [ref]22, Unicoder-VL [ref]21, VL-VERT , B2T2 . Typical self-supervised learning tasks, such as masked language modeling, masked region modeling, image-text matching, and word-region alignment are applied to pre-train the models. More recently, VILLA has been proposed using adversarial training as a general framework can be applied to any V+L models 1. There are quite a lot of work trying to explicitly enforce the word and region alignment, such as VisualBERT [ref]22, UNITER , Oscar , MMAC . For example, UNITER  uses the Optimal Transport  to explicitly calculate the minimum cost of transporting between the image embedding to word embedding.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: VilBERT [ref]26 and LXMERT  are the two pioneering works in image-text joint representation learning, utilizing two streams of Transformers to images and text independently.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
