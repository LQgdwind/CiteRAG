      "content": "Paper Title: Generative AI-empowered Simulation for Autonomous Driving in Vehicular Mixed Reality Metaverses\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe vehicular mixed reality (MR) Metaverse is envisioned as a promising solution for realizing autonomous driving by fusing the physical and virtual vehicular networks  [ref]2. The multi-dimensional communications among physical and virtual entities can surrender the distance of “data islands” on roads for\nimproving road safety and traffic efficiency while reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions . Assisted by digital twin (DT) technologies, autonomous vehicles (AV) utilize advanced sensors, e.g., ultrasonic radars, cameras, and LiDAR, to collect data from their surrounding environments for constructing virtual representations in the virtual space . Then, AVs can make driving decisions, such as driving model selection and motion planning, via artificial intelligence (AI) methods. Even though panoramic cameras and high-class LiDAR are equipped with AVs, each AV can only collect limited environment data and cannot perceive the whole environment, e.g., occlusions . Therefore, multiple connected AVs, roadside units (RSUs), and virtual simulators can share and fuse sensing data in the virtual space, to perceive the complete information of environments including occlusions. However, it is difficult and costly to collect realistic driving data on a large scale to train AVs directly in the physical world. To address this issue, much effort from academia and industry has been devoted to developing platforms in the virtual space for traffic and driving simulations  . By establishing virtual driving simulation platforms with DT   and MR  0 technologies, virtual representations of AVs can efficiently collect traffic and training data and cheaply test it on rare cases, such as virtual traffic accidents and car collisions under realistic scenes 1 2.\nAlthough traditional simulation platforms can generate an unlimited number of various driving experiences, the collected driving data requires a lot of manual work for labeling, which prevents the potential from being fully realized . Fortunately, with the multi-modal generative AI 3 4 5, the labeled traffic and driving data can be synthesized directly for virtual autonomous driving systems 6.\nIn this way, the process of using simulation platforms for autonomous driving training and evaluation is revolutionized by shifting from collecting and labeling data to directly synthesizing labeled data 6 7. Therefore, the simulation systems empowered by generative AI can generate large and diverse labeled driving datasets based on real-time road and weather conditions and user preferences for online prediction and offline training in autonomous driving systems. Furthermore, in the vehicular Metaverse, connected AVs, RSUs, and virtual simulators need to construct the traffic and driving simulation platforms in the virtual space collaboratively.\nTo update with virtual representations in virtual space, AVs continuously generate and offload multiple computation-intensive DT tasks to RSUs in online traffic simulation . Specifically, these DT tasks of each AV, including simulation, decision-making, and monitoring, are heterogeneous in requiring computing, communication resources, and deadlines.\nIn driving simulations, virtual simulators synthesize controllable traffic and driving data for satisfying specific requirements, e.g., passenger preferences and weather conditions, of the simulated driving tasks 2. In addition, the synthesized traffic and driving datasets can also be used in training virtual representations of AVs to further improve driving robustness.\nThese synchronization activities, e.g., DT task execution, traffic and driving simulations, and AV training, are demanding enormous communication and computing resources of RSUs for supporting autonomous driving systems 8 9.\nTherefore, developing effective multi-task incentive mechanisms that motivate RSUs to improve their use of communications and computing resources is imperative. As shown in Fig. 1, in this paper, we propose a novel DT-assisted autonomous driving architecture for the vehicular MR Metaverse, where generative AI is leveraged to synthesize massive and conditioned traffic and driving data for online and offline simulations.\nIn detail, to improve reliability in DT task execution, we propose a multi-task DT offloading model where AVs can offload heterogeneous DT tasks with different deadlines to RSUs for real-time execution.\nTo improve reliability in driving decision-making, virtual simulators can utilize the information in DTs, such as current location, historical trajectory, and user preferences, for online traffic simulations  . Moreover, based on the collected sensing data in the physical world and user preferences in DTs, virtual simulators can synthesize massive and conditioned driving data for AV training of virtual simulators via running generative AI models.\nAs a use case, we propose a diffusion model-based traffic sign generator, named TSDreamBooth, which is developed based on the DreamBooth  fine-tuned using Belgium traffic sign (BelgiumTS) dataset . The TSDreamBooth can be leveraged to generate virtual traffic sign images under different driving conditions and user preferences. Finally, we propose a multi-task enhanced auction-based mechanism to satisfy multi-dimensional requirements (e.g., prices and deadlines) of multiple DT tasks. We analyze the properties of the proposed auction and prove that it is strategy-proof and adverse-selection free. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can increase total social surplus by 150%. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: To improve the safety and reliability of autonomous driving, we propose a novel DT-assisted MR Metaverse architecture with MR simulations empowered by generative AI. In this architecture, connected AVs, RSUs, and virtual simulators maintain digital simulation platforms in the virtual space, where data collecting, sharing, and utilizing among physical and virtual entities can improve driving safety and traffic efficiency in physical autonomous driving systems. In this architecture, we propose a reliable DT task offloading framework where AVs can continuously offload multiple DT tasks with different requirements to RSUs for updating DTs in the virtual space. In traffic and driving simulations, we consider generative AI-empowered virtual simulators to synthesize new driving data for AVs’ decision-making and training. To incentivize RSUs for providing resources in supporting autonomous driving systems, we propose a multi-task enhanced auction-based mechanism to offer fine-grained allocation results and prices for executing heterogeneous DT tasks with various deadlines. Based on the property analysis, the proposed mechanism is fully strategy-proof and adverse-selection free. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we review the related works. In Section III, we discuss the proposed system architecture and its system model. Then, in Section IV, we implement the multi-task enhanced auction-based mechanism. We demonstrate the experimental results in Section V, and provide a conclusion in Section VI.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: The vehicular mixed reality (MR) Metaverse is envisioned as a promising solution for realizing autonomous driving by fusing the physical and virtual vehicular networks  [ref]2.
