      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Algorithms for Obnoxious Facility Location on a Line Segment or Circle\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe study of facility location problems is an important branch of operations research and algorithm design. Such problems are typically concerned with finding optimum locations for facilities to serve a set of demand points (clients). In general, we would like to place facilities such that they are close to demand points . The most common objectives include minimizing the total service costs(i.e., the uncapacitated facility location problem(UFLP))  or covering all demand points within\na certain radius (i.e., the k𝑘k-center problem) . The mathematical model of the facility location problem can be applied to several other problems, including clustering and the lock-box problem. However, in certain applications, facilities can be obnoxious and must be placed as far as possible away from other facilities such as hospitals, fire stations, post offices, schools, , and other obnoxious facilities.\nIn such applications, such facilities should typically be located on the sides of highways because of heavy transportation requirements.\nThis motivates the problems we study in this paper, that is how to place\nobnoxious facilities on a line segment or circle. First, we review existing models for\nobnoxious facility placement.\nChurch and Garfinkel  first introduced the obnoxious p𝑝p-median problem.\nIn this problem, the positions of the non-obnoxious facilities are given.\nThe goal is to locate p𝑝p obnoxious facilities to maximize the cumulative minimum distance from the non-obnoxious facilities to these p𝑝p obnoxious facilities.\nThe obnoxious p𝑝p-median problem has been proved to be NP-hard .\nHerrán, Alberto and Colmenar demonstrated that\nthe obnoxious p𝑝p-median problem can be formulated as an integer linear program and obtained the best solution in 137 of the 144 instances in the benchmark.\nDrezner and Wesolowsky  provided\nanother formulation of the obnoxious facility location problem.\nTheir goal was to locate an obnoxious facility that is as far as possible from the arcs and nodes of a given network.\nThey provided an (1−ϵ)1italic-ϵ(1-\\epsilon)-approximation algorithm that executes in O​(m3​log⁡(1/ϵ))𝑂superscript𝑚31italic-ϵO(m^{3}\\log(1/\\epsilon)) time for the weighted version of the problem, where m𝑚m is the number of arcs in the network.\nMichael  improved the execution time to O​(m2​log⁡n​log⁡(1/ϵ))𝑂superscript𝑚2𝑛1italic-ϵO(m^{2}\\log n\\log(1/\\epsilon)) by modifying the network to a rectilinear network, where n𝑛n is the number of nodes in the network.\nSingireddy and Basappa provided a\nO​((n​k)2​log⁡(n​k)+(n+k)​log⁡(n​k))𝑂superscript𝑛𝑘2𝑛𝑘𝑛𝑘𝑛𝑘O((nk)^{2}\\log(nk)+(n+k)\\log(nk)) time algorithm for the constrained obnoxious facility location problem, where n𝑛n is the number of non-obnoxious and k𝑘k is the number of the obnoxious facilities. Another popular variation is the minimum-sum obnoxious facility location (MOFL) problem. We are given a set of weighted points corresponding to\nnon-obnoxious facilities. We must place k𝑘k obnoxious facilities such that they minimize the total weight of the points covered.\nThe MOFL problem is motivated by applications where we must place a small number of obnoxious facilities and minimize the total weight of the non-obnoxious facilities that can be influenced.\nThese obnoxious facilities influence the area around them, where each area can be approximated by a disk (or other shapes).\nDreznre and Wesolowsky  first studied this problem where the requirement was to place a single facility.\nThey modeled the area influenced by this obnoxious facility as a rectangle or disk and provided an algorithm for solving both cases in O​(n2)𝑂superscript𝑛2O(n^{2}) time. Singireddy and Basappa [ref]35 improved this to O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n) time and presented a dynamic\nprogramming solution that solves the case of placing k𝑘k obnoxious facilities using O​(n3​k)𝑂superscript𝑛3𝑘O(n^{3}k) time.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: modeled the area influenced by this obnoxious facility as a rectangle or disk and provided an algorithm for solving both cases in O​(n2)𝑂superscript𝑛2O(n^{2}) time.
