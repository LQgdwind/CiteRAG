      "content": "Paper Title: T-TAME: Trainable Attention Mechanism for Explaining Convolutional Networks and Vision Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe start by briefly discussing the broader domain of XAI.\nThe ability to provide an explanation for why a specific decision was made is now seen as a desirable feature of intelligent systems . These explanations serve to help users understand the AI system’s underlying model, facilitating its effective use and maintenance. Additionally, they assist users in identifying and correcting errors in the AI system’s outputs, thus aiding in debugging. Furthermore, explanations can be used for educational purposes, helping users to explore and understand new concepts within a particular domain. Finally, explanations contribute to users’ trust and cogency by offering actionable insights and convincing them that the system’s decisions can be trusted. What constitutes a “good” explanation for an AI system is still an open research question. Three important properties for explanations have been identified by social science research on how humans explain their decisions to each other ; here we briefly discuss how the current paradigm of explanation methods for vision classifiers aligns with these properties. First, explanations are counterfactual; they justify a decision in opposition to other choices, i.e., why a backbone network classified a specific image as a certain class instead of another possible class. An explanation method can be counterfactual by providing explanation maps for each class that is considered by the backbone network, thus, allowing the user to compare explanation maps for different possible classification decisions. Second, explanations are selected in a biased manner, so as to not overwhelm the user with information. To this end, in the vision classifier domain, the most common form of explanation\nis\na heatmap (a.k.a. explanation map). Third, explanations are social, thus they need to align with the mental model of the user of an AI system. When a user views an image, typically they pay more attention to some parts of the image than to others. In a direct analogy, the user would expect an image classification model to focus more or less on specific regions of the input image for making its classification decision; these are the image regions that are highlighted by the explanation map. There is a wide range of explainability methods, which are often also referred to as feature attribution methods.\nBased on the scope of their explanations, i.e., whether they are used to produce explanations for single predictions or for the overall model, these methods can be characterized as local or global .\nAnother important distinction regarding an explainability method arises from its relationship with the model it aims to explain, classifying it as either ante-hoc or post-hoc.\nThe former approaches require architectural modifications that have to be applied prior to the training of the classifier. Several intrinsically explainable classifiers that fall in this category have been developed . Contrarily, a method that can be directly applied to an already-trained classifier is a post-hoc method.\nPost-hoc explainability approaches can be applied to existing off-the-shelf classifiers, thus providing users with the freedom to choose a top-performing classifier without compromising on model explainability .\nThese approaches can be further categorized as model-specific or model-agnostic, depending on whether they are applicable to only specific models or any type of model.\nFor a more comprehensive review of the different taxonomies of explanation methods and the different approaches therein, the interested reader is referred to    . Among the above-described classes of explainability methods, local post-hoc methods are most widely applicable to the task of explaining deep learning-based image classification models.\nIn the following, we survey the state-of-the-art approaches in this category that are most closely related to ours.\nThese approaches can be roughly categorized into gradient-, relevance-, perturbation- and response-based.\nGradient-based methods  [ref]13 compute the gradient of a given input with backpropagation and modify it in various ways to produce an explanation map.\nGrad-CAM , one of the first in this category, uses global average pooling in the gradients of the backbone network’s logits with respect to the feature maps to compute weights.\nThe explanation maps are obtained as the weighted combination of feature maps, using the computed weights. Grad-CAM++ [ref]13 similarly uses gradients to generate explanation maps.\nThese methods suffer from the same issues as the gradients they use: neural network gradients can be noisy and suffer from saturation problems for typical activation functions such as ReLU, GELU, and Sigmoid . Relevance-based methods    use a Taylor approximation of the gradients to propagate relevance of pixel information through the examined network. The propagation function is a modified version of backpropagation, aimed at reducing noise and retaining layer-wise salient information. Relevance is propagated to the input image, producing an explanation map. An early work of this class,\nDeep Taylor Decomposition (DTD) , directly uses gradients, propagating them throughout the network and accumulating the contribution to the output prediction from each layer of the network. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)  cemented the use of Taylor approximation to explain general network architectures. In contrast to methods like Grad-CAM, this method combines information from all of the layers in the network. An extension of the LRP method for Transformer-based architectures, including ViTs, is presented in .\nHowever, applying these methods to novel architectures and new network layers is not a straightforward task, requiring the careful fulfillment of the relevance propagation rules through each network operation and dealing with practical issues that may arise, such as numerical instability; thus, their applicability is limited. Perturbation-based methods [ref]20 [ref]21 attempt to repeatedly alter the input and produce explanations based on the observed changes in the confidence of the original prediction; thus, avoid gradient-related problems such as vanishing or noisy gradients.\nFor instance, RISE [ref]20 utilizes Monte Carlo sampling to generate random masks, which are then used to perturb the input image and generate a respective CNN classification score.\nUsing the computed scores as weights, the explanation map is derived as the weighted combination of the generated random masks.\nScore-CAM [ref]21, on the other hand, utilizes the feature maps from the final layer of the network as masks by upsampling them to the size of the input image, instead of generating random masks.\nThus, RISE and Score-CAM, as most methods in this category, require many forward passes through the network (in the order of hundreds or thousands) to generate an explanation, considerably increasing the inference time and computational cost. Response-based methods      use feature maps or activations of the backbone’s layers in the inference stage to interpret the decision-making process of the backbone neural network.\nOne of the first methods in this category, CAM , uses the output of the backbone’s global average pooling layer as weights, and computes the weighted average of the features maps at the final convolutional layer.\nCAM requires the presence of such a global average pooling layer in the target model’s architecture, restricting its applicability.\nSISE , and later Ada-SISE , aggregate feature maps in a cascading manner to produce explanation maps of any CNN model.\nSimilarly, Poly-CAM  uses feature maps from multiple layers, upscales them to the largest spatial dimension present in the set, and then combines them in a cascading manner. Iterated Integrated Attributions (IIA)  is a generalization of Integrated Gradients  that further employs gradients from internal feature maps. It is also applied to ViT models by using attention matrices as feature maps; the usage of gradients of the input and feature maps from the last two layers before the classification stage are considered. Similarly to perturbation-based methods, the above methods require either multiple forward passes in the case of SISE, Ada-SISE, and Poly-CAM, or multiple backward passes in the case of IIA, to produce an explanation. Finally, the category of trainable response-based explanation methods is represented by L-CAM . L-CAM mitigates the limitations of response-based methods by using a learned attention mechanism to compute class-specific explanations in one forward pass.\nHowever, it can only harness the salient information of feature maps from a single layer of a CNN backbone. The proposed T-TAME method is a trainable response-based method that addresses the limitations of L-CAM, by using feature maps from multiple layers and by being applicable to both CNN and Transformer-based architectures.\nIn contrast to the majority of the approaches described above, which traverse the network multiple times to provide an explanation, the proposed approach is computationally inexpensive at the inference stage, requiring only a single forward pass. We should also note that the methods of   take a somewhat similar approach to ours in that they produce explanation maps using an attention mechanism and multiple sets of feature maps.\nHowever, these methods are ante-hoc, jointly training the attention model with the CNN backbone that learns to perform the desired image classification task.\nIn contrast, T-TAME does not modify the trained target (a.k.a. backbone) model, whose weights remain frozen. I.e., T-TAME is a post-hoc method, exclusively optimizing the attention mechanism in an unsupervised learning manner to generate visual explanations.\nThus, no direct comparisons can be drawn with   as they provide explanations for a different, concurrently-trained classifier rather than an already optimized backbone. Finally, as T-TAME is based on an attention mechanism, special tribute must be paid to  for the first use of hierarchical attention, inspired by early primate vision, in the field of image processing.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: approaches in this category that are most closely related to ours.\nThese approaches can be roughly categorized into gradient-, relevance-, perturbation- and response-based.\nGradient-based methods  [ref]13 compute the gradient of a given input with backpropagation and modify it in various ways to produce an explanation map.\nGrad-CAM , one of the first in this category, uses global average\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
