      "content": "Paper Title: FedTP: Federated Learning by Transformer Personalization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFederated learning  is a framework that learns a shared global model from multiple disjointed clients without sharing their own data. In federated learning, each client trains a model using its own local data and only sends model updates back to the server. In this way, federated learning overcomes a range of problems with both data privacy and communications overheads. However, in situations where there is data heterogeneity and system heterogeneity across the clients, learning a single global model may fail. Accordingly, personalized federated learning has emerged as an extension to federated learning to overcome these challenges. The paradigm works by learning personalized models instead of a single global model, while still benefiting from joint training. Data heterogeneity is a common problem in the real world, since the training data collected from different clients varies heavily both in size and distribution [ref]2   [ref]5 [ref]6.\nNumerous methods have been developed for federated learning to tackle the challenge of non-IID data distribution across clients.\nYet most federated learning frameworks are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which generally focus on high-frequency local patterns that might be particularly sensitive to data heterogeneity .\nTransformers , however, use self-attention to learn the global interactions between inputs  and, therefore, they tend to be more robust to distribution shifts and data heterogeneity 0. Motivated by this, a very recent work 1 proposed the idea of using Transformers as a federated network architecture coupled with the basic federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm . Although the study showed some very promising experimental results, the impacts that federated learning algorithms may have on self-attention has not yet been studied. It is our fear that such algorithms may limit the capabilities of Transformers in federated learning. Given the promise of Transformer-based federated learning, this is a topic worthy of further investigation. To sum up, the main issues of current personalized federated learning are as follows: Many existing CNNs-based federated models might be particularly sensitive to data heterogeneity since CNNs generally focus on high-frequency local patterns. Existing Transformer-based Federated learning methods do not investigate the effects of the federated aggregation operations on the self-attention. There is a lack of a personalized federated learning framework that is more appropriate for Transformer structures. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the self-attention layers in Transformers play a more important role than the other layers 0. Inspired by this, we devised a simple experiment to explore the contribution of self-attention to federated learning and to study the effects of federated learning methods on self-attention mechanisms. In our experiment, we compared the attention maps of three different Vision Transformer (ViT) models 2, these being: 1) Local-T, which trains a unique ViT in each client locally; 2) FedAvg-T, which applies the FedAvg algorithm to train a global ViT; and 3) Vanilla Personalized-T, which retains the self-attention locally and uses FedAvg to aggregate the other parameters in the server. The experiment itself involved sampling a set of images from different classes in CIFAR-100 3 with five clients and using the Attention Rollout method 4 to produce attention maps. The original images and corresponding attention maps of these methods are shown in Fig. 1. We can see that both Local-T and Vanilla Personalized-T can discover critical information in the images (the red area in the images), but FedAvg-T failed to generate a meaningful attention map. This indicates that aggregating the self-attention of clients with heterogeneous data may ruin the client-specific representations, potentially degrading the modelâ€™s performance. Unlike applying simple FedAvg operations on the whole model, the above vanilla personalization mechanism can depict client-specific self-attention layers by local training. However, since these personalized self-attention layers are learned independently without considering the potential inherent relationships between clients, the obtained personalized self-attention may be sub-optimal. Moreover, the personalized self-attention layers are not scalable as they increase linearly with the increase of client numbers. Furthermore, the generalization of personalized self-attention to novel clients is limited since the whole self-attention layers must be re-trained.\nBased on this, we designed a novel Transformer-based federated learning framework called Federated Transformer Personalization (FedTP) that uses a\nlearn-to-personalize mechanism instead of the above vanilla personalization. Specifically, a hypernetwork is learned on the server that generates projection matrices in self-attention layers to produce client-wise queries, keys, and values, while the other model parameters are aggregated and shared.\nThe learn-to-personalize mechanism for self-attention layers through hypernetwork allows us to effectively share parameters across clients and generate personalized self-attention layers by learning a unique embedding vector for each client. In addition to high accuracy, FedTP is also scalable to the increase of client number and enjoys good generalization capability to novel clients. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: We explore the effects of self-attention mechanism in personalized federated learning and we are the first to reveal that FedAvg may have negative impacts on self-attention where data heterogeneity is present. Based on this, we propose a novel Transformer-based federated learning framework, namely FedTP, that learns personalized self-attention for each client. We propose a learn-to-personalize mechanism to better exploit clientsâ€™ cooperations in the personalized layers and improve the scalability and generalization of FedTP. In addition, we derive the generalization bounds for FedTP with the learn-to-personalize mechanism. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets under different non-IID data settings. The experimental results demonstrate that FedTP yields state-of-the-art performance over a wide range of personalized federated learning benchmark methods on both image and language tasks. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II briefly reviews the related work of personalized federated learning, Transformers and Hypernetworks. Section III presents the formulation of Transformer-based personalized federated learning; the details of two types of personalization, including vanilla personalization and learn-to-personalize; and the update of model parameters. Experimental results and discussions are provided in Section IV. Section IV analyzes the limitations of FedTP and section V concludes the whole paper. The proof of Theorem 1 in Section III is given in the Appendix.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: still benefiting from joint training.
