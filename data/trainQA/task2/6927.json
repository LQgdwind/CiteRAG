      "content": "Paper Title: PointOcc: Cylindrical Tri-Perspective View for Point-based 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLiDAR Segmentation.\nLiDAR segmentation aims to assign a semantic label to each point in the LiDAR point clouds, which serves as the basic task for LiDAR semantic perception.\nExisting state-of-the-art methods     usually split the 3D space into uniform voxels and process voxels with 3D convolutional networks, resulting in dense cubic features to describe the 3D scenes [ref]37.\nDespite the strong performance of voxel-based methods, they usually suffer from significant computational and storage burdens due to the complex 3D operations on a vast number of voxels    .\nTherefore, considering the sparse and varying density of LiDAR point clouds, other methods explored projecting point clouds onto a 2D plane and using 2D backbones to process pseudo-image features [ref]48   , and can thus greatly reduce computational and storage overhead.\nBEV-based methods compress 3D space along the z-axis and only encode point features on the ground plane [ref]48.\nRange-view-based methods transform point clouds to spherical coordinates and project them along the radial axis to obtain the 2D range view features  1 .\nHowever, the loss of structural information during the 3D-2D projection results in lower performance compared to voxel-based methods.\nIn addition, 2D projection-based methods require complicated post-processing techniques 7 8  to restore 3D structural information, making it difficult to deploy them in real-world applications. Recently, TPVFormer 6 proposed a Tri-Perspective View (TPV) representation for vision-based 3D perception, which uses three orthogonal complementary 2D planes to model the 3D scene.\nDue to the complementary properties of the three planes, TPV representation can effectively restore the 3D structure while maintaining efficiency.\nStill, TPVFormer only employs TPV to model already extracted image features.\nIt remains unknown how to transform LiDAR point clouds into TPV and how to process them using 2D image backbones.\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are the first to effectively apply TPV to LiDAR-based 3D perception.\nWe further propose a Cylindrical TPV representation to adapt to LiDAR point clouds and employ a spatial group pooling method to effectively transform LiDAR into TPV with minimum information loss. 3D Occupancy Prediction.\nThe LiDAR segmentation task predicts labels only for the sparse lidar points, and thus cannot provide a comprehensive and fine-grained description of the 3D scene, which is essential for autonomous driving systems.\nTo address this, recent methods  [ref]39  started exploring dense semantic predictions for all the voxels in the surrounding space, formulated as the 3D occupancy prediction task [ref]37 .\nThis task requires a simultaneous prediction of the occupancy status for all voxels and semantic labels for occupied voxels.\nBy modeling densely distributed voxels in 3D space, the 3D occupancy prediction task achieves a fine-grained and complete perception of the full space.\nTherefore, 3D occupancy prediction is a promising and challenging task in the field of autonomous driving perception.\nThe dense prediction space motivates most existing works to adopt a voxel-based model 2   [ref]39 [ref]37.\nFor example, SCPNet [ref]39 utilizes a 3D completion network without downsampling and distills rich knowledge from the multi-frame model.\nL-CONet [ref]37 introduces a coarse-to-fine supervision strategy to reduce heavy computational burdens. Though voxel-based methods can model fine-grained structures in 3D space, the dense voxel features introduce a huge storage overhead [ref]39 [ref]37.\nDue to the computation resource limitation, only low-resolution occupancy predictions can be obtained, which severely degrades the performance.\nHowever, it is non-trivial to directly adapt existing 2D-prediction-based lidar segmentation methods to 3D occupancy prediction due to the difficulty to recover 3D dense features from 2D projected features.\nIn this paper, we address this problem by transforming LiDAR point clouds to the proposed cylindrical TPV representation followed by 2D image backbones.\nWe can then effectively restore the 3D structured representation from the processed TPV to obtain high-resolution 3D occupancy predictions.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: state-of-the-art methods     usually split the 3D space into uniform voxels and process voxels with 3D convolutional networks, resulting in dense cubic features to describe the 3D scenes [ref]37.\nDespite the strong performance of voxel-based methods, they usually suffer from significant computational and storage burdens due to the complex 3D operations on a vast number of voxels\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
