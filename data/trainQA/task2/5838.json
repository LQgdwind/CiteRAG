      "content": "Paper Title: Preserving Linear Separability in Continual Learning by Backward Feature Projection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nContinual Learning Settings.\nWe follow   [ref]8 and test all methods using both the Class-IL and Task-IL settings in our CL experiments.\nBoth Class-IL and Task-IL split the dataset into a sequence of tasks, each containing a disjoint set of classes, while task identifiers are available during testing under Task-IL.\nTask-IL thus has extra advantages during inference (e.g. select proper prediction head) and becomes an easier CL scenario.\nOur work is designed for Class-IL and its Task-IL performance is obtained by only considering the logits within the ground truth task. Datasets.\nWe evaluate baselines and our methods on the following datasets using varying buffer sizes:\nSplit CIFAR-10 divides the original CIFAR-10¬†0 dataset into 5 tasks, with each task composed of 2 classes. Each class includes 5000 training and 1000 testing images of shape 32√ó\\times32.\nSplit CIFAR-100 divides CIFAR-100¬†0 into 10 tasks, with 10 classes per task. Each class has 500 training and 100 testing images of shape 32√ó\\times32.\nSplit TinyImageNet splits TinyImageNet¬† into 10 tasks, with 20 classes per task. Each class contains 500 training images, 50 validation images, and 50 testing images.\nThese datasets are challenging and state-of-the-art continual learning methods still fall far behind the Joint Training (JT) baseline, especially in the Class-IL setting as shown in Table¬†1. Metrics. Following¬†[ref]8   , we report the performance of each compared method using Final Average Accuracy (FAA). Suppose aitsuperscriptsubscriptùëéùëñùë°a_{i}^{t} is the testing classification accuracy on the ithsuperscriptùëñthi^{\\text{th}} task when the training finishes on task tùë°t, FAA is the accuracy of the final model averaged all tasks: We also report the Final Forgetting (FF), which reflects the accuracy drop between the peak performance on one task and its final performance: Lower FF means less forgetting and better CL performance. Training details.\nWe use ResNet-18¬† as the network backbone, and instead of the simple reservoir buffer used in¬†[ref]8, we use class-balanced reservoir sampling¬† for pushing examples into the buffer.\nAll the baselines we compare are updated with this change.\nWe use an SGD optimizer to optimize the model fŒ∏subscriptùëìùúÉf_{\\theta} and another SGD+Momentum optimizer with a learning rate 0.10.10.1 for the projection matrix Aùê¥A.\nThe optimizers and the matrix Aùê¥A are re-initialized at the beginning of each task.\nThe network is trained for 50 epochs per task for Split CIFAR-10 and Split CIFAR-100 and 100 epochs per task for Split TinyImageNet. The learning rate is divided by 10 after a certain number of epochs within each task (5 5  for Split CIFAR-100 and 5  53560755  5 for Split TinyImageNet).\nIn this work, we focus on this offline CL setting where each task is trained for multiple epochs. Although we are also interested in online CL, multi-epoch training helps disentangle underfitting and catastrophic forgetting¬†[ref]8 .\nBFP introduces only one extra hyperparameter Œ≥ùõæ\\gamma, which is set to 1 for all experiments. We found that Œ≥=1ùõæ1\\gamma=1 works well for all datasets and buffer sizes and did not perform hyperparameter searches for individual experiment settings. Hyperparameters Œ±ùõº\\alpha and Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta used in Equation¬†12 are adopted from¬†[ref]8.\nMost baselines adopt different hyperparameters for different settings, for which we adopt the hyperparameters that have been optimized by grid search by¬†[ref]8 and  for a fair comparison. The details can be found in the¬†Appendix.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Continual Learning Settings.\nWe follow   [ref]8 and test all methods using both the Class-IL and Task-IL settings in our CL experiments.\nBoth Class-IL and Task-IL split the dataset into a sequence of tasks, each containing a disjoint set of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
