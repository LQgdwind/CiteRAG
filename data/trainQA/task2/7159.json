      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Learning-Based Detection for Marker Codes over Insertion and Deletion Channels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nChannels with synchronization errors , including insertions and deletions, have appeared in various communication and storage systems, such as wireless communication [ref]3, racetrack memory , and DNA storage . Synchronization errors can cause catastrophic consequences for communication systems. Even a single insertion/deletion error makes quite a few bits different between the transmitter and the receiver. Traditional error correcting codes for substitution errors cannot be used in this scenario. Thus, constructing efficient codes against insertions and deletions has received a lot of research interest. For channels with fixed number of insertion/deletion errors, zero-error number-theoretic codes have been studied extensively. The well-known Varshamov-Tenengolts (VT) code, invented several decades ago, is a single insertion/deletion error correcting code with asymptotically optimal redundancy . Helberg et al. extended VT codes to multiple insertion/deletion errors via a modified Fibonacci sequence, but the coding rate is rather low . More recently, number-theoretic codes correcting two deletions with low redundancy have been successfully constructed [ref]80. However, the decoding algorithm becomes complicated when extending the code constructed in  to more than two insertion/deletion errors 1. When relaxing the adversarial noise assumption and zero-error requirement, probabilistic synchronization channels and code constructions that tolerate a small probability of errors are studied, which often lead to practical solutions for multiple insertion/deletion errors. Davey et al. introduced a random insertions, deletions, and substitutions (IDS) channel model and designed a concatenated scheme using an inner watermark code and an outer low-density parity-check (LDPC) code over a nonbinary field 2. The synchronization is recovered using a forward-backward (FB) algorithm via a pseudorandom watermark sequence shared by the transmitter and the receiver. Later, Ratzer proposed marker codes for IDS channels which use periodic markers inserted into the information sequence as inner codes and binary LDPC codes as outer codes 3. The synchronization of marker codes is also recovered by the FB algorithm via markers. Compared with watermark codes, marker codes sometimes exhibit lower decoding complexity and better error rate performances. The methods of the above two codes for IDS channels have also been improved and extended to other scenarios in recent years 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2. In this paper, we investigate a decoding problem of marker codes for insertion and deletion channels that is not considered in the related literature before. When decoding marker codes or other similar codes for insertion and deletion channels, the channel state information (CSI), such as insertion and deletion probabilities, should be known perfectly at the receiver. Then the FB algorithm can be used to recover synchronization optimally for each transmitted symbol. However, the performance of FB algorithm for synchronization recovery is significantly degraded in the presence of CSI uncertainty, i.e., the insertion and deletion probabilities are not known accurately at the receiver. Moreover, when the accurate channel model is unknown, e.g., the insertion and deletion events are not random and independent, the FB algorithm may not be optimal. Motivated by the application of deep learning for physical layer communications 3 4 5 6 7 8, we propose deep learning-based detection methods for marker code over insertion and deletion channels to solve the performance degradation problem due to CSI uncertainty or inaccurate channel models. Our study is also driven by the complexity of DNA storage channel model related to insertion/deletion errors. There are various kinds of errors in DNA storage systems, including insertions, deletions, substitutions, and sequence losses 9. The errors are not random, and sometimes burst, during DNA synthesis and DNA sequencing 9  . This may lead to inaccurate estimation of CSI or even inaccurate characterization of the DNA storage channel model.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Channels with synchronization errors , including insertions and deletions, have appeared in various communication and storage systems, such as wireless communication [ref]3, racetrack memory , and DNA storage .
