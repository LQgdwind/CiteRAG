      "content": "Paper Title: 27 Open Problems in Kolmogorov Complexity\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMulti-source network coding problems have been extensively studied in the context of Shannon’s information theory. In these problems we are given a network (a directed graph), where some nodes are associated with input sources (mutually correlated random variables, usually with some properties of ergodicity), and some nodes are terminals, which wish to reconstruct specific parts of the input data. The edges play the role of communication channels with limited capacities. The aim is to establish the relation between the entropy profile of the input sources and the capacities of the edges that allow vertices to perform encoding/decoding satisfying the capacity constraints and allow the terminal nodes to obtain the desired data. Such problems can be studied in the framework of algorithmic information theory as well, where the data are represented by strings, and their correlations are measured in terms of Kolmogorov complexity. One specific example, motivated by the problem of Gray–Wyner profile discussed above, is shown in Fig. 4. At the source (the leftmost vertex) both strings x𝑥x and y𝑦y are known. Three channels of bounded capacity (the dotted lines) connect the source with three intermediate nodes, and then the unlimited capacity channels (the solid lines) connect intermediate nodes with terminals (two vertices on the right) that should output messages x𝑥x and y𝑦y (respectively). For this network we ask whether there exist some messages on all edges that have complexity bounded by the edge capacity such that no new information is created at every vertex (the outgoing messages are simple given the incoming ones). There are three edges of bounded capacity, so we look for three messages: q𝑞q of complexity at most γ𝛾\\gamma for the middle edge, and p𝑝p and r𝑟r of capacities at most α𝛼\\alpha and β𝛽\\beta for the top and bottom edge. (The edges of unbounded capacity may just transmit all the available information.) The messages p𝑝p and q𝑞q together should be enough to reconstruct x𝑥x, so C⁡(x|q)≤αCconditional𝑥𝑞𝛼\\operatorname{\\mathrm{C}\\mskip 1.0mu}(x\\mskip 2.0mu|\\mskip 2.0muq)\\leq\\alpha; for the same reasons, C⁡(y|q)≤βCconditional𝑦𝑞𝛽\\operatorname{\\mathrm{C}\\mskip 1.0mu}(y\\mskip 2.0mu|\\mskip 2.0muq)\\leq\\beta. So, if the information transmission problem is solvable, the triple (α,β,γ)𝛼𝛽𝛾(\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma) belongs to the Gray–Wyner profile. The reverse statement is also true: if there is some q𝑞q such that C⁡(q)≤γC𝑞𝛾\\operatorname{\\mathrm{C}\\mskip 1.0mu}(q)\\leq\\gamma, C⁡(x|q)≤αCconditional𝑥𝑞𝛼\\operatorname{\\mathrm{C}\\mskip 1.0mu}(x\\mskip 2.0mu|\\mskip 2.0muq)\\leq\\alpha, and C⁡(y|q)≤βCconditional𝑦𝑞𝛽\\operatorname{\\mathrm{C}\\mskip 1.0mu}(y\\mskip 2.0mu|\\mskip 2.0muq)\\leq\\beta, then we can let p𝑝p and q𝑞q be the shortest programs that transform q𝑞q to x𝑥x and y𝑦y, respectively. The only missing conditions are that p,q,r𝑝𝑞𝑟p,q,r are simple given x𝑥x and y𝑦y (the information transmission problem requires that no new information appears in the leftmost vertex). If this is not the case, we can replace p,q,r𝑝𝑞𝑟p,q,r by other strings that have the required properties (have correct lengths and are enough to reconstruct x𝑥x and y𝑦y) found by search; note that the properties are computably enumerable, so we can wait until the first triple appears, and this triple will be simple given x𝑥x and y𝑦y. We reformulated the notion of Gray–Wyner profile in terms of a multi-source information problem. For each network there are simple conditions corresponding to the information flow through each cut of the network that are necessary for satisfying the constraints (derived as in the max-flow min-cut theorem, see [47, Chapter 12] for the details). For example, for the Gray–Wyner network one can consider three cuts (Figure 5). The first one says that p,q,r𝑝𝑞𝑟p,q,r together should provide enough information to reconstruct x,y𝑥𝑦x,y, so the triple (α,β,γ)𝛼𝛽𝛾(\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma) can be in the Gray–Wyner profile only if α+β+γ≥C⁡(x,y)𝛼𝛽𝛾C𝑥𝑦\\alpha+\\beta+\\gamma\\geq\\operatorname{\\mathrm{C}\\mskip 1.0mu}(x,y). The second and third cuts show that α+γ≥C⁡(x)𝛼𝛾C𝑥\\alpha+\\gamma\\geq\\operatorname{\\mathrm{C}\\mskip 1.0mu}(x) and β+γ≥C⁡(y)𝛽𝛾C𝑦\\beta+\\gamma\\geq\\operatorname{\\mathrm{C}\\mskip 1.0mu}(y) for every point in the Gray–Wyner profile. We get some upper bound for the Gray–Wyner profile, and this upper bound is reached if the common information exists. For the cases where the common information does not exist, the Gray–Wyner profile is smaller, and these necessary conditions are no longer sufficient. For some other networks the information flow conditions are not only always necessary but also always sufficient. One of the first examples was Muchnik’s theorem on conditional codes  that deals with the network in Fig. 6. Here the terminal needs to reconstruct x𝑥x knowing y𝑦y, and gets some information about x𝑥x through the bounded channel; how much information does it need? In other words, we are looking for a program p𝑝p that is simple conditional on a string x𝑥x and that produces x𝑥x given a string y𝑦y as a condition. Obviously, the size of such a program cannot be less than C⁡(x|y)Cconditional𝑥𝑦\\operatorname{\\mathrm{C}\\mskip 1.0mu}(x\\mskip 2.0mu|\\mskip 2.0muy), which is by definition the length of the shortest program that transforms y𝑦y (known to the receiver) to x𝑥x. The difficulty is that the sender does not know y𝑦y (if it knew y𝑦y, then such a program could be found by search: we need only to know its length, and this is logarithmic amount of information). This problem has the following interpretation. Suppose that Alice wants to send a document x𝑥x to Bob, who holds an older version y𝑦y not known by Alice. Then Alice would like to get a short description of x𝑥x given y𝑦y (something like a diff file), without having y𝑦y.333This problem is known as document exchange and also as information reconciliation in the theoretical computer science (TCS) literature, and as asymmetric Slepian–Wolf coding and also as compression with side information at the receiver in the information theory (IT) literature. Typically the scenario in TCS is that the Hamming distance or the edit distance between x𝑥x and y𝑦y is small, and in IT that x𝑥x and y𝑦y are realizations of random variables X𝑋X and Y𝑌Y with small entropy H​(X|Y)𝐻conditional𝑋𝑌H(X\\mskip 2.0mu|\\mskip 2.0muY). The corresponding scenario in Kolmogorov complexity (namely C⁡(x|y)Cconditional𝑥𝑦\\operatorname{\\mathrm{C}\\mskip 1.0mu}(x\\mskip 2.0mu|\\mskip 2.0muy) is small) is arguably the least restrictive one in this group. Muchnik’s theorem demonstrates that, surprisingly, the absence of y𝑦y does not cost too much the sender: the “overhead” is only logarithmic. That is, there exists a program p𝑝p of length C⁡(x|y)+O​(log⁡C⁡(x,y))Cconditional𝑥𝑦𝑂C𝑥𝑦\\operatorname{\\mathrm{C}\\mskip 1.0mu}(x\\mskip 2.0mu|\\mskip 2.0muy)+O(\\log\\operatorname{\\mathrm{C}\\mskip 1.0mu}(x,y)) producing x𝑥x conditioned by y𝑦y such that C⁡(p|x)=O​(log⁡C⁡(x,y))Cconditional𝑝𝑥𝑂C𝑥𝑦\\operatorname{\\mathrm{C}\\mskip 1.0mu}(p\\mskip 2.0mu|\\mskip 2.0mux)=O(\\log\\operatorname{\\mathrm{C}\\mskip 1.0mu}(x,y)). (In the next section we shall see that in some circumstances the program p𝑝p can be found efficiently.) Thus, the capacity of the bounded channel in Fig. 6 is necessarily at least C⁡(x|y)Cconditional𝑥𝑦\\operatorname{\\mathrm{C}\\mskip 1.0mu}(x\\mskip 2.0mu|\\mskip 2.0muy), and Muchnik’s theorem guarantees that this capacity is essentially sufficient. Another network for which the information flow conditions are always sufficient, is the Slepian–Wolf network in Fig. 7; it was considered in [ref]48 in the Shannon information theory setting; the algorithmic information theory version was studied in  (English version ),, . Here the receiver wants to know both strings x𝑥x and y𝑦y, and two senders know x𝑥x and y𝑦y respectively. The first is allowed to send α𝛼\\alpha bits, while the second is allowed to send β𝛽\\beta bits. For which α𝛼\\alpha and β𝛽\\beta is this possible? Note that for unbounded β𝛽\\beta we get the previous information transmission problem. There are information flow bounds: α+β≥C⁡(x,y)𝛼𝛽C𝑥𝑦\\alpha+\\beta\\geq\\operatorname{\\mathrm{C}\\mskip 1.0mu}(x,y), since the receiver should reconstruct the pair (x,y)𝑥𝑦(x,y) having only α+β𝛼𝛽\\alpha+\\beta bits of information; α≥C⁡(x|y)𝛼Cconditional𝑥𝑦\\alpha\\geq\\operatorname{\\mathrm{C}\\mskip 1.0mu}(x\\mskip 2.0mu|\\mskip 2.0muy), since the bottom sender and the receiver together initially know only y𝑦y, and should reconstruct x𝑥x getting α𝛼\\alpha bits of information; β≥C⁡(y|x)𝛽Cconditional𝑦𝑥\\beta\\geq\\operatorname{\\mathrm{C}\\mskip 1.0mu}(y\\mskip 2.0mu|\\mskip 2.0mux), for symmetric reasons. Slepian and Wolf [ref]48 proved in the Shannon information theory setting that these information flow conditions are not only necessary, but also sufficient. Algorithmic information versions of this theorem with increasingly better parameters were obtained in    . The strongest result is in  and it says that the senders can use probabilistic polynomial-time algorithms to find messages of lengths α𝛼\\alpha and β𝛽\\beta (plus log2⁡(n/ϵ)superscript2𝑛italic-ϵ\\log^{2}(n/\\epsilon) overhead) that solve the Slepian–Wolf transmission problem with probability (1−ϵ)1italic-ϵ(1-\\epsilon), provided of course that α𝛼\\alpha and β𝛽\\beta satisfy the necessary information flow conditions.444Note that the senders do not know each other data and, thus, the problem in Fig. 7 is that of distributed compression. The interpretation of the Slepian-Wolf theorem is that, amazingly enough, distributed compression can achieve the same compression lengths as centralized compression (in which the senders share data and collaborate). We see that there are non-trivial results of both types (when the information flow conditions are sufficient and when they are not). So we come to the following question: For which networks are the information flow conditions sufficient for the existence of a solution?\n  The relation between Shannon and algorithmic information theory approaches to network flow is not well understood. The Shannon information theory considers random variables as sources (and wants to reconstruct them at the destinations). To compare it with algorithmic setting, we consider strings obtained by N𝑁N independent samples of all the variables. If the information flow is achievable in the Shannon’s sense, then one can use the same coding/decoding functions to solve the problem in the algorithmic setting (though maybe it does not give us logarithmic precision). The reverse direction looks even less clear: the reason is that the algorithmic setting is non-uniform and “advices” of logarithmic size are allowed in the intermediate vertices. Is the reverse statement true? If the information flow is not achievable in the Shannon’s sense for independent samples of random variables, may it happen that with high probability the corresponding algorithmic information flow problem is solvable for those samples? More generally, what are the connections between algorithmic and Shannon’s multi-source information theory?  Even for the Slepian–Wolf network where there are results for both Shannon and algorithmic settings, the parallelism between them is quite perplexing: none of these theorems can currently be derived from the other one. Is there a natural statement that would imply both the Slepian–Wolf theorem and its algorithmic version?\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: guarantees that this capacity is essentially sufficient.
