      "content": "Paper Title: Audio-Visual Event Localization via Recursive Fusion by Joint Co-Attention\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAudio-Visual Event Localization aims to identify the event of interest in a video sequence and predict what category the event belongs to.\nTian et al. [ref]36 first define audio-visual event localization problem aiming to detect event which is both audible and visible. They design an audio-guided attention dual-LSTM network that captures each uni-modal representation and fuses them by concatenation for the final prediction.\nLin et al.  propose a dual-modality sequence-sequence framework that explores the global features of audio and visual modalities. Wu et al.  introduce a dual attention matching mechanism that conducts cross-matching across modalities. They also leverage the global event feature by only considering segments containing audio-visual events, i.e., they filter out background segments to compute the global feature. However, determining background segments often requires more supervision. In our work, we propose to use less supervision to fulfill the task. Different from [ref]36, we introduce a recursive layer that can be stacked and therefore recursively fuses two uni-modal representations multiple times to obtain more robust representations. Sound Localization is to associate certain regions in a video that has the corresponding sound with visual-aid. To this end, Hershey et al.  use a Gaussian process model to measure the mutual information of the audio and visual motion. Owens and Efros  propose a multi-sensory model that learns audio-visual correspondence in a self-supervised style to align the audio and visual frames and then localizes the sound source afterward. To investigate the correspondences between audio and visual components, Hu et al.  propose a deep multimodal clustering network that adds similar parts among two modalities to the final output. Zhao et al.  propose PixelPlayer that learns to locate image regions by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled videos. Arandjelovic and Zisserman  design two sub-networks that individually learn from audio tracks and image frames. After learning, they fuse two branches to predict correspondence. Senocak et al.  develop a localization module that is based on the attention mechanism to capture the correlation between audio and visual features. The attention mechanism they adopt is quite plain where they transpose visual embedding and then multiply with audio embedding. Multimodal Attention involves interaction at least two features from different modalities. In Video Question Answering (VQA), Lu et al.  propose a hierarchical attention technique that co-attends to the features extracted from text language modality and visual modality. Another work in VQA, Nguyen and Okatani  introduce a memory-based co-attention technique that enables dense interactions between the two modalities, and then both modalities contribute to the selection of the right answer. In emotion recognition, Zadeh et al.  exploit a small neural network that takes the concatenated cell states of three different LSTMs for language, audio and visual components as input and then output the attended features. Wang et al.  present an attention gating mechanism where they try to learn a nonverbal shift vector by weighting features from different modalities. Different from the two aforementioned work that only perform attention operation once, we develop a joint co-attention mechanism that can be recursively performed. Multimodal Fusion also known as the integration of information from multiple modalities , allows for more robust representations by leveraging multiple modalities and it can be categorized into two types: model-agnostic and model-based. Here, we only review the model-agnostic approaches, i.e., early fusion , late fusion 6  and hybrid fusion 7 [ref]40 as it is more related to our work. Early fusion combines low-level features of each modality while late fusion uses uni-modal decision values based on a fusion algorithm, e.g., averaging, weighting. Hybrid fusion, or double fusion, attempts to take advantage of both early and late fusion mechanisms. It has been widely used in the research of multimodal learning, e.g., multimodal speech recognition   and multimedia event detection 7 [ref]40 5. Besides a bigger picture of fusion strategies, there are many specific fusion strategies in terms of feature-level. Rahman et al. 5 adopt element-wise addition or multiplication, channel-wise concatenation, and fully-connected neural network to fuse information from three different modalities: language, audio, and visual modality.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: Audio-Visual Event Localization aims to identify the event of interest in a video sequence and predict what category the event belongs to.\nTian et al. [ref]36 first define audio-visual event localization problem aiming to detect event which is both audible and visible.
