      "content": "Paper Title: Deciding branching hyperproperties for real time systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAfter Clarkson and Schneider introduced hyperproperties, there has been an increasing interest in verifying hyperproperties. Clarkson et al. proposed temporal logic HyperLTL and HyperCTL* to describe hyperproperties and showed that when restricted to finite Kripke structures, the model-checking problem of HyperLTL and HyperCTL* is decidable. They also establish complexity results for the verification problem.\nAutomated tools like MCHyper, AutoHyper for model checking and satisfiability checking, EAHyper for satisfiability checking and RVHyper for runtime monitoring have been built. To express security hyperproperties in a timed setting, different hyper-timed logics have been proposed.\nA pioneering work is , which extends STL with quantification over real-time signals and is studied over cyber-physical systems. Linear-time HyperMTL that extends MTL was introduced in [ref]9. The real-time systems in [ref]9 are modeled as timed Kripke structures, that are Kripke structures with time elapsing on transitions. The semantics used in [ref]9 is point-based, and the model of time is discrete-time. The logic is defined over finite timed words but is syntactically different from ours. They show that the verification problem for the logic is decidable for a nontrivial fragment of the logic by reducing the problem to checking untimed hyperproperties. In , linear-time temporal logic Time Window Temporal Logic (TWTL) is extended to reason about hyperproperties. Like [ref]9, the models are timed Kripke structures, the semantics considered is point-based, and the model of time is discrete time. The verification problem for the resulting logic is shown to be undecidable, and the model-checking algorithms are given for the alternation-free fragment of the logic. Linear-time HyperMITL has been proposed in  by extending MITL. Unlike our work, they also consider past operators in the logic. The semantics used in  is point-based, and the model of time used is continuous/dense.  consider decidability for many fragments of HyperMITL, and most of the fragments are undecidable over the unbounded time domain. The most interesting decidability result is verifying\nHyperMITL is decidable for bounded time domains. While the proof is not provided, the authors hint that the proof could be accomplished by a reduction to the satisfiability problem for QPTL  which is known to be decidable . Our work extends MTL to HCMTL* that allows us to express branching hyperproperties in addition to linear-time hyperproperties. Like , the model of time is taken to be dense. However, we also consider the interval-based semantics in addition to point-based semantics. We show that the time-bounded verification for HCMTL* is decidable. In contrast to , our decidability result is obtained by a reduction to the satisfiability problem of MSO with order and successor. The challenge is to encode the semantics of branching logic as well as time automaton into an MSO formula. We also show that the decision problems for verifying HCMTL* under point-based semantics can be reduced to the verification problem for interval-based semantics. This allows us to transfer decidability results under interval-based semantics to point-based semantics, and undecidability results from point-based semantics to interval-based semantics. One difference from [ref]9  is that they distinguish between synchronous and asynchronous hyperproperties. Intuitively, in synchronous semantics, observations on all traces happen at the same time, while in asynchronous semantics they may happen at different times. Since our focus is interval-based semantics, our semantics is asynchronous in principle. HyperTidy CTL* logic is presented in [ref]7 to reason about timed hyperproperties of timed cryptographic protocols in the Dolev-Yao model . HyperTidy CTL* is also a branching logic and is similar to HCMTL*, but has significant differences. First, it is interpreted over timed processes and not timed automata, a variant of applied pi calculus  augmented with timing constructs. The logic has special\natomic constructors and atomic formulas to model the attacker’s knowledge and actions. For example, it has the atomic formula X⊢uproves𝑋𝑢X\\vdash u, where X𝑋X is a variable that ranges over recipes. Intuitively, a recipe is a term in applied pi calculus  that represents a computation by a Dolev-Yao attacker from the messages it possesses, and the formula X⊢uproves𝑋𝑢X\\vdash u represents that the message u𝑢u can be computed from the recipe assigned to X𝑋X. The logic allows quantification over recipe and message variables in addition to the path variables. Further, the temporal operators are not annotated explicitly with intervals, and the semantics is equivalent to taking all intervals to be (0,∞).0(0,\\infty). It is shown in  [ref]7 that the problem of checking that a process satisfies a HyperTidy CTL* is undecidable, even for the LTL fragment. The proof relies on the fact that the problem of checking whether the attacker can compute a message u𝑢u from a finite set of messages is undecidable .\nThis undecidability result is incomparable to the undecidability of HCMTL* presented in this paper as both the models and the logic in [ref]7 are much richer than ours. In  , a variant of HyperTidy CTL* is considered. The formula\nX⊢uproves𝑋𝑢X\\vdash u is replaced by K​(u)𝐾𝑢K(u), which intuitively means that u𝑢u can be computed by the attacker from its intercepted messages using some recipe. Thus, there are no recipe variables. The quantification of message variables also takes a restricted form. The temporal operators are now decorated with intervals as they are needed to specify liveness properties such as timeliness and fairness properties as discussed in Section III.\nThey consider the problem of verifying whether a process satisfies a HyperTidy CTL* formula is satisfied by a process when the number of protocol sessions is bounded and when the cryptographic primitives are modeled using subterm-convergent equational theories . They show that the verification problem becomes EXPSPACE complete for this variant. The decision procedure is based on constraint solving. Please note that this decision procedure is incomparable to ours as we consider abstract finite timed automata and not processes. Further, the assumption of a bounded number of sessions means that the “transition system” underlying a process in  is acyclic, and any trace necessarily has a bounded number of actions/observations that depend on the process being verified. We make no such assumptions, and traces can have any number of observations. However, the transition system underlying   is infinite branching; hence, the total number of traces is still infinite in this setting. In contrast, our transition systems are finite-branching, and the number of traces is infinite because we allow for any number of actions along a trace.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: been proposed.\nA pioneering work is , which extends STL with quantification over real-time signals and is studied over cyber-physical systems.
