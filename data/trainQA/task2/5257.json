      "content": "Paper Title: Latent Evolution Model for Change Point Detection in Time-varying Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBy computing the prediction network 𝑮^T+1subscript^𝑮𝑇1\\hat{\\bm{G}}_{T+1} for timestamp T𝑇T+1, we can compare it with the actual network 𝑮T+1subscript𝑮𝑇1\\bm{G}_{T+1} to check whether 𝑮T+1subscript𝑮𝑇1\\bm{G}_{T+1} is a change point or not. Specifically, we use the Laplacian-spectrum-based method which has shown a state-of-the-art performance in graph comparisons . The eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix capture the structural properties of the corresponding graph. Note that real-world applications contain both undirected and directed graphs. For the undirected graphs, we construct a normalized Laplacian matrix 𝑳tsubscript𝑳𝑡\\bm{L}_{t}, defined as 𝑳t=𝑰−𝑫t−1/2​𝑾t​𝑫t−1/2subscript𝑳𝑡𝑰superscriptsubscript𝑫𝑡12subscript𝑾𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑫𝑡12\\bm{L}_{t}=\\bm{I}-\\bm{D}_{t}^{-1/2}\\bm{W}_{t}\\bm{D}_{t}^{-1/2}, where 𝑰𝑰\\bm{I} is the identity matrix; 𝑾tsubscript𝑾𝑡\\bm{W}_{t} is the weight matrix of 𝑮tsubscript𝑮𝑡\\bm{G}_{t} and 𝑫tsubscript𝑫𝑡\\bm{D}_{t} is a diagonal matrix 𝑫t,(i;i)subscript𝑫𝑡𝑖𝑖\\bm{D}_{t,(i;i)} = ∑j(𝑮t,(i;i))subscript𝑗subscript𝑮𝑡𝑖𝑖\\sum_{j}(\\bm{G}_{t,(i;i)}).\nFor the directed graphs, we leverage the method proposed in  to build the Laplacian matrix: where ϕbold-italic-ϕ\\bm{\\phi} is the matrix with the Perron vector  of 𝑷𝑷\\bm{P} in the diagonal; 𝑷𝑷\\bm{P} is a transition probability matrix . Given the Laplacian matrices for all timestamps, i.e., 𝑳1subscript𝑳1\\bm{L}_{1}, ⋯⋯\\cdots, 𝑳T+1subscript𝑳𝑇1\\bm{L}_{T+1} and 𝑳^T+1subscript^𝑳𝑇1\\hat{\\bm{L}}_{T+1}, where 𝑳T+1subscript𝑳𝑇1\\bm{L}_{T+1} is built by actual network 𝑮T+1subscript𝑮𝑇1\\bm{G}_{T+1}; 𝑳^T+1subscript^𝑳𝑇1\\hat{\\bm{L}}_{T+1} is built by the prediction 𝑮^T+1subscript^𝑮𝑇1\\hat{\\bm{G}}_{T+1}. We follow a well-performed metric that utilises the singular values calculated of Laplacian matrices 𝑳tsubscript𝑳𝑡\\bm{L}_{t} as the network attributes . Then, the vector made up of singular values is denoted as 𝝈→tsubscript→𝝈𝑡\\overrightarrow{\\bm{\\sigma}}_{t}, t𝑡t ∈\\in [1, T𝑇T+1]. Let 𝝈→asubscript→𝝈𝑎\\overrightarrow{\\bm{\\sigma}}_{a} (𝝈→T+1subscript→𝝈𝑇1\\overrightarrow{\\bm{\\sigma}}_{T+1}) denote the vector of actual network, 𝝈→psubscript→𝝈𝑝\\overrightarrow{\\bm{\\sigma}}_{p} (singular values of 𝑳^T+1subscript^𝑳𝑇1\\hat{\\bm{L}}_{T+1}) denote the vector of prediction network. The first anomaly score 𝒁1subscript𝒁1\\bm{Z}_{1} based on the cosine distance is defined as: It is evident that the more dissimilar between the prediction and the actual network, 𝒁1subscript𝒁1\\bm{Z}_{1} is closer to 1, and vice versa111The range of 𝒁1subscript𝒁1\\bm{Z}_{1} is  [ref]1 because of the non-negativity of 𝝈→→𝝈\\overrightarrow{\\bm{\\sigma}}. The score of 𝒁1subscript𝒁1\\bm{Z}_{1} reflects the difference between the prediction and ground truth. This evaluation is more suitable for the temporal network that evolves gradually. However, the normal graph pattern extracted from the previous networks is also important since it can reflect the average evolution representation. Thus we introduce the second anomaly score 𝒁2subscript𝒁2\\bm{Z}_{2} which considers the normal graph patterns. Let 𝝈→n​o​rsubscript→𝝈𝑛𝑜𝑟\\overrightarrow{\\bm{\\sigma}}_{nor} be the average vector of previous snapshots, i.e., 𝝈→n​o​rsubscript→𝝈𝑛𝑜𝑟\\overrightarrow{\\bm{\\sigma}}_{nor} = (∑t=1T𝝈→t)/T\\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\overrightarrow{\\bm{\\sigma}}_{t})/T, 𝒁2subscript𝒁2\\bm{Z}_{2} is defined as: Finally, the combined anomaly score 𝒁𝒁\\bm{Z} is a trade-off between 𝒁1subscript𝒁1\\bm{Z}_{1} and 𝒁2subscript𝒁2\\bm{Z}_{2}: where α𝛼\\alpha is the trade-off factor. Algorithm 1 summarizes our learning and detection process in LEM-CPD.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: is defined as: It is evident that the more dissimilar between the prediction and the actual network, 𝒁1subscript𝒁1\\bm{Z}_{1} is closer to 1, and vice versa111The range of 𝒁1subscript𝒁1\\bm{Z}_{1} is  [ref]1 because of the non-negativity of 𝝈→→𝝈\\overrightarrow{\\bm{\\sigma}}.
