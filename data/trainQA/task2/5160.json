      "content": "Paper Title: A Unified Framework for Contrastive Learning from a Perspective of Affinity Matrix\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nContrastive Learning.\nContrastive learning based SSL methods aim to learn a feature embedding space by simultaneously maximizing the agreement between positive examples and the disagreement with negative examples. That is to say, both positive and negative examples will be involved in the unsupervised pre-training. A variety of methods   5     have been proposed along this paradigm, such as NPID , CMC , CPC v2 5, InfoMin , MoCo  , SimCLR , PCL , AdCo  and so on. In generally, an InfoNCE like loss is used and optimized in this type of methods, so as to employ a large memory bank or a large batch size to obtain massive negative examples for excellent performance. Non-Contrastive Learning.\nDifferent from the contrastive SSL methods, non-contrastive learning based SSL methods try to completely discard the large number of negative examples for reducing the computation overhead. Also, to avoid trivial solutions caused by not using negatives as anchors, some asymmetric structures or operations are normally designed, such as asymmetric embedding network 2 [ref]7, momentum encoder 2, non-differentiable operators , and stop-gradients 2 [ref]7. For example, BYOL 2 predicts the representation of one view via another view based on bootstrapping by using an online network and a momentum network, where both asymmetric embedding network and stop-gradients are used. After that, SimSiam [ref]7 discards the momentum encoder in BYOL and shows that only using an asymmetric embedding network and stop-gradients can achieve excellent performance with a small batch size. Recently, some latest works attempt to introduce vision transformers instead of convolutional neural networks into SSL, such as DINO  and EsViT . Whitening Regularization.\nWhitening transformation is a classical pre-processing step to transform random variables to orthogonality, which has been frequently introduced into SSL in recent works. Specifically, W-MSE  scatters all the sample representations into a spherical distribution using a whitening transform and penalizes the positive pairs which are far from each other to avoid the collapse problem. Barlow Twins 1 proposes to makes the cross-correlation matrix as close to the identity matrix as possible by reducing redundancy between their components to learn unsupervised representations. In addition, VICReg  explicitly makes the embedding vectors of samples within a batch to be different via a new variance term based on the former work of Barlow Twins. DBN 8 proposes to standardize the variance and the covariance matrix to address the complete collapse and dimensional collapse issues, respectively. Recently, Zero-CL 3 fully combines both instance-wise whitening and feature-wise whitening into the contrastive learning to prevent trivial solutions. Consistency Regularization.\nAs a core idea of many state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods  3, consistency regularization is also introduced into the field of SSL to further boost the performance of unsupervised models, recently. For example, CO2 7 exploits the consistency assumption that a robust model should generate similar representation vectors on perturbed versions of the same image to encourage the consistent similarities between image crops. Similarly, TWIST 6 enforces the class probability distributions of two augmented views of the same image to be consistent while regularizing the distributions to make them sharp and diverse. Both of methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the consistency regularization term through extensive experiments. Our UniCLR framework is closely related to all the above four types of methods. The key difference is that UniCLR attempts to unify the above four types of methods into a simple framework from a new affinity matrix perspective. Moreover, three variants, i.e., SimAffinity, SimWhitening and SimTrace, are designed based on UniCLR and show remarkable performance.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: overhead. Also, to avoid trivial solutions caused by not using negatives as anchors, some asymmetric structures or operations are normally designed, such as asymmetric embedding network 2 [ref]7, momentum encoder 2, non-differentiable operators , and stop-gradients 2 [ref]7. For example, BYOL 2 predicts the representation of one view via another view based on bootstrapping by using an\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
