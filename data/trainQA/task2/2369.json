      "content": "Paper Title: Hierarchical Neural Dynamic Policies\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRobot Learning for Dynamic Tasks\nRobot learning methods have been successful for many real-world tasks. However, these tasks have been performed in a controlled, and quasi-static setting where the robot can take arbitrarily long gap between subsequent actions 0  3 . The real world, however, is a lot more dynamic. When humans perform daily actions, like cutting vegetables, they think at a trajectory level and not at a discrete action level. To this end, seminal work in robotics has proposed using dynamical systems to model actions and trajectories, in a continuous space. Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) 2   have been widely used to perform diverse, dynamic tasks such as table tennis , panckake flipping 6 or tether-ball . They are able to model smooth, natural motions, and have in fact been used to inspire many policy learning schemes    1 1 . More recent work  5   has shown DMPs can be incorporated in a differentiable, end-to-end deep learning setting, which is an attribute that H-NDPs leverage. Hierarchical Frameworks for robot learning\nWhile DMPs have been used in previous works for building hierarchical policies [ref]9  4 8, these have mostly been constrained to discrete primitives [ref]9 8 and relatively simple settings from a perception standpoint. Previous works have also attempted to share knowledge between DMPs; for example Rückert and d’Avella  leverages shared basis functions for controlling multidimensional systems. To our knowledge, our work is the first to use a hierarchical local-to-global structure using DMPs. Hierarchical frameworks are popular for deep imitation learning setups. One prominent example is Guided Policy Search (GPS 8 9) which uses a bottom-up approach by learning ”expert” local controllers from state observations and then distill them into a image-based policy.\nWhile H-NDPs uses a similar bottom-up framework, we employ the structure of dynamical systems within our policy architecture, allowing us to perform more dynamic tasks than GPS. Furthermore, our local controllers are learnt from a few (10−15101510-15) demonstrations, which are a lot easier to obtain than assuming fully observable environment and hand-engineering required for GPS. Hierarchical learning has also long been explored in the context of RL from both top-down 2 as well as bottom-up  4 perspective. Ghosh et al. 0 and Teh et al.  propose a hierarchical local-to-global framework to perform more complex, diverse tasks. Ghosh et al. 0 takes advantage of local RL policies trained via policy gradients and a global policy which imitates the former. The local-to-global interactions between neural networks can lead to suboptimal behavior, especially for more difficult dynamic tasks. On the other hand, the local-to-global interactions taking place within H-NDPs are in a much more structured space (the space of physically plausible trajectories), leading to a stronger performance by H-NDPs.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: deep learning setting, which is an attribute that H-NDPs leverage.
