      "content": "Paper Title: Proof.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nData sharing is vital for the growth of machine learning applications in numerous domains. However, in many application scenarios,\ndata sharing is prohibited due to the private nature of data (e.g., individual data stored on mobile devices, medical treatments, and banking records) and the corresponding stringent regulations,\nwhich greatly hinders technological progress.\nDifferentially private (DP) data publishing¬†   provides a compelling solution to such challenge, where only a sanitized form of the data is publicly released.\nSuch sanitized synthetic data can be leveraged as if it were the real data, analyzed with established toolchains, and can be shared openly to the public, facilitating technological advance and reproducible research in sensitive domains. Yet, generation of high-dimensional data with DP guarantees is highly challenging and traditional DP algorithms designed for capturing low-dimensional statistical characteristics are not applicable to this task¬†[ref]31  [ref]4 ).\nInstead, inspired by the great successes of deep\ngenerative models in learning high-dimensional representations, recent works¬† [ref]6    \nadopt deep generative neural networks as the underlying generation backbone and incorporate the privacy constraints into the training procedure, such that any privacy leakage upon disclosing the data generator is bounded. However, these methods have common shortcomings:\n(i) deep generative models are known to be data-demanding¬†, which becomes even harder to train when considering the privacy constraints¬†[ref]6 ; (ii) they do not guarantee any optimal solution for the downstream task (e.g.\nclassification). In fact, existing models are still struggling to generate sanitized data that is useful for downstream data analysis tasks. For example, when training a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) classifier on the private generated data, the highest test accuracy reported in literature is <85%absentpercent85<85\\% for MNIST dataset with (Œµ,Œ¥)=(10,10‚àí5)ùúÄùõø10superscript105(\\varepsilon,\\delta)=(10,10^{-5})¬†, which lags far behind the discriminative baseline (>98%absentpercent98>98\\% with (Œµ,Œ¥)=(1.2,10‚àí5)ùúÄùõø1.2superscript105(\\varepsilon,\\delta)=(1.2,10^{-5})¬†) and makes private generative models less appealing for many practical scenarios with data analysis as the end goal. In this work, we learn to synthesize informative samples that\nare privacy-preserving and are optimized to train neural networks for downstream tasks. In contrast to existing approaches, we directly optimize a small set of samples instead of the deep generative models that is notoriously difficult to train in a private manner.\nMoreover, we\nexploit discriminative information from downstream tasks to guide the samples towards containing more useful information for downstream analysis. Compared to existing works, we improve the task utility by a large extent (up to 10%percent\\% downstream test accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art approach), while still preserving the flexibility and generality across varying configurations for downstream analysis. As an added benefit, our formulation naturally distilled the knowledge of original data into a much smaller set, which largely saves the memory and\ncomputational consumption for downstream analysis. We summarize our main contributions as follows. We present a new perspective of private high-dimensional data generation, with which we aim to bridge the utility and generality gap between the private generative and discriminative models.\nWe believe this alternative view opens up new possibilities in different research directions ranging from private analysis to generation. We introduce a simple yet effective method for generating informative samples that are optimized for training downstream neural networks, while maintaining generality as well as reducing the memory and computation consumption as added benefits. Experimental results demonstrate that, in comparison to existing works, our work improves the sample utility by a large margin and offers superior practicability for real-world application scenarios.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: of high-dimensional data with DP guarantees is highly challenging and traditional DP algorithms designed for capturing low-dimensional statistical characteristics are not applicable to this task¬†[ref]31  [ref]4 ).\nInstead, inspired by the great successes of deep\ngenerative models in learning high-dimensional representations, recent works¬† [ref]6    \nadopt deep generative neural networks as\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
