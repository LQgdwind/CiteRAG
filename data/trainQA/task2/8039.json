      "content": "Paper Title: Deeploy: Enabling Energy-Efficient Deployment of Small Language Models On Heterogeneous Microcontrollers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe latest evolutions in mainstream Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been driven by Transformers, which have taken over from Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as the leading edge models for language processing and multi-modal applications [ref]1 . The success of Transformers can be primarily attributed to the emergence of the Foundation Model (FM) paradigm: large Transformer models extensively pre-trained on datasets spanning trillions of tokens and then fine-tuned with a much lower volume of labeled data to solve domain-specific problems.\nFollowing the success of FMs in Natural Language Processing (NLP) [ref]1 , an increasing number of fields are starting to formulate and adapt FMs for high dimensional sensor data that has traditionally been challenging to process, like decoding neural data  [ref]5, or training embodied AI agents  [ref]7, which may incorporate multi-modal sensor inputs. Operating directly on sensory data and in a cyber-physical loop may lead to solving many outstanding challenges in fields such as brain-machine interfaces [ref]5 and miniaturized robotics [ref]7.\nHowever, to materialize this promise, models of this class need to be embodied in physical devices as Embodied Foundation Models (EFMs), and they must cope with the strict constraints in terms of compute throughput, power consumption, and footprint typical of edge devices.\nUnlike datacenter-scale systems, which collect and aggregate sensor data over sharded resources for high-throughput processing, embodied AI systems must process sensor data with extremely low latency and memory capacity under tight power constraints.\nThis is particularly challenging for the smallest class of AI-oriented computers: so-called “tinyML” devices operating at the extreme edge, based on microcontroller-class devices without complex operating systems or Memory-Management Units (MMUs), relying on user-level software to implement low-level hardware management functionalities.\nDespite many recent successes with previous-generation Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), the emergence of the tinyML paradigm for EFMs faces the dual challenge of reducing FMs to a manageable size and enabling their deployment on tiny devices. A first concrete step in this direction is the recent introduction of Small Language Models (SLMs): FMs with tens to a few hundred million, rather than several billion parameters  .\nWhile most currently available FMs are focused on processing natural language at a proof-of-concept scale, the effort towards embedded multi-modal sensor inputs with small-scale, application-specific FMs offers a highly promising path for the development of this novel class of models.\nMuch like what happened with the initial emergence of Deep Learning , the evolution of advanced tinyML applications based on EFMs is currently prevented by the lack of suitable targets for deployment of these models and, even more, of deployment frameworks that enable utilizing existing specialized hardware to its full capabilities. Deploying tiny EFMs requires overcoming several challenges specific to the tinyML domain.\nLarge-scale AI inference systems typically employ heterogeneous computer architectures composed by a conventional host (e.g., an x86 processor) and a very large throughput-oriented accelerator (e.g., H100 , TPU ), which is fully exploited only at large batch sizes.\nConversely, tinyML is used for latency-sensitive applications focusing on real-time inference without batching. As a consequence, tinyML AI inference typically employs much more specialized accelerator architectures  , leading to more complex mapping and optimization challenges for DNN deployment.\nFurthermore, tinyML’s strict constraints on energy efficiency and microcontroller-class computer architecture typically require platform-specific optimization, including memory-aware tiling, static memory allocation, and latency-hiding Direct Memory Access (DMA) scheduling, which require advanced compiler support to scale to complex DNNs like FMs. While several compilers have limited support for user-defined kernels  , configuring and extending them requires expert knowledge, and their top-down compilation approach often clashes with loosely coupled accelerators. Moreover, mainstream compilers do not address the strict memory constraints in extreme-edge devices. In this paper, we aim to remove the first barrier towards developing EFM suited for deployment on tinyML platforms: the lack of deployment frameworks that enable their efficient execution.\nWe demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first end-to-end tool flow to deploy EFMs on heterogeneous microcontroller-class systems. Specifically, we demonstrate the end-to-end deployment of a TinyStories-class  network on Siracusa, an advanced microcontroller in TSMC 16 nm/times16dividenanometerabsent16\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{nm}\\text{/} technology featuring embedded non-volatile memory (MRAM) and two heterogeneous compute engines, namely, an octa-core RV32 compute cluster with instruction extensions for ML and a multi-mode CNN Neural Processing Unit (NPU), N-Eureka . We present the tooling and algorithms integrated within our deployment framework, Deeploy. The contributions of this paper are as follows: We describe Deeploy, a customizable, domain-specific compiler designed for generating bare metal code fitting the memory constraints of extreme edge devices. Deeploy supports all the key computational primitives needed for the execution of Transformer-based EFMs on heterogeneous extreme edge Systems-on-chip (SoCs) through its bottom-up compilation approach, which allows applying advanced code optimization on expert-optimized kernel templates. We further introduce a novel algorithm for solving the tiling and static memory allocation problems for multi-level software-managed caches and its integration into Deeploy.111We will open-source all code required to reproduce our experiments under https://github.com/pulp-platform/deeploy. We benchmark common Transformer configurations, demonstrating that code generated by Deeploy maximizes engine utilization in heterogeneous, multi-accelerator SoCs. We achieve data marshaling overheads of just 9 % for large workloads with high arithmetic intensity executing on the cluster cores and NPU collaboratively thanks to efficient data movement acceleration and low-overhead offloading mechanisms. As a concrete large-scale end-to-end use-case of Deeploy and its adaptability to heterogeneous hardware platforms, we demonstrate for the first time the deployment of a TinyStories-class SLM on Siracusa, a state-of-the-art heterogeneous Microcontroller (MCU). While using on-chip memory only, we achieve a throughput of 340 Token/stimes340Tokens340\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{T}\\mathrm{o}\\mathrm{k}\\mathrm{e}\\mathrm{n}\\mathrm{/}\\mathrm{s} at an energy cost of 490 µ​J/times490dividemicrojouleabsent490\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro J}\\text{/} for autoregressive inference. We show that using the flexible deployment flow enabled by Deeploy for the same SLM allows us to implement multi-layer K​V𝐾𝑉KV caching using on-chip memory only, improving token throughput by 26 ×\\times compared to inference without caches. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in Section II, previous work in quantized neural networks, small language models, and neural network deployment for extreme edge devices is introduced and discussed. Section III introduces Deeploy and discusses its deployment flow for Transformers. Section IV discusses the SLM architecture used in this work and the approach to mapping it on Siracusa. In Section V, we present the Siracusa MCU platform. Section VI presents and discusses the end-to-end deployment results, comparing them to the state-of-the-art. Finally, Section VII concludes this paper, summarizing the results and contributions.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: by Transformers, which have taken over from Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as the leading edge models for language processing and multi-modal applications [ref]1 .
