      "content": "Paper Title: Revisiting Fully Convolutional Geometric Features for Object 6D Pose Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n6D pose estimation approaches can be designed to use different input data.\nRGB methods     rely on photometric information only, while RGBD methods [ref]13 [ref]12   9 also use range information in addition to RGB. RGB-based 6D pose estimation.\nSO-Pose  proposes an end-to-end method that explicitly models self-occlusion maps (i.e., portions of the object that are hidden by camera orientation).\nIt computes 2D-3D correspondences for each visible point of the object, and feeds them with self-occlusion maps to a pose regression module.\nZebraPose  proposes a strategy to learn surface descriptors on the image, by training a neural network to predict pixel features which correspond to predefined descriptors on the object model.\nAt inference time, it finds correspondences by similarity, and solves the PnP problem with RANSAC.\nThe authors show that the vertex encoding process is crucial for performance improvement. RGBD-based 6D pose estimation.\nPVN3D [ref]13 extends PVNet  by incorporating 3D point cloud information.\nThe core of this approach is a keypoint voting mechanism, in which for each pixel the offset to a reference keypoint is regressed.\nA semantic segmentation module is also used to identify the points belonging to each object in the scene.\nPVN3D is a two-stage method, as it passes the final correspondences to a RANSAC-based  algorithm for 6D pose estimation.\nFFB6D [ref]12 adopts an analogous method to PVN3D [ref]13, but introduces a novel convolutional architecture with Fusion Modules.\nThese modules enable the model to combine photometric (RGB) and geometrical (D) features for learning a better point cloud representation.\nE2EK  proposes an end-to-end trainable method by extending FFB6D [ref]12.\nIt clusters and filters the features computed by FFB6D based on confidence, and then processes them by an MLP-like network that regresses the pose.\nWu et al. 9 addresses the problem of objects that are symmetric to rotation with a two-stage method.\nThey extend FFB6D [ref]12 by introducing a novel triplet loss based on geometric consistency.\nSymmetry is leveraged by considering symmetric points as positives, thus forcing them to have similar features.\nFeng et al.  proposes a method to solve a related problem. In this work, FCGF is applied to align different point clouds of objects belonging to the same category. However, the authors do not introduce task-specific modifications to FCGF, and unlike our case of application, the target object is assumed to be already segmented from the scene. Unlike methods that employ sophisticated combinations of deep network architectures to process RGB and depth modalities [ref]12 9, our approach\nuses deep networks based on sparse convolutions to process coloured point clouds with a single framework.\nSparse convolutions are designed to process point clouds efficiently .\nWe also split the pose estimation problem into two subproblems, i.e. feature learning and point cloud registration.\nThis allows us to evaluate the quality of the learned features by using metrics such as Feature Matching Recall , which fosters interpretability of our model.\nUnlike Wu et al. 9, we do not rely on a detector to crop the region with the candidate object before processing the point cloud with our network.\nOur experiments show that we can outperform the nearest competitors E2EK  and Wu et al. 9 by 5.7 and 1.9 ADD(S)-0.1d on the LMO dataset, respectively, without using a detector.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: 6D pose estimation approaches can be designed to use different input data.\nRGB methods     rely on photometric information only, while RGBD methods [ref]13 [ref]12   9 also use range information in addition to RGB.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
