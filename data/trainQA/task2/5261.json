Homophily Graph vs. Heterophily Graph Homophily, denoting the tendency for interconnected nodes to share the same class or exhibit similar characteristics, is a prevalent phenomenon in various types of networks, as noted in studies such as McPherson et al.’s exploration of homophily in social and academic networks . This homophilous nature proves advantageous for diverse tasks. For instance, Kossinets and Watts  delve into the origins of homophily within a large university community, establishing that the dynamic interplay of choice homophily can amplify even modest preferences for similar others, thereby generating discernible patterns of observed homophily. Tang et al.  contribute to the understanding of the homophily effect by employing homophily regularization in low-rank matrix factorization, applying it specifically to the trust prediction problem. In real-world scenarios, there exist contexts where the principle of ”opposites attract” prevails, leading to heterophily networks. Heterophily, characterized by connected nodes originating from different categories or possessing distinct characteristics, is observed in various domains, such as heterosexual dating networks and ecological food webs. Lazarsfeld and Merton [ref]62 succinctly define heterophily as the ”mirror opposite of homophily.” Nevertheless, real-world graph structures commonly manifest a combination of both homophily and heterophily. Notably, prevailing models often exhibit superior performance on graphs characterized by high homophily. Addressing this challenge entails two primary approaches. One avenue involves the design of specialized models tailored to handle heterophily in graphs. For example, Chanpuriya and Musco [ref]63 propose a versatile model capable of adapting to both homophilous and heterophilous graph structures. Zhu et al. 6 introduce H2​G​C​Nsubscript𝐻2𝐺𝐶𝑁H_{2}GCN, specifically designed to effectively accommodate both heterophily and homophily. Another approach involves transforming heterophily graphs into homophily graphs. Suresh et al.  achieve this by converting the input graph into a computation graph with enhanced assortativity. Additionally, they emphasize the adaptive selection between structure and proximity when addressing diverse mixing patterns in graphs. \n B. Uni-typed Graph vs. Bi-typed Graph vs. Multi-typed Graph Uni-typed graph & Bi-typed graph & Multi-typed graph\nA uni-typed graph can be defined as 𝐆=(𝒱,ℰ)𝐆𝒱ℰ{\\bf G}=({\\mathcal{V}},{\\mathcal{E}}). Here, 𝒱𝒱{\\mathcal{V}} denotes the set of nodes and ℰℰ{\\mathcal{E}} denotes the set of edges. 𝒱={v1,v2,⋯,vN}𝒱subscriptv1subscriptv2⋯subscriptvN{\\mathcal{V}}=\\{v_{1},v_{2},\\cdots,v_{N}\\} and ℰ={e1,e2,⋯,eE}ℰsubscripte1subscripte2⋯subscripteE{\\mathcal{E}}=\\{e_{1},e_{2},\\cdots,e_{E}\\}.\nNode type mapping function Ψ​(vi)∈𝒯vΨsubscriptvisuperscript𝒯v\\Psi(v_{i})\\in{\\mathcal{T}}^{v}.\nEdge type mapping function ψ​(ej)∈𝒯eψsubscriptejsuperscript𝒯e\\psi(e_{j})\\in{\\mathcal{T}}^{e}. ∣𝒯v∣=1delimited-∣∣superscript𝒯v1\\mid{\\mathcal{T}}^{v}\\mid=1, ∣𝒯e∣∈ℝdelimited-∣∣superscript𝒯eℝ\\mid{\\mathcal{T}}^{e}\\mid\\in{\\mathbb{R}}. For a bi-typed graph, the difference is that ∣𝒯v∣=2delimited-∣∣superscript𝒯v2\\mid{\\mathcal{T}}^{v}\\mid=2. Fora multi-typed graph, the difference is that ∣𝒯v∣>2delimited-∣∣superscript𝒯v2\\mid{\\mathcal{T}}^{v}\\mid>2. According to the number of node types in graphs (see Definition 1), we can divide them into three types (i.e., uni-typed graph, bi-typed graph and multi-typed graph). Uni-typed graphs, characterized by the presence of a single node type, represent one of the simplest graph structures. This fundamental graph type serves as an advantageous framework for investigating diverse graph-related problems in a straightforward and dependable manner.\nFor instance, Page et al.  introduced PageRank, a method for objectively and mechanically rating web pages. This algorithm effectively quantifies the level of interest and attention that users allocate to web pages. Building upon this seminal work, subsequent incremental advancements have been made to enhance the applicability of PageRank across various graph settings  . Bi-typed graphs encompass graphs featuring two distinct node types, notably including bipartite graphs and bi-typed multi-relational heterogeneous graphs (BMHG), which hold significance in real-world applications. A bipartite graph is characterized by its ability to be decomposed into two disjoint vertex sets, where edges exclusively connect nodes from different types. Research by Li et al.  delves into the hierarchical representation learning of bipartite graphs.\nIn contrast to bipartite graphs, BMHG introduces intra-type relations, often overlooked and consequently compromising overall performance. To address this limitation, Zhao et al.  propose DHAN, which employs both intra-type and inter-type attention-based encoders within a hierarchical mechanism to effectively model BMHG. Additionally, Zhao et al.  apply the BMHG framework to model a Market Knowledge Graph for stock prediction. These endeavors contribute to a nuanced understanding and improved modeling of complex relationships within bi-typed graphs. A multi-typed graph, characterized by the presence of three or more node types, typically exhibits a rich array of relationships among nodes. Modeling such graphs involves various strategies, one of which is the direct learning of relationships among nodes. Notably, Hu et al.  introduce HGT, leveraging a transformer-style attention mechanism  within a graph neural network to effectively model multiple heterogeneous relationships on web-scale graphs.\nAn alternative approach involves the utilization of meta-paths, which represent combinations of several types of relationships. Meta-paths are widely favored for their flexibility and interpretability, enabling the capture of complex semantic relations among objects. For instance, Dong et al.  contribute two scalable representation learning methods, named metapath2vec and metapath2vec++. Additionally, the automated discovery of meta-paths is recognized as a means to alleviate the expertise requirement , thus drawing scholarly attention.\n\nReference markers found: [62]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]62: originating from different categories or possessing distinct characteristics, is observed in various domains, such as heterosexual dating networks and ecological food webs.
