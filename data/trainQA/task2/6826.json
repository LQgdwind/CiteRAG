      "content": "Paper Title: Co-Evolution of Pose and Mesh for 3D Human Body Estimation from Video\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEstimating 3D human pose from monocular video.\nBenefiting from the advance of 2D pose detection, video-based 3D human pose estimation often takes a 2D pose sequence detected from images by an off-the-shift 2D pose detector to estimate the 3D pose.\nRecent years have witnessed the development of video-based 3D human pose estimation. Several methods have been proposed to explore spatial and temporal pose information through Temporal Convolution Networks (TCNs)    , and Transformer-based networks    , resulting in an impressive performance in terms of pose accuracy and motion smoothness.\nThe achievements in video-based 3D human pose estimation demonstrate that the pose sequence contains sufficient spatial and temporal information, which can be leveraged to produce accurate and smooth 3D human pose motion. Recovering 3D human mesh from a single image.\n3D human mesh recovery aims to reconstruct 3D human pose and shape from monocular images. Previous studies can be divided into parametric methods and non-parametric methods.\nParametric methods adopt the pre-trained parametric human model (e.g., SMPL ) and estimate the pose and shape parameters to recover the human mesh. Early works [ref]13 directly predict the parameter from the input image, but it is challenging to obtain accurate results. Recent works further introduce human body information extracted from the input image, such as 2D pose 4 [ref]49, human part segmentation 3 , silhouette 4 [ref]49, and depth map\n   , then predict the SMPL parameters from them.\nHowever, parametric methods are constrained by the limited pose and shape representation space. To this end, non-parametric methods are proposed that directly regress the mesh vertices.\nThey model the relations between mesh vertex by GCNs    or Transformers   , which produce flexible human meshes.\nAlthough the single image-based methods have achieved significant performance in accuracy, it is hard for them to produce temporally consistent and smooth 3D human motion when applied to video cases. Recovering 3D human mesh from monocular video.\nDifferent from image-based methods, video-based methods aim to produce accurate and temporally consistent human mesh from video frames.\nMost methods      extract the static image feature vectors using a pre-trained CNN [ref]13 with global pooling operation and train the temporal networks, such as 1D CNNs , Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)   , and Transformers , to predict the pose and shape parameters for human mesh representation.\nFor larger receptive fields, some methods 9  take the image feature maps before the global pooling as input.\nSun et al. 9 disentangle the skeletons from the image feature maps, and then aggregates per-frame skeleton and image feature vector by a bilinear transformation.\nMAED  takes the image patch sequence as input and uses a Transformer-based encoder-decoder framework to predict SMPL parameters.\nDespite the promising results of video-based methods,\nthe low-resolution image features in the deep CNN layers inevitably discard detailed spatial information.\nBesides, their representation abilities are constrained by the limited parametric space, making it difficult to learn the slight and swift human motion in pose and shape domains.\nTherefore, existing video-based methods still struggle to recover accurate and temporally consistent 3D human mesh.\nIn contrast, our method decouples this task into 3D pose estimation and non-parametric mesh regression by pose and mesh co-evolution, achieving better per-frame accuracy and temporal consistency.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: methods and non-parametric methods.\nParametric methods adopt the pre-trained parametric human model (e.g., SMPL ) and estimate the pose and shape parameters to recover the human mesh.
