      "content": "Paper Title: AdPE: Adversarial Positional Embeddings for Pretraining Vision Transformers via MAE+\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile adversarial training has been intensively studied through adversarial examples [ref]18[ref]19, adversarial pretraining of deep networks, especially CNNs, is receiving lots of attentions recently in the context of contrastive learning  . One of representative works in this line of research is to treat negative samples as adversarially learnable by maximizing instead of minimizing the InfoNCE loss [ref]6. Hard negatives are thus generated directly, where they are continuously being pushed towards their positive counterparts so that more discriminative features must be learned to distinguish between positives and negatives for a query. The idea was also extended to incorporate learnable positives in a cooperative-adversarial fashion together with learnable negatives . All these methods focus on the adversarial pretraining for contrastive learning. In this paper, we seek to adversarially pretrain vision transformers in the MIM fashion. In contrast to obtaining hard negatives in [ref]6  , we will impose adversarial perturbations on positional embeddings to distort the local visual structures spatially so that the pretrained transformers are forced to explore high-level features in long-range contexts to predict missing patches, instead of simply cheating on the strongly correlated patches in local neighborhood.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: While adversarial training has been intensively studied through adversarial examples [ref]18[ref]19, adversarial pretraining of deep networks, especially CNNs, is receiving lots of attentions recently in the context of contrastive learning  .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
