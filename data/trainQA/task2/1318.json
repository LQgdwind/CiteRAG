      "content": "Paper Title: OpenHoldem: A Benchmark for Large-Scale Imperfect-Information Game Research\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFrom its inception, artificial intelligence (AI) research has been focusing on building agents that can play games like humans.\nBoth Turing  and Shannon  developed programs for playing chess to validate initial ideas in AI.\nFor more than half a century, games have continued to be AI testbeds for novel ideas, and the resulting achievements have marked important milestones in the history of AI      [ref]8  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7.\nNotable examples include the checkers-playing bot Chinook winning a world championship against top humans , Deep Blue beating Kasparov in chess , and AlphaGo defeating Lee Sedol  in the complex ancient Chinese game Go.\nAlthough substantial progress has been made in solving these large-scale perfect-information games that all players know the exact state of the game at every decision point, it remains challenging to solve large-scale imperfect-information games that require reasoning under the uncertainty about the opponents’ hidden information.\nThe hidden information is omnipresent in real-world strategic interactions, such as business, negotiation, and finance, making the research of imperfect-information games particularly important both theoretically and practically. Poker has a long history as a challenging problem for developing algorithms that deal with hidden information 8 9.\nThe poker game involves all players being dealt with some private cards visible only to themselves, with players taking structured turns making bets, calling opponents’ bets, or folding.\nAs one of the most popular global card games, poker has played an essential role in developing general-purpose techniques for imperfect-information games.\nIn particular, No-limit Texas Hold’em (NLTH), the world’s most popular form of poker, has been the primary testbed for imperfect-information game research for decades because of its large-scale decision space and strategic complexity.\nFor example, Heads-up No-limit Texas Hold’em (HUNL), the smallest variant of NLTH, has 10161superscript1016110^{161} decision points 0 which makes it almost impossible to solve directly. There have been many efforts to design poker AIs for NLTH over the past few years 1 2.\nMost of these systems exploit some equilibrium-finding algorithms, e.g., counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) 3, with various abstraction strategies to merge similar game states to reduce the size of the game tree.\nRecently, a series of breakthroughs have been made in the NLTH AI research community.\nDeepStack 6, which combines the continual re-solving and the depth-limited sparse look-ahead algorithms, defeated 10 out of 11 professional poker players by a statistically significant margin.\nLibratus 7 defeated a team of four top HUNL-specialist professionals by using a nested safe subgame solving algorithm with an extensible blueprint strategy.\nPluribus 4 defeated elite human professional players in six-player NLTH by extending the techniques behind Libratus. Although many important milestones have been achieved in NLTH AI research in recent years, the problem is far from being solved, and there remain many theoretical and computational issues to be addressed.\nFor example, the game-theoretic solution for multiplayer NLTH, the best way to game tree abstraction, more efficient equilibrium-finding algorithms that converge faster and consume fewer resources, etc.\nTo solve these challenges, further studies are urgently needed. However, one main obstacle to further research in NLTH AI is the lack of standard benchmarks in this area.\nFirst, there are no standard evaluation protocols in this community; different papers use different evaluation metrics, making comparisons of different methods difficult.\nSecond, there is no publicly available baseline AI which can serve as a starting point for future improvements.\nThird, there are no public easy-to-use platforms for researchers to test the performance of their AIs at any time. Considering the important role of standard benchmarks in AI development, we present OpenHoldem, a benchmark for NLTH AI research developed to boost the studies on large-scale imperfect-information games.\nOpenHoldem provides an integrated toolkit for evaluating NLTH AIs with three main components: the evaluation protocols, the baseline AIs, and a testing platform. For each component, we have made the following contributions to the community: For the evaluation part, we propose to use four different evaluation metrics to test different algorithms from different aspects comprehensively. For the baseline part, we design and implement four different types of NLTH AIs: rule-based AI, CFR based static AI, DeepStack-like online AI, and deep reinforcement learning based AI.\nThese diverse AIs can serve as strong baselines for further development in this field. For the platform part, we develop an online testing platform with multiple NLTH AIs built-in.\nResearchers can link their AIs to this platform through easy-to-use APIs to play against each other for mutual improvement. Our proposed OpenHoldem provides a standardized benchmark for the NLTH AI research.\nThe adopted approach, namely to propose an evaluation protocol via several metrics, the provision of baselines tested to have strong performances, and the establishment of an online testing platform, is perfectly rigorous and will allow algorithm improvements and comparisons with the state-of-the-arts, which impossible to do today without spending much time re-implementing other people’s methods.\nOpenHoldem can potentially have a significant impact on the poker AI research, and more generally in the AI community dealing with decision-making problems under uncertainty.\nWe hope that OpenHoldem makes the NLTH AI research easier and more accessible, and further facilitates the research of the key problems in large-scale imperfect-information games, such as large-scale equilibrium-finding, opponent modeling, human-computer interactive learning, and online exploiting sub-optimal opponents.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: initial ideas in AI.\nFor more than half a century, games have continued to be AI testbeds for novel ideas, and the resulting achievements have marked important milestones in the history of AI      [ref]8  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7.\nNotable examples include the checkers-playing bot Chinook winning a world championship against top humans , Deep Blue beating Kasparov in chess , and AlphaGo defeating Lee\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
