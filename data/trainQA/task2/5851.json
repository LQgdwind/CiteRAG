      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Attention as Disentangler for Compositional Zero-shot Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisual attribute has been widely studied to understand how visual properties can be learned from objects. The pioneering work by Ferrari and Zisserman  learned visual attributes using a probabilistic generative model. The successive work by Lampert et al.  used visual attributes to detect unseen objects with an attribute-based multi-label classification. Similarly, Patterson et al.  proposed Economic Labeling Algorithm (ELA) to discover multi-label attributes for objects. Different from multi-label classification, other works     learned attribute-object relationship to generalize attribute feature across all object categories based on probabilistic models. Visual attributes also benefit downstream tasks, e.g., object recognition   , action recognition [ref]1  , image captioning  , and semi-supervised learning . Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) is a special case of zero-shot learning (ZSL)  0   , aims at recognizing unseen attribute-object compositions learning from seen compositions. Misra et al.  first termed and studied CZSL by projecting composed primitives and visual features to a joint embedding space. Nagarajan et al.  formulated attributes as matrix operators applied on object vectors. Purushwalkam et al.  introduced a task-driven modular architecture to learn unseen compositions by re-weighting a set of sub-tasks. Wei et al.  generated attribute-object compositions with GAN  to match visual features. Li et al.  proposed symmetry principle of attribute-object transformation under the supervision of group axioms. Naeem et al.  and Mancini et al. 6 used graph convolutional networks to extract attribute-object representations. Recently, some works shift their interest from word composing to visual disentanglement. Atzmon et al.  solved CZSL from a causal perspective to learn disentangled representations. Ruis et al.  proposed to learn prototypical representations of objects and attributes. Li et al. 2 disentangled visual features into a Siamese contrastive space and entangled them with a generative model. Saini et al.  extracted visual similarity from spatial features to disentangle attributes and objects. Zhang et al. 2 treated CZSL as a domain generalization task, learning attribute- and object-invariant domains. A more realistic open-world CZSL setting was studied in 5 6 , which considered all possible compositions in testing. Very recently, an inspiring work by Nayak et al.  introduced compositional soft prompts to CLIP  to tackle CZSL problem. Attention mechanism has been well studied by non-local neural networks  in computer vision and transformers  in machine translation. Dosovitskiy et al.  adapted transformer architecture to computer vision field, proving its comparable efficiency over traditional CNNs. Inspired by the multi-head self-attention implemented by transformers, our work exploits efficient attention as disentangler for CZSL.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: to generalize attribute feature across all object categories based on probabilistic models.
