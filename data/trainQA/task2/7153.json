      "content": "Paper Title: Hybrid Pooling and Convolutional Network for Improving Accuracy and Training Convergence Speed in Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPrevious voxel-based methods utilized the Pointnet module [ref]21 for 3D feature extraction. Pointnet++ [ref]22 introduced a multi-level architecture that effectively extracts both local and global features. Voxel-RCNN  proposed the use of Voxel ROI Pooling to extract adjacent voxel features in proposals. To address the challenging task of detecting occluded objects in object detection, we have developed a novel feature extraction module called the Multi-Scale Extended Receptive Field Feature Extraction Module. As depicted in Fig. 4, this module consists of two parts. The first part, named EAConv, expands the receptive field through multi-layer Deformable Convolution  and further extracts object features using RROI pooling. The second part employs a multi-scale fusion strategy to combine the output results of the initial pooling step across multiple scales, thereby enhancing the module’s feature expression capability. In EAConv, our approach to improving occluded object detection involves increasing the depth of convolutional neural networks and utilizing deformable convolution  to expand the receptive field of the convolutional layer. We enhance the standard convolution by employing a multi-layer deformable convolution  with an RROI pooling architecture. The formula for EAConv is defined as follows (Eq. 7), where p0subscript𝑝0\\mathit{p_{0}} is each point in the output feature map, corresponding to the center point of the convolution kernel; pnsubscript𝑝𝑛\\mathit{p_{n}} is each offset of p0subscript𝑝0\\mathit{p_{0}} within the convolutional kernel range; w​(pn)𝑤subscript𝑝𝑛\\mathit{w(p_{n})} is the weight of the corresponding position of the convolutional kernel; x​(p0+pn)𝑥subscript𝑝0subscript𝑝𝑛\\mathit{x(p_{0}+p_{n})} is the element value at the position of p0+pnsubscript𝑝0subscript𝑝𝑛\\mathit{p_{0}+p_{n}} on the input feature map, with each point introducing an offset Δ​pn𝛥subscript𝑝𝑛\\mathit{\\Delta p_{n}}. Φ​(⋅)𝛷⋅\\mathit{\\Phi(\\cdot)} represents RROI pooling. O​(p0)𝑂subscript𝑝0\\mathit{O(p_{0})} indicates that the output of EAConv undergoes two layers of deformable convolution  followed by RROI pooling. Deformable Convolution  achieves a larger receptive field by incorporating offsets into the convolution kernel and combining it with the input. Our experiments have demonstrated that the highest accuracy is achieved when the deformable convolution  is increased to two layers. Leveraging the concept of Replaceable Pooling (RP), we introduce a new interface for the existing ROI pooling module in current object detection methods. This new module, called RROI pooling, is not limited to only two pooling methods, namely maximum pooling and average pooling. Users of the new ROI pooling module can now choose the pooling method that best suits their requirements. After EAConv convolutes the input feature tensor, we progressively expand the pooling area of RROI pooling in a 2-fold proportional sequence. This generates a series of feature output maps with dimensions equal to twice the proportional sequence. The principle of multi-scale fusion is illustrated in Eq. 8, where k𝑘\\mathit{k} represents the layer number of the feature map, w𝑤\\mathit{w} and hℎ\\mathit{h} respectively represent the width and height of the object box, and k0subscript𝑘0\\mathit{k_{0}} is a hyperparameter. By fusing these feature maps, we achieve multi-scale feature fusion results, effectively enhancing the performance of the feature extraction module.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: Previous voxel-based methods utilized the Pointnet module [ref]21 for 3D feature extraction.
