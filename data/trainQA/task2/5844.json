      "content": "Paper Title: OTAvatar:One-shot Talking Face Avatar with Controllable Tri-plane Rendering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we first describe the implementation detail of our proposed method, the dataset used, and the baselines of our work. Then we compare our proposed method with previous 2D and 3D methods on motion controllability and multi-view consistency. Implementation details.\nWe use the off-the-shelf 3D face reconstruction model to extract the expression and pose coefficients of 3DMM. The motion of any timestamp is represented by the window of adjacent 27 frames of expression and pose coefficients. In practice, we find that the extracted head poses contain too much noises to serve as the camera pose. Therefore, we extract the camera pose using the method in [ref]15. Our model is implemented in Pytorch using four A100 GPUs. The total batch size is 24, with six images per GPU. We use Adam optimizer with a 0.0001 learning rate to train the motion controller C and finetune the generator G. Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is employed to update ΘcsubscriptΘ𝑐\\Theta_{c} in Alg. 1 since it can stabilize the training. The model is trained for 2000 iterations, and each iteration contains N=Ni​d+Nm​o=100𝑁subscript𝑁𝑖𝑑subscript𝑁𝑚𝑜100N=N_{id}+N_{mo}=100 steps to optimize the identity codes and train the motion controller. For each mini-batch of data, a new batch of latent codes are initialized and optimized using the Adam optimizer with a 0.01 learning rate. Both the 64×\\times64 resolution volume rendering results and 512×\\times512 super-resolution results are implemented to calculate the loss. During training, the identity code 𝐰i​dsubscript𝐰𝑖𝑑\\mathbf{w}_{id} is optimized in 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} space. After being extended to the 𝒲+superscript𝒲\\mathcal{W}^{+} space by channel-wisely repeated 14 times, it is combined with the motion code 𝐰xsubscript𝐰𝑥\\mathbf{w}_{x} and then fed into the face generator G.\nIt takes less than two days to train the network entirely.\nDuring inference, we first optimize the identity code in 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} space, then use another N=100𝑁100N=100 steps to finetune it in 𝒲+superscript𝒲\\mathcal{W}^{+} space [ref]1 .  Dataset. Our model is trained on the HDTF dataset, which contains frontal talking faces from 362 videos and over 300 subjects. Following [ref]41, we use the pre-processing step in  and resize images to 512×\\times512 resolution. The test dataset contains 20 videos of subjects out of the training set. To evaluate the novel subject generalizability and controllability\nin the 3D-consistent fashion, we sample subjects from the Multiface dataset, which is particularly proposed for 3D-consistent face avatars. Baseline methods. We mainly compare our method with previous works that incorporate 3DMM coefficients to reenact face avatars in either 2D/3D fashion and are generalizable to unseen identities. For 2D methods, PIRenderer 9 and StyleHEAT [ref]41 achieve SOTA performance on face reenactment.\nFor 3D methods, HeadNeRF  is the most advanced volume rendering method that incorporates controllability and generalizability. Beyond coefficients-based methods, the SOTA image-driven method FOMM  is also taken into comparison. Evaluation metrics.\nWe adopt peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM) , and learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS)  to evaluate the visual quality. To measure the realism of the synthesized results and the identity preservation, we use frechet inception distance (FID)  and cosine similarity of identity embedding (CSIM)  based on ArcFace model, respectively. Besides, the average expression distance (AED), average pose distance (APD), and average keypoint distance (AKD) are employed to evaluate the facial expression and pose.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: of expression and pose coefficients.
