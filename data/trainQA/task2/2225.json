      "content": "Paper Title: Universal Domain Adaptation in Ordinal Regression\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent works revised the main assumption of the source and target sharing the same class set and study more realistic scenarios [ref]2  6 7 . In partial DA, the target is allowed to cover only a subset of the source class set. In this case the adaptation process should be adjusted so that the samples with not-shared labels would not influence the learned model. Common techniques consist in adding a re-weight source sample strategy to a standard DA approach [ref]2 . Alternative solutions leverage two separate deep classifiers and their prediction inconsistency on feature norm matching , or include adversarial alignment and adaptive uncertainty suppression . The open set scenario is not trivial since the target samples in unknown class are not expected to align with the source. This problem is addressed by measuring the entropy of class predictions  or by augmenting the domain adaptation with class-agnostic clusters in target domain 3.\n proposed a method to model the synchronization relationship among the local distribution pieces and global distribution, aiming for more precise domain-invariant features in hierarchical manner.\nThe sample transfer scoring scheme in \ncouples target pseudo-labeling with careful sample selection to ensure class diversity in a batch. A new UDA framework has been proposed in 6. It relies on a neighborhood clustering to learn the structure of the target domain in a self-supervised way. It also uses entropy-based feature alignment and rejection to align target features with the source, or reject them as “unknown”. All mentioned methods address the classification tasks.\nDomain adaptation in regression is less studied  and represented by eye gaze 8 and hand pose estimation  1. In both tasks, a model trained on synthetically generated images is transferred to real images by adjusting the loss function or by reweighting source images. The process of generating synthetic images ensures the same output space across the domains and therefore prevents any output shift. In 1, this is addressed exploiting topological properties, which are invariant to the shift across domains.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Recent works revised the main assumption of the source and target sharing the same class set and study more realistic scenarios [ref]2  6 7 .
