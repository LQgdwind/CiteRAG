      "content": "Paper Title: Integrating Contrastive Learning with Dynamic Models for Reinforcement Learning from Images\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent literature on unsupervised representation learning focuses on extracting latent embeddings by maximizing different lower bounds on the mutual information between the representations and the inputs. Commonly used bounds include MINE , which estimates mutual information based on the Donsker-Varadhan representation  of the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and InfoNCE [ref]12, which uses a multi-sample version of noise-contrastive estimation [ref]26. Hjelm et al.  maximize mutual information between the input and its representations. They propose to maximize both, this global mutual information and local mutual information that considers small patches of the input. The local mutual information objective should encourage the encoder to capture features shared by different patches, and thus put less focus on pixel-level noise.\nBengio et al.  considered simple reinforcement learning problems, and propose to learn independently controllable features, by learning a separate policy for every dimension of the embedding that only affects variation of that respective dimension.\nAnand et al.  proposed to learn state representations by maximizing the mutual information of observations across spatial and temporal axes. Their key idea is to improve temporal coherence of observations. However, they do not take into account the action for their temporal mutual information objective and hence the predictive information is specific to actions that were used in the training set. More recently, several works apply mutual information objectives for representation learning in a deep reinforcement learning setting.\nOord et al. [ref]12 introduced the InfoNCE bound on the mutual information and already evaluated it in a reinforcement learning setting. They maximize the mutual information between the current context, which is computed from all previous state embeddings, and the embedding several time steps in the future.\nLaskin et al. [ref]10 learn useful state representations by maximizing the mutual information between the features of independent transformations of the same observations, improving transformation invariance of the learned embedding. The importance of data augmentation for deep reinforcement learning from images has also been stressed by Yarats et al. . Laskin et al. [ref]10 generate transformed images for data augmentation, where a random patch is cropped from a stack of temporally sequential frames sampled from the replay buffer. Moreover, they use separate online and target encoders for the anchor, and positive/negative samples, respectively, when computing the InfoNCE loss on the mutual information, rather than using same encoder for the anchor, and positive/negative samples, which was proposed by  Oord et al. [ref]12. Our method shares several aspects with their method, CURL, since we also apply the InfoNCE [ref]12 bound to maximize the mutual information between two embeddings that result from different image crops in one of our auxiliary tasks. However, we do not consider the embeddings directly, but the predicted embeddings at the next time step, additionally targeting latent dynamics invariant to the transformation of the current embedding.\nLee et al.  apply the conditional entropy bottleneck  to maximize the mutual information between the current embedding and the future state and reward, while compressing away information that is not also contained in the next state or reward. Their conditional entropy bottleneck objective is conditioned on multiple future states and rewards for multi-step prediction. Instead, we propose to compress away task-irrelevant information by using data augmentation without compromising the ability to predict the embedding of the next state. Model-based reinforcement learning methods iteratively build a predictive model of the environment from high-dimensional images along with a policy based on that model    . For example, Dreamer  learns models of the latent dynamics and rewards and uses them for reinforcement learning in the latent MDP. By iteratively applying the policy on the real system, new data is collected to improve the models. Some recent model-free reinforcement learning approaches learn latent dynamic models to compute intrinsic reward for solving many reinforcement learning tasks with sparse rewards  . For instance, Li et al.  compute intrinsic rewards by estimating the novelty of the next state based on the prediction error of a dynamic model that is smoothly updated during training. Learning predictive dynamic models has also been shown to be promising for many robotic control tasks. For example, Li et al.  propose a neural fuzzy-based dynamic model for reliable trajectory tracking, which effectively facilitates the control performance of the wheel-legged robot. We also learn a model of the latent dynamics, but we use it only for learning better representations. However, making better use of the learned models is a natural extension for future work. In this paper, we propose an approach for representation learning in the context of deep reinforcement learning, that is based on mutual information, without relying on robotic prior knowledge or pixel-reconstruction. Most aforementioned mutual information based methods either improve temporal coherence of observations or maximize the similarity of two independently augmented images, which cannot effectively guarantee the Markovianity of state and action embeddings. However, non-Markovian embeddings can make it harder to learn an optimal policy or Q-function, since reinforcement learning agents assume their states and actions to be Markovian. To alleviate this problem, our proposed method imposes a nonlinear dynamic model on the latent state space. Moreover, instead of directly maximizing the agreement of embedding of augmented images, we propose to maximize the mutual information between the predicted embedding at the next time step, additionally improving data augmentation invariance of the latent dynamic models. The comparative experiments presented in Section 4 have shown that the proposed method outperforms leading reconstruction-based and contrastive-based methods on typically challenging image-based benchmark tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: representations and the inputs.

Hjelm et al.  maximize mutual information between the input and its representations. They propose to maximize both,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
