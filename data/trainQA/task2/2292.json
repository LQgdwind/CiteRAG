      "content": "Paper Title: Abstract\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCatalan is a Romance language spoken in the Western Mediterranean by more than ten million people.\nCatalan is considered a language between the Ibero-Romance (Spanish, Portuguese, Galician) and Gallo-Romance (French, Occitan, Franco-Proven√ßal) languages . Catalan can be considered a language of intermediate complexity from the quantitative perspective of information theory : Catalan has an intermediate level of\nentropy rate of 5.845.845.84, with languages mean around 5.97¬±0.91plus-or-minus5.970.915.97\\pm 0.91  and morphological complexity (in terms of word complexity, with Catalan ranked in 202202202 position over 520520520 languages ).\nAs it happens with other Romance languages Catalan does have a great inflectional variability , especially in verbs but also in nouns and adjectives  with some lexical peculiarities . Besides, derivation is a very productive procedure in the formation of new words in Catalan, suffixation being the most important (above the prefixation and infixation) , as it is also usual in other Romance languages . Despite the limited geographical extension of Catalan, there are local variations in suffixation processes that have been reviewed in detail (see  and references therein). Catalan is also a language that has recently been studied in depth under the paradigm of quantitative linguistics , recovering the best-known linguistic laws in which meaning does not intervene (as is the case of Zipf‚Äôs rank-frequency law, Herdan-Heaps‚Äô law, the brevity law or the Menzerath-Altmann law) in this speech corpus (Glissando) and in its transcripts . In addition, although the issue is still debated , it has also been found the lognormal distribution of words, lately proposed as a new linguistic law   but, nevertheless, the statistical patterns of meaning in Catalan has not been addressed until the present study. Since Zipf‚Äôs pioneering research, one of the most remarkable discoveries on the rank-frequency law in large multi-author textual corpus is that the power law put forward by Zipf (Eq. 3) has to be generalized, on a first approximation, as a double power law of the form      , where Œ±1subscriptùõº1\\alpha_{1} is the exponent for the low rank (high frequency) power-law regime corresponding to Eq. 3, Œ±2subscriptùõº2\\alpha_{2} is that of the high rank (low frequency) regime, and i‚àósuperscriptùëñi^{*} is the breakpoint rank. In the British National Corpus it was found that Œ±1=1subscriptùõº11\\alpha_{1}=1 and Œ±2=2subscriptùõº22\\alpha_{2}=2 . Precisely, these two scaling regimes in Zipf‚Äôs rank-frequency law were referred to as the kernel lexicon, for the most frequent words usually shared by the majority of speakers of the language, while the rarer words would be part of the so-called unlimited lexicon, formed by less common, more specialized or technical words or, in the case of more extensive diachronic corpus, that have fallen into disuse  . Here we will provide evidence, in a novel way, that such a double power-law regime also applies to Zipf‚Äôs laws of meaning.\nFirst, the law of meaning distribution becomes where Œ≥1subscriptùõæ1\\gamma_{1} is the exponent for high frequency regime, corresponding to Œ¥ùõø\\delta in Eq 1, and Œ≥2subscriptùõæ2\\gamma_{2} is the exponent for the low frequency regime.\nSecond, the meaning-frequency law becomes where f‚Äã(i‚àó)ùëìsuperscriptùëñf(i^{*}) is the frequency of the word of rank i‚àósuperscriptùëñi^{*}, Œ¥2subscriptùõø2\\delta_{2} is the exponent for the low frequency regime and Œ¥1subscriptùõø1\\delta_{1} is the exponent for the high frequency regime (Eq. 1).\nNotice that, according to our convention,\nthe subindex 111 (in Œ±1subscriptùõº1\\alpha_{1}, Œ≥1subscriptùõæ1\\gamma_{1} and Œ¥1subscriptùõø1\\delta_{1}) is used to refer to high frequencies (low ranks) while\nthe subindex 222 (in Œ±2subscriptùõº2\\alpha_{2}, Œ≥2subscriptùõæ2\\gamma_{2} and Œ¥2subscriptùõø2\\delta_{2}) is used to refer to low frequencies (high ranks). The remainder of the article is organized as follows. In Section¬†Materials and methods, we introduce the materials used, i.e. two Catalan corpora, one based on written texts (CTILC) and the other based on transcribed speech (Glissando), as well as the DIEC2 normative dictionary , from which the number of meanings (or polysemy of words) were obtained. We also present the lemmatization process with FreeLing  and the binning method used, following Zipf . In Section¬†Results, we first present an empirical exploration of the three Zipfian laws outlined above\nassuming a single regime followed by and analysis assuming two regimes.\nWe will show that Eq. 4 offers a poor prediction of Œ¥ùõø\\delta when a single power-law regime as in Zipf‚Äôs classic work for the multi-author corpora described above. In contrast, the assumption of two regimes, namely improves the quality of predictions.\nFinally, in Section¬†Discussion, we discuss these results for Catalan in the context of previous studies [ref]13   \nand revisit the hypothesis of the existence of a core vocabulary and a peripheral vocabulary   .\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: above. In contrast, the assumption of two regimes, namely improves the quality of predictions.\nFinally, in Section¬†Discussion, we discuss these results for Catalan in the context of previous studies [ref]13   \nand revisit the hypothesis of the existence of a core vocabulary and a peripheral vocabulary   .\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
