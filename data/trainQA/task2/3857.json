      "content": "Paper Title: Geometric Graph Representation with Learnable Graph Structure and Adaptive AU Constraint for Micro-Expression Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, graph-based methods are popular in MER and generally donâ€™t input the whole facial images into models. According to the way to construct graph, these methods can be divided into two types: landmark-based and AU-based. Lei et al.  firstly constructed a landmarks-based graph. The magnified shape features around landmarks were taken as node features. However, they ignore the special relationships of nodes and only employed Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) [ref]36 to deal with the node representation. Recently, Kumar et al. [ref]7 took the facial landmarks and optical flow features around landmarks as node features, and designed Graph Attention Convolutional Network (GACN) to process the landmark-based graph. Except for facial landmarks, AU also is suitable to construct the graph. Lo et al.  designed GCN with two layers to deal with AU-based graph and aggregate AU label information that dots product with spatial-temporal features extracted by 3D convolution. They explores the relationship between AUs and MEs, but the node features are the annotated AU labels, which is not suitable for practical applications. Furthermore, both  and [ref]24 took the AU features extracted by extra model as node features in AU-based graph. Differently, Zhou et al.  connected the inception block and an AU detection module to extract AU features, while Xie et al. [ref]24 employed 3D ConvNet to extract AU features. Lei et al.  introduce transformer and AU features to extend their previous work  through combining two types of graph.\nHowever, on one hand, the existing works with landmark-based graph aggregated dynamic information, e.g. optical flow and magnified shape feature, which still spends too much computational cost to extract these features. On the other hand, the works with AU-based graph need extra learning model to extract AU features as node feature, which increases the model complexity and computational cost. Also, AU detection for MER itself is a very challenging task. Inspired from skeleton-based action recognition works, e.g. , instead of providing much complicated and costly appearance features or not easily accessible AU features, we provide a simple and much efficient way that directly takes landmark coordinate-based geometric features as node features. A new graph network is designed to deal with such geometric features from facial landmarks for MER. Furthermore, the proposed graph-based method involves the relationship between nodes and the AU information. The related works are as follows:\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: graph. The magnified shape features around landmarks were taken as node features. However, they ignore the special relationships of nodes and only employed Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) [ref]36 to deal with the node representation. Recently, Kumar et al.
