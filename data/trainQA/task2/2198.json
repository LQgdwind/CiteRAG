Given an oracle for a desired molecular property, the goal is to generate molecules with high property score after the fewest trials. This is critical to pharmaceutical drug development [ref]44, as property evaluations require expensive wet-lab assays. Similar to 8, we fix a query budget and optimize several properties: QED: a synthetic measure of drug-likeness, relatively simpler to optimize; DRD2: a measure of binding affinity to a human dopamine receptor; HIV, the probability of inhibition potential for HIV; and SARS: the same probability for a variant of the SARS virus, related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19. All four properties have a range of   ; higher is better. For DRD2, HIV, and SARS, we evaluate using computational predictors from  (DRD2) and  (HIV, SARS) in lieu of wet-lab assays. To run LaP3 on molecular design, we view the molecular string representation (SMILES string ) as the action sequence, similar to how many generative models generate molecules autoregressively¬†1   [ref]50. Following the state-of-the-art HierG2G model from 9, we learn a latent representation from a subset of ChEMBL¬†, a dataset of 1.8 million drug-like molecules, without using any of its property labels (e.g., effectiveness in binding to a particular receptor). During this unsupervised training, we only use the 500k molecules with the lowest property scores to ensure a good molecule is discovered by search rather than a simple retrieval from the dataset. Our setting differs from many existing methods for molecular design, which assume a large preexisting set of molecules with the desired property for training the generator    [ref]50. On this task only, the latent space is trained on additional unlabeled data, and is used as both the partition space Œ¶ssubscriptŒ¶ùë†\\Phi_{s} and sampling space Œ¶hsubscriptŒ¶‚Ñé\\Phi_{h} for LaP3. All baselines operate in the same space for fair comparison. Otherwise, all methods struggle to generate well-formed molecules of reasonable length. Results.\nFigure 9 shows the highest property score discovered by each method for each property.\nThe absolute difference is small in the relatively simple synthetic QED task. However, LaP3 outperforms all baselines by a much greater margin‚Äîup to 0.4 in DRD2‚Äîin the more challenging and realistic DRD2, HIV, and SARS tasks, where CEM and CMA-ES quickly plateau but LaP3 continues to improve with more function evaluations.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: design.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
