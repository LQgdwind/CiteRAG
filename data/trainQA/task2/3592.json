      "content": "Paper Title: Federated Cycling (FedCy): Semi-supervised Federated Learning of Surgical Phases\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe establish several baselines to contextualize FedCy with respect to various learning paradigms. In all cases, our aim is to train a ResNet-50 [ref]54 model initialized from ImageNet [ref]55 pretrained weights for the task of surgical phase recognition. In all semi-supervised experiments, we use Cholec80 as the labeled dataset and refer to the 4 unlabeled datasets as D1‚àí4subscriptùê∑14D_{1-4}. Our first category of baselines comprises various fully- and semi- supervised methods assuming access to a single, fully labeled dataset and 4 completely unlabeled datasets, corresponding to 5 independent clients. These methods were chosen to demonstrate the superiority of our approach to both na√Øve federated approaches and state-of-the-art designs that use the same amount of labeled data. The first baseline, FullSup-Cholec80, is trained on a fully labeled cholec80 train set. This presents the standard non-federated approach that excludes external unlabeled data from training. The next baselines, FedFixMatch, FedUDA, and FedTCC represent na√Øve adaptations of FixMatch , UDA  and TCC pretraining , respectively, using federated averaging . Our two final baselines in this category, FedMatch [ref]36 and FedRGD , are state-of-the-art FSSL approaches. Here, FedRGD proposes several changes to improve model performance including a change to the network design, replacing batch normalization layers with group normalization (GN) . To perform a fair comparison with FedRGD, we also implement our final FedCy model with group normalization, denoted by FedCy-GN. Our second category of baselines includes only fully supervised approaches assuming that each of the included datasets is fully labeled. These baselines, which are dependent on the presence of additional labeled data, are included to provide the target performance that we would like to achieve through this and future semi-supervised work. In this category, FullSup-Each, is a model trained using full supervision only on the dataset it is being evaluated on. This represents the strictest scenario in terms of privacy where no sharing of either data or models is involved in training. In contrast, FullSup-All, represents the most relaxed scenario, where a single model is trained on all the data collected together and treated as a single, centralized dataset. Finally, federated averaging  represents the middle ground where models but not data can be transferred freely.\n\nReference markers found: [54]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]54: We establish several baselines to contextualize FedCy with respect to various learning paradigms.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
