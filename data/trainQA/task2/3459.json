      "content": "Paper Title: Problems hard for treewidth but easy for stable gonality\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nProblems on finite (multi-)graphs that are NP-hard may become polynomial by restricting a specific graph parameter kùëòk. If furthermore the degree of the resulting polynomial bound is constant, we say that the problem becomes fixed parameter tractable (FPT) for the parameter kùëòk [15, 1.1]. More precisely, there should exist an algorithm that solves the given problem in time bounded by a computable function of the parameter kùëòk times a power of the input size of the problem. Despite the fact that computing the parameter itself can often be shown to be NP-hard or NP-complete, the FPT-paradigm, originating in the work of Downey and Fellows , has shown to be very fruitful both in theory and practice. One successful approach is to consider graph parameters that measure how far a given graph is from being acyclic; more specifically, how the graph may be decomposed into ‚Äúsmall‚Äù pieces, such that the interrelation of the pieces is described by a tree-like structure. A prime example of such a parameter is the treewidth tw‚Å°(G)twùê∫\\operatorname{tw}(G) of a graph Gùê∫G ([15, Ch.¬†7]; reviewed briefly below). Some reasons for the success are that graphs of bounded treewidth are amenable to algorithms based on dynamic programming [15, 7.3], and Courcelle‚Äôs theorem  [15, 7.4], that states that graph problems described in second order monadic logic are FPT, linear in the number of vertices, provided a tree decomposition realising the treewidth is given. Examples of problems that are FPT for treewidth are Dominating Set and Vertex Cover [15, 7.3]. Other parameters have been considered; for example, in , it is shown that colouring problems such as Equitable Colouring (existence of a vertex colouring with at most kùëòk colours, so that the sizes of any two colour classes differ by at most one) is hard for treewidth (technically, W‚Äã[ref]1Wdelimited-[]1\\mathrm{W}[ref]1-hard), but FPT for vertex cover number. In  and [15, 7.9] one finds more problems and parameters that shift their complexity. Still, some famous graph orientation and graph flow problems, as well as capacitated version of classical problems such as Dominating Set have so far not succumbed to the FPT¬†paradigm for any reasonable parameter, despite being of practical importance in logistics and resource allocation. Below, we will consider Undirected Flow with Lower Bounds, Problem [ND37] in , known to be strongly NP-complete since the 1970‚Äôs. We will show that, when parameterized by treewidth, the problem is hard (in fact, XNLP-complete with pathwidth as parameter, cf.¬†infra). The new paradigm of this paper is that such problems become FPT¬†for a novel, natural graph parameter based on mapping the graph to a tree, rather than decomposing the graph.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: such as Equitable Colouring (existence of a vertex colouring with at most kùëòk colours, so that the sizes of any two colour classes differ by at most one) is hard for treewidth (technically, W‚Äã[ref]1Wdelimited-[]1\\mathrm{W}[ref]1-hard), but FPT for vertex cover number.
