      "content": "Paper Title: AROID: Improving Adversarial Robustness through Online Instance-wise Data Augmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep neural networks (DNNs) are well known to be vulnerable to infinitesimal yet highly malicious artificial perturbations in their input, i.e., adversarial examples . Thus far, adversarial training (AT) has been the most effective defense against adversarial attacks .\nAT is typically formulated as a min-max optimization problem: where the inner maximization searches for the perturbation ùúπùúπ\\bm{\\delta} to maximize the loss, while the outer minimization searches for the model parameters ùúΩùúΩ\\bm{\\theta} to minimize the loss on the perturbed examples. One major issue of AT is that it is prone to overfitting 4 . Unlike in standard training, overfitting in AT, a.k.a. robust overfitting 4, significantly impairs adversarial robustness. Many efforts  [ref]43  have been made to understand robust overfitting and mitigate its effect. One promising solution is data augmentation (DA), which is a common technique to prevent standard training from overfitting. However, many studies 4 [ref]43  3 have revealed that advanced DA methods, originally proposed for standard training, often fail to improve adversarial robustness.Therefore, DA was usually combined with other regularization techniques such as Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) 3, Consistency regularization 7 and Separate Batch Normalization  to improve its effectiveness.\nHowever, recent work  demonstrated that DA alone can significantly improve AT if it has strong diversity and well-balanced hardness. This suggests that standard training and AT may require different DA strategies, especially in terms of hardness. It is thus necessary to design DA schemes dedicated to AT. IDBH  is the first and the latest DA scheme specifically designed for AT. Despite its impressive robust performance, IDBH employs a heuristic search method to manually optimize DA. This search process requires a complete AT for every sampled policy, which induces prohibitive computational cost and scales poorly to large datasets and models. Hence, when the computational budget is limited, the hyperparameters for IDBH might be found using a reduced search space and by employing a smaller model, leading to compromised performance. Another issue is that IDBH, in common with other conventional DA methods such as AutoAugment  and TrivialAugment 1, applies the same strategy to all samples in the dataset throughout training.\nThe distinctions between different training samples, and between the model checkpoints at different stages of training, are neglected. We hypothesize that different data samples at the same stage of training, as well as the same sample at the different stages of training, demand different DAs. Hence, we conjecture that an improvement in robustness could be realized by customizing DA for data samples and training stages. To address the above issues, this work proposes a bi-level optimization framework (see Fig.¬†1) to automatically learn Adversarial Robustness by Online Instance-wise Data-augmentation (AROID).\nTo the best of our knowledge, AROID is the first automated DA method specific to AT.\nAROID employs a multi-head DNN-based policy model to map a data sample to a DA policy (see Fig.¬†2). This DA policy is defined as a sequence of pre-defined transformations applied with strength determined by the output of the policy model. This policy model is optimized, alongside the training of the target model, towards three novel objectives to achieve a target level of hardness and diversity.\nDA policies, therefore, are customized for each data instance and evolve with the target network as training progresses. This in practice produces a more globally optimal DA policy and thus benefits robustness. Importantly, the proposed policy learning objectives, in contrast to the conventional ones like validation accuracy , do not reserve a subset of the training data for validation and do not rely on prohibitively expensive inner loops for training the target model to evaluate the rewards of the sampled policies. The former ensures the entire training set is available for training to avoid potential data scarcity. The latter enables policy optimization to be much more efficient and scalable so that it is more practical for AT. Compared to IDBH in particular, this allows our approach to explore a larger space of DAs on the target. Extensive experiments show that AROID outperforms or matches all competitive DA methods across various datasets and model architectures while being more efficient than the prior art IDBH. AROID achieves state-of-the-art robustness for DA methods on the standard benchmarks of CIFAR10 and Imagenette with WideResNets and Vision Transformers, respectively. Furthermore, AROID outperforms, regarding accuracy and robustness, state-of-the-art AT methods.\nAROID also complements such robust training methods and can be combined with them to improve robustness further.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: One major issue of AT is that it is prone to overfitting 4 .
