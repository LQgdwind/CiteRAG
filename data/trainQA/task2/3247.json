      "content": "Paper Title: EvoMoE: An Evolutional Mixture-of-Experts Training Framework via Dense-To-Sparse Gate\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExploiting the sparsity in deep neural networks can reduce both storage and computation requirements for model training and inference.\nOne of the most widely used sparsification methods is weight pruning  [ref]32.\nPrevious studies proposed to prune away redundant or less useful weights based on various pruning criteria (e.g., the importance of individual weights [ref]32 or groups of weights [ref]33  ) and then fine-tune remaining weights to regain the lost accuracy.\nAfter pruning and fine-tuning, parts of weights are permanently removed, inducing a static sparsity pattern in DNNs.\nThe sparsity pattern/structure is a trade-off between model effectiveness and hardware efficiency . Early work attempts to increase the sparsity ratio or model accuracy by employing unstructured sparsification methods, while recent work focuses more on structured sparsity for practical speedup on hardware.\nInterestingly,  points out training a sparse network from scratch is superior or comparable to pruning-based methods.\nOur EvoMoE adopts a dense-to-sparse gate, which is analogous to pruning-based methods that train all experts first and then learning the sparse gate routing. Different from previous static sparse neural networks that permanently remove partial weights, conditional computation  only activates the relevant parameter of the model on a per-sample basis, which can be regarded as a dynamic sparsity structure that remains all model weights but brings sparsity into the computation. The mixture-of-expert (MoE) architecture [ref]7, as a specific form of conditional computation, contains a series of experts and a trainable gating network which routes each input sample to its corresponding experts.\nConditional computation is capable of reducing inference cost (without reducing model capacity) or increasing model capacity (without increasing inference cost) from a model acceleration or scaling perspective.\nOn the other hand, the sparsely activated parts (i.e., MoE in models) can be regarded as structured sparse blocks, which does not introduce additional computational overhead.\nHowever, conditional computation models are often difficult to train, since they require learning discrete routing decisions from individual examples to experts and the gating network tends to converge to a state that only selects the same few experts .\nLSTM-MoE [ref]7, GShard  and Switch-Transformer  utilize auxiliary load-balancing losses to mitigate this self-reinforcement phenomenon and thus improve training efficiency.\nIn such MoE models, the gating network and experts, as two critical components,\nare jointly trained which may interfere with each other.\nIn EvoMoE, we consider decoupling the training of experts and the gating network by involving all experts starting with a high temperature in Gumbel-Softmax and then training the gating network to be sparser and select the best expert through decaying this temperature.\nBASELayer  formulates the token-expert routing as a linear assignment problem and guarantees balanced compute loads by employing numerous algorithms.\nHashLayer  replaces the gating network with a hash-based routing strategy (e.g., random hash, clustered hash dispersed hash).\nMoEfication  utilizes the sparse activation in feed-forward networks (FFNs) of a Transformer model and divides each large dense FFN into several experts to accelerate model inference, while EvoMoE evolves a small dense model into a large and sparse MoE model. The multi-task learning (MTL) adopts a shared architecture to learn multiple tasks, which exploits relationships among tasks and achieve better generalization performance . However, sharing parameters between unrelated tasks can potentially degrade performance.\nThe multi-gate MoE (i.e., MMoE) architecture is introduced as an effective way to exploit both the commonalities and differences among tasks, where each task has its own gate that adaptively controls the extent of parameter sharing .\nDSelect-K  involves sparse gates (Top-K) for better parameter sharing and trains gates from dense to sparse for smoothness,\nRegarding DSelect-K and the DTS gate in our EvoMoE both propose the dense-to-sparse mechanism, they are trying to address two totally different problems, though both two pieces of work show SparseMoE is better than DenseMoE by coincidence.\nFor our DTS work, because DenseMoE performs well but cost for large model pretraining, we tried to find a more efficient solution (SparseMoE). While for the multi-task work, because DenseMoE performs badly for multi-task learning, they tried to find a better solution to deal with various tasks, i.e., DSelectK. Therefore, this two pieces of work have clearly different motivations.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: the sparsity in deep neural networks can reduce both storage and computation requirements for model training and inference.\nOne of the most widely used sparsification methods is weight pruning  [ref]32.\nPrevious studies proposed to prune away redundant or less useful weights based on various pruning criteria (e.g., the importance of individual weights [ref]32 or groups of weights [ref]33  )\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
