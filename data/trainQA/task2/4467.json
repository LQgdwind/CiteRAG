      "content": "Paper Title: Entity Type Prediction Leveraging Graph Walks and Entity Descriptions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRDF2vec  is one of the first approaches to adopt statistical language modeling techniques to KGs. The key idea of RDF2vec is a two-step approach: first, random walks over the graph are executed, thereby collecting sequences of entities and relations. To employ language modeling techniques, these sequences are then considered as sentences where each entity and relation in the sequence are treated as words. In RDF2vec, those sentences are then processed by word2vec  , where both variants of word2vec, i.e., continuous bag of words (CBOW) and skip-gram (SG), are possible. One limitation of the word2vec algorithm is that it is not aware of the word order. For instance, for a window size of 4, the sentences “John ate a pizza” and “pizza ate a John” are equivalent. This is also the case with RDF2vec: For instance, the statements <Severus> <loves> <Lily> and <Lily> <loves> <Severus>, are considered equivalent even though <loves> is not a symmetric property. To overcome this limitation, an order-aware version of RDF2vec has been proposed  which has shown improved performance on multiple machine learning datasets. This order-aware variant of RDF2vec uses a structured word2vec model  which incorporates the positional information of the words in a sentence. The main advantage of the order-aware RDF2vec model over the classical RDF2vec model is that it respects the positional information of the entities and relations in the random walks, thereby learning embeddings which are better in terms of type separation. Another type of RDF2vec extension is to explore different strategies for performing graph walks. These strategies have been explored using either variants of random walks (e.g., community hops , walklets [ref]21, or hierarchical walks ), or by combining different random walk strategies, as the ontowalk2vec approach, which combines RDF2vec and node2vec walks [ref]8.\nIn this paper, the aforementioned order-aware as well as different RDF2vec graph walk strategies [ref]25 are leveraged to predict the missing types of the entities. Graph Walk Generation Strategies. RDF2vec combines the notion of similarity and relatedness. This can be easily observed when printing the most related concepts for “Berlin” on DBpedia via KGvec2go , i.e., many people who are related to the city are identified as politicians. However, those are not really similar – they do not share properties with Berlin (which is a city rather than a living being). This leads to further exploration of RDF2vec for entity typing. In this paper, six different RDF2vec configurations are presented and evaluated – stand alone as well as combinations.\nFor the task of entity typing, three different walk generation strategies are applied: (1) classic walks, (2) entity walks, and (3) predicate walks. Each strategy is explained below in more detail. Classic Walks.\nThe originally presented RDF2vec variant generates multiple random walks for each node in the graph.\nA random walk of length n𝑛n (where n𝑛n is an even number) is of the form where wi∈𝒱subscript𝑤𝑖𝒱w_{i}\\in\\mathcal{V} if i𝑖i is even, and wi∈ℛsubscript𝑤𝑖ℛw_{i}\\in\\mathcal{R} if i𝑖i is odd.\nFor better readability, we stylize wi∈𝒱subscript𝑤𝑖𝒱w_{i}\\in\\mathcal{V} as eisubscript𝑒𝑖e_{i} and wi∈ℛsubscript𝑤𝑖ℛw_{i}\\in\\mathcal{R} as pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i}: Entity Walks (e-RDF2vec). An entity walk contains only entities without any other properties. Such an approach is also known as e-RDF2vec, given by For an entity walk, all elements are entities, i.e., wni∈𝒱subscript𝑤subscript𝑛𝑖𝒱w_{n_{i}}\\in\\mathcal{V}. Predicate Walks (p-RDF2vec).\nA predicate walk contains only one entity together with object properties known as p-RDF2vec and is defined as: The different walk strategies are visualized in component  A in Figure 1. Generating Entity Embeddings using RDF2Vec variants.\nAn embedding model is trained for each set of walks using word2vec   and position-aware word2vec  (suffix o​a𝑜𝑎oa in the following) which yields six sets of embeddings: (1) Classic RDF2vec, (2) e-RDF2vec, (3) p-RDF2vec, (4) Classic RDF2vecoa, (5) e-RDF2vecoa, and (6) p-RDF2vecoa.\nThe proposed model, GRAND, is evaluated by using the configurations presented in 3.1 on their own as well as in a fused way. Concerning the fusion of vectors, three modes are employed: (1) Vector concatenation, (2) Local PCA (LPCA), and (3) Global PCA (GPCA). PCA is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of the vectors with minimal loss in encoded information. It is used for identification of a smaller number of uncorrelated variables known as principal components. The difference between (2) and (3) is that in the case of the LPCA, a principal component analysis is only performed for the subset of vectors that appear in the datasets (see Section 4) whereas for the GPCA, one all vectors generated from the KG using RDF2vec variants are considered. Each of these configurations can be used as vector within GRAND (see component  C in Figure 2). The main advantages of using different RDF2vec variants are: (i) With a growing length of walks and training window, they can take advantage of large entity context ranges by effectively treating every entity as being connected to all the others in the graph – this is in contrast to the baseline models which are based on local aggregation, i.e. they learn the representation of each entity based on its adjacent entities in the KG  . (ii) The graph walk strategies are effective, robust, and equitable, i.e., all relations and nodes are given equal importance in generating the embeddings. (iii) The walk strategies put emphasis on certain semantic aspects – namely relatedness and similarity [ref]25. (iv) RDF2vec is a very scalable embedding algorithm. (v) The experimental results from  show RDF2vec works better on the separability task compared to the other embedding models. The separability task aims at measuring if embeddings from different classes can be linearly separable and the evaluation is done on 10,000 pairs of classes from DBpedia.\n(vi) Any classification algorithm can be deployed on top of entity embeddings to predict the missing types.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: type of RDF2vec extension is to explore different strategies for performing graph walks. These strategies have been explored using either variants of random walks (e.g., community hops , walklets [ref]21, or hierarchical walks ), or by combining different random walk strategies, as the ontowalk2vec approach, which combines RDF2vec and node2vec walks [ref]8.\nIn this paper, the aforementioned\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
