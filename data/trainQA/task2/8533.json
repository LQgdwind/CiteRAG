      "content": "Paper Title: On the clique number of random Cayley graphs and related topics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGiven a group G𝐺G and a subset S𝑆S of G𝐺G with the property that s−1∈Ssuperscript𝑠1𝑆s^{-1}\\in S whenever s∈S𝑠𝑆s\\in S, the Cayley graph GSsubscript𝐺𝑆G_{S} is the graph with vertex set G𝐺G where two vertices x𝑥x and y𝑦y are joined by an edge if and only if x​y−1∈S𝑥superscript𝑦1𝑆xy^{-1}\\in S. For example, for N≡1(mod4)𝑁annotated1pmod4N\\equiv 1\\pmod{4} prime, the Paley graph PNsubscript𝑃𝑁P_{N} is the Cayley graph on ℤNsubscriptℤ𝑁\\mathbb{Z}_{N} whose generating set S𝑆S is the set of quadratic residues, so that vertices x𝑥x and y𝑦y are joined by an edge if and only if x−y𝑥𝑦x-y is a quadratic residue. Our first concern in this paper will be with estimating the clique number, the order of the largest complete subgraph, of random Cayley graphs. For the usual binomial random graph GN,1/2subscript𝐺𝑁12G_{N,1/2}, the graph with N𝑁N vertices where each edge is chosen independently with probability 1/2121/2, it has been known since seminal work of Erdős  in the 1940s that the clique number is at most 2​log2⁡N2subscript2𝑁2\\log_{2}N with high probability and this bound was later shown to be asymptotically tight (see, for example,   and their references). Building on work of Green , Green and Morris  showed that the same upper bound holds with high probability for the clique number of the uniform random Cayley graph on ℤNsubscriptℤ𝑁\\mathbb{Z}_{N} with N𝑁N prime, where each set {s,−s}𝑠𝑠\\{s,-s\\} is included in the generating set S𝑆S independently with probability 1/2121/2. One of our main results says that there is an absolute constant C𝐶C such that the uniform random Cayley graph on any group G𝐺G with N𝑁N elements has clique number at most C​log⁡N​log⁡log⁡N𝐶𝑁𝑁C\\log N\\log\\log N with high probability, which improves on an earlier bound of C​log2⁡N𝐶superscript2𝑁C\\log^{2}N due to Alon  and, for some groups such as 𝔽2nsuperscriptsubscript𝔽2𝑛\\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}, is best possible up to the constant. Surprisingly, the proof of this result does not make use of the structure of groups in any meaningful way and applies in a much more general combinatorial setting, to what we call random entangled graphs. The main input, and arguably our real main result, is an essentially best possible upper bound for the number of subsets of order n𝑛n that contain at most K​n𝐾𝑛Kn colors in a proper edge-coloring of the complete graph KNsubscript𝐾𝑁K_{N}. To show the power of this result, we also use it to make progress on an important conjecture of Alon  on the existence of Ramsey Cayley graphs. A graph on N𝑁N vertices is said to be C𝐶C-Ramsey if both its clique number and its independence number, the clique number of its complement, are at most C​log⁡N𝐶𝑁C\\log N. This definition is motivated by an old result of Erdős and Szekeres  saying that there are no 1/2121/2-Ramsey graphs (see also the recent breakthrough by Campos, Griffiths, Morris and Sahasrabudhe [ref]12 which improves this 1/2121/2 to 1/2+ε12𝜀1/2+\\varepsilon for some absolute constant ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0), implying that Ramsey graphs, if they exist, are essentially best possible. In the other direction, Ramsey graphs do exist, since the result of Erdős  on the clique number of random graphs implies that almost all graphs on N𝑁N vertices are 222-Ramsey. It has also long been conjectured that the family of Paley graphs should be a good source of Ramsey graphs, though the difficulty in proving this was one of the sparks that initiated the closer study of both the clique number and the Ramsey properties of random Cayley graphs. With this notation in hand,\nAlon’s conjecture states that there is an absolute constant C𝐶C such that every finite group has a C𝐶C-Ramsey Cayley graph. The results of Green  and Green and Morris  mentioned earlier imply that this conjecture is true over ℤNsubscriptℤ𝑁\\mathbb{Z}_{N}. There it is sufficient to consider uniform random Cayley graphs, but over other groups such as 𝔽2nsuperscriptsubscript𝔽2𝑛\\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}, where the clique number of the random Cayley graph is Ω​(log⁡N​log⁡log⁡N)Ω𝑁𝑁\\Omega(\\log N\\log\\log N) with high probability, this cannot work. Nevertheless, by using our counting result together with some additional ideas, we are able to prove Alon’s conjecture for a range of groups, including abelian groups of order N𝑁N for almost all N𝑁N and finite vector spaces of characteristic at least 555. Arguably our strongest result in this direction says that if G𝐺G is a finite vector space of order N𝑁N with characteristic congruent to 1(mod4)annotated1pmod41\\pmod{4}, then it has a self-complementary Cayley graph whose clique number and independence number are both at most (2+o​(1))​log⁡N2𝑜1𝑁(2+o(1))\\log N. This solves, in strong form, a problem of Alon and Orlitsky  arising from information theory asking whether self-complementary Ramsey Cayley graphs exist. We will describe our work on Alon’s conjecture in detail below, but first we look more closely at our results on the clique number of random Cayley graphs and the more general combinatorial results from which they follow.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: This definition is motivated by an old result of Erdős and Szekeres  saying that there are no 1/2121/2-Ramsey graphs (see also the recent breakthrough by Campos, Griffiths, Morris and Sahasrabudhe [ref]12 which improves this 1/2121/2 to 1/2+ε12𝜀1/2+\\varepsilon for some absolute constant ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0), implying that Ramsey graphs, if they exist, are essentially best possible.
