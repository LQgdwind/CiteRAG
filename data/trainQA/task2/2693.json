      "content": "Paper Title: Studying Fake News Spreading, Polarisation Dynamics, and Manipulation by Bots: a Tale of Networks and Language\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlthough network scientists and NLP experts have been members of quite distant scientific communities for years, network-based and linguistics perspectives have been often adopted together to tackle the problem of disinformation online. From one side, one could investigate the behavioural properties of the news propagation network, to detect malicious content diffusing in an anomalous way. From the other side, one could investigate the stylistic features that differentiate false from true news, or bots and fake news propagators from regular users. For instance, Shu et al. [ref]237 is a great survey on methods for detection of fake news from how they spread on networks, but with little mention of the content they deliver. Similarly, Oshikawa et al.  is a comprehensive survey on detection of fake news using NLP techniques. However, accounting for only the network side of disinformation could result in neglecting the stylistic cues of fake news articles, and the other way around. In 2015 Conroy et al. [ref]57 presented a survey of linguistic-based and network-based methods for fake news detection, but without any mixed contribution, for which they stated to “see promise in an innovative hybrid approach that combines linguistic cue and machine learning, with network-based behavioural data”. Since then, we are seeing a growing trend of contributions that mix both approaches. One of the first pioneering approaches that combined characteristics from both disciplines was attempted by Castillo et al. , that designed features that exploited information from user profiles, tweets and propagation trees. Not surprisingly, this paper corresponds to one of the most influential milestone in the periphery network (see Sec. 3), as listed in the Supplementary Material. Similarly, Shu et al. [ref]238 proposed a model that exploits the structural, temporal and linguistic perspectives of the hierarchical propagation network of fake news to effectively distinguish them from real news. Fed to classical machine learning models, their combination of features outperforms each feature taken alone. Monti et al.  proposed a CNN fed with an embedding of a high number of features, regarding content (words, including hashtags) and spreading on networks (social connections and cascades trees, among others) for detection of fake news. Jin et al.  also evaluated news credibility by mining the stance correlations within a graph optimisation framework. In particular, they linked a credibility propagation network of tweets with supporting or opposing relations. The credibility labels were generated by the credibility propagation on the network. Temporal, structural, and linguistic characteristics were also combined by  for addressing the problem of rumour detection. For the temporal aspect, they considered a periodic time series model that captured daily and external shock cycles. Structural aspect referred to network characteristics such as the number of nodes and links in the friendship network, whereas the linguistic characteristics were based on LIWC and included the number of words that indicated several psycho-linguistic categories. Another interdisciplinary approach was presented by Zhang et al.  who proposed to address the credibility detection problem with a set of explicit and latent features extracted from the textual information of news articles, creators and subjects. In their study, they proposed a deep diffusive network model to incorporate the network structure information into model learning based on the connections among news articles, creators and news subjects. Shu et al.  proposed an approach based on embedding the relationships among news articles, publishers and spreaders on social media. With the embeddings, they represented the news content by using non-negative matrix factorisation, the users on social media, the news-user relationships such as user engagements in news spreading, and the news publisher relationships such as publisher engagement in publishing. Then a semi-supervised machine learning framework is applied for the fake news detection. Mixed approaches have been used extensively for the detection of bots and trolls as well. DARPA held a 4-week competition  with the aim of identifying bots influencing a pro-vaccination discussion on Twitter, providing features that range from the style of texts to the structure of neighbourhood of users. The Botometer tool , largely discussed in Sec. 8.2, computes the probability of a batch of accounts being automated by looking at the content they tweet from a psycho-linguistic point of view, and also by looking at network-based metrics and their ego-network. Consequently, other works that leverage Botometer are inherently using a mixed approach for bots characterisation   . Stella et al.  paired a deep network analysis of the topology and patterns of human-bots interaction network with an investigation of related concepts in tweets promoted by bots. Dickerson et al.  employed several features to characterise tweets’ syntax and semantics, along with users’ behaviour and their neighbourhood, to identify bots aiming to influence the 2014 Indian elections. Atanasov et al.  leveraged the community structure and the text of the messages from which they extracted different types of representations such as embeddings, in order to distinguish trolls from regular users. Echo chambers and polarisation are inherently network phenomena, but the textual analysis of the content discussed can better characterise in-group and out-group interactions. For instance, Williams et al.  and Zollo et al.  both found that in-group communications showed a positive sentiment, while out-group interactions were predominantly hostile. The latter found even a negative reaction of conspiracy believers to scientific debunking posts. Bessi  could link personality traits to the tendency of users to surround themselves with like-minded, by inspecting both the interaction between users and their comments. Lai et al. 1 0 studied polarised debates on constitutional referendums on Twitter observing the dynamics of changing stances and network homophily; also the machine learning models used to detect users’ stances over time were trained embedding network measures as features. Finally, the recent COVID-19 infodemic phenomenon , has been studied using both network analysis and text processing tools extensively: Cinelli et al.  studied the online discussion on the virus outbreak observing different social platforms, and analysing COVID-19 related topics by means of word embedding techniques. Furthermore, they observed the infodemic diffusion with compartmental epidemic models, estimating the basic reproduction number R0subscript𝑅0R_{0} for each social media platform. Gruzd et al.  curated a special theme issue of “Big Data &\\& Society” Journal on Studying the COVID-19 infodemic at scale, mentioning necessary analytical techniques from machine learning, network analysis, agent-based modelling, and text mining. The “COVID-19 Infodemic Observatory”, a platform for the large-scale analysis of publicly available discourse on Twitter presented by Gallotti et al. , analysed more than 1.6 billion COVID-19 related tweets and estimated that around 40%percent4040\\% of them are shared by social bots. Using text mining and network based approaches, they estimates infodemic risks variations across countries, arguing that the level of socio-economic development is not the key discriminant to separate countries with high versus low infodemic risk. For instance, there are G8 countries with remarkable infodemic risk (e.g., Russia and Germany) and developing countries showing lower risk (e.g., Thailand and the Philippines).\n\nReference markers found: [237]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]237: way.
