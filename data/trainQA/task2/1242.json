      "content": "Paper Title: Occlusion Guided Scene Flow Estimation on 3D Point Clouds\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nScene flow estimation is a core challenge in computer vision which aims to find the 3D motion between points from consecutive temporal frames. While flows in between images, also known as optical flow, still have an important part in modern vision systems, the rise of depth sensors shifts the focus towards geometric flows. The two tasks are similar in spirit but with one fundamental gap - the data source for optical flow are regular dense samples given on top of a grid, while most depth sensors, especially outdoor, provide a sparse set of points in space. Algorithmic-wise, in the deep networks era, that gap shifts us from image-based convolutions towards graph neural network architectures. Early attempts to solve 3D model alignment minimized the point-to-point or point-to-plane energy and were referred to as Iterative-Closest-Point (ICP) algorithms [ref]5 , where during iterative steps one searches for the closest set of matched points and minimizes the energy on that subset. Rigid alignment  [ref]5 was first introduced, then rapidly non-rigid deformations were solved by adding adequate regularization [ref]3.\nMany different approaches for alignment appeared over the years. Just stating a few -   [ref]7    focused on RGB-D between stereo images,   introduced a more robust cost function,   considered the alignment as a quadratic assignment task and   added intrinsic long geodesics to enrich the process with global features. Moving from axiomatic methods towards learning-based approach became feasible lately, where graph convolutions evolved as well as rich and deep enough networks were capable of sensing more of the scene.\nFlowNet3D  was probably the first robust learnable deep network for aligning 3D point clouds. It utilizes a PointNet++  structure and computes the correlation between the point clouds by using the flow embedding layer. Following that line of thought PointPWC-Net , based on an optical flow mechanism  , uses Feature Pyramid Network on top of local correlations with a new cost volume and cost function, showing superior results all across the benchmarks. Lately, we have seen attempts to handle larger sets of deformations by correlating all points with all points  but those models require a massive increase in memory resources and suffer from outliers that need to be cleaned. When calculating flow in between objects, we encounter in many cases the challenge of occlusions, where some regions in one frame do not exist in the other. Due to the displacement between the sensor and the object, the sensor does not see the entire object in all time steps. Incorrect treatment of the occluded area would reduce the performance of the flow estimation. That is true for optical flow tasks in images and of course for scene flow.\nClassical methods usually regularize incoherent motion to propagate flow from non-occluded pixels to the occluded region   . That is also true in the deep learning era where occlusions were learned in addition to flow estimation. Those attempts worked well on regular grids but traditionally failed on a sparse set of points due to numerical challenges. In this work, we focus on that exact task and show for the first time that if we couple the task for flow and occlusion tight enough in a guided approach we can gain in both worlds; getting a more accurate flow and understanding what is occluded. The main contributions of our work are: We propose a deep learning model called OGSF-Net which can jointly estimate the scene flow and occlusion map from point clouds. We utilize an occlusion handling mechanism inside our Cost Volume layer. We present a new residual multi-scale architecture in place of traditional multi-scale flow schemes. We show state-of-the-art performance on Flyingthings3D and KITTI Scene Flow 2015.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: graph neural network architectures.
