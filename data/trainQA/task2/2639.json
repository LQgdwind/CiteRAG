Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

Training the MSM.\nThe default network architecture of the MSM is ResNet-19 shown in Figure 2, with M​1𝑀1M1, M​2𝑀2M2, M​3𝑀3M3, and M​4𝑀4M4 set to 32, 80, 200, and 500, respectively.\nWe follow previous works [ref]12  to evaluate the transferability of AEs in two settings: using a single source model and using multiple source models.\nWe set the input resolution of the MSM to 224×\\times224.\nNote that, when the resolution of the source model differs from that of the MSM, we resize the AE xa​d​vTsuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑇x_{adv}^{T} to the resolution of the source model before feeding it into the source model.\nMore details about training the MSM will be shown in Appendix. Evaluating the MSM.\nWe follow the compared methods\nto randomly choose 5,000 validation images from ImageNet that are correctly classified by all models for evaluation.\nNote that, when the resolutions of the MSM and the target model are different, we resize the AE xa​d​vTsuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑇x_{adv}^{T} to the resolution of the target model.\nFor instance, when attacking Inc-V3 whose resolution is 299×\\times299, we first resize xa​d​vTsuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑇x_{adv}^{T} from 224×\\times224 to 299×\\times299 and then use the resized xa​d​vTsuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑇x_{adv}^{T} to attack Inc-V3.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: imagenet_models including ResNet-50, -101, -152 , DenseNet-121, -161 [ref]23, Inception-V3 , -V4 , Inception-ResNet-V2, Inception-V3ens3, Inception-V3ens4, and Inception-ResNet-V2ens.\nThe former eight models are normally trained models while the latter three are\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
