      "content": "Paper Title: Smoothness Analysis of Adversarial Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile deep learning is starting to play a crucial role in modern data analysis applications,\ndeep learning applications are threatened by adversarial examples.\nAdversarial examples are data perturbed to make models misclassify them.\nTo improve the robustness against adversarial examples, a lot of studies have explored and presented\ndefense methods¬† 0 3   6 .\nEspecially, adversarial training has attracted the most attention¬† 0 3.\nAdversarial training generates adversarial examples of training data by maximizing the loss function with norm constraints\nand minimizes the loss function on these adversarial examples with respect to parameters to obtain the robustness. However, adversarial training is still difficult to achieve good accuracies on adversarial examples (hereinafter, called robust accuracies)\ncompared with accuracies on clean data achieved by standard training.\nTo tackle the issue, several studies investigate\nthe loss landscape in the parameter space¬†2 [ref]32 .\nWu et¬†al. [ref]32 have experimentally revealed that loss landscapes in the parameter space of adversarial training\ncan be sharp, which is a cause of the poor generalization performance of adversarial training.\nAs a theoretical analysis, Liu et¬†al. 2 have shown that the loss function of the adversarial training (hereinafter, called adversarial loss) is not a Lipschitz-smooth function: i.e.,\nits gradient is not Lipchitz continuous¬†.\nSince the gradient-based optimization is not very effective for non-smooth objective functions¬†,\nthis indicates that minimization in adversarial training is more difficult than that in the standard training.\nHowever, this theoretical analysis ignores the dependence of adversarial examples on the model parameters.\nSince adversarial examples are optimized for the models, they should depend on the parameters. Considering the dependence,\nwe theoretically investigate the smoothness of adversarial loss in the parameter space and reveal\nthat the constraint of adversarial attacks is one cause of non-smoothness.\nIn addition, since our analysis still indicates that adversarial loss can be a non-smooth function,\nwe show that EntropySGD addresses the non-smoothness of adversarial loss.\nFirst, we analyze the Lipschitz continuity of gradients of adversarial loss for binary linear classification\nbecause its optimal adversarial examples are obtained in closed form.\nAs a result, we reveal that adversarial loss can be a locally smooth function\nand that the smoothness depends on the constraints of adversarial examples.\nNext, we extend the analysis to the general case using the optimal adversarial attack.\nBy using the condition of the local maximum point, we reveal that the adversarial loss using the optimal attack is a locally smooth function\nif the optimal attack is inside the feasible region of the constraints (i.e., if the constraints do not affect the optimal attack).\nIn addition, even if the optimal attack is on the boundary of the feasible region,\nthe adversarial loss with the L2subscriptùêø2L_{2} norm constraint becomes locally smooth.\nOur analysis also implies that if we flatten the loss function with respect to input data,\nthe Lipschitz constant of gradient with respect to parameters can increase: the Lipschitz constant depends on the singular values of Hessian matrices with respect to input data.\nSince Lipschitz constants of gradient determine the convergence and stability of training¬†1,\nthis result might explain why adversarial training is more difficult than standard training.\nFinally, to show that the improvements in smoothness contributes adversarial training, we apply EntropySGD to adversarial training.\nWe prove that EntropySGD smoothens the non-smooth and non-negative loss function,\nand our experimental results demonstrate that EntropySGD accelerates adversarial training and improves robust accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: called robust accuracies)\ncompared with accuracies on clean data achieved by standard training.\nTo tackle the issue, several studies investigate\nthe loss landscape in the parameter space¬†2 [ref]32 .\nWu et¬†al.
