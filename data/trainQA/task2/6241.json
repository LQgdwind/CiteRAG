      "content": "Paper Title: A Graph is Worth 1-bit Spikes: When Graph Contrastive Learning Meets Spiking Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph contrastive learning. \nSelf-supervised representation learning from graph data is a quickly evolving field.\nThe last years have witnessed the emergence of a promising self-supervised learning strategy, referred to as graph contrastive learning (GCL) [ref]23.\nTypically, GCL works by contrasting so-called positive samples against negative ones from different graph augmentation views, which has led to the development of several novel techniques and frameworks such as DGI [ref]37, GraphCL , GRACE , and GGD . Recent research has also suggested that negative samples are not always necessary for graph contrastive learning, with prominent examples including BGRL  and CCA-SSG . Negative-sample-free approach paves the way to a simple yet effective GCL method and frees the model from intricate designs.\nWe refer readers to [ref]23 for a comprehensive review of graph contrastive learning.\nDespite the achievements, current GCL designs mainly focus on task accuracy with a large hidden dimensionality  , and lack consideration of hardware resource limitations to meet the real-time requirements of edge application scenarios . Spiking neural networks. \nSNNs, which mimic biological neural networks by leveraging sparse and event-driven activations, are very promising for low-power applications.\nSNNs have been around for a while, and although they have not gained the same level of popularity as GNNs, they have steadily increased their influence in recent years.\nOver the past few years, SNNs have gained significant popularity in the field of vision tasks, including image classification , objection detection , and segmentation .\nEfforts have been paid to incorporate their biological plausibility and leverage their promising energy efficiency into GNN learning. SpikingGCN  is a recent endeavor on encoding the node representation through SNNs. As SNNs are intrinsically dynamic with abundant temporal information conveyed by spike timing, SpikeNet  then proceeds to model the temporal evolution of dynamic graphs via SNNs.\nIn spite of the increasing research interests, the benefits of SNNs have not been discovered in GCL yet. Binarized graph representation learning. \nModel size, memory footprint, and energy consumption are common concerns for many real-world applications [ref]1.\nIn reaction, binarized graph representation learning has been developed in response to the need for more efficient and compact representations for learning on large-scale graph data. Currently, there are two lines of research being pursued in this area. One line of research involves directly quantizing graphs by using discrete hashing techniques  [ref]1 or estimating gradients of non-differentiable quantization process .\nAnother research line to produce binary representations using deep learning methods are those binarized networks, which are designed for fast inference and small memory footprint, in which binary representation is only a by-product .\nOn one hand, binarized graph representation learning is a novel and promising direction that aims to encode graphs into compact binary vectors that can facilitate efficient storage, retrieval, and computation. On the other hand, SNNs that use discrete spikes rather than real values to communicate between neurons are naturally preferred for learning binary representations. Therefore, it is intuitively promising to explore the marriage between them.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: learning from graph data is a quickly evolving field.\nThe last years have witnessed the emergence of a promising self-supervised learning strategy, referred to as graph contrastive learning (GCL) [ref]23.\nTypically, GCL works by contrasting so-called positive samples against negative ones from different graph augmentation views, which has led to the development of several novel techniques and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
