      "content": "Paper Title: IllumiNet: Transferring Illumination from Planar Surfaces to Virtual Objects in Augmented Reality\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCompositing rendered virtual objects into real scenes is a fundamental but challenging problem. Emerging applications such as augmented reality (AR), live streaming, and film production all demand realistic compositing.\nThe high dynamic range (HDR) environment maps are usually adopted to record the illumination of the entire scene. It reproduces a great dynamic range of luminosity which is even higher than that of the human visual system. However direct capture of HDR images is not feasible for most cases, as it requires tedious set-ups and expensive devices .\nOn the contrary, commercial augmented reality tools, e.g. Apple’s ARkit, provide lightweight mobile applications to estimate the scene illumination. But these techniques only consider the camera exposure information and are actually quite rudimentary. In order to achieve realistic rendering, previous approaches try to obtain the HDR environment maps in various ways. For example, some works propose to insert certain objects to the scene, such as light probes  , 3D objects   with known properties, or human faces  . Some assume they have additional information e.g. panoramas 7, depth , or user input . Although these methods work well in certain scenarios, such requirements are usually not feasible for practical applications. Therefore, recent works try to infer the HDR environment maps from limited input information by learning. For example  [ref]28 [ref]13 propose to recover the HDR environment maps from a single limited filed-of-view (FOV) low dynamic range(LDR) image for indoor scenes, while  8 [ref]17 take use of the sky model and try to infer the outdoor lighting. Although the learning-based methods achieve plausible results, recovering the illumination of the entire scene is still a highly ill-posed problem, mainly because of the complexity of HDR environment maps and the missing information from the input LDR image. The illumination of a scene is a result of many factors including various lighting sources, surface reflectance, scene geometry, and object inter-reflections. The limited FOV, which only captures 6% of the panoramic scene according to , makes the problem even harder since the light sources are very likely not captured in the input image. More importantly, HDR environment maps only account for the illumination incident from every direction at a particular point in the scene, which is often violated for spatially-varying lighting in the scene . It means that, describing illumination of the entire scene with a single HDR environment map may fall short for realistic rendering of virtual objects. Therefore in this research project, we propose an object illumination estimation method by transferring the lighting conditions from 3D planes detected in real scenes to some kind of virtual object. Rather than learning a HDR environment map, we directly infer the relit virtual object itself. On the one hand, the per-vertex lighting model from 4, overall illumination(OI),are utilized, representing the overall effect of all incident lights at the particular 3D point. On the other hand, planar regions are quite common in both indoor and outdoor scenes. They offer important geometric and photometric cues in tasks such as scene reconstruction , navigation , and scene understanding 0. Taking advantage of the easy-to-obtain OI from the planes in the scene, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) to transfer the deep feature. We use common objects first such as planes and some kind of virtual object to train an autoencoder network to learn deep features from OI. Then we guide the GAN to transfer OI between different objects with the photo-consistency constraint. Finally, relighting objects are generated from the predicted OI. The main contributions of the proposed method are as follows: Rather than recovering the complicated HDR environment map from a single RGB image, we propose a novel framework that directly infers the rendered virtual object by transferring the illumination features of planar surfaces in real scenes. Our method is robust to handle both indoor and outdoor scenes with spatially-varying illumination, which is more versatile than previous approaches   [ref]13 [ref]17  [ref]28 8 only focusing on a particular case. Although the proposed GAN framework is trained with planar surfaces in this paper, it’s also feasible for other common geometries for illumination transfer.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: such requirements are usually not feasible for practical applications. Therefore, recent works try to infer the HDR environment maps from limited input information by learning.
