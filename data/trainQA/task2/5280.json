      "content": "Paper Title: KL Regularized Normalization Framework for Low Resource Tasks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDue to breakthroughs in optimization techniques, big datasets, and streamlined designs of deep neural architectures, deep learning (DL) has gained significant success in a variety of domains. Nevertheless, deep learning is renowned for requiring huge labelled datasets, which restricts the scalability of a deep model due to the expense of annotation. Early research in this subject utilised data augmentation and regularisation approaches to mitigate the overfitting issue caused by a lack of data, but only to a limited degree. With the coming of large pre-trained models in NLP such as Bert[ref]8, GPT, Wav2Vec[ref]3, Whisper[ref]39, etc, low resource tasks have become an active area of research and have lots of industry use-cases such as manufacturing, gaming, metaverse, etc. A lot of techniques such as fine tuning, linear probing , prompt tuning  have been explored to improve the performance of these model in low resource settings. No work has been done in the direction of normalization to make it work better for low resource tasks. The normalization method is one of the fundamental contributions to the deep learning community. It is a method of adaptive reparametrization, motivated by the difficulty of training very deep neural networks. Batch Normalization¬† is the first normalization technique proposed to prevent the training from getting stuck in the saturated regimes of non-linearities and improves the training speed. It gives regularization effects which leads to better generalization of deep neural networks. It promotes larger learning rate and reduces the photometric distortions as batch normalized networks train faster and observe each training example fewer times. Beyond Batch Normalization, several normalization techniques have been proposed which work better on various applications such as stylization¬†   , recurrent neural networks¬† , object detection¬† and faster convergence¬†, image to image translation¬†, neural acoustic modeling¬†6 and vision related applications¬†8 . Such techniques have gained success in all the fields of artificial intelligence such as NLP, vision, speech and others. In the traditional batch normalization operation, normalization is done by mean shifting of feature map along with making it the unit variance. To increase the expressivity of network , we use two learnable parameters namely scale Œ≥ùõæ\\gamma and bias Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta as shown in Equation (5). Assuming the input data is Gaussian, after passing through the batch normalization, it becomes the unit gaussian and to increase the representative power, we are adding the learnable parameters to shift its mean and increase it variance according to the deep learning tasks. Now if we expand the Equation (5) and combine the scale and shift with mean and variance, we will get the general equation of normalization(Equation (3)). Normalization makes the data well behaved by making it unit gaussian such that it helps in faster optimization, larger learning rate and implicit regularization. Equation (3) is the general formulation of normalization where the Œ±ùõº\\alpha and Œ∂ùúÅ\\zeta incorporates the mean and variance which results in the batch normalization as shown in equation (5). There are various ways to make the normalization framework well behaved and effective for deep learning training with different formulation of Œ±ùõº\\alpha and Œ∂ùúÅ\\zeta. We are looking into the normalization framework that works well in low resource setting as it has a lot of industry and research relevance. High resource supervised datasets are time and resource consuming and sometimes impossible to scale in industry set up. With the coming of large pre-trained models such as Bert, Wav2Vec, etc. it is possible to achieve good results in low resource setting. Current normalization approaches such as batch normalization, layer normalization have not been effective in low resource set up to make data well behaved, increasing the expressive power of the network and better generalization as shown in experimental section. No work has been done in making the data well behaved through normalization in low resource setting. In this regard, we propose KL-Norm KL Regularized normalization framework which imposes the prior on the normalization framework through the KL divergence loss to follow gaussian distribution. This has shown promising result in low resource tasks. KL Regularized normalization helps to improve accuracy as KL regularization based method acts as an ensemble of data. It helps in better training generalization as it reduces overfitting by adding a regularization loss function in the training schedule. It generalizes well on out of domain datasets as compared to other normalization techniques. It filters relevant features and removes the superficial features or biases present in the dataset or pre-trained model. An overview of the proposed normalization mechanism is shown in Figure 2. We specifically make the following contributions: We propose a novel KL Regularized normalization framework (KL-Norm) which incorporates rescaling parameter computation by considering regularization loss (Section ¬†3). KL-Norm demonstrates better expressiveness due to regularization loss and generalizes well by reducing over-fitting. It incorporates uncertainty which promotes better out of domain data generalization. Detailed experimental analysis demonstrates superior accuracy and performance of KL-Norm as compared to other normalization techniques, on low resource downstream NLP tasks including: sentiment classification, characterizing semantic relationships, semantic textual similarity, textual entailment and paraphrase detection as well as downstream speech task such as keyword detection and emotion classification.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: augmentation and regularisation approaches to mitigate the overfitting issue caused by a lack of data, but only to a limited degree.
