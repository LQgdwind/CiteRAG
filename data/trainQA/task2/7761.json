      "content": "Paper Title: QREChem: Quantum Resource Estimation Software for Chemistry Applications\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nT gates for various algorithms over many molecules at many basis set levels. See text for the definitions of the algorithms. Using QREChem, we obtained the total number of logical T gates necessary for various algorithms for each molecule at different basis set levels. The data for all molecules is shown in Figure¬†2.\n‚ÄúThis Work\" represents the QREChem estimate of number of Trotter gates, as described above. ‚ÄúSF\" uses OpenFermion‚Äôs resource estimation tools for the single factorization algorithm¬†[ref]37\nto estimate the number of Toffoli gates, which is then scaled by 4, as that is the number of T gates necessary for one Toffoli gate¬†[ref]37. ‚ÄúTF-Trot\" uses TFermion¬†[ref]8\nto estimate the number of T gates in the qDRIFT algorithm¬† and ‚ÄúTF-SF\" uses TFermion to estimate the single factorization algorithm. Most striking is the comparison between\nTFermion‚Äôs Trotter algorithm (‚ÄúTF-Trot\") and the one estimated in QREChem (‚ÄúThis Work\"). This is likely due to the fact the qDRIFT estimates use worst-case error bounds to calculate the total number\nof operations. In QREChem‚Äôs Trotter estimates, we instead use heuristic estimates, which result in orders of magnitude lower number of necessary Trotter steps\nand, thus, orders of magnitude lower resource estimates. Furthermore, QREChem uses explicit gate counting\nprovided by the Microsoft QDK, rather than the more pessimistic estimates used in the formula of TFermion. These more realistic estimates put Trotter close to the estimates\nof the more advanced single factorization algorithm\n(which requires additional ancilla qubits). We further compare the resource estimates of the number of logical T gates for various algorithms using FeMoco, which is the standard benchmark molecule for evaluation of quantum algorithms. We used the same Hamiltonian as in previous studies¬†[ref]1 and ¬† to obtain a precise comparison with other works. Table¬†1 shows the comparison of the number of T gates between QREChem‚Äôs Trotter estimation\n(‚ÄúThis Work\") and others from [ref]8 [ref]1 [ref]37. Ref.¬†[ref]1 provided the first theoretical estimates for FeMoco, which were approximately 1015superscript101510^{15} T gates. Again, we see that QREChem‚Äôs Trotter estimation lines up with the estimation from Ref.¬†[ref]1, which is reasonable, given that both works used similar heuristic estimates. The single factorization algorithm¬†[ref]37 performs the best out of those studied. All estimates presented in Figure¬†2 and Table¬†1are only for the number of logical T gates required, not including additional overheads from hardware or error correction.\nTo provide more realistic estimates, we estimated the surface code overhead for two benchmark systems: a\nsuperconducting qubit system and a trapped ion system. To parameterize the hardware, we use slight variations of\nparameters from recent demonstrations of error correction in each system¬† ,\nwhich are summarized in Table¬†2. The results are plotted in Figure¬†3 for our benchmark small molecules. The much lower error\nrates of the trapped ion system used (3e-5 vs 5e-4 for the superconducting qubit system) allow for smaller surface code distances, dùëëd, and, hence, smaller numbers of physical qubits. The total runtime is several orders of magnitude higher, due to the increased cycle time (70ms vs 1Œºùúá\\mus for the superconducting qubit system). This leads to several orders of magnitude increase in the total space-time (measured in qubit-seconds) of the algorithm. These results point to the need for fast cycle times to achieve reasonable runtimes for quantum chemistry algorithms on quantum computers. Tabulated data for both physical qubit count and total runtime can be found in the Supplementary Materials for both architectures. The data used in Figure¬†2 in collated in tabular form in the Supplementary Materials. Further tables, including our parameter settings, the number of rotation and CNOT\ngates and the number of physical qubits and runtime assuming a surface code error correction scheme on both superconducting qubit and trapped ion hardware can also be found in the Supplementary Materials as can details about the code and how to reproduce the results.
