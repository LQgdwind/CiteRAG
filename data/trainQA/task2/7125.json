      "content": "Paper Title: Mitigating Procrastination in Spatial Crowdsourcing Via Efficient Scheduling Algorithm\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConsider a logo designing task of a multinational company which can be distributed to a set of current employees of the company or to obtain the best design, the company may float the task worldwide. Anyone possessing the design capacity can contribute her design to that company no matter which corner of the world she belongs to. This situation for asking contribution from unbounded bulk people around the world is generally termed as crowdsourcing as the task has been outsourced from the crowd without categorisation . This concept has been utilized since 2006 and proliferated in various directions from disaster management  to atmospheric sciences , from agriculture to logistics , IoT to smart cities [ref]9 and there are many to name. Consider another scenario where an agency wants to measure the air moisture level in multiple agricultural areas in a city or in a district or so. In present time there are various sensory devices that can measure the moisture level. Also, with the increased usage of mobile devices (smartphones) 0, mobile users can easily read those sensory data using appropriate mobile application or through sensors in mobile phones 1. To perform this kind of task from multiple locations, the agency could distribute the task to the general crowd who have smartphones. The extension of crowdsourcing, specifically crowdsensing through mobile devices (collecting sensor data) for a particular location, is termed as mobile crowdsourcing 23. Mobile crowdsourcing (MCS) is emerging since 2009 with mobile applications like m-Clerke 4, a mobile (iPhone) application which utilizes sensors in iPhone to perform various crowdsourcing tasks, txteagle 5 through which agents (henceforth, task executers and task provider or requesters will also be termed as agents) can perform the task of translation, transcription and surveys. There are many other researches which has given MCS immense popularity and utmost importance 6. When MCS tasks are to be executed at different geographic areas with spatiotemporal constraint, it is termed spatial crowdsourcing (SC),\nwhich is the boiling research topic and also the subset of MCS 78901. Some of the most customary examples of SC application are food delivery service2, on-demand taxi3 and bike service 8. SC is also applied for collecting geospatial data 9, traffic information 4, pollution5, disaster 67, journalism8 and many more to name with requirement of spatial information. Though the demand and application of SC are increasing incrementally, some loopholes have been found, such as acquisition of inaccurate data, bounded capability of sensing devices, or untruthful data reporting from the worker end, etc., which has been notified and addressed in 9. At an abstract level in SC111applicable in crowdsourcing in general sense, we have task provider(s) and task executers where the task provider(s) disseminate the tasks to the task executers. Many researches related to SC have been carried out in the direction where the task provider is constrained by deadlines 071234[ref]95. Even if the deadlines are set, it may be a realistic situation that most of the agents submit the tasks at the penultimate day or at the last day of submission. This situation where the agents may delay their task submission is termed as procrastination 67890 in behavioural economics1278. In many applications, these late submissions of tasks may be problematic for task providers.\nIn the SC literature (also in crowdsourcing), how to prevent this procrastination within the deadline is not addressed. However, in a bipartite graph setting, one procrastination aware scheduling is proposed in 3. In 3, balanced job distribution in different slots (also termed as schedules) regarding procrastination perspective is not considered. In this paper, an algorithm named, Procrastination Preventive Scheduling of Jobs: A Balanced Perspective (PPSJBP) is proposed in SC scenario (also applicable in crowdsourcing), so that balancing of jobs in different schedules are maintained (The detailed objective of the paper is presented in\nSection 3.3). We have compared our scheme with 3 and have observed that in terms of balancing effect, our proposed algorithm outperforms 3. Also we have shown analytically that our proposed algorithm maintains the balanced distribution.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: .
