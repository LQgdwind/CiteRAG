      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Trustworthy and Aligned Machine Learning: A Data-centric Survey with Causality Perspectives\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn modern machine learning communities,\nrobustness is usually used to refer to the property\nthat a model can maintain its performances over perturbed test data\nwhen the perturbed data\nhas some ‚Äútolerable‚Äù shifts from the original data\nand the causal features remain intact during the perturbation. The study of machine learning robustness in this regard has a long history.\nDomain adaptation  ,\nas one of the pioneers,\nstudies the problem of how to maintain the model‚Äôs predictive performances\nwhen the test are from a domain that is similar but different from the domain used to train the models. The study of domain adaptation has inspired a long line of research\nin both theoretical perspectives    5 8 \nand empirical perspectives    .\nThe empirical evaluation is usually set upon a test scenario\nthat the model is trained with one dataset from one distribution\nand evaluated from another dataset from another distribution\nthat is considered similar but different to the training one.\nThis ‚Äúsimilar but different‚Äù property is usually defined by human factors\nduring the collection of the datasets used for domain adaptation study. For instance, under the setup of Example¬†1,\none domain adaptation study is to train\nthe image classification model on photos of sea turtles vs. tortoise,\nand then test the model on sketches of the depicted animals\nwithout background.\nA ideal model is expected to perform well on sketches of animals\neven if it was trained on photos because\nan ideal model is supposed to be able to capture the causal features of depicted animals from photos,\njust as how a human will recognize the images in either photos or sketches because a human understands the true differences between a dog and a cat.\nCovariate shift  is a formalization of this problem setup of domain adaptation. The theoretical discussion of domain adaptation\nhas been expanded over decades    5 8 ,\nprobably pioneered by  .\nRecent works such as   conceptually summarized the\nmain idea of the generalization error bounds into\ntwo components\n(an estimatable term regarding the divergence between the source and target distributions, and an non-estimable term about the nature of the problem). Thus,\nmost of the empirical methods devoted to this topic seeks to\nimprove the models‚Äô performances by introducing regularizations\nto force the learned representations to be invariant across training and testing distributions,\nwith the pioneering example of domain adversarial neural network (DANN) , which introduces\na ‚Äúdomain classifier‚Äù to differentiate two domains\nat the representation/embedding space,\nand then a representation that\noffers minimum information to\nthis\n‚Äúdomain classifier‚Äù\n(i.e. a representation invariant across domains)\nis considered good for\ndomain adaptation.\nInspired by the theoretical discussions above,\nmostly from  ,\ndomain adversarial neural network has popularized the following\nformulation of training a model from which the parameters œïitalic-œï\\phi are obtained from where (ùêô,‚àÖ)ùêô(\\mathbf{Z},\\emptyset) denotes the dataset from target distribution\nwith ùêôùêô\\mathbf{Z} denoting features and ‚àÖ\\emptyset denoting the unavailable labels,\nand dùëëd denotes ‚Äúdomain IDs‚Äù, an label-functioning variable that encodes\nthe information of whether xùë•x is from the source domain\nor target domain. In summary, we refer to the equation set of Equation¬†2 and Equation¬†3 as a DANN structure solution. This name is chosen following the fact that domain adversarial neural network (DANN)  is one of the most popular techniques using this set of equations. The community later proliferative\nprogressed along this line\nto introduce many methods for the invariance across\ndomains/distributions,\nwith extensions of the\nrepresentation-learning-model (i.e., encoder)\nto two copies ,\nextensions with additional alignment of\nactivation\ndistributions\nbetween source and target domains\n,\nextensions through additional domain-relevant\nbut task-irrelevant data ,\nand many others that target learning invariant\nrepresentations\nacross domains e.g.,   . Another branch of domain adaptation techniques aim to introduce the invariance\nacross training domain and test domain in a more explicit manner\nby directly augmenting the training data to match the marginal distributions\nof the test data.\nFor example,\na popular approach is\nto generate the data with source domain semantics (i.e., p‚Äã(Y|X)ùëùconditionalùëåùëãp(Y|X)) but target domain style (i.e., p‚Äã(X)ùëùùëãp(X)),\nwith a simple master equation where we use g‚Äã(h‚Äã(‚ãÖ;œï);œà)ùëî‚Ñé‚ãÖitalic-œïùúìg(h(\\cdot;\\phi);\\psi) to denote a data generation model, where h‚Äã(‚ãÖ;œï)‚Ñé‚ãÖitalic-œïh(\\cdot;\\phi) maps the raw sample into embedding space, and g‚Äã(‚ãÖ;œà)ùëî‚ãÖùúìg(\\cdot;\\psi) maps the embedding space back to the data space. A mainstream choice is to use GAN or its variants as g‚Äã(h‚Äã(‚ãÖ;œï);œà)ùëî‚Ñé‚ãÖitalic-œïùúìg(h(\\cdot;\\phi);\\psi) to generate the data to boost the performance for domain adaptation, such as    . While the above summarizes the main approaches in domain adaptation,\nit is worth mentioning that\nthere are also works arguing that\nEquation (2) will not solve a domain\nadaptation problem sufficiently,\nbut\nmost of these works assume the label shift setting such as  2,\nand thus they are not in the scope of our discussions. In addition to the relative fixed train-test distributions split scenario,\nthere are also works using intermediate\ndomains (distributions) to help the adaptation process,\nusually terms as\nmulti-step domain adaptation  \nor\ngradual domain adaptation   .\nFor a more dedicated summary and a general primer of domain adaptation, we refer readers to several focused literature reviews   . An often asked question regarding the study of domain adaptation\nis what if we do not know the distribution the model to be tested with\nduring training.\nIn reality, this concern seems legitimate since after we build a model,\nwe will expect it to perform consistently in future data distributions\nthat we are still unaware at this moment.\nThus, as an answer to this question, the community starts to work on\ndomain generalization ,\nfor which a model is trained on a collection of distributions of training data\nand then tested on new distributions unseen during training. Different from domain adaptation research,\nthe development of\ndomain generalization techniques in this deep learning era\nrarely build upon pioneering theoretical discussions.\nInstead,\nmost of the development efforts can extend upon the\nempirical efforts in the domain adaptation field\nto extend the ‚Äúinvariance between source vs. target distributions‚Äù technique\nto the more suitable ‚Äúinvariance among multiple training distributions‚Äù techniques.\nTherefore, a large trunk of empirical\nworks\nconverge again to the common theme of being invariant\nacross multiple distributions,\ndespite being creative and innovative as each individual publication,\nsuch as direct extension of DANN to multi-domain case \nand further extensions like conditioning on the label \nor through divergence terms  or others        , with a master equation where dùëëd stands for the domain ID that is part of the dataset by the definition of domain generalization. Due to the similarity between Equations¬†5 and¬†2, h‚Äã(‚ãÖ;œï)‚Ñé‚ãÖitalic-œïh(\\cdot;\\phi) can be estimated in the same way as in Equation¬†3. enforcing invariance with generated corresponding\nsamples in other domains 2    .\nAt a high level, the main idea is essentially data augmentation, with which almost the same as Equation¬†4, except for the definition of the marginal distribution one is interested in generating:\ndomain adaptation aims to generate data following the marginal distribution of the target domain data,\nwhile domain generalization aims to generate data following the marginal distributions of other training (source) domain data.\nAs some concrete examples for domain generalization, 2 perturbs data through the gradient with respective to the data\nto fool both the label and the domain classifiers (i.e., an adversarial attack process that we will discuss in the next part),\nand then use the generated data for training (i.e., an adversarial training process that we will discuss in the next part).\n introduced a bidirectional\nlearning idea that involves\nthe learning in both spatial domain and the frequency domain of an image,\nwith domain randomization on the frequency domain as an augmentation.\n builds multiple extensions upon  with different blocks for global domains and local sub-domains. learning the same classifier across all the\ndomains (e.g., invariant risk minimization)  ,\nalthough with some counterpoints on the effectiveness of this thread  . It is also worth mentioning\nanother thread of domain generalization works\nfollowing the assumption domain-specific features\ncan also help the empirical performances\nin domain generalization 5 7 ,\nalthough this thread is not in the scope of our discussion. In recent years,\nalthough it is fairly intuitive that using the extra domain\npartition information\nwill benefit empirical performances,\nthe community continues to seek to\nfree this last constraint of domain generalization\nto a more realistic scenario where the training datasets are not necessarily\npartitioned into multiple distributions/domains with clear boundaries\nduring training\n    .\nIt seems the community is using the terminology\nOut-of-domain Domain (OOD) Generalization\nto largely refer to Domain Generalization.\nFor more detailed discussions\nof topics in Domain Generalization\nand Out-of-domain Domain (OOD) Generalization,\nwe refer the readers to more dedicated surveys\n 8. Another thread of research that usually falls into the\nscope of machine learning robustness\nis motivated by the concept of spurious features ,\nconfounding factors ,\nor bias-in-data .\nOverall,\nin comparison to the topics discussed above,\nthis thread of works centers more explicitly around the story in Example¬†1\nabout the fact that the models might learn some undesired features (like backgrounds) other than\nthe ones that are semantically aligned with the human perception of the data. As there are multiple lines of works suggesting that\na fundamental challenge for the model to learn ‚Äúsemantic‚Äù (or causal) features instead\nof the spurious features lies in the construction of the dataset  [ref]547 ,\nor the existence of the confounding features (Example¬†1).\nTherefore,\nmost of these methods are designed following the same procedure:\nfirst identify the spurious features,\nand then analyze the statistical properties of the spurious features to\nbuild a reguarlization and/or a training process for the\nmodel to avoid learning these features. For example,  investigates the problem that\na vanilla computer vision model tends to learn the texture features from an image 2 0,\nand build a side model that focuses particularly on learning textures\nand force the main model to learn information invariant to this side model.\nFollowing the similar main structure, \nstudies the problem that sometimes model tend to learn a local patch of information, ignoring the idea from the whole images,\nand\nconstructs a side model\nthat particularly focuses on learning patches of images to help the learning of the main model.\nFurther,  introduces a more systematic view to counter the bias of data with concrete examples such as\nCNN with smaller receptive fields for texture bias.\nMore recently,\naiming to break the requirement of a prior model design,\nthere is a line of works investigating\nthe statistical properties of certain datasets, and conclude that, for these datasets,\nthe spurious features are usually the ones that are easier to learn.\nFollowing this observation,\n\nconsiders the features\nlearnt at an early stage of the training spurious,\nand  considers the features learnt by a shallow network spurious,\nthen they can take advantage of these properties to counter the main model‚Äôs learning of the spurious features. The above thread naturally converges to a master equation, with œïitalic-œï\\phi to be estimated with As one might notice, Equations¬†7 and¬†5 are exactly the same,\nhowever, the differences lie where Equation¬†8 is compared to Equation¬†3.\nThe main difference lies that,\nwhere 8 does not require explicit domain labels dùëëd,\nhowever, it usually requires dedicated chosen hypothesis space Œ¶Œ¶\\Phi such as\nthe models that only learn the texture of images etc. There is also some exceptions, for example,\n assumes prior knowledge of bias information is available in the form of labels, and then directly reuses the DANN structure from Equation¬†2 and¬†3. Another widely studied topic under the robustness category\nis adversarial robustness,\nwhich studies the model‚Äôs reaction to samples that are transformed under certain criteria.\nThe research field is popularized by the ‚Äúintriguing properties of neural networks‚Äù  \nthrough showcasing that we can generate samples that are\nperceptually indistinguishable to the original samples\nbut completely alter the models‚Äô decisions. The community names these samples adversarial samples,\nthe process of generating them attack,\nand correspondingly, the process of maintaining\nthe model‚Äôs prediction over these generated samples same as over the original ones defense.\nAlso, it is critical to note that there is usually a constraint\nregularizing the generation of adversarial sample\nin terms of the distance between the resultant adversarial sample\nand the original sample,\notherwise, the research will become meaningless\nif the adversarial sample can be arbitrarily different\nfrom the original sample.\nUsually, we denote such a constraint as\nd‚Äã(x‚Ä≤,x)‚â§œµùëësuperscriptùë•‚Ä≤ùë•italic-œµd(x^{\\prime},x)\\leq\\epsilon, where\nx‚Ä≤superscriptùë•‚Ä≤x^{\\prime} is the generated sample and\nd‚Äã(‚ãÖ,‚ãÖ)ùëë‚ãÖ‚ãÖd(\\cdot,\\cdot) is the distance metric of choice,\nwith the most popular choices usually being ‚Ñìpsubscript‚Ñìùëù\\ell_{p} norms. The discovery of the intriguing property of adversarial sample inspires long lines of studies\nto innovation along the attack methods 9     3               1        4    0\nas well as the defense methods     2       7     4 5   5    5        1    . While the community has progressed significantly along both the attack methods and the defense methods directions,\nthe research efforts recently seemingly converge to the most powerful attack methods and its associated defense methods:\nfor a while,\nPGD  is considered as the most powerful attack methods.\nIntuitively speaking, PGD can be considered as an opposite process\nof training a model with the gradient descent:\nwhen we train a model with the gradient descent,\nwe usually iteratively update the model parameters following the gradient to decrease the model‚Äôs loss over the fixed data,\nwhen we use PGD, we iteratively update the data following the gradient to increase the fixed model‚Äôs loss over the resultant data. With a most powerful attack method, the most powerful defense method is to simply train with the\nadversarial samples generated with the attack at each iteration along training ,\nwhich leads to the following equation As Equation¬†9 once again aligns well with the\none of the central themes above (e.g., Equation¬†6),\none might wonder that whether we can use the other major theme (e.g., Equations¬†2 and¬†5)\nto improve the method for adversarial robustness.\nIn fact, there are indeed some works using, again, the DANN structure\nto improve adversarial robustness by considering the setting\nas a domain adaptation problem  ,\nbut these methods do not seem to have shown its significance. Interestingly,\na more significant thread of methods have demonstrated its empirical strength is closely tied\nto the Equations¬†2 and¬†5 but in a much more simplified\nmanner because of the nature of adversarial examples.\nSince the generation of adversarial examples is essentially a data augmentation process,\nthus there is a natural one-to-one correspondence between the original sample xùë•x, and the augmented sample x‚Ä≤superscriptùë•‚Ä≤x^{\\prime}\nwe do not really need a discriminator (i.e., the h‚Äã(‚ãÖ;œï)‚Ñé‚ãÖitalic-œïh(\\cdot;\\phi)) to push for the invariance between the embeddings\nlearnt from these two samples,\nwe can simply regularize the distance between these two embeddings,\nas the following: where D‚Äã(‚ãÖ,‚ãÖ)ùê∑‚ãÖ‚ãÖD(\\cdot,\\cdot) stands for a distance metric of choice over the embeddings of samples fed into the model.\nEquation 10 corresponds to\nadversarial training  when Œª=0ùúÜ0\\lambda=0,\nTRADES loss 3 when D‚Äã(‚ãÖ,‚ãÖ)ùê∑‚ãÖ‚ãÖD(\\cdot,\\cdot) is KL divergence,\nand ALP loss  when D‚Äã(‚ãÖ,‚ãÖ)ùê∑‚ãÖ‚ãÖD(\\cdot,\\cdot) is squared ‚Ñì2subscript‚Ñì2\\ell_{2} norm.\nOther notable methods under this category are\nMART  and Consistency . In addition to the development of defense methods for the statistical perspectives,\nthe community has also been seeking to offer an intuitive understanding of the underlying causes\nof such ‚Äúintriguing properties‚Äù.\nOne answer is points to the nature of data\nby showing the\nthe existence of such features that are imperceptible to human\nbut also predictive  [ref]547.\nThe existence of such features have also been validated by multiple other works\nshowing that deep learning model has a tendency in learning the texture of images  2 [ref]547  0,\nnot necessarily in the context of adversarial robustness.\nThese evidence credits the challenges\nof adversarial robustness to the perspective of data. Further, it is worth mentioning that, despite the popularity gained through adversarial robustness in the deep learning community recently,\nthe statistical techniques of how to maintain a model‚Äôs prediction\ntoward certain distribution shifts\nequivalent to perturbing features within a ‚Ñìpsubscript‚Ñìùëù\\ell_{p} ball\nhas been studied over decades in the statistics community\nunder the name\nDistributional Robustness Optimization .\nSome of these studies in recent years interestingly connects\nthe regularization in loss terms 8 7\nto the adversarial robustness behaviors in ‚Ñìpsubscript‚Ñìùëù\\ell_{p} norms in linear models. There are many other related topics in adversarial robustness.\nFor example, targeted adversarial attack\nis an extension of adversarial attack, in the sense\nthat it does not only use the resultant image\nto deceive the model to predict into something,\nbut direct it to predict into a specific class .\nMany of the vanilla adversarial attack methods above can be extended to its targeted version, as surveyed by .\nAnother popular extension is to extend the adversarial training into embedding space  ,\nwhere the above adversarial training idea (e.g., Equation¬†9) is\nused, but, instead of at the raw data level, it is used\nat the embedding/representation level.\nIn other words,\ninstead of augmenting xùë•x into x‚Ä≤superscriptùë•‚Ä≤x^{\\prime},\nit augments fk‚Äã(x;Œ∏)subscriptùëìùëòùë•ùúÉf_{k}(x;\\theta) into its perturbed counterpart. While we have shown that the Equation¬†9 has the same format with one of the major threads of methods in OOD robustness (such as domain adaptation and domain generalization),\nit is worth mentioning that\nthe format of Equation¬†10 is also not unique.\nIt has been studied in the robustness literature\nin the name of consistency loss or alignment regularizations\n     1 0 5   These connections inspire us to think in a more high-level of what robustness means:\nrobustness refers to the study of whether the model can maintain its performance under the shifts when the stakeholders do not consider these shifts should lead to degradation of the model‚Äôs performance,\neither the shift is more salient such as from color image to sketch (thus OOD generalization) or more subtle such that the stakeholders cannot observe the shift (thus adversarial robustness).\n\nReference markers found: [547]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]547: are multiple lines of works suggesting that\na fundamental challenge for the model to learn ‚Äúsemantic‚Äù (or causal) features instead\nof the spurious features lies in the construction of the dataset  [ref]547 ,\nor the existence of the confounding features (Example¬†1).\nTherefore,\nmost of these methods are designed following the same procedure:\nfirst identify the spurious features,\nand then analyze\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
