      "content": "Paper Title: The Geometric Structure of Topic Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith our work, we contribute towards a rich interpretation of\ndocuments in the topic space. We compare our method to three commonly\nused explanation techniques for topic models. Such methods are usually\nbased on visualizations. We present how they can be used based on the\nwell understood SSH21 topic model from\nSchäfermeier et al.[ref]11. This topic model was computed on\nmachine learning research papers [ref]40 and has\ntwenty-two topics. The topic model itself is discussed in more detail\nin Section 5. The first visualization of SSH21, depicted in\nFigure 1, is a similarity heatmap. This plot displays\nin each cell the output of a similarity measure between two\ntopics. This similarity is computed using the term-topic relations\ndiscussed in Section 5.1. From this plot one\ncan infer the one-to-one topic relations between topics and\npotentially identify small clusters of topics. Yet, it is difficult\nto infer n-to-n topic relations. Moreover, this plot does not reveal\nthe reasons for similarities and dissimilarities of topics. Therefore,\nthis method eludes from explainability. We consider it as a necessity\nto give explanations of such (dis-) similarities in the language of the\nterms. Another commonly used visualization of topic models are embeddings\ninto the ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2} or (rarely) the ℝ3superscriptℝ3\\mathbb{R}^{3} vector\nspace, e.g., umap  or t-SNE . These\nvisualizations aim to reflect similarity through (local) proximity of\ntopics. In Figure 2 (left) we depict an embedding of\nthe SSH21 topic model (from Schäfermeier et\nal. ) computed with t-SNE. The\nresulting visualizations are considered good with respect to the\napplication domains . However, because of the\ndistortion of the original distances by non-linear mappings it is very\ndifficult to relate the distance within the t-SNE plot to meaningful\ndistances between topics. This makes it difficult to assess\ntopic-topic relations from the resulting diagrams. This problem is\namplified if clusters are computed based on the distorted\ndistances. For obvious reasons, approaches employing linear mappings\ninto ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2} do often fail to separate classes\n or lack performance .\nAlthough this approach to analyze topic models is more geometric in\nnature, it does not correctly reflect the incidences between topics\nand terms. The third visualization technique maps the topic representation of an\nentity in regards to temporal information. These entities can be\ncollections of papers representing authors or venues. Every cell in\nthis heatmap (cf. Figure 2, right) reflects the topic\nshare of an entity for a particular year. For example, in the depicted\npicture, we find that Wolfgang Nejdl’s research focus in 2017\nwas on Semantic Web. Moreover, such plots allow to identify\nchanges in topics over time. Although this visualization technique is\npromising for analyzing single entities, it lacks geometric depth. For\nexample, it is unclear if in 2004 all documents were about\nSemantic Web and Planning & Reasoning, or if these sets\nwere disjoint. A different view on this is the question, to what\nextent both topics are related. We deem an answer to this question a\nnecessity for a comprehensive topic analysis method. In the following, we introduce our novel method for analyzing and\nexplaining topic models based on an (order-)relational\napproach. Alongside a practical investigation, we revisit the just\ndiscussed techniques and compare them to our results.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: explanation techniques for topic models. Such methods are usually\nbased on visualizations. We present how they can be used based on the\nwell understood SSH21 topic model from\nSchäfermeier et al.[ref]11. This topic model was computed on\nmachine learning research papers [ref]40 and has\ntwenty-two topics. The topic model itself is discussed in more detail\nin Section 5. The first visualization\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
