      "content": "Paper Title: False Correlation Reduction for Offline Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOffline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn the optimal policy from a pre-collected dataset without interacting with the environment. Theoretically, experience replay allows for the direct application of off-policy RL algorithms to this setting, but they perform poorly in practice [ref]1 . Many research works attribute this problem to out-of-distribution (OOD) actions [ref]1  . Because the offline setting disallows learning by trial and error, an agent may ”exploit” OOD actions to attack the value estimator, resulting in a highly suboptimal learned policy. Although this provides an intuitive explanation, the relationship between OOD actions and the suboptimality of the learned policy is ambiguous and lacks a mathematical description. As opposed to this, false correlation is a rigorously defined concept by mathematically decomposing suboptimality. Due to the insufficient data coverage, a correlation exhibits between epistemic uncertainty and decision-making. As a result, the agent is biased towards suboptimal policies that look good only by chance. Such false correlations can be generated not only by OOD actions but also by insufficient coverage over the state space (or, equivalently, OOD states). Moreover, in-distribution samples have differences in uncertainty, and those with higher uncertainty may subtly raise suboptimality when the agent greedily pursues the maximum estimated value. According to recent theoretical studies, pessimism in the face of uncertainty can solve this problem [ref]5 . An example of false correlation is shown in Figure 1, where the estimated value function encourages the agent to pick a suboptimal action while the lower confidence bound (pessimism) recovers the optimal one. Unfortunately, this approach fails in practice [ref]1  due to the inability to obtain high-quality estimations of uncertainty. In this paper, we propose falSe COrrelation REduction (SCORE) for offline RL, a practically effective and theoretically provable algorithm. Specifically, SCORE introduces an annealing behavioral cloning regularizer on top of pessimism in the face of uncertainty. This regularizer drives the agent to concentrate on the dataset distribution during the initial stages of training, producing high-quality uncertainty estimates. In the later phases, SCORE gradually decays the regularization weight towards zero, avoiding the bias towards the behavioral policy.\nOn the theoretical side, we generalize the conclusion in [ref]5 to the context of infinite-horizon regularized MDP and incorporate the policy optimization process, showing SCORE converges to the optimal policy at a sublinear rate. Importantly, this result does not rely on strong assumptions regarding access to the exact value of OOD samples [ref]8 or sufficient coverage over the sample space  . Furthermore, SCORE eliminates the need to sample and calculate the target value of OOD data, which distinguishes it from the approach presented in [ref]8. Through extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark, we demonstrate that SCORE is not only theoretically sound but also obtains promising empirical results across various data settings. Furthermore, the simplicity of SCORE brings approximately a 3.1x speedup over the previous SoTA method.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: dataset without interacting with the environment.
