      "content": "Paper Title: Stochastic Multiple Target Sampling Gradient Descent\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSampling from an unnormalized target distribution that we know the\ndensity function up to a scaling factor is a pivotal problem with\nmany applications in probabilistic inference  1 .\nFor this purpose, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) has been widely\nused to draw approximate posterior samples, but unfortunately, is often time-consuming and has difficulty accessing the convergence .\nTargeting an efficient acceleration of MCMC, some stochastic variational particle-based\napproaches have been proposed, notably Stochastic Langevin Gradient\nDescent [ref]31 and Stein Variational Gradient\nDescent (SVGD) . Outstanding among them is SVGD,\nwith a solid theoretical guarantee of the convergence of the set of\nparticles to the target distribution by maintaining a flow of distributions. More specifically,\nSVGD starts from an arbitrary and easy-to-sample initial distribution\nand learns the subsequent distribution in the flow by push-forwarding the\ncurrent one using a function T​(x)=x+ϵ​ϕ​(x)𝑇𝑥𝑥italic-ϵitalic-ϕ𝑥T\\left(x\\right)=x+\\epsilon\\phi\\left(x\\right),\nwhere x∈ℝd𝑥superscriptℝ𝑑x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}, ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0 is the learning rate, and\nϕ∈ℋkditalic-ϕsuperscriptsubscriptℋ𝑘𝑑\\phi\\in\\mathcal{H}_{k}^{d} with ℋksubscriptℋ𝑘\\mathcal{H}_{k} to be the Reproducing\nKernel Hilbert Space corresponding to a kernel k𝑘k. It is\nwell-known that for the case of using Gaussian RBF kernel, by letting the kernel width approach +∞+\\infty,\nthe update formula of SVGD at each step asymptotically reduces to the typical gradient\ndescent (GD) , showing the connection between a probabilistic\nframework like SVGD and a single-objective optimization algorithm. In other\nwords, SVGD can be viewed as a probabilistic version of the GD for\nsingle-objective optimization. On the other side, multi-objective optimization (MOO)  aims to\noptimize a set of objective functions and manifests itself in many real-world applications\nproblems, such as\nin multi-task learning (MTL) 0 8,\nnatural language processing , and reinforcement learning 0 6 5. Leveraging the above insights, it is natural to ask: “Can we derive a probabilistic version of multi-objective optimization?”. By answering this question, we enable the application of the Bayesian inference framework to the tasks inherently fulfilled by the MOO framework. Contribution. In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer to that question. In particular, we go beyond the SVGD to propose\nStochastic Multiple Target Sampling Gradient Descent (MT-SGD), enabling us to sample\nfrom multiple target distributions. By considering the push-forward map T​(x)=x+ϵ​ϕ​(x)𝑇𝑥𝑥italic-ϵitalic-ϕ𝑥T\\left(x\\right)=x+\\epsilon\\phi\\left(x\\right)\nwith ϕ∈ℋkditalic-ϕsuperscriptsubscriptℋ𝑘𝑑\\phi\\in\\mathcal{H}_{k}^{d}, we can find a closed-form for the\noptimal push-forward map T∗superscript𝑇T^{*} pushing the current distribution\non the flow simultaneously closer to all target distributions. Similar to SVGD, in the case of using Gaussian RBF kernel, when the kernel width approaches +∞+\\infty, MT-SGD reduces\nexactly to the multiple-gradient descent algorithm (MGDA)  for multi-objective optimization\n(MOO). Our MT-SGD, therefore, can be considered as a probabilistic version of\nthe GD multi-objective optimization  as\nexpected. Additionally, in practice, we consider a flow of empirical distributions, in which, each distribution is presented as a set of particles. Our observations indicate that MT-SGD globally drives\nthe particles to close to all target distributions, leading them\nto diversify on the joint high-likelihood region for all distributions.\nIt is worth noting that, different from other multi-particle approaches 6 8 0\nleading the particles to diversify on a Pareto front, our MT-SGD orients\nthe particle to diversify on the so-called Pareto common (i.e., the joint high-likelihood\nregion for all distributions) (cf. Section 2.4\nfor more discussions). We argue and empirically demonstrate that this characteristic is essential for the Bayesian setting, whose main goal is to estimate the ensemble accuracy and the\nuncertainty calibration of a model. In summary, we make the following contributions in this work: Propose a principled framework that incorporates the power of Stein Variational Gradient Descent into multi-objective optimization. Concretely, our method is motivated by the theoretical analysis of SVGD, and we further derive the formulation that extends the original work and allows to sample from multiple unnormalize distributions. Demonstrate our algorithm is readily applicable in the context of multi-task learning. The benefits of MT-SGD are twofold: i) the trained network is optimal, which could not be improved in any task without diminishing another, and ii) there is no need for predefined preference vectors as in previous works 6 0, MT-SGD implicitly learns diverse models universally optimizing for all tasks. Conduct comprehensive experiments to verify the behaviors of MT-SGD and demonstrate the superiority of MT-SGD to the baselines in a Bayesian setting, with higher ensemble performances and significantly lower calibration errors. Related works. The work of  proposed a multi-gradient\ndescent algorithm for multi-objective optimization (MOO) which opens\nthe door for the applications of MOO in machine learning and deep\nlearning. Inspired by , MOO has been applied\nin multi-task learning (MTL) 0 8,\nfew-shot learning  , and knowledge distillation\n . Specifically, in an earlier attempt at solving MTL, 8\nviewed multi-task learning as a multi-objective optimization problem,\nwhere a task network consists of a shared feature extractor and a\ntask-specific predictor. In another study, 0 developed\na gradient-based multi-objective MTL algorithm to find a set of solutions\nthat satisfies the user preferences. Also follows the idea of learning neural networks conditioned on pre-defined preference\nvectors, 6\nproposed Pareto MTL, aiming to find a set of well-distributed Pareto solutions, which can represent different trade-offs among different tasks. Recently,\nthe work of 8 leveraged MOO with SVGD  and Langevin dynamics [ref]31 to diversify the solutions of MOO. In another line of work,  proposed a bi-level MOO that can be applied to few-shot learning. Furthermore, a somewhat different result was proposed,  applied MOO to enable the knowledge distillation from multiple teachers and find a better optimization direction in training the student network. Outline. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we first present our theoretical contribution by reviewing the formalism and providing the point of view adopted to generalize SVGD in the context of MOO. Then, Section 3 introduces an algorithm to showcase the application of our proposed method in the multi-task learning scenario. We report the results of extensive experimental studies performed\non various datasets that demonstrate the behaviors and efficiency of MT-SGD in Section 4. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 5.
