      "content": "Paper Title: Zero-Shot Temporal Action Detection via Vision-Language Prompting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVision-language models\nThere have been a series of works\non the interaction of computer vision and natural language\nprocessing fields, e.g., text-to-image retrieval , image\ncaption [ref]45, visual question answering , and so on. Among these works, vision language (ViL) pre-training has attracted growing attention during\nthe past few years [ref]19 3.\nAs a milestone, Radford et\nal.  devise a large-scale pretraining ViL model, named CLIP,\ntrained with a contrastive learning strategy on 400 million image-text pairs.\nIt shows impressive zero-shot transferable ability over 30 classification datasets.\nSince then, many follow-ups have been proposed, including improved\ntraining strategy (e.g., CoOp , CLIP-Adapter ,\nTip-adapter ).\nIn video\ndomains, similar idea has also been explored for transferable representation learning 4, text based action localization .\nCLIP has also been used very recently in action recognition (e.g., ActionCLIP ) and TAD .\nConceptually, all these methods use CLIP in a classification perspective.\nCommonly a two-stage pipeline is applied, where the first stage needs to crop the foreground followed by aligning the foreground using CLIP in the second stage.\nHowever, this strategy often suffers from the error propagation problem,\nthat is, the errors from first stage would flow into the second stage and potentially amplify.\nIn this work, we tackle this challenge by designing a one-stage ZS-TAD architecture featured with parallel classification and localization. Temporal action detection\nSubstantial progress has been made in TAD. Inspired by object detection in static images ,\nR-C3D  uses anchor boxes by following the design of proposal generation and classification.\nWith a similar model design, TURN  aggregates local features to represent snippet-level features for temporal boundary regression and classification. SSN  decomposes an action instance into three stages (starting, course, and ending)\nand employs structured temporal pyramid pooling\nto generate proposals.\nBSN 1 predicts the start, end and actionness at each temporal location and generates proposals with high start and end probabilities. The actionness was further improved in BMN 0 via\nadditionally generating a boundary-matching confidence map for improved proposal generation.\nGTAN 2\nimproves the proposal feature pooling procedure with a learnable Gaussian kernel for weighted averaging. G-TAD \nlearns semantic and temporal context via graph convolutional networks for more accurate proposal generation. BSN++  further extends BMN with a complementary boundary generator to capture rich context.\nCSA  enriches the proposal temporal context via attention transfer. Recently, VSGN  improves short-action localization using a cross-scale multi-level pyramidal architecture. Commonly, the existing TAD models mostly\nadopt a 2-stage sequential\nlocalization and classification architecture.\nThis would cause the localization error propagation problem\nparticularly in low-data setting such as ZS-TAD.\nOur STALE is designed to address this limitation by designing a single stage model, thereby removing\nthe dependence between localization and classification\nand cutting off the error propagation path.\n Zero-shot temporal action detection\nZero-shot learning (ZSL) is designed to recognize new classes that are not seen during training . The idea is to learn shared knowledge from prior information and then transfer that knowledge from seen classes\nto unseen classes  .\nVisual attributes (e.g., color, shape, and any properties) are the typical forms of prior information.\nFor example, Lampert et al.  prelearned the attribute classifiers independently to accomplish\nZSL on unseen classes, while Parikh et al.  learned relative attributes.\nDespite promising results on ZSL, attribute-based\nmethods have poor scalability because the attributes need to be manually defined.\nSemantic embeddings of seen and unseen\nconcepts, another type of prior information, can solve\nthis scalability problem . They are generally learned in an unsupervised manner such as Word2Vec  or\nGloVe .\nZhang et al.  firstly applied zero-shot learning on TAD using Word2Vec.\nVery recently, EffPrompt  used image-text pretraining from CLIP  for ZS-TAD.\nHowever, due to a two-stage design, this method also has the error propagation problem, in addition to its inability of learning the action localization module.\nWe address all these limitations by introducing a new one-stage ZS-TAD architecture.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: Vision-language models\nThere have been a series of works\non the interaction of computer vision and natural language\nprocessing fields, e.g., text-to-image retrieval , image\ncaption [ref]45, visual question answering , and so on.
