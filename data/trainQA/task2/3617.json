      "content": "Paper Title: On Practical Nearest Sub-Trajectory Queries under the Fréchet Distance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe present three different baseline algorithms (cf. Section 4) that return exact or approximate vertex-aligned sub-trajectory results, obtained by slight modifications of existing work to our problem setting.\nThese are\n(B1) adjusting the decision algorithm of Alt and Godau [ref]1,\n(B2) adapting the approximate Fréchet distance algorithm of Driemel et al. , and\n(B3) using the metric indexing technique from .\nThese baseline algorithms have fast query times for certain types of inputs and queries, however all have drawbacks, such as impractically large data structures and query search spaces, on realistic input (cf. Figure 1). We counter those drawbacks with a new data structure and sub-trajectory query algorithms (cf. Section 5) that are practically more efficient in searching the input space on real and synthetic data sets.\nThe method uses three techniques, with the third expanding on the first two and also offering the best experimental performance. Our first technique (cf. Section 5.1) is a novel greedy method, with backtracking, that searches the freespace diagram of P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q to solve the sub-trajectory Fréchet decision problem in 𝒪​(n+m)𝒪𝑛𝑚\\mathcal{O}(n+m) space and 𝒪​(n​m)𝒪𝑛𝑚\\mathcal{O}(nm) pointer machine operations in the worst case.\nThough improving on B1 query times, the technique alone does not scale substantially better for very large input trajectories. To enable metric pruning techniques on the sub-trajectories of P𝑃P, we introduce the Hierarchical Simplification Tree (HST) to quickly derive relevant sub-trajectory clusters in the query phase (cf. Section 5.2).\nThe HST stores simplifications of the input trajectory P𝑃P at various resolutions.\nIts space is 𝒪​(n)𝒪𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n) and construction time is 𝒪​(n​D)𝒪𝑛𝐷\\mathcal{O}(nD), where D≤min⁡{n,𝒪​(log⁡Δ​(P))}𝐷𝑛𝒪Δ𝑃D\\leq\\min\\left\\{n,\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\log\\Delta(P)\\right)\\right\\} and spread Δ​(P)Δ𝑃\\Delta(P) is the ratio between the largest and smallest Euclidean distance in the set of vertices from P𝑃P.\nThough HST sub-trajectory clusters lack the strong quality guarantees of B3, the construction time is four to five orders of magnitude faster in practice. Our second technique (cf. Section 5.3) performs 𝒪​(log⁡Δ​(P))𝒪Δ𝑃\\mathcal{O}(\\log\\Delta(P)) iterations of a breadth-first search that derives and prunes clusters of sub-trajectories from the HST using the triangle inequality.\nThough irrelevant clusters of sub-trajectories are pruned based on distance computations that only involve simplified sub-trajectories of P𝑃P, the technique alone improves only sporadically over B1 and B2. Our integrated, third technique combines both and additionally uses simplifications to accelerate the freespace technique and heuristics [ref]5  to accelerate the pruning technique (cf. Section 5.4). Experiments show that the method is suited to handle very large inputs on standard laptop hardware, has orders of magnitude faster construction times, and query times that improve on all baseline methods.\nThis includes B3, the recent practical\nmetric index method of  that is specifically designed for trajectory proximity searches, but results in a data structure of quadratic size in the sub-trajectory setting (cf. Section 6).\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: exact or approximate vertex-aligned sub-trajectory results, obtained by slight modifications of existing work to our problem setting.\nThese are\n(B1) adjusting the decision algorithm of Alt and Godau [ref]1,\n(B2) adapting the approximate Fréchet distance algorithm of Driemel et al. , and\n(B3) using the metric indexing technique from .\nThese baseline algorithms have fast query times for certain\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
