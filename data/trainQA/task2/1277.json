      "content": "Paper Title: Persistent Laplacians: properties, algorithms and implications\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe combinatorial graph Laplacian, as an operator on functions defined on the vertex set of a graph, is a fundamental object in the analysis of and optimization on graphs.\nIts spectral properties are widely used in graph optimization problems (e.g, spectral clustering    ) and in the efficient solution of systems of equations, cf.    . The graph Laplacian is also connected to network circuit theory via the notion of effective resistance    . There is also an algebraic topology view of the graph Laplacian which arises through considering boundary operators and specific inner products defined on simplicial (co)chain groups .\nThis permits extending the graph Laplacian to a more general operator, the q𝑞q-th combinatorial Laplacian ΔqKsuperscriptsubscriptΔ𝑞𝐾\\Delta_{q}^{K} on the q𝑞q-th (co)chain groups of a given simplicial complex K𝐾K (see e.g.,    5), so that the standard graph Laplacian simply corresponds to the 0-th case.\nThese ideas connect to the topology of the input simplicial complex via the so called combinatorial Hodge Theorem , which states that the nullity of the q𝑞q-th combinatorial Laplacian is equal to the rank of the q𝑞q-th cohomology group of K𝐾K with real coefficients, i.e. the q𝑞q-th Betti number of K𝐾K. See also 5  for thorough expositions. The combinatorial Laplacian (and variants) have received a great deal of attention in recent years; see e.g.  [ref]19 0 . For example, 9 aims to extend the related concept, effective resistance from network circuit theory, to this “high dimensional” situation, whereas 2 1 consider a spectral theory of cellular sheaves with applications to sparsification and synchronization problems. Adopting the algebraic topology view of the q𝑞q-th combinatorial Laplacian,  and  independently introduced the so-called q𝑞q-th persistent Laplacian ΔqK,LsuperscriptsubscriptΔ𝑞𝐾𝐿\\Delta_{q}^{K,L}, which is an extension of the combinatorial Laplacian mentioned above to a pair of simplicial complexes K↪L↪𝐾𝐿K\\hookrightarrow L connected by an inclusion.\nTo the best of our knowledge,  and  are the first works which establishes a link between persistent homology  , one of the most important developments in the field of applied and computational topology in the past two decades, with the Laplacian, a common and fundamental object with a vast literature, both in the theoretical and applied domains. See also   for other work in computational topology which leverages ideas connected to the (standard) combinatorial Laplacian. It is thus natural and also highly desirable to achieve better understanding, as well as algorithmic developments, for this persistent Laplacian, all of which will help broaden its potential applications. The present paper aims to close this gap. In this paper, we carry out a thorough study of the properties of and develop algorithms for the persistent Laplacian. Our work brings together ideas and methods from several communities, including spectral graph theory, circuit theory, topological treatments of high-dimensional combinatorial Laplacians, together with a persistent homology perspective (both at the theoretical and algorithmic levels). For instance, we relate the computation of persistent homology with notions from network theory such as the Kron reduction (and also Schur complements) which have novel algorithmic implications; see below. This is an overview of our results: In Section 2, we present several\nresults about the\nproperties of the q𝑞q-th persistent Laplacian ΔqK,LsuperscriptsubscriptΔ𝑞𝐾𝐿\\Delta_{q}^{K,L}, including Theorem 2.7, which establishes that the nullity of\nΔqK,LsuperscriptsubscriptΔ𝑞𝐾𝐿\\Delta_{q}^{K,L} equals the q𝑞q-th persistent Betti number from K𝐾K to L𝐿L: a result analogous to the one that holds in the non-persistent case. In Section 3, we give a first algorithm (Algorithm 1) to compute a matrix representation\nof ΔqK,LsuperscriptsubscriptΔ𝑞𝐾𝐿\\Delta_{q}^{K,L}, which relies on matrix reduction ideas which are standard when computing persistent homology. In Section 4, we establish our main observation Theorem 4.6, a relationship between the persistent Laplacian and the concept of Schur complement of a matrix. This observation has several immediate and important implications: We establish a second, very simple algorithm (Algorithm 2) which computes the matrix representation of the persistent Laplacian ΔqK,LsuperscriptsubscriptΔ𝑞𝐾𝐿\\Delta_{q}^{K,L} (for any q𝑞q) efficiently, purely based on a linear algebraic formulation (Theorem 4.6). This observation leads to a new algorithm to compute the q𝑞q-th persistent Betti number for a pair of spaces in a fundamentally different manner from extant algorithms in the computational topology literature. This new algorithm is, under mild conditions (e.g. as those commonly satisfied by Vietoris-Rips complexes) significantly more efficient than existing algorithms. We believe that this new algorithm for computing persistent Betti numbers is of independent interest. In the graph case (i.e. when K𝐾K and L𝐿L are graphs and q=0𝑞0q=0), this provides a direct connection with notions from network circuit theory such as the Kron reduction , a connection which reveals that the matrix representation of the persistent Laplacian permits recovering the effective resistance of pairs of vertices in K𝐾K w.r.t the larger graph L𝐿L (cf. Proposition 4.9 and Theorem 4.10). The connection with network circuit theory leads to our definition of a “persistent” Cheeger constant as well as to a novel persistent Cheeger-like inequality for a pair of graphs K↪L↪𝐾𝐿K\\hookrightarrow L (cf. Section 4.4). Finally, in Section 5, we consider q𝑞q-th persistent Laplacians for filtrations of simplicial complexes (connected by inclusion morphisms).\nWe first describe an efficient algorithm to iteratively compute the persistent Laplacian for all all pairs of complexes in a filtration. We then discuss certain spectral stability results for the persistent Laplacian for filtrations of simplicial complexes. Some technical details are relegated to the appendix.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: coefficients, i.e. the q𝑞q-th Betti number of K𝐾K.
