      "content": "Paper Title: Differentiable NAS Framework and Application to Ads CTR Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, deep learning based approaches have become the de-facto standard methods in a number of fields, such as computer vision (CV) [ref]13, automated speech recognition (ASR) , and natural language processing (NLP) . Building state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) often involves a significant experimentation process to find the best DNN architecture suited to a task, considering the varying accuracy requirements as well as inference time constraints involved. This has motivated the development of neural architecture search (NAS) techniques, which aim to automate the process of finding the optimal DNN architecture for a given task. NAS has been successfully applied to many DNN application areas, including CV   and NLP . NAS techniques work by searching for the best architecture in a large search space. This is typically judged by comparing their search efficiency to other NAS methods and to random search [ref]24. A common metric used to measure this efficiency is “GPU-hours” of search time, which allows us to compare the machine times used by NAS algorithms to arrive at their results.111Note that this is distinct from the time to potentially train the NAS-determined architecture if the NAS algorithm does not train its candidate architectures during the search process itself. Many NAS approaches are based on reinforcement learning (RL)  [ref]14. They operate in an iterative fashion where an architecture is sampled, evaluated and the learning is fed back into the sampling process. However, RL-based approaches have a higher search cost, as measured by GPU-hours, than gradient-based NAS approaches which aim to perform the NAS process through the gradient-descent optimization of some parameterized computational graph. For example, [ref]24, a gradient-based approach, showed at least 400×400\\times speedup over an RL-based approach [ref]14 when optimizing architectures to run image classification on mobile devices. We apply the DNAS framework designed in this work to the problem of ads click-through rate (CTR) prediction. CTR prediction is the task of estimating the probability that a given user will click on a given ad at a given time. We can then predict estimated CTRs over a subset of our ad inventory and show the ad which maximizes the predicted CTR (a more complex ranking function can also be used ). Section VI-A defines the task of CTR prediction formally. Ads CTR prediction, and CTR prediction for arbitrary content more generally, is one of the backbone technologies for the large-scale Internet services, allowing for personalized user experiences. Given that the accuracy of CTR prediction is critical to the revenue of companies offering such services (e.g. a given percentage increase in the AUC of CTR prediction will result in 5x that percentage increase in CTR ), there has justifiably been a large investment in both people and machines to improve the models which predict CTR . At the same time, the large scale of these services, which reach billions of globally distributed users, means that the inference latency and efficiency of CTR prediction models is a non-trivial consideration. Hard SLAs 0 also mean that the problem naturally becomes one of finding the architecture which maximizes accuracy subject to some latency constraint. A scalable NAS framework would improve the development velocity of of ranking engineers. All of this motivates the application of DNAS to the problem. CTR prediction systems have, in the last decade, evolved from systems based on collaborative filtering or large-scale logistic regression  to models incorporating techniques from DNNs such as neural-collaborative filtering (NCF) 1, and more recently heavily deep-learning based models. These include the Deep & Cross Network , Deep Interest Evolution Network (DIEN) , Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM) , Time-Based Sequence Model (TBSM) , and many others. Most of these systems share a few components, including their input feature types and some common layers, which we outline in more detail in sections II-A and VI-B. The contributions of this work are as follows. The rest of the paper follows this general structure, with the exception of related work (section II) and the conclusion (section X). Novel DLRM CTR prediction search spaces to apply DNAS to CTR prediction. The problem statement and search spaces for our application of DNAS to CTR prediction is contained in section VI. Experimental results on a CTR prediction dataset demonstrating the efficacy of our approach. These results are presented in section VII. Our best result for embedding cardinality search compresses the total size of embedding tables 15.14×\\times with a relative 0.0012 increase in loss, demonstrating the promise of our approach (see sections VI-C3 and VIII-C). Our approach discovered recommendation models that beat the state-of-the-art in terms of logloss with significantly fewer parameters (0.4442 vs. 0.447 of ; see VIII-D). Moreover, our approach discovered this model using 52×\\times less computational effort (see section VIII-D). An efficient and extensible DNAS framework, implemented and open-sourced in PyTorch. We implement the DNAS algorithm as it is described in section III and  [ref]24 and in such a way that arbitrary supernets for arbitrary application areas can be used. The framework is described in detail in section IV, and section V is dedicated to helping others extend the framework to their application areas.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: In recent years, deep learning based approaches have become the de-facto standard methods in a number of fields, such as computer vision (CV) [ref]13, automated speech recognition (ASR) , and natural language processing (NLP) .
