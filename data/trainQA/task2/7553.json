In real-world scenarios, the collected data exhibits a long-tail distribution, wherein a small fraction of classes possess a substantial number of samples and the remaining classes are associated with only a few samples¬†.\nTo address long-tailed class imbalance and the failure of the vanilla empirical risk minimization methods, massive studies have been conducted recently. (i) Re-sampling aims to balance the training samples of different class¬†   [ref]29 by over-sampling the data from the tail class and under-sampling the data from the head class. (ii) Cost-sensitive learning adjusts loss values for different classes to make a balance, such as focal loss ¬†, class-balanced loss (CB) ¬†[ref]9, balanced softmax loss (BS) ¬†[ref]29, LADE¬† and\nLDAM ¬†. (iii) Representation Learning focuses on improving the feature extractors, consisting some paradigms, i.e., metric learning¬† 3, prototype learning¬† 9, and transfer learning¬†6 . (iv) Classifier Design\n replaces the linear classifier\nwith well-designed classifiers, such as scale-invariant cosine classifier¬† and œÑùúè\\tau-normalized classifier¬†.\n(v) Decoupled Training decouples the learning into representation learning and classifier retraining, rather than training them jointly.\n(vi) Other methods use data augmentation¬†1 6   , self-supervised learning¬† , multi-expert ensemble   4 and so on¬†. These models require more data or computation resources and are inclined to achieve high accuracy. In the paper, we report them as the upper bound baseline. Decoupled Training. The Decoupled Training scheme  [ref]9 2 [ref]29 6 in LTR separates the joint learning process into feature learning and classifier learning stages.\nDecoupling  is the pioneering work to experimentally evaluate different sampling strategies in the first stage and classifier design (e.g. cRT and œÑùúè\\tau-norm) in the second stage. KCL¬†7 empirically finds a balanced\nfeature space important for LTR. MiSLAS¬†6 empirically observes data mixup benefit feature extractor in the first stage but will do harm to classifier performance in the second stage. DisAlign ¬†2 develops the distribution alignment strategy with a generalized re-weight method.\n(LTWB)¬† emphasizes parameter regularization in both feature learning and classifier finetuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: imbalance and the failure of the vanilla empirical risk minimization methods, massive studies have been conducted recently.
