      "content": "Paper Title: Enhancing SMT-based Weighted Model Integration by Structure Awareness\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraditionally, inference algorithms in hybrid graphical models either\ndisallowed complex algebraic and logical\nconstraints¬†  ,\nor solved the problem\napproximately¬† .\nThe use of piecewise polynomial densities when dealing with algebraic\nconstraints was pioneered by Sanner and Abbasnejad .\nThe algorithm, called Symbolic Variable Elimination (SVE), first\nused a compact representation called eXtended Algebraic Decision Diagrams (XADD)¬† in probabilistic inference tasks. As\ndescribed in detail in¬†¬ß4, these representations\nlie at the core of modern compilation-based WMI techniques.\nIn broad terms, knowledge compilation refers to a\nfamily of approaches that seek to convert problem instances in a\ntarget representation that, thanks to certain structural properties,\nguarantees efficient solving of a specific task.\nAn offline, expensive compilation phase searches in the space of target\nrepresentations for the most compact encoding of a problem instance.\nThen, the compiled representation of the problem instance can be\nqueried efficiently with respect to its size, typically amortizing\nthe computational cost of the compilation over multiple queries.\nThis approach is quite popular in WMC, where propositional logic\nformulas are compiled in deterministic, decomposable normal\nnegation form (d-DNNF) circuits. Thanks to these properties, WMC\ntasks can be computed in linear time in the size of the d-DNNF.\nSince the problem structure has to be explicitly encoded in a target\nrepresentation, KC techniques fail by running out of memory on\ninstances where this compact representation does not exist. Probabilistic inference modulo\ntheories¬† used representations\nsimilar to XADDs together with a modified DPLL procedure. The\nresulting algorithm, called PRAiSE, showed superior performance with\nrespect to both SVE and the original WMI¬† solver,\nwhich didn‚Äôt exploit any SMT enumeration technique. Follow-up works on\nSMT-based WMI capitalized on the advanced features of SMT solvers,\nobtaining state-of-the-art results in many\nbenchmarks¬† . The substantial efficiency gains obtained by caching partial results\nin WMC¬†  motivated their\napplications in the hybrid case. When the dependencies induced by the\nalgebraic constraints are limited, similar ideas can be applied to\nWMI¬†.\nAlternatively to SMT- or compilation-based approaches, WMI can be\nreduced to Belief Propagation when the algebraic dependencies involve\nat most two variables. Then, an efficient message passing algorithm on\nan acyclic pairwise factor graph can solve the problem\nexactly¬†. This idea was later extended for\napproximating problems with circular dependencies¬†.\nIn contrast with the work above, this paper focuses on the general WMI\nproblem, where the above assumptions cannot be leveraged. Approximate WMI algorithms exploit both SMT-based¬†\nand knowledge compilation-based¬† approaches. While generally\napplicable, the latter does not provide any guarantee on the\napproximation error. The former provides practical statistical\nguarantees in limited scenarios when constraints are expressed in\nconjunctive form. Instead, if the constraints can be expressed in\ndisjunctive form, WMI admits a fully polynomial randomized\napproximation scheme (FPRAS) under mild\nassumptions¬†. The quantitative evaluation of programs by counting SMT solutions (see\ne.g.¬†[ref]39 ) is\nequivalent to the notion of unweighted model integration.\nThis approach was later extended to fairness verification of decision\nprocedures based on small ML models.\nThis approach, dubbed FairSquare¬†[ref]41,\nencodes the verification problem in SMT(‚Ñí‚Äã‚Ñõ‚Äãùíú‚Ñí‚Ñõùíú\\mathcal{LRA}{}) and reduces\nprobabilistic inference to axis-aligned volume computations.\nFairSquare ultimately addresses a decision problem, answering whether\nthe fairness measure is above a user-defined threshold or not. This is\nachieved by iteratively computing tighter lower and upper bounds using\nincreasingly accurate approximations of the measure until convergence.\nMoreover, the distribution considered in FairSquare are probabilistic\nprograms where random variables have univariate Gaussian or piecewise\nconstant distributions. The notion of weight function considered in\nthis work is more general, including multivariate piecewise\npolynomials of arbitrary degree and Gaussians.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: in\ndisjunctive form, WMI admits a fully polynomial randomized\napproximation scheme (FPRAS) under mild\nassumptions¬†.
