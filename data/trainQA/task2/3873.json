      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Combinatorial Optimization: a New Player in the Field\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInstances. As depicted in Section III, we distinguish two main strategies for obtaining the instances needed to train the models: instance generators and benchmarks. In the case of the LOP, the most evident way of creating a generator is to randomly sample each element of the matrix BùêµB from a uniform distribution between (0,1)01(0,1). Regarding benchmarks, the LOLIB [ref]43 is the most commonly used LOP library, which is composed of real world instances (IO, SGB and XLOLIB) and randomly generated instances which try to mimic real world data (RandB, MB, RandA1 and RandA2). Both strategies will be adopted for the experiments. Algorithms. Among the set of conventional algorithms to solve the LOP, we will distinguish 3 groups: exact methods, constructive heuristics and metaheuristics. In each one of the groups we selected the algorithms that compose the state-of-the-art, and the stopping criteria for each algorithm will be set in a fair way so that the real performance of each algorithm can be exploited. Among the constructive heuristics, the algorithm by Becker  is the best performing one, and as a deterministic constructive algorithm, it will be run until a solution is given. Considering exact methods, SCIP is one of the fastest non-commercial exact solvers, it will be run until the optimal solution is found with a maximum time of 12h per instance. The implementation of the constructive heuristic and exact solver has been made following the respective handbooks. Also, we consider two of the state-of-the-art metaheuristics: A Memetic Algorithm (MA) ; and a Variable Neighborhood Search (CD-RVNS) [ref]16, which are publicly available333Codes available at https://github.com/sgpceurj/Precedences_LOP and https://github.com/carlossegurag/LOP_MA-EDM. CD-RVNS will be stopped once 1000‚Äãn21000superscriptùëõ21000n^{2} objective function evaluations are computed, where nùëõn is the instance size, while MA will be given the same time budget as CD-RVNS. This will be enough to let the metaheuristic converge as seen in [ref]16 . Finally, as for NCO methods, we will include the model described in Section V (named as GNN) and an active search procedure (GNN-AS), which consist of performing extra training steps using the evaluation set (instances to be solved). Hardware. Models are trained in four Nvidia RTX 2070 GPUs, with a cumulative memory of 32GB. The NCO algorithm is implemented in Python 3.8, while the conventional algorithms are written in C++. Experiments that do not need a GPU are run on a cluster of 55 nodes, each one equipped with two Intel Xeon X5650 CPUs and 64GB of memory. Training. We train four different GNN models using instances of sizes n=20,30,40ùëõ203040n=20,30,40 and 505050. Each model is trained for 200 epochs with 100 batches per epoch and a batch-size of 128, 128, 64 and 32 instances respectively. The batch size of larger models needs to be reduced so that the GPU memory is not overloaded. For the AS procedure, the model parameters are trained for 200 additional epochs.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: case of the LOP, the most evident way of creating a generator is to randomly sample each element of the matrix BùêµB from a uniform distribution between (0,1)01(0,1).
