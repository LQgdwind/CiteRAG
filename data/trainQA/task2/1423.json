      "content": "Paper Title: Energy-constrained Self-training for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) with deep networks [ref]20 [ref]21    targets to learn domain invariant embeddings by minimizing the cross-domain difference of feature distributions with certain criteria  . Examples of these methods include maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), deep Correlation Alignment (CORAL), sliced Wasserstein discrepancy, adversarial learning at input-level, feature level, output space level, etc  . Despite the underlying difference, there exists an interesting connection between some of these methods with conditional forms111E.g., class-wise adversarial learning, or discriminators taking network predictions as input. and Self-training as they can be broadly considered as EM algorithms, and such conditional formulation has been widely proved to benefit the adaptation. Self-training was initially investigated in semi-supervised learning . A subtle difference between self-training with fixed feature input and deep self-training is that the latter involves the learning of deep embedding which renders greater flexibility towards domain alignment than classifier-level adaptation only. Recently, there have been multiple deep self-training/pseudo-label based methods that are proposed for UDA   . Considering the noisy pseudo-label, our previous work  proposes to construct a more conservative pseudo-label that smoothing the one-hot distribution or regularize it with the entropy. The solution proposes in this paper is orthogonal with , which resorts to the additional supervision signal of EBM that independent of pseudo-label. Compared with the manually defined label smoothing in , the energy-constraint can adaptively regularize the training w.r.t. the input and the present network parameters. We note that our EBM regularization can be simply added on state-of-the-art self-training methods following a plug-and-play fashion. Energy-Based Models (EBMs) capture dependencies between variables by associating a scalar energy to each configuration of the variables . Recently,  [ref]15 approximated the expectation of the log-likelihood for a single example ùê±ùê±\\mathbf{x} with respect to network parameter using a sampler based on Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) . Targeting on the combination of classifier and EBMs,   reinterpret the logits to define a class-conditional EBM p‚Äã(ùê±|ùê≤)ùëùconditionalùê±ùê≤p(\\mathbf{x}|\\mathbf{y}), which require additional parameters to be learned to derive a classifier and an unconditional model.  is similar as well but is trained using a GAN-like generator and is applied to different applications. Based on , [ref]15 scales the training of EBMs to high-dimensional data with Contrastive Divergence and SGLD. Here, we regard EBMs as the pseudo label-irrelevant optimization constrains and explore its potentials on domain adaptation, especially UDA. This helps realize the potential of energy-based models on downstream supervised discriminative problems. Moreover, the thorough convergence analysis and theoretically connection with CEM are investigated.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) with deep networks [ref]20 [ref]21    targets to learn domain invariant embeddings by minimizing the cross-domain difference of feature distributions with certain criteria  .
