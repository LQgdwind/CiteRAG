      "content": "Paper Title: Feature Map Testing for Deep Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe adopt four widely used image classification benchmark datasets for the evaluation (i.e., MNIST , Fashion MNIST , SVHN , and CIFAR10 ), which are most commonly used datasets in deep learning testing   [ref]25       [ref]13  . Table I presents the detail of the datasets and models. The MNIST  dataset is a large collection of handwritten digits. It contains a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. The CIFAR-10  dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images in CIFAR-10. Fashion  is a dataset of Zalando’s article images—consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image associated with a label from 10 classes. SVHN  is a real-world image dataset that can be seen as similar in flavor to MNIST (e.g., the images are of small cropped digits). SVHN is obtained from existing house numbers in Google Street View images. The models we evaluated include LeNet , VGG , and ResNet , which are also commonly used in deep learning testing tasks    [ref]25       [ref]13  . We follow the prior data simulation    to generate realistic test cases. Specifically, we use seven well-used benign mutations (i.e., shift, rotation, scale, shear, contrast, brightness, and blur) to generate the test case with its original label. The configurable parameters of the mutation are shown in Tab. IV. We do not choose adversarial attack (e.g., FGSM, PGD, and BIM) to generate test cases because these data can not represent data collected from the real-world scenario and may lead to unreliable conclusions .\nDuring the test case generation, for each test data in the dataset, we randomly select one benign data augmentation from our seven augmentations to mutate a test case with its original label. When the original test size is 10,000, we will generate the same size of test cases. A branch of existing works [ref]13 [ref]25   0  have been proposed for generating fuzzing cases. To show the effectiveness of DeepFeature, we select the state-of-the-art neuron coverage-guided fuzzing method (i.e., ADAPT [ref]13) and DeepMutation++  as our baseline. Compared with other existing works, ADAPT integrates with 29 neuron characteristics (e.g., NAC), while others only have one to four different characteristics, which are even contained in ADAPT. The DeepMutation++ is also intergrate multiple coverage guided fuzzing metrics, e..g., Neuron-Level (NAC), and layer-level (e.g., TKNC). We believe evaluate DeepFeature’s fuzzing module with ADAPT and DeepMutation++ can sohws DeepFeature’s effectiveness.\nWe also notice that DeepHyperion 1 generates test cases from the feature map level, so we chose it as one of our baseline. Multiple test case selections have been proposed by recent works (e.g., NC-guided     2, Priority [ref]25 3, Active learning guided  4, robust-guided  5 6, SA-guided ).\nHowever, robust-guided selection  5 6 focus on model robustness, as mentioned by Zhang et al. 7, there is a trade-off between the accuracy and robustness, which means using these (e.g., RobOT , and PACE 6) strategies to increase model robustness, the accuracy will decrease. So we will not choose these strategies as our baselines. To show the effectiveness of DeepFeature, we use the most famous metric (i.e., NAC) and its fine-grained version (i.e., KMNC) proposed by DeepGauge . To evaluate DeepFeature with SOTA coverage metrics, we take NPC 2 as our baseline. Compared with DC/MC, it can evaluate the DNN decision logic flows for each connected layer directly, which can reduce the overhead of DC/MC. Since DeepFeature’s test case selection is a prioritization technique (i.e., priority the test cases with certain rules and return cases with larger priority), we take DeepGini, the SOTA open-sourced prioritization technique as our baseline. Compared with PRIMA 3, it only need 1/10011001/100 times to select test cases. To compare DeepFeature with SA metrics, we use DSA, which is proposed by Kim et al. , to evaluate DeepFeature’s effectiveness. Then to evaluate DeepFeature’s effectiveness with the current SOTA active learning guided selection strategies, we use ATS  as our baseline. Finally, we also use Random Selection (RS) as a natural baseline, which can help us evaluate whether a selection method is effective.\nThe configurable parameters of the selection strategies are shown in Tab. V.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: four widely used image classification benchmark datasets for the evaluation (i.e., MNIST , Fashion MNIST , SVHN , and CIFAR10 ), which are most commonly used datasets in deep learning testing   [ref]25       [ref]13  .
