      "content": "Paper Title: Automatic Microprocessor Performance Bug Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVerification and validation are typically the largest component of the\ndesign effort of a new processor. The effort can be broadly divided\ninto two distinct disciplines, namely, functional and performance\nverification. The former is concerned with design correctness and has\nrightfully received significant attention in the literature. Even\nthough challenging, it benefits from the availability of known correct\noutput to compare against. Alternately, performance verification,\nwhich is typically concerned with generation-over-generation workload\nperformance improvement, suffers from the lack of a known correct\noutput to check against. Given the complexity of computer systems, it\nis often extremely difficult to accurately predict the expected\nperformance of a given design on a given workload. Performance bugs,\nnevertheless, are a critical concern as the cadence of process\ntechnology scaling slows, as they rob processor designs of the primary\nperformance and efficiency gains to be had through improved\nmicroarchitecture. Further, while simulation studies may provide an approximation of how\nlong a given application might run on a real system, prior work\nhas shown that these performance estimates will typically vary\ngreatly from real system\nperformance   . Thus,\nthe process to detect performance bugs, in practice, is via tedious and\ncomplex manual analysis, often taking large periods of time to\nisolate and eliminate a single bug. For example, consider the case\nof the Xeon Platinum 8160 processor snoop filter eviction\nbug . Here the performance regression was\n>10%absentpercent10>10\\% on several benchmarks. The bug took several months of\ndebugging effort before being fully characterized. In a competitive\nenvironment where time to market and performance are essential,\nthere is a critical need for new, more automated mechanisms for\nperformance debugging. To date, little prior research in performance debugging exists,\ndespite its importance and difficulty. The few existing\nworks [ref]9   take\nan approach of manually constructing a reference model for\ncomparison. However, as described by Ho et\nal. , the same bug can be repeated in the model\nand thus cannot be detected. Moreover, building an effective model\nis very time consuming and labor intensive.  Thus, as a first\nstep we focus on automating bug detection. We note that, simply\ndetecting a bug in the pre-silicon phase or early in the post-silicon phase\nis highly valuable to shorten the validation process or to avoid costly steppings.\nFurther, bug detection is a challenge by itself. Performance bugs, while potentially significant versus a bug-free\nversion of the given microarchitecture, may be less than the\ndifference between microarchitectures. Consider the data shown in\nFigure 1. The figure shows the performance of\nseveral SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks  on gem5 ,\nconfigured to emulate two recent Intel microarchitectures: Ivybridge\n(3rd gen Intel “Core” 3) and Skylake (6th\ngen ), using the methodology discussed in\nSections III and IV.\nThe figure shows that the baseline, bug-free Skylake microarchitecture\nprovides nearly 1.7X the performance of the older Ivybridge, as\nexpected given the greater core execution resources provided.\n In addition to a bug-free case, we collected performance data for two\narbitrarily selected bug-cases for Skylake. Bug 1 is an\ninstruction scheduling bug wherein xor instructions are the\nonly instructions selected to be issued when they are the oldest\ninstruction in the instruction queue.\nAs the figure shows, the\noverall impact of this bug is very low (<1%absentpercent1<1\\% in average\nacross the given workloads). Bug 2 is another instruction\nscheduling bug which causes sub instructions to be\nincorrectly marked as synchronizing, thus all younger instructions\nmust wait to be issued after any sub instruction has been\nissued and all older instructions must issue before any sub\ninstruction, regardless of dependencies and hardware resources. The\nimpact of this bug is larger, at ∼7%similar-toabsentpercent7\\sim 7\\% across the given workloads. Nevertheless, for both bugs, the impact is less than the\ndifference between Skylake and Ivybridge. Thus, from the designers\nperspective, working on the newer Skylake design with Ivybridge in\nhand, if early performance models showed the results shown for\nBug 2 (even more so Bug 1) designers might incorrectly\nassume that the buggy Skylake design did not have performance bugs\nsince it was much better than previous generations. Even as the\nperformance difference between microarchitecture generations\ndecreases, differentiating between performance bugs and expected\nbehavior remains a challenge given the variability between simulated\nperformance and real systems. Examining the figure, we note that each bug’s impact varies\nfrom workload to workload. That said, in the case of Bug 1, no\nsingle benchmark shows a performance loss of more than 1%. This\nmakes sense since the bug only impacts the performance of\napplications which have, relatively rare, xor instructions.\nFrom this, one might conclude that Bug 1 is trivial and perhaps\nneeds not be fixed at all. This assumption however, would be wrong, as\nmany workloads do in fact rely heavily upon the xor\ninstruction, enough so that a moderate impact on them translates into\nsignificant performance impact overall. In this work, we explore several approaches to this problem\nand ultimately develop an automated, two-stage, machine learning-based\nmethodology that will allow designers to automatically detect the\nexistence of performance bugs in microprocessor designs. Even though this\nwork focus is the processor core, we show that the methodology\ncan be used for other system modules, such as the memory.\nOur approach extracts and exploits knowledge from legacy designs instead\nof relying on a reference model. Legacy designs have already undergone major debugging,\ntherefore we considered them to be bug-free, or to have only minor performance bugs.\nThe automatic detection\ntakes several minutes of machine learning inference\ntime and several hours of architecture simulation time. The major\ncontributions of this work include the following: This is the first study on using machine learning for\nperformance bug detection, to the best of our knowledge. Thus,\nwhile we provide a solution to this particular problem, we also\nhope to draw the attention of the research community to the broader performance validation domain. Investigation of different strategies and\nmachine learning techniques to approach the problem. Ultimately, an\naccurate and straight forward, two phase approach is developed. A novel automated method to leverage\nSimPoints 5 to extract, short,\nperformance-orthogonal, microbenchmark “probes” from long\nrunning workloads. A set of processor performance bugs which may be configured for\nan arbitrary level of impact, for use in testing\nperformance debugging techniques is developed. Our methodology detects 91.5% of these processor core performance bugs\nleading to ≥1%absentpercent1\\geq 1\\% IPC degradation with 0% false positives.\nIt also achieves 100% accuracy for the evaluated performance bugs in\nmemory systems. As an early work in this space, we limit our scope somewhat\nto maintain tractablity. This work is focused mainly\non the processor\ncore (the most complex component in the system), however we show\nthat the methodology can be generalized to other units by evaluating\nits usage on memory systems.\nFurther, here we focus on\nperformance bugs that affect cycle count and consider timing issues to\nbe out of scope. The goal of this work is to find bugs in new architectures that\nare incrementally evolved from those used in the training data, it may not work\nas well when there have been large shifts in microarchitectural details, such as\ngoing from in-order to out-of-order. However, major generalized\nmicroarchitectural changes are increasingly rare. For example, Intel processors’\nlast major microarchitecture refactoring occurred ∼15similar-toabsent15\\sim 15 years ago, from\nP4 to “Core”. Over this period, there have been several microarchitectures\nwhere our approach could provide value. In the event of larger changes, our method can be partially reused by augmenting it with additional features.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: need for new, more automated mechanisms for\nperformance debugging.
