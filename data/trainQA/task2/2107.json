      "content": "Paper Title: On the Role of Entropy-Based Loss for Learning Causal Structure with Continuous Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo investigate the effectiveness of the entropy-based loss, we compare it with baseline algorithms on both synthetic data and real-world data. The synthetic data are generated from linear pairwise SCM, linear non-Gaussian SCM, and nonlinear additive noise SCM, respectively. The following algorithms are taken as the baseline: NOTEARS , LiNGAM , GOLEM-NV [ref]28, DAG-GNN , NOTEARS-MLP [ref]13, GraN-DAG . We reuse the parameter settings for those baseline algorithms in their original papers and codes. Our implementation, denoted by ours (linear) and ours-MLP (nonlinear), is based on the codes of NOTEARS  and NOTEARS-MLP [ref]13, respectively. Following the previous works, the numerical optimize algorithms L-BFGS  is used for optimization, and we will prune the edges after training with a small threshold ω=0.3𝜔0.3\\omega=0.3 to rule out cycle-inducing edges. In the linear pairwise SCM, the data are generated according to the following SCM: X=NX,Y=α​X+NYformulae-sequence𝑋subscript𝑁𝑋𝑌𝛼𝑋subscript𝑁𝑌X=N_{X},Y=\\alpha X+N_{Y} with causal strength α∈[0.5,1.0]𝛼0.51.0\\alpha\\in[0.5,1.0] and the noise NX,NY∼σN∗Gaussian​(0,1)similar-tosubscript𝑁𝑋subscript𝑁𝑌subscript𝜎𝑁Gaussian01N_{X},N_{Y}\\sim\\sigma_{N}*\\text{Gaussian}(0,1) or NX,NY∼σN∗Uniform​(−3,3)similar-tosubscript𝑁𝑋subscript𝑁𝑌subscript𝜎𝑁Uniform33N_{X},N_{Y}\\sim\\sigma_{N}*\\text{Uniform}(-\\sqrt{3},\\sqrt{3}) or NX,NY∼σN∗Gumbel​(0,6π)similar-tosubscript𝑁𝑋subscript𝑁𝑌subscript𝜎𝑁Gumbel06𝜋N_{X},N_{Y}\\sim\\sigma_{N}*\\text{Gumbel}(0,\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{\\pi}) with standard deviation σN∈[0.6,1.6]subscript𝜎𝑁0.61.6\\sigma_{N}\\in[0.6,1.6].
