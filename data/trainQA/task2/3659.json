      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Effective Clustered Federated Learning: A Peer-to-peer Framework with Adaptive Neighbor Matching\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nClustered Federated Learning. Clustered FL holds the Non-IID assumption that different groups of clients have their own optimization objectives, and it is usually used to realize better accuracy performance  [ref]13 or better compression of model updates [ref]20 . In this paper, we focus on the effectiveness of clustered FL on test accuracy, especially local personalization. In personalized clustered FL  [ref]13, aggregating models in the same cluster will bring better personalization while aggregation among different clusters will cause negative transfer111In some works, it is found that generalized knowledge can be transferred among cluster centroids  . However, this only happens when the clustered heterogeneity is not dominant. In this paper, we focus on more heterogeneous clustered FL, where negative transfer exists among different clusters.. To group clients into clusters, the main challenge of clustered FL is measuring client similarity. There are mainly three types of measurement, based on losses, gradients [ref]13  , model weights [ref]13  [ref]12 , respectively. In loss-based measurement, clients receive several models and infer them on the local dataset, and the one with the smallest loss has maximal similarity . For model weight and gradient measurement, cosine distance [ref]13 [ref]12 or Euclidean distance   [ref]12 are used in previous works. It is verified that clients with similar data distributions will have small Euclidean distances and large cosine similarities in gradients or model weights. The methods for clustering in previous works can be divided into two streams, the K-means-based and the hierarchical. For the K-means-based approaches, FedSEM [ref]12 first implements the K-means method based on clients’ Euclidean distances of model weights on the server to cluster clients. However, server-side K-means clustering is computationally expensive. To solve this issue, Duan et al.   use decomposed cosine similarity to speed up computation and design an efficient newcomer device cold start mechanism. Additionally, Ghosh et al. propose an efficient algorithm IFCA by inherently applying K-means to the client side. IFCA keeps several global models, and clients iteratively choose which global model it is prone to contribute to based on local losses of global models.\nIn another stream of works, hierarchical clustering methods are used to achieve better personalization. Sattler et al. [ref]13 use a hierarchical optimal bi-partitioning algorithm based on cosine similarity of weights or gradients. By bi-partitioning, the method realizes a model tree from personalization to generalization. Further, Briggs et al.  design a hierarchical algorithm for a wider range of Non-IID settings, and the method separates clusters of clients by the similarity of their local models to the global model. Additionally, Dem-AI is developed for building large-scale distributed and democratized machine learning systems , and it realizes a bottom-up hierarchical clustering with specialized–generalized duality. Note that all the algorithms mentioned above in clustered FL rely on the assumption of the number of clusters (the K-means-based methods) or the level of hierarchy (the hierarchical techniques). However, the number of clusters is latent and cannot be obtained as prior knowledge, and if the hyperparameters are set inappropriately, the clustering performance will degrade. Peer-to-peer Federated Learning. Peer-to-peer federated learning (P2P FL, also known as decentralized FL) alters the centralized topology of conventional FL, and it allows clients to communicate with limited neighbors  . There is a study comparing decentralized algorithms like gossip learning with centralized FL in terms of communication efficiency. It is found that the best gossip variants perform comparably to the best centralized FL algorithms overall . Early works related to P2P FL introduce the P2P FL problem under privacy constraints and provide theoretical guarantees. Lalitha et al.   use a Bayesian-like approach to let clients collectively learn a model that best fits the observations over the entire network. Bellet et al.  make P2P FL differentially private and analyze the trade-off between utility and privacy. They mainly study P2P FL under the IID data assumption, but heterogeneity is prevalent in FL practices. Recent works mostly discuss class imbalance heterogeneity and communication problems. First, to tackle class imbalance, Li et al.  use mutual knowledge distillation instead of weight averaging. Bellet et al.  elaborately design a topology from holistic perspective. However, without a central server, the holistic perspective is impractical, and it is hard for clients to form such topology with limited observations. Second, communication of P2P FL can be more efficient by sparsification , adaptive partial gradient aggregation , and using max-plus linear system theory to compute throughput . Most recently, swarm learning  has been brought up as a P2P FL customized for medical research, utilizing edge computing and blockchain as infrastructures, and it has attracted wide attention. It provides strong application practices of P2P FL. While we are formulating this paper, we find a related same-time work (PENS) that has the same motivation as ours but uses different methods . PENS adopts a two-stage strategy. In the first stage, clients select top k𝑘k peers as neighbors for aggregation from randomly sampled l𝑙l neighbor candidates in each round. After the first stage, clients select the peers that were selected from as neighbors more than “the expected amount of times” in the first stage as permanent neighbors. In the second stage, in each round, clients randomly choose k𝑘k neighbors for aggregation from permanent neighbors. It is possible for PENS to have noisy neighbor estimations, and we analyze the superiority of PANM to PENS in Section 4 and 5.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: Federated Learning.
