      "content": "Paper Title: Semi-Supervised Hierarchical Graph Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe task of graph instance representation is to produce a fixed-length embedding vector of a graph instance, for which, however, we identify two challenges: Size invariance: How to design the network structure to flexibly take an arbitrary-sized graph instance and produce a fixed-length embedding vector? Permutation invariance: How to derive the representation regardless of the permutation of nodes? While the concept of size invariance is straightforward, we specifically provide the definition of permutation invariance on graphs here: Let P∈{0,1}n×n𝑃superscript01𝑛𝑛P\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n\\times n} be any permutation matrix of order n𝑛n, then the permutation to a graph instance g𝑔g is defined as a mapping of the node indices, i.e.: Then a function f𝑓f is invariant to permutation on g𝑔g if Recently graph pooling has emerged as a research topic that can be used to tackle the above challenges. Some common practices include DIFFPOOL [ref]23, Attention-based Pool [ref]25[ref]24, MinCut-Pool . In particular,  shows Attention-based Pool is permutation-invariant by connecting with\nWeisfeiler-Lehman test. To this end, in IC, we first utilize a multi-layer Graph Neural Network (GNN)  to smooth each node’s features over the graph’s topology. Then we adopt a graph pooling method and transform a variable number of smoothed nodes into a fixed-length graph instance representation e𝑒e. Formally, we are given the adjacency matrix A∈ℝn×n𝐴superscriptℝ𝑛𝑛A\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n} and the attribute matrix X∈ℝn×d𝑋superscriptℝ𝑛𝑑X\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d} of a graph instance g𝑔g as inputs.\nWe apply a multi-layer GNN network: here we get a set of representation H∈ℝn×v𝐻superscriptℝ𝑛𝑣H\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times v} for nodes in g𝑔g. Note that the representation H𝐻H is size variant, i.e., its size is still determined by the number of nodes n𝑛n. So next we utilize the graph pooling mechanism: here consider Attention-based Pool is adopted, as the attention weight is used to multiply with H𝐻H and flatten the representation, e𝑒e is size invariant and does not depend on the number of nodes n𝑛n any more, which solves the first challenge. While for the second challenge of the node permutations, the following positive Proposition shows that our constructed instance-level classifier IC is permutation invariant as long as the selected component graph pooling method and GNN are permutation invariant: Let P∈{0,1}n×n𝑃superscript01𝑛𝑛P\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n\\times n} be any permutation matrix, then I​C​(A,X)=I​C​(P​A​P⊤,P​X)𝐼𝐶𝐴𝑋𝐼𝐶𝑃𝐴superscript𝑃top𝑃𝑋IC(A,X)=IC(PAP^{\\top},PX) as long as the chosen graph pooling method and GNN are permutation invariant. Consider a permutation invariant GNN, e.g., GIN , we have: For pooling operation, consider the permutation invariant Attention-based Pooling function used in  [ref]25: where Ws​1subscript𝑊𝑠1W_{s1} and Ws​2subscript𝑊𝑠2W_{s2} are two weight matrices. H𝐻H is the same after nodes permutation from Eq. (15) and our example pooling function Eq. (16) is only relevant to H𝐻H, which reveals the permutation invariance of IC. Thus we finish the proof.\n∎ To summarize, we use GNN and graph pooling that are permutation invariant to construct the instance-level classifier IC. It produces graph instance representations E={ei}i=1L+U𝐸superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑒𝑖𝑖1𝐿𝑈E=\\{e_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{L+U} while successfully dealing with the aforementioned two challenges, which is the input for classifier HC in the next.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: a function f𝑓f is invariant to permutation on g𝑔g if Recently graph pooling has emerged as a research topic that can be used to tackle the above challenges.
