      "content": "Paper Title: LakeBench: Benchmarks for Data Discovery over Data Lakes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBenchmarks.\nWe create new benchmarks to train or finetune the foundation models for table discovery including table unionability, table joinability, and table subset tasks. The unionable table search benchmarks released on\nTUS  and SANTOS  are the closest work in the literature.\nNotice however, they are created for searching unionable tables from the data lakes, and cannot be easily used to train neural models; our work adapts these benchmarks as well. Several tabular benchmarks exist in the literature for other tasks .\nFor instance, Koutras et al.  create benchmarks for schema matching task  using open data tables and evaluate the existing matching techniques over them.\nFurthermore, Mudgal et al.  open source 13 datasets such as the DBLP-Google Scholar author dataset and Walmart-Amazon product datasets for entity matching task . Other public dataset includes WDC Web Table corpus  that contains around 233 million web tables extracted from different web pages. These tables have been used for diverse tasks such as Question Answering  , Semantic Parsing   [ref]35, Table Retrieval , Table Metadata Prediction [ref]34 [ref]10  and more . Recently, Efthymiou et al.  use knowledge graphs to create tabular benchmarks for column type prediction and column-to-column binary relationship prediction tasks. Another benchmark such as VizNet  has been used to evaluate column type prediction tasks  . Unlike the existing benchmarks, LakeBench targets data discovery tasks . Tabular Foundation Models.\nNeural models pretrained on tabular datasets show significant advantage on many of the tasks described above when followed by supervised fine-tuning [ref]10  [ref]34 [ref]35.\nThere models are pretrained with tabular objective to either recover masked tokens in the table or to detect corrupt values.\nFor instance, Deng et al. [ref]10\ncombined the Masked Language Model (MLM) objective from BERT  with a novel Masked Entity Recovery (MER) to train TURL. Wang et al. [ref]34 use MLM with novel Cell-level Cloze (CLC) and Table Context Retrival (TCR) for TUTA. Yin et al. [ref]35 used Masked Column Prediction (MCP) and Cell Value Recovery (CVR) for TABERT while Iida et al.  repurposed ELECTRA’s objective function  for TABBIE.\nOnce trained, these models are finetuned for tasks like table metadata prediction, table content population, fact-checking, question answering, semantic parsing and so on.\nFor instance, TABERT is evaluated on neural semantic parsing; TABBIE for column, row, and column type population tasks; and TUTA is finetuned and evaluated for cell and table type classification tasks. Essentially, all the downstream tasks either take a table or a table with a question as input. None of these tasks involved the comparison of two tables; which is essential for data discovery.\nBadaro et al.  provides a survey of transformers for tabular data representation and their applications.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: WDC Web Table corpus  that contains around 233 million web tables extracted from different web pages. These tables have been used for diverse tasks such as Question Answering  , Semantic Parsing   [ref]35, Table Retrieval , Table Metadata Prediction [ref]34 [ref]10  and more . Recently, Efthymiou et al.  use knowledge graphs to create tabular benchmarks for column type prediction and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
