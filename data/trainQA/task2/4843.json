      "content": "Paper Title: Meta-Sift : How to Sift Out a Clean Subset in the Presence of Data Poisoning?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOverview. We now describe the full algorithm to sift out a clean subset, which we call Meta-Sift .\nGiven a poisoned dataset and a selection budget, Meta-Sift  aims to select a subset that is most likely to be clean. The subset output by Meta-Sift  can then be used as a base set in different downstream defense algorithms to fulfill their corresponding defense goals.\nAt a high level, Meta-Sift consists of two stages: Training and Identification. In the Training stage, we adopt an online algorithm to solve (11, 12), and the algorithm will produce optimized parameters ψ∗superscript𝜓\\psi^{*} for 𝒮​(⋅)𝒮⋅{\\mathcal{S}}(\\cdot) as well as model parameters θ∗superscript𝜃\\theta^{*} trained on the weighted samples. The definition of θ∗superscript𝜃\\theta^{*} will be more clear after we explicate the algorithm. We will refer to the combination of 𝒮​(⋅)𝒮⋅{\\mathcal{S}}(\\cdot) parameterized by ψ∗superscript𝜓\\psi^{*} and the classification model parameterized by θ∗superscript𝜃\\theta^{*} as a Sifter. To mitigate the randomness of batch selection in the online algorithm, we run the online algorithm independently for m𝑚m times, which results in m𝑚m Sifters. In the Identification stage, we feed the dataset into each Sifter and aggregate the weights produced by all Sifters to obtain the final weight for each sample in the dataset.\nThe full process of Meta-Sift is depicted in Figure 4. Training Stage.\nWe present how to train a single Sifter in Meta-Sift .\nThe training process starts by “warming up” θ𝜃\\theta—training θ𝜃\\theta on the entire dataset for one epoch. Essentially, we update θ𝜃\\theta while setting all weights to be one. This “warm-up” step helps promote 𝒮​(⋅)𝒮⋅\\mathcal{S}(\\cdot) to assign large weight (close to 111) to samples, which in turn, allows most of the samples to be placed into the split for training, as mentioned above.\nThen, the Sifter (with θ𝜃\\theta and ψ𝜓\\psi) are updated via an online algorithm (illustrated in Figure 4). At each round of the online algorithm, we perform the following four steps: Virtual-update of a warmed-up model θ𝜃\\theta, Gradient Sampling using the meta-gradient-sampler ΓΓ\\Gamma, Meta-update of ψ𝜓\\psi, and finally the Actual-update of θ𝜃\\theta. Virtual-update of θ𝜃\\theta.\nThis step takes a virtual update of θ𝜃\\theta, the same as the traditional stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Formally, a mini-batch of data {zi}i=1nsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑧𝑖𝑖1𝑛\\{z_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{n} is sampled, where n𝑛n is the batch size, and the following update is performed: where 𝐠θ=1n​∑i=1n𝒮​(Li​(θ);ψ)​∂Li​(θ)∂θsubscript𝐠𝜃1𝑛superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛𝒮subscript𝐿𝑖𝜃𝜓subscript𝐿𝑖𝜃𝜃\\mathbf{g}_{\\theta}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\mathcal{S}\\left(L_{i}\\left(\\theta\\right);\\psi\\right)\\frac{\\partial L_{i}(\\theta)}{\\partial\\theta}, representing the weighted gradient of the training loss with respect to θ𝜃\\theta and α𝛼\\alpha is the learning rate.\nSuppose θ𝜃\\theta is a neural network consisting of ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} layers. Let the parameters in layer l𝑙l be denoted by wlsubscript𝑤𝑙w_{l}.\nThen, we can rewrite 𝐠θsubscript𝐠𝜃\\mathbf{g}_{\\theta} as where gl=∂Li​(θ)∂wlsubscript𝑔𝑙subscript𝐿𝑖𝜃subscript𝑤𝑙g_{l}=\\frac{\\partial L_{i}\\left(\\theta\\right)}{\\partial w_{l}}, representing a scaled gradient with respect to the parameters in layer l𝑙l. Gradient Sampling.\nInspired by [ref]15, we parallelly train a list of u𝑢u gradient-samplers to select partial gradients from the last u𝑢u layers, {gℒ−u,…,gℒ}subscript𝑔ℒ𝑢…subscript𝑔ℒ\\{g_{\\mathcal{L}-u},\\ldots,g_{\\mathcal{L}}\\} for subsequent update on ψ𝜓\\psi. The goal of gradient sampling is to accelerate and achieve more stable results on the subsequent update on ψ𝜓\\psi [ref]15. In particular, we associate a different gradient-sampler γl​(⋅)subscript𝛾𝑙⋅\\gamma_{l}(\\cdot) for each layer l∈{ℒ−u,…,ℒ}𝑙ℒ𝑢…ℒl\\in\\{\\mathcal{L}-u,\\ldots,\\mathcal{L}\\}. γlsubscript𝛾𝑙\\gamma_{l} takes as input the gradient glsubscript𝑔𝑙g_{l} and returns a value indicating whether glsubscript𝑔𝑙g_{l} is selected. The reason why each layer has a different gradient-sampler is that their corresponding gradients are of different dimensions and γl​(⋅)subscript𝛾𝑙⋅\\gamma_{l}(\\cdot)’s input dimension needs to be tailored to the size of glsubscript𝑔𝑙g_{l}.\nFollowing [ref]15, we implement each gradient-sampler as a two-layer fully-connected neural network. The activation units in the first and second layer are\nPReLU  and “Gumbel-softmax” [ref]36, respectively. The l𝑙l-th gradient sampler, γlsubscript𝛾𝑙\\gamma_{l}, can be updated using the gradient of the outer optimization objective w.r.t. the gradient sampler’s parameters.\nThe dependency of the outer optimization objective on the sampler’s parameters is via ψ𝜓\\psi. The gradient can be calculated automatically via auto-differentitaion in standard deep learning frameworks [ref]37.\nWe then update each sampler according to the respected gradients before selecting layers.\nThe gradient of a layer is selected if the output of the respect sampler exceeds 0.50.50.5. We denote the collection of the weights for layers that are selected by a gradient sampler as Meta-update of ψ𝜓\\psi.\nIn this step, we update the parameter ψ𝜓\\psi of the weight-assigning network by calculating the gradient of the outer optimization objective function with respect to ψ𝜓\\psi and performing the gradient descent:\nψ^=ψ−β​𝐠ψ,^𝜓𝜓𝛽subscript𝐠𝜓\\hat{\\psi}=\\psi-\\beta\\mathbf{g}_{\\psi},\nwhere 𝐠ψsubscript𝐠𝜓\\mathbf{g}_{\\psi} 𝐠ψ=∂∂ψ​(1n​∑i=1n(1−𝒮​(Li​(θ′);ψ))​Li​(θ′))=1n​∑i=1n(−∂𝒮​(Li​(θ′);ψ)∂ψ​Li​(θ′)+(1−𝒮​(Li​(θ′);ψ))​∂Li​(θ′)∂ψ).subscript𝐠𝜓absent𝜓1𝑛superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛1𝒮subscript𝐿𝑖superscript𝜃′𝜓subscript𝐿𝑖superscript𝜃′missing-subexpressionabsent1𝑛superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛𝒮subscript𝐿𝑖superscript𝜃′𝜓𝜓subscript𝐿𝑖superscript𝜃′1𝒮subscript𝐿𝑖superscript𝜃′𝜓subscript𝐿𝑖superscript𝜃′𝜓\\begin{aligned} \\mathbf{g}_{\\psi}&=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\psi}\\bigg{(}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(1-\\mathcal{S}(L_{i}(\\theta^{\\prime});\\psi))L_{i}(\\theta^{\\prime})\\bigg{)}\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\bigg{(}-\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{S}(L_{i}(\\theta^{\\prime});\\psi)}{\\partial\\psi}L_{i}(\\theta^{\\prime})+(1-\\mathcal{S}(L_{i}(\\theta^{\\prime});\\psi))\\frac{\\partial L_{i}(\\theta^{\\prime})}{\\partial\\psi}\\bigg{)}.\\end{aligned} ∂Li​(θ′)∂ψsubscript𝐿𝑖superscript𝜃′𝜓\\frac{\\partial L_{i}(\\theta^{\\prime})}{\\partial\\psi} is often referred to as indirect gradient, and expands as The process of calculating the indirect gradient of ψ𝜓\\psi has been shown to be computationally intensive  . However, in our case, by using the gradient samplers, we only consider the selected layers to calculate the indirect gradient, i.e., Note that 𝐠ψsubscript𝐠𝜓\\mathbf{g}_{\\psi} does not need to be calculated manually; instead, it can also be computed via automated differentiation. Actual-update of θ𝜃\\theta.\nFinally, we update θ𝜃\\theta in place based on the weights assigned by the updated 𝒮​(⋅;ψ^)𝒮⋅^𝜓\\mathcal{S}(\\cdot;\\widehat{\\psi}): In each round of our online algorithm, the four steps are performed on one batch of data. The algorithm terminates when it has gone through all the samples in D𝐷D.\nThe pseudocode of the Training Stage is in Algorithm 1, Appendix 6.3. We define the updated θ𝜃\\theta and ψ𝜓\\psi in the final round as θ∗superscript𝜃\\theta^{*} and ψ∗superscript𝜓\\psi^{*}, respectively. The pair of θ∗superscript𝜃\\theta^{*} and ψ∗superscript𝜓\\psi^{*} defines one Sifter’s parameters. We will run the online Training algorithm multiple times to obtain the Sifters we will use in the Identification Stage. Identification Stage.\nNow we aggregate the results from all the Sifters to identify the clean samples in three steps:\nRandomized Sample-Dilution, Weight Assignment, and Weight Aggregation & identification. Randomized Sample-Dilution: Instead of directly feeding a sample to the Sifter, we propose to first randomly perturb the sample. Existing works   show that the prediction associated with a clean sample is robust to random perturbation. Hence, a sample that consistently receives high weights under different perturbations is more likely to be clean than those samples experiencing large variance under perturbations. The perturbation strategies considered in this paper include\nrandom cropping, random rotation, random horizontal flipping, and Gaussian blurring. For each sample, we apply all the perturbation strategies simultaneously, and each strategy is configured randomly (e.g., we randomly sample a rotation angle and rotate the sample correspondingly).\nAblation study on these random perturbations is presented in Appendix 6.7. Weight Assignment: The random sample-dilution step produces m𝑚m perturbed datasets and each dataset contains samples perturbed by a different random configuration of the perturbations strategies. Then, each Sifter (m𝑚m in total) takes as input a perturbed dataset and produces the weights for all samples. In particular, the classification model (parameterized by θ∗superscript𝜃\\theta^{*}) in the Sifter will be used to extract features from each sample and 𝒮​(⋅)𝒮⋅{\\mathcal{S}}(\\cdot) (parameterized by ψ∗superscript𝜓\\psi^{*}) will assign weight to a sample based on the extracted features. Aggregation & identification: We average the weights for each sample from multiple Sifters and use the top-weighted samples of each class k𝑘k to form the sifted class-wise clean subset Bksubscript𝐵𝑘B_{k}. Finally, the clean split ℬℬ{\\mathcal{B}} is obtained by combining the class-wise results.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: L_{i}\\left(\\theta\\right)}{\\partial w_{l}}, representing a scaled gradient with respect to the parameters in layer l𝑙l. Gradient Sampling.\nInspired by [ref]15, we parallelly train a list of u𝑢u gradient-samplers to select partial gradients from the last u𝑢u layers, {gℒ−u,…,gℒ}subscript𝑔ℒ𝑢…subscript𝑔ℒ\\{g_{\\mathcal{L}-u},\\ldots,g_{\\mathcal{L}}\\} for\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
