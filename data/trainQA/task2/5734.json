      "content": "Paper Title: Exorcising ‚ÄúWraith‚Äù: Protecting LiDAR-based Object Detector in Automated Driving System from Appearing Attacks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n(1) Victim Models. We choose three mainstream LiDAR-based object detectors: PointPillars , PointRCNN  and PV-RCNN [ref]37 as the victim models. Specifically, we adopt the implementation of these three object detectors available on an open-source project OpenPCDet [ref]43, each of which is normally trained on KITTI dataset 9 to achieve the near state-of-the-art performance. (2) Attack Methods. We implement three popular appearing attacks which can be roughly categorized into white-box and black-box attacks. In the former case, the attacker has full access to the victim 3D detector, including the architecture and the parameters, while the latter only accesses the detector as a black-box prediction API. Specifically, the attacks are ‚Ä¢¬†A Variant of Adv-LiDAR  (abbrev. Baseline, white-box): Because Adv-LiDAR is specially designed for attacking Baidu‚Äôs Apollo , it could hardly be directly transferred to attack other 3D object detectors . Therefore, following its main idea, we implement a variant of ADV-LiDAR by randomly injecting a certain number of points into a specified zone, and using FGSM  to increase the confidence scores of those forged cars related to these points. ‚Ä¢¬†Yang‚Äôs Work  (abbrev. Roadside, white-box): This attack forges cars by 3D printing a small and specifically-designed object, increasing their confidence scores and category scores of label car, and enlarging their bounding boxes with gradient descent.\nSince this attack will generate the adversarial points and then turn them into a physical object, we will only deploy the first part for our experiments.\nIn their original work, this attack mainly aims at breaking PointRCNN with a white-box access. We thus also follow the settings in our experiments. ‚Ä¢¬†Sun‚Äôs Work  (abbrev. Physical, black-box): This attack forges cars by duplicating real cars, which contains a limited number of points due to either inter-occlusion or intra-occlusion. The PC of the fake car is then transformed to a front-near position of the victim ADS. (3) Baseline Defenses. We implement SRS, SOR, CARLO and Shadow-Catcher which we have introduced in Section 3.3 as the baseline defenses.\nWe do not consider SVF because it relies on retraining the whole 3D object detector itself, and causes much more time and computation cost compared with other baseline defenses as well as ours (Section 5.2.3). (4) Metrics.\nWe choose three different metrics to evaluate the performance of our proposed defense and other defenses: ‚Ä¢¬†Precision measures the proportion of the real objects in the prediction results. In the context of defense, the decrease in precision reflects whether these defenses would harm the original performance of the victim model.\nFollowing   [ref]37, we first choose a certain threshold Cconfsubscriptùê∂confC_{\\text{conf}} for each 3D object detector, and remove those predicted objects with confidence scores less than Cconfsubscriptùê∂confC_{\\text{conf}}.\nThen we calculate the 2D IoU on the x-y plane between the bounding boxes of each remaining predicted object and the ground-truth objects. A predicted object is true positive, if its maximal IoU value surpasses another certain threshold CIoUsubscriptùê∂IoUC_{\\text{IoU}} and the predicted category is identical with the ground-truth; otherwise, the predicted object is a false positive prediction.\nFor PointPillars and PointRCNN, we set Cconf=0.5,CIoU=0.5formulae-sequencesubscriptùê∂conf0.5subscriptùê∂IoU0.5C_{\\text{conf}}=0.5,\\ C_{\\text{IoU}}=0.5; for PV-RCNN, we set Cconf=0.7,CIoU=0.5formulae-sequencesubscriptùê∂conf0.7subscriptùê∂IoU0.5C_{\\text{conf}}=0.7,\\ C_{\\text{IoU}}=0.5. ‚Ä¢¬†Average Precision (AP) is a comprehensive metric over the precision and the recall of the detection results. Specifically, AP is the average value of precision when the recall is larger than different specific values, which can be represented as ‚Ä¢¬†Attack Success Rate (ASR) measures the ratio of the number of forged cars detected by the victim 3D object detector over the total number of attack attempts, which directly reflects the performance of these defenses. A more effective defense should result in a lower ASR. (5) Implementation of LOP. We choose two off-the-shelf point-wise PC classification architectures, PointNet  and DGCNN , to instantiate the LOP. For those hyper-parameters of LOP described in Section 4, we set Mp‚Äãc=1024,TIoU=1√ó10‚àí6,Œ±f‚Äãl=1,Œ≥f‚Äãl=2,Œ≤=1√ó10‚àí3formulae-sequencesubscriptùëÄùëùùëê1024formulae-sequencesubscriptùëáIoU1superscript106formulae-sequencesubscriptùõºùëìùëô1formulae-sequencesubscriptùõæùëìùëô2ùõΩ1superscript103M_{pc}=1024,\\ T_{\\text{IoU}}=1\\times{10}^{-6},\\ \\alpha_{fl}=1,\\ \\gamma_{fl}=2,\\ \\beta=1\\times{10}^{-3}.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: (1) Victim Models.
