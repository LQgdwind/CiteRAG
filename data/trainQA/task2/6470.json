      "content": "Paper Title: Cooperation or Competition: Avoiding Player Domination for Multi-Target Robustness via Adaptive Budgets\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets. We conducted extensive experiments on\none synthetic dataset (Sec. 4.1) to complement our theoretical results, and on MNIST , CIFAR-10 [ref]21, and CIFAR-100 [ref]21 to show the superiority of our proposed methods over the existing methods of multi-target adversarial training. Due to the limitation of space, the experiments on synthetic data is in Appendix. Methods.\nModels that defend against multiple adversaries are trained using MAX [ref]41, AVG [ref]41, and MSD [ref]26.\nFor each algorithm, we use the default hyperparameters introduced in their original papers.\nAll methods are implemented in PyTorch  on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.\nRaw images are resized to 28×28282828\\times 28 pixels for MNIST and 32×32323232\\times 32 pixels for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 as inputs.\nWe apply the AdaptiveBudget to MAX, MSD, and AVG with ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} and ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2} norms to assign proper budgets adaptively to avoid player domination. Models.\nFollowing MSD [ref]26 and Madry et al. , for MNIST, we use a four-layer convolutional network which consists of two convolutional layers of 32 and 64 5×5555\\times 5 filters and 222 units of padding, followed by a fully connected layer with 102410241024 hidden units, where both convolutional layers are followed by 2×2222\\times 2 Max Pooling layers and ReLU activations.\nSimilarly, following MSD [ref]26, for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we use the pre-activation version of the ResNet18  architecture that consists of nine residual units with two convolutional layers. Attacks used for training. For MNIST, we follow the setting of three adversaries from MSD [ref]26, as shown below. The ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty}-adversary uses a step size of α=0.01𝛼0.01\\alpha=0.01 within a radius of ϵ∞=0.3subscriptitalic-ϵ0.3\\epsilon_{\\infty}=0.3 for 50 iterations. The ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-adversary uses a step size of α=0.1𝛼0.1\\alpha=0.1 within a radius of ϵ2=2.0subscriptitalic-ϵ22.0\\epsilon_{2}=2.0 for 100 iterations, and the ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-adversary uses a step size of α=0.8𝛼0.8\\alpha=0.8 within a radius of ϵ1=10subscriptitalic-ϵ110\\epsilon_{1}=10 for 50 iterations. By default, the attack is run with two restarts: one starting with 𝜹=𝟎𝜹0\\bm{\\delta}=\\mathbf{0}, and another by randomly initializing 𝜹𝜹\\bm{\\delta} in the perturbation ball.\nSimilarly, for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we follow MSD [ref]26. The ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty}-adversary uses a step size of α=0.003𝛼0.003\\alpha=0.003 within a radius of ϵ∞=0.03subscriptitalic-ϵ0.03\\epsilon_{\\infty}=0.03 for 40 iterations. The ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-adversary uses a step size of α=0.05𝛼0.05\\alpha=0.05 within a radius of ϵ2=0.5subscriptitalic-ϵ20.5\\epsilon_{2}=0.5 for 50 iterations, and the ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-adversary uses a step size of α=1.0𝛼1.0\\alpha=1.0 within a radius of ϵ1=12subscriptitalic-ϵ112\\epsilon_{1}=12 for 50 iterations. Attacks used for evaluation.\nTo fully understand the performance of the defense, we employ the PGD adversary and Autoattack We only consider white-box attacks based on gradients and do not use attacks based on gradient estimation, as the gradients for the standard architectures used here are readily available. to test the effectiveness of our method. We make 10 random restarts for all results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. The budgets for the three adversaries, i.e., ϵ1subscriptitalic-ϵ1\\epsilon_{1}, ϵ2subscriptitalic-ϵ2\\epsilon_{2}, and ϵ∞subscriptitalic-ϵ\\epsilon_{\\infty}, are the same as the setting during training for both datasets. However, we increase the number of iterations to (100,200,100)100200100(100,200,100) for (ℓ∞,ℓ2,ℓ1)subscriptℓsubscriptℓ2subscriptℓ1(\\ell_{\\infty},\\ell_{2},\\ell_{1}) on MNIST, and to (100,500,100)100500100(100,500,100) for (ℓ∞,ℓ2,ℓ1)subscriptℓsubscriptℓ2subscriptℓ1(\\ell_{\\infty},\\ell_{2},\\ell_{1}) on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Hyperparameter setting and tuning.\nWe did not tune any hyperparameters as our goal is to demonstrate the player domination phenomenon and propose a solution with our AdaptiveBudget method.\nWe adopted all hyperparameters directly from MSD [ref]26. Specifically, on MNIST, we used Adam  without weight decay and a variation of the learning rate schedule from Smith . The schedule is piecewise linear, starting from 00 and increasing to 10−3superscript10310^{-3} over the first 666 epochs, then decreasing to 00 over the last 999 epochs. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we used SGD  with momentum 0.90.90.9 and weight decay 5×10−45superscript1045\\times 10^{-4} for all models. We also used a variation of the learning rate schedule from Smith  to achieve superconvergence in 505050 epochs. The schedule is piecewise linear, starting from 00 and increasing to 0.10.10.1 over the first 202020 epochs, then decreasing to 0.0050.0050.005 over the next 202020 epochs, and finally decreasing to 00 over the last 101010 epochs. Evaluation metric. While our main target is to improve the overall robust accuracy on ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-, ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}, and ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty}- attacks, we report the single attack accuracy as well. The overall robust accuracy is calculated as ∑(𝐱,y)(𝐈(f(𝐱+𝜹1(𝐱))==y)∗𝐈(f(𝐱+𝜹2(𝐱))==y)∗𝐈(f(𝐱+𝜹∞(𝐱))==y))/n\\sum_{(\\mathbf{x},y)}(\\mathbf{I}(f(\\mathbf{x}+\\bm{\\delta}_{1}(\\mathbf{x}))==y)*\\mathbf{I}(f(\\mathbf{x}+\\bm{\\delta}_{2}(\\mathbf{x}))==y)*\\mathbf{I}(f(\\mathbf{x}+\\bm{\\delta}_{\\infty}(\\mathbf{x}))==y))/n, where 𝐈​(c​o​n​d)=1𝐈𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑1\\mathbf{I}(cond)=1 when c​o​n​d𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑cond is true and 𝐈​(c​o​n​d)=0𝐈𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑0\\mathbf{I}(cond)=0 when c​o​n​d𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑cond is false, n𝑛n is the total number of testing data, and f​(⋅)𝑓⋅f(\\cdot) is the trained model.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: Datasets.
