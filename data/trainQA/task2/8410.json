      "content": "Paper Title: Compromising the Intelligence of Modern DNNs: On the Effectiveness of Targeted RowPress\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent advancements in deep learning have revolutionized applications, including image classification , object detection , and speech recognition . However, privacy and security concerns surrounding this powerful technology are gaining increasing attention, especially in safety-critical domains like healthcare and finance . Recent attacks exploiting software   and system-level  [ref]8 vectors demonstrate the feasibility of compromising DNN systems. Among the various security threats to DNN security, this paper focuses on adversarial weight attack [ref]9  0 [ref]8 1. This attack typically injects RowHammer-based faults 2 in DRAM, where model parameters are stored. RowHammer, characterized by repetitive DRAM row activation (i.e., hammering), can significantly degrade DNN performance through precise bit-flip algorithms [ref]9. Advanced in-DRAM defenses 3 4 5 6 have improved memory system resilience, mitigating RowHammer threats, but similar emerging threats, like RowPress, remain a concern. RowPress shares similarities with RowHammer in exploiting the differential bit states between adjacent rows. The fundamental difference between them lies in the underlying attack mechanism. RowPress relies on prolonged row activation, as opposed to RowHammer’s frequent and relatively transient row activation, and thus requires considerably fewer number of activations to induce bit-flips. 7 also shows that these two attack models result in distinct bit-flip patterns, i.e., vulnerable bit profiles. Existing precise bit-flip algorithms such as [ref]9 were designed according to RowHammer. Given the aforementioned similarities and differences between RowHammer and RowPress, we are motivated to leverage and revise such algorithm by incorporating two distinct vulnerable bit profiles to compare and analyze the effect of these two attack models on depleting DNN intelligence. The main contributions of this work are as follows: We perform RowHammer 8 and RowPress 7 attacks on a Samsung-manufactured DDR4 DRAM chip to profile vulnerable bit-cell locations under both attacks. We then develop a novel profile-aware bit-flip attack algorithm that utilizes these two profiles to induce precise targeted bit-flips. We conduct an extensive comparative analysis between RowHammer and RowPress on their effectiveness in depleting DNN intelligence. Eleven DNNs of different sizes and structures trained on three benchmark datasets, including both image and speech data modality, are experimented. Our results exhibit that, compared to RowHammer, RowPress only requires up to 4 ×\\times fewer bit-flips to undermine DNN performance and can induce up to 20 ×\\times more bit-flips within the same operational duration, making it a stealthier attack with noticeably higher efficacy.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: surrounding this powerful technology are gaining increasing attention, especially in safety-critical domains like healthcare and finance .
