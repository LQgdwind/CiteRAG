      "content": "Paper Title: Average-Constrained Policy Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLet π′superscript𝜋′\\pi^{\\prime} be the policy obtained via some update rule from the current policy π𝜋\\pi. Analogous to the discounted setting of a CMDP, we would like to characterize the performance difference J​(π′)−J​(π)𝐽superscript𝜋′𝐽𝜋J(\\pi^{\\prime})-J(\\pi) by an expression which depends on π𝜋\\pi and some divergence metric between the two policies.  give such a lemma. \n\nUnder the unichain assumption of the underlying Markov chain, for any stochastic policies π𝜋\\pi and π′superscript𝜋′\\pi^{\\prime}: Note that this difference depends on the stationary state distribution obtained from the new policy, dπ′subscript𝑑superscript𝜋′d_{\\pi^{\\prime}}. This is computationally impractical as we do not have access to this dπ′subscript𝑑superscript𝜋′d_{\\pi^{\\prime}}. Fortunately, by use of the following lemma we can show that if dπsubscript𝑑𝜋d_{\\pi} and dπ′subscript𝑑superscript𝜋′d_{\\pi^{\\prime}} are “close” with respect to some metric, we can approximate Eq. (4) using samples from dπsubscript𝑑𝜋d_{\\pi}. Under the unichain assumption, for any stochastic policies π𝜋\\pi and π′superscript𝜋′\\pi^{\\prime} we have: See Appendix A.1 for proof. Lemma 3.2 implies J​(π′)≈J​(π)+𝔼​[A¯π​(s,a)]𝐽superscript𝜋′𝐽𝜋absent𝔼delimited-[]superscript¯𝐴𝜋𝑠𝑎J(\\pi^{\\prime})\\approx J(\\pi)+\\underset{\\begin{subarray}{c}\\end{subarray}}{{\\mathbb{E}}}[\\widebar{A}^{\\pi}(s,a)] when dπsubscript𝑑𝜋d_{\\pi} and dπ′subscript𝑑superscript𝜋′d_{\\pi^{\\prime}} are “close”. Now that we have established this approximation, we need to study the relation of how the actual change in policies affects their corresponding stationary state distributions. For this, we turn to standard analysis of the underlying Markov chain of the CMDP. Under the ergodic assumption, we have that Pπsubscript𝑃𝜋P_{\\pi} is irreducible and hence its eigenvalues {λπ,i}i=1|S|superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝜆𝜋𝑖𝑖1𝑆\\{\\lambda_{\\pi,i}\\}_{i=1}^{|S|} are such that λπ,1=1subscript𝜆𝜋11\\lambda_{\\pi,1}=1 and λπ,i≠1<1subscript𝜆𝜋𝑖11\\lambda_{\\pi,i\\neq 1}<1. For our analysis, we define σπ=maxi≠1(1−λπ,i)−1/2\\sigma^{\\pi}=\\max_{i\\neq 1}\\,(1-\\lambda_{\\pi,i})^{-1/2}, and from [ref]21 and [ref]8, we connect {λπ,i}i=1|S|superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝜆𝜋𝑖𝑖1𝑆\\{\\lambda_{\\pi,i}\\}_{i=1}^{|S|} to the sensitivity of the stationary distributions to changes in the policy using the result below. Under the ergodic assumption, the divergence between the stationary distributions dπsubscript𝑑𝜋d_{\\pi} and dπ′subscript𝑑superscript𝜋′d_{\\pi^{\\prime}} is upper bounded as: See Appendix A.1 for proof. This bound is tighter and easier to compute than the one given by , which replaces σ⋆superscript𝜎⋆\\sigma^{\\star} by κ⋆=maxπ⁡κπsuperscript𝜅⋆subscript𝜋superscript𝜅𝜋\\kappa^{\\star}=\\max_{\\pi}\\kappa^{\\pi}, where κπsuperscript𝜅𝜋\\kappa^{\\pi} is known as Kemeny’s constant   . It is interpreted as the expected number of steps to get to any goal state, where the expectation is taken with respect to the stationary-distribution of those states. Combining the bounds in Lemma 3.2 and Lemma 3.3 gives us the following result: Under the ergodic assumption, the following bounds hold for any stochastic policies π𝜋\\pi and π′superscript𝜋′\\pi^{\\prime}: where It is interesting to compare the inequalities of Equation (7) to Equation (4). The term 𝔼​[A¯π​(s,a)]absent𝔼delimited-[]superscript¯𝐴𝜋𝑠𝑎\\underset{\\begin{subarray}{c}\\end{subarray}}{{\\mathbb{E}}}[\\widebar{A}^{\\pi}(s,a)] in Prop. 3.4 is somewhat of a surrogate approximation to J​(π′)−J​(π)𝐽superscript𝜋′𝐽𝜋J(\\pi^{\\prime})-J(\\pi), in the sense that it uses dπsubscript𝑑𝜋d_{\\pi} instead of dπ′subscript𝑑superscript𝜋′d_{\\pi^{\\prime}}. As discussed before, we do not have access to dπ′subscript𝑑superscript𝜋′d_{\\pi^{\\prime}} since the trajectories of the new policy are not available unless the policy itself is updated. This surrogate is a first order approximation to J​(π′)−J​(π)𝐽superscript𝜋′𝐽𝜋J(\\pi^{\\prime})-J(\\pi) in the parameters of π′superscript𝜋′\\pi^{\\prime} in a neighborhood around π𝜋\\pi . Hence, Eq. (7) can be viewed as bounding the worst-case approximation error. Extending this discussion to the cost function of our CMDP, similar expressions follow immediately. For any policies π′,πsuperscript𝜋′𝜋\\pi^{\\prime},\\pi, and any cost function Cisubscript𝐶𝑖C_{i}, the following bound holds: where Until now, we have been dealing with bounds given with regards to the TV divergence of the policies. However, in practice, bounds with respect to the KL divergence of policies is more commonly used [ref]27  .\nFrom Pinsker’s and Jensen’s inequalities, we have that We can thus use Eq. (9) in the bounds of Proposition 3.4 and Corollary 3.5 to make policy improvement guarantees, i.e., if we find updates such that πk+1∈arg​maxπ⁡Lπk−​(π)subscript𝜋𝑘1subscriptargmax𝜋superscriptsubscript𝐿subscript𝜋𝑘𝜋\\pi_{k+1}\\in\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{\\pi}L_{\\pi_{k}}^{-}(\\pi), then we will have monotonically increasing policies as, at iteration k𝑘k, 𝔼s∼dπk,a∼π​[A¯πk​(s,a)]=0formulae-sequencesimilar-to𝑠subscript𝑑subscript𝜋𝑘similar-to𝑎𝜋𝔼delimited-[]superscript¯𝐴subscript𝜋𝑘𝑠𝑎0\\underset{\\begin{subarray}{c}s\\sim d_{\\pi_{k}},a\\sim\\pi\\end{subarray}}{{\\mathbb{E}}}[\\widebar{A}^{\\pi_{k}}(s,a)]=0, 𝔼s∼dπk[DKL(π∥πk)[s]]=0\\underset{\\begin{subarray}{c}s\\sim d_{\\pi_{k}}\\end{subarray}}{{\\mathbb{E}}}[D_{\\text{KL}}\\left(\\pi\\middle\\|\\pi_{k}\\right)[s]]=0 for π=πk𝜋subscript𝜋𝑘\\pi=\\pi_{k}, implying that J​(πk+1)−J​(πk)≥0𝐽subscript𝜋𝑘1𝐽subscript𝜋𝑘0J(\\pi_{k+1})-J(\\pi_{k})\\geq 0. However, this sequence does not guarantee constraint satisfaction at each iteration, so we now turn to trust region methods to incorporate constraints, do policy improvement and provide safety guarantees.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: and λπ,i≠1<1subscript𝜆𝜋𝑖11\\lambda_{\\pi,i\\neq 1}<1.
