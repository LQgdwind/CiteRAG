We expect language models pre-trained on social media data to perform better on the Vent dataset. In preliminary experiments using performance on the development set, we test three pre-trained models based on the Robustly optimized BERT approach (RoBERTa) architecture and pre-training: Roberta-base , Twitter-RoBERTa [ref]22, and BERTweet-base [ref]24.\nBERTweet-base had the best performance on the development set and thus we chose to continue our work with BERTweet-base and its large version, BERTweet-large, in all our experiments. BERTweet-base and BERTweet-large are transformers model pre-trained on 850M tweets with 12 and 24 layers, respectively. BERTweet-base has a maximum sequence length of 128 (sub)words while BERTweet-large has a maximum sequence length of 512 (sub)words [ref]24.\nBefore training a classifier on the training set, we pre-train BERTweet-base (BERTweet-large) on the text of Vent posts in the training set ignoring all emotion labels. We perform task-adaptive pre-training [ref]28 by preferentially masking emotion words using eMLM.\nWe use the emotion terms in the NRC emotion lexicon   as it is one of the most extensive emotion lexicons available. We set the probability of masking emotion words to 0.5 following previous work .\nWe train with the eMLM objective for 100K steps using the AdamW optimizer , a learning rate of 5∗10−55superscript1055*10^{-5}, and a batch size of 128.\nWe name the resulting models LEIA-LM-base and LEIA-LM-large, i.e. the result of our pre-training of BERTweet-base and BERTweet-large respectively. On an NVIDIA RTX8000 GPU, pre-training takes approximately a week for the base model and a month for the large model.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: using performance on the development set, we test three pre-trained models based on the Robustly optimized BERT approach (RoBERTa) architecture and pre-training: Roberta-base , Twitter-RoBERTa [ref]22, and BERTweet-base [ref]24.\nBERTweet-base had the best performance on the development set and thus we chose to continue our work with BERTweet-base and its large version, BERTweet-large, in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
