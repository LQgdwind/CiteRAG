      "content": "Paper Title: A Framework for Supervised Heterogeneous Transfer Learning using Dynamic Distribution Adaptation and Manifold Regularization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHeTL methods deal with the setting where (1) the dimensionality and features of source and target domains are different and disjoint, respectively, (2) the distributions of the domains are different 6. To alleviate the feature discrepancy and distribution divergence, the methods either learn a domain-invariant space [ref]8  for representing the data of Dssubscript𝐷𝑠D_{s} and Dtsubscript𝐷𝑡D_{t} or learn a mapping to project such data   or explore correspondences to bridge the heterogeneity gap between Dssubscript𝐷𝑠D_{s} and Dtsubscript𝐷𝑡D_{t}  . To learn a common representation space, DSCMR [ref]8 and CLARINET  use a deep neural network based architecture for representing data of Dssubscript𝐷𝑠D_{s} and Dtsubscript𝐷𝑡D_{t}. The common representation space is used to bridge the heterogeneity gap between Dssubscript𝐷𝑠D_{s} and Dtsubscript𝐷𝑡D_{t} and to compare the records from Dssubscript𝐷𝑠D_{s} and Dtsubscript𝐷𝑡D_{t} directly by calculating similarities among the records. The similarity of the records having the same class label is higher than the similarity of the records having different class labels. Therefore, the class label of a test record can be predicted based on the similar records regardless of their feature types. Similarly, GLG 6 utilizes the geodesic flow kernel to learn the common representation space. To learn a mapping, CSFT  finds a covariance-structured representation space by building two joint regression models: (i) yis=PT​Φ​(xis)subscriptsuperscript𝑦𝑠𝑖superscript𝑃𝑇Φsubscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑠𝑖y^{s}_{i}=P^{T}\\Phi(x^{s}_{i}) and (ii) yit=PT​Φ​(xit)subscriptsuperscript𝑦𝑡𝑖superscript𝑃𝑇Φsubscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑡𝑖y^{t}_{i}=P^{T}\\Phi(x^{t}_{i}). The regression models are then used to map the data of Dssubscript𝐷𝑠D_{s} and Dtsubscript𝐷𝑡D_{t} into the shared space. After that CSFT builds a classifier by applying the SVM (or kNN) on the shared space and predicts the class value of a test record. A recent method called JMEA  that makes use of a deep neural network to map the data of Dssubscript𝐷𝑠D_{s} and Dtsubscript𝐷𝑡D_{t}. The method assumes that Dssubscript𝐷𝑠D_{s} contains huge labeled data and Dtsubscript𝐷𝑡D_{t} contains a few labeled and huge unlabeled data. It utilizes two networks for mapping: (1) from source to target, and (2) from labeled target to unlabeled target. Using the initial networks, the method obtains pseudo labels for the unlabeled data of Dtsubscript𝐷𝑡D_{t}. The method takes the confidence of the pseudo labels into consideration to determine k𝑘k pseudo labels as the final labels of the unlabeled data. It then calculates the overall errors of the networks. The method iteratively updates the networks parameters and pseudo labels simultaneously until convergence criteria are met. Like JMEA, KHDA  performs the mapping in two ways: from source to target and from labeled target to unlabeled target. However, KHDA considers a kernel matrix for the knowledge transfer instead of the neural network. Similar to JMEA and KHDA, TOHAN 7 considers two deep networks simultaneously, where the first network transforms the data of Dssubscript𝐷𝑠D_{s} into an intermediate domain and the second network focuses on learning from intermediate to target domain. Due to the transformation of data from Dssubscript𝐷𝑠D_{s} into an intermediate domain, the privacy issue of the source data is solved. Another method called STN  that builds an initial model based on the labeled data and then generates pseudo labels for the unlabeled data of Dtsubscript𝐷𝑡D_{t}. It then iteratively minimizes the distribution divergence by using the MMD and regenerates the pseudo labels. The method repeats this process until the distribution divergence is minimized. Besides, SHOT 8 builds an initial model by applying a deep neural network on Dssubscript𝐷𝑠D_{s}. The model is then adjusted for Dtsubscript𝐷𝑡D_{t} without accessing the source data. The improvement SHOT is SHOT++ 9 which calculates the confidence of predicting pseudo labels for the unlabeled data of Dtsubscript𝐷𝑡D_{t}. The highly confident pseudo labels are considered in minimizing overall error and in updating parameters of the network . To explore correspondences, TNT  uses a deep neural network to transform Dssubscript𝐷𝑠D_{s} and Dtsubscript𝐷𝑡D_{t} into a shared space and then uses the neurons of the network to form a decision forest. Since the sigmoid function is used in each decision node of the forest, the split value of the node does not represent actual value (as shown in Fig. 3). Thus, TNT may not be suitable for knowledge discovery purposes. However, it is possible to discover patterns from a recent existing method called SHDA  which makes use of a forest algorithm on Dssubscript𝐷𝑠D_{s} and Dtsubscript𝐷𝑡D_{t} to explore shared label information. Since our proposed framework, TLF is very relevant to SHDA we discuss it in detail as follows. SHDA first builds a forest (say 100 trees) by applying the Random Forest (RF)  on Dssubscript𝐷𝑠D_{s} and obtains a set of rules Rssubscript𝑅𝑠R_{s} that produces Lssubscript𝐿𝑠L_{s} leaves (see Fig. 3). For every rule from the root to a leaf node, it calculates the contribution of each attribute of Dssubscript𝐷𝑠D_{s}. The contribution of an attribute dsj∈dssubscript𝑑subscript𝑠𝑗subscript𝑑𝑠d_{s_{j}}\\in d_{s} is calculated as Wsj=∑i=1v(12)v​(i)subscript𝑊subscript𝑠𝑗subscriptsuperscript𝑣𝑖1superscript12𝑣𝑖W_{s_{j}}=\\sum^{v}_{i=1}{(\\frac{1}{2})}^{v(i)} where v𝑣v is a list contains the level numbers at which the attribute dsjsubscript𝑑subscript𝑠𝑗d_{s_{j}} is considered as the candidate split. Thus for all rules, it produces a contribution matrix Ws[Ls×ds]superscriptsubscript𝑊𝑠delimited-[]subscript𝐿𝑠subscript𝑑𝑠W_{s}^{[L_{s}\\times d_{s}]}. After that, for each leaf SHDA calculates the distributions of labels. If the size of the class attribute of Dssubscript𝐷𝑠D_{s} is Cssubscript𝐶𝑠C_{s} then SHDA produces a label distribution matrix, Qs[Ls×Cs]superscriptsubscript𝑄𝑠delimited-[]subscript𝐿𝑠subscript𝐶𝑠Q_{s}^{[L_{s}\\times C_{s}]}. SHDA then refines Qssubscript𝑄𝑠Q_{s} by removing the duplicate rows of the label distribution. For every duplicate row, the corresponding rows of the attributes contribution matrix Wssubscript𝑊𝑠W_{s} are averaged. Similar to Dssubscript𝐷𝑠D_{s}, SHDA produces the attributes contribution matrix Wt[Lt×dt]superscriptsubscript𝑊𝑡delimited-[]subscript𝐿𝑡subscript𝑑𝑡W_{t}^{[L_{t}\\times d_{t}]} and label distribution matrix, Qt[Lt×Ct]superscriptsubscript𝑄𝑡delimited-[]subscript𝐿𝑡subscript𝐶𝑡Q_{t}^{[L_{t}\\times C_{t}]} by building a forest from Dtsubscript𝐷𝑡D_{t}, where Rtsubscript𝑅𝑡R_{t} is number of rules and Ctsubscript𝐶𝑡C_{t} is the size of the class attribute of Dtsubscript𝐷𝑡D_{t}. The label distribution Ltsubscript𝐿𝑡L_{t} is also refined by removing the duplicate rows, and then the corresponding rows of the attributes contribution matrix Wtsubscript𝑊𝑡W_{t} are also averaged. Using Qssubscript𝑄𝑠Q_{s} and Qtsubscript𝑄𝑡Q_{t}, SHDA identifies the identical or similar label distributions across Dssubscript𝐷𝑠D_{s} and Dtsubscript𝐷𝑡D_{t}. Let Npsubscript𝑁𝑝N_{p} be the number of identical or similar label distributions across the source and target domains. These Npsubscript𝑁𝑝N_{p} rows of Qssubscript𝑄𝑠Q_{s} and Qtsubscript𝑄𝑡Q_{t} are called the pivots that act as the bridge between Dssubscript𝐷𝑠D_{s} and Dtsubscript𝐷𝑡D_{t}. The concept of bridging Dssubscript𝐷𝑠D_{s} and Dtsubscript𝐷𝑡D_{t} is illustrated in Fig. 2. Since the attribute contribution matrices Wssubscript𝑊𝑠W_{s} and Wtsubscript𝑊𝑡W_{t} are also refined, both of them have Npsubscript𝑁𝑝N_{p} rows. The source projection matrix Pssubscript𝑃𝑠P_{s} is obtained as : Using Pssubscript𝑃𝑠P_{s}, SHDA calculates the projected source data (Ds×Pssubscript𝐷𝑠subscript𝑃𝑠D_{s}\\times P_{s}) which are then appended to Dtsubscript𝐷𝑡D_{t} to build the final classifier. It is reported that SHDA outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods . However, since SHDA projects the whole Dssubscript𝐷𝑠D_{s} into Dtsubscript𝐷𝑡D_{t}, the final classifier may suffer from negative transfer resulting in a low classification accuracy if the number of pivots between Dssubscript𝐷𝑠D_{s} and Dtsubscript𝐷𝑡D_{t} is very low.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: and disjoint, respectively, (2) the distributions of the domains are different 6.
