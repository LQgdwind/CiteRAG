      "content": "Paper Title: Disentangling Object Motion and Occlusion for Unsupervised Multi-frame Monocular Depth\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we review self-supervised depth prediction approaches relevant to our proposed method in the following three categories: (1) single-frame, (2) multi-frame, (3) dynamic-objects-optimized. Self-supervised Single-frame Monocular Depth Prediction: Due to the limited availability of labeled depth data, self-supervised monocular depth prediction methods¬† [ref]10  [ref]1 [ref]24  have become more and more popular. Monodepth2¬†[ref]10 set a benchmark for robust monocular depth, FeatDepth¬† tried to improve the low-texture area depth prediction, and PackNet¬† explored a more effective network backbone. These self-supervised depth models generally take a single frame as input and predict the dense depth map. In the training stage, the temporally neighboring frames are projected to the current image plane by the predicted depth map. If the prediction is accurate, the re-projected images are supposed to be identical to the actual current frame image. The training is based on enforcing the re-projection photo-metric¬† consistency. These methods provided a successful paradigm to learn the depth prediction without labeled data, but they have a major and common problem with dynamic objects: the re-projection loss function assumes the environment is static, which does not hold for real-world applications. When objects are moving, even if the prediction is perfect, the re-projected reference image will still not match the target frame image. The loss signal from the dynamic object areas will generate misleading gradients to degrade the model performance. In contrast, our proposed Dynamic Object Motion Disentanglement solves this mismatch problem and achieves superior accuracy, especially in the dynamic object areas. Multi-frame Monocular Depth Prediction: The above mentioned re-projection loss only uses temporal constraints at the training loss function level. The model itself does not take any temporal information as input for reasoning, which limits its performance. One promising way to improve self-supervised monocular depth prediction is to leverage the temporal information in the input and prediction stage. Early works¬†  4  explored recurrent networks to process image sequences for monocular depth prediction. These recurrent models are computationally expensive and do not explicitly encode and reason geometric constraints in their prediction. Recently, Manydepth¬†7 and MonoRec¬†8 adopt the cost volumes from stereo matching tasks to enable the geometric-based reasoning during inference. They project the reference frame feature map to the current image plane with multiple pre-defined depth hypothesises, whose difference to the current frame feature maps are stacked to form the cost volume. Hypothesises which are closer to the actual depth are supposed to have a lower value in the cost volume, while the entire cost volume is supposed to encode the inverse probability distribution of the actual depth value. With this integrated cost volume, they achieve great overall performance improvement while preserving real-time efficiency. However, the construction of the cost volume relies on the static environment assumption as well, which leads to catastrophic failure in the dynamic object area. They either circumvent this problem¬†8 or simply use a L‚Äã1ùêø1L1 loss¬†7 to mimic the prediction of the single-frame model, which makes less severe mistakes for dynamic objects. This L‚Äã1ùêø1L1 loss alleviates but does not actually solve the problem. Our proposed Dynamic Object Motion Disentanglement, Occlusion-aware Cost Volume, and Re-projection Loss solve the mismatch and occlusion problem at both the reasoning and the training loss levels and outperform all other methods, especially in the dynamic object areas. Dynamic Objects in Self-supervised Depth Prediction: The research community has attempted to solve the above-mentioned ill-posed re-projection geometry for dynamic objects. SGDepth¬† tried to exclude the moving objects from the loss function, Li et al.¬† proposed to build a dataset only containing non-moving dynamic-category objects. The latest state-of-the-art methods¬†[ref]1     [ref]24 tried to predict pixel-level or object-level translation and incorporate it into the loss function re-projection geometry. However, these methods still have several drawbacks. First, their single frame input did not enable the model to reason from the temporal domain. Second, explicitly predicting object motions requires redundant models and increased complexity. Third, they only focused on the re-projection mismatch, the occlusion problem introduced by object motions is still unsolved. Our proposed Dynamic Object Motion Disentanglement works at both the cost volume and the loss function levels, solving the re-projection mismatch problem while enabling the geometric reasoning through temporal frames in the inference stage, without additional explicit object motion prediction. Furthermore, we propose Occlusion-aware Cost Volume and Occlusion-aware Re-projection Loss to solve the occlusion problem introduced by object motion.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: (3) dynamic-objects-optimized.
