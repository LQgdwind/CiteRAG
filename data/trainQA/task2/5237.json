We evaluate performance of neural networks trained on condensed datasets generated by several methods as baselines. Following previous works   [ref]22, we conduct experiments on both low- and high-resolution datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet [ref]5. Network Architectures. Following previous works [ref]22 [ref]55, we use a depth-3 ConvNet  on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. For ImageNet subsets, we follow IDC [ref]22 and adopt ResNetAP-10 for dataset distillation, a modified ResNet-10  by replacing strided convolution as average pooling for downsampling. Evaluation Metrics. We study several methods in terms of performance and efficiency. The performance is measured by the testing accuracy of networks trained on condensed datasets. The efficiency is measured by GPU hours required by the dataset distillation process . For a fair comparison, all GPU hours are measured on a single GPU. The training time of condensing CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet subsets is evaluated on RTX-2080 GPU and RTX-A6000 GPU, respectively. We adopt FLOPs as a metric of computational efficiency. Baselines. We compare our method with several prominent dataset condensation methods like (1) gradient-matching method including DSA  and IDC [ref]22 (2) distribution-matching including DM [ref]55 and CAFE 6 (3) parameter-matching including TM . We use the state-of-the-art dataset distillation method IDC as the strongest baseline to calculate the gap between other methods on performance and efficiency. Training Details. We adopt IDC as the backbone of our method, which is the state-of-the-art gradient-matching dataset distillation method. The outer loops and learning rate of condensed data are 400/100 and 0.01/0.1 for CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet-Subsets. We employ 5/10 pre-trained models for CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet. The number of pre-train epochs is 2/5/10 for CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet-10, and ImageNet-100. The setting of other hyperparameters follows IDC [ref]22 including the number of inner loops, batch size, and augmentation strategy.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: Datasets.
