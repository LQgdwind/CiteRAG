We used the outputs of the backward models – synth-A and synth-B – to train final forward models. We expected the quality of synth-B to be better since it was generated using the best backward model among those trained in the experiments above. Both of the models trained using the standard back-translation and the pre-training and fine-tuning approaches performed better than the models trained using the same approaches but with synth-A (see Fig.  3). Table  4 shows the performance of the models trained: without synthetic data; with synth-A and; with synth-B. The best model was obtained through pre-training and fine-tuning using authentic data and synth-B. The model out-performed the baseline forward model by a BLEU score of 7.78 (28.73 BLEU). Although using synth-A improved the performance of the forward model over the baseline (+4.92 and +5.08 BLEUs using standard back-translation and pre-training and fine-tuning respectively), the effect of the backward model self-training ensured that the quality of synth-B was superior and the model trained using this data improved the forward model further by over +2 BLEU.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: It is expected, as shown in many studies (e.g. [ref]4, ), that a better synthetic data generated using a good backward model will result in an improved forward model.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
