      "content": "Paper Title: Parametric Representation for Singing Voice Synthesis: a Comparative Evaluation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Deterministic plus Stochastic Model (DSM) was proposed in  [ref]10 to model the residual signal (obtained by inverse filtering after removing the contribution of the spectral envelope). DSM consists of two components acting in two distinct spectral sub-bands demarcated by the so-called maximum voiced frequency (usually noted FmsubscriptùêπùëöF_{m}): the deterministic contribution holds below FmsubscriptùêπùëöF_{m}, while the stochastic component holds beyond FmsubscriptùêπùëöF_{m}. These two contributions are fixed for a given speaker and are estimated by an analysis led on a speaker-dependent database. The deterministic component is defined as the first eigenvector obtained by Principal Component Analysis (PCA, [ref]26) on a dataset of pitch-synchronous residual frames. Pitch marks were defined as the Glottal Closure Instants (GCIs) determined by the SEDREAMS algorithm . The resulting first eigenvector is then resampled to the target F‚Äã0ùêπ0F0 value at synthesis time. The stochastic component is a white Gaussian noise further filtered to keep its content above FmsubscriptùêπùëöF_{m} and whose time structure is modulated by an Hilbert envelope estimated by averaging the noisy part of the same GCI-synchronous residual frames. Both deterministic and stochastic components are finally added and the resulting excitation signal filtered by the MGLSA filter with the same MGC coefficients as described in Section 2.1. In [ref]10, the maximum voiced frequency FmsubscriptùêπùëöF_{m} was fixed to a constant value. For neutral speech, this value turned out to be around 4 kHz. In singing voice, however, harmonics reach much higher frequencies and FmsubscriptùêπùëöF_{m} is fixed to 7 kHz for this study. This value comes from an inspection of various singing voice spectra. As a consequence, the input features of the DSM vocoder are the MGC coefficients for the filter and pitch (F‚Äã0ùêπ0F0); all other data (like FmsubscriptùêπùëöF_{m}, the first eigenvector or the noise envelope) being pre-estimated on the dataset of GCI-synchronous residual frames.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: The Deterministic plus Stochastic Model (DSM) was proposed in  [ref]10 to model the residual signal (obtained by inverse filtering after removing the contribution of the spectral envelope).
