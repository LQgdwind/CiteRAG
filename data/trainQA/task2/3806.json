      "content": "Paper Title: RangeUDF: Semantic Surface Reconstruction from 3D Point Clouds\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate our RangeUDF in two categories of experiments. First, we evaluate the accuracy of surface reconstruction on four point cloud datasets, including Synthetic Rooms¬†[ref]38, ScanNet¬†[ref]13, 2D-3D-S¬†[ref]1 and SceneNN¬†. Note that, only Synthetic Rooms consists of closed 3D surfaces, while the other three are real-world datasets with complex topology and noisy open surfaces. Second, we jointly evaluate both semantic segmentation and surface reconstruction of our RangeUDF on the three challenging real-world datasets, and extensively investigate how one task might benefit the other. For all datasets, we follow their original train/val/test splits. More details are in appendix. Training Data Generation:\nFor all datasets, we follow the same pre-processing steps used in NDF¬† and ConvOcc¬†[ref]38 to normalize each ground truth scene mesh into a unit cube. For each scene, we sample both on and off surface points as the query points in training. For each query point, we find its nearest face in the ground truth mesh, and then calculate the unsigned distance value. Naturally, we directly assign the semantic label of the nearest face to that query point. With the x‚Äãy‚Äãzùë•ùë¶ùëßxyz positions of all query points and their unsigned distances and semantics, we train our RangeUDF in an end-to-end fashion. Metrics:\nTo evaluate the accuracy of reconstruction, we use the standard Chamfer-L1subscriptùêø1L_{1} Distance (CD-L1subscriptùêø1L_{1}√ó10‚àí2absentsuperscript102\\times 10^{-2}, ‚Üì‚Üì\\downarrow), Chamfer-L2subscriptùêø2L_{2} Distance (CD-L2subscriptùêø2L_{2}√ó10‚àí4absentsuperscript104\\times 10^{-4}, ‚Üì‚Üì\\downarrow) and F-score (‚Üë‚Üë\\uparrow) with different thresholds (FS-Œ¥ùõø\\delta, FS-2Œ¥ùõø\\delta, FS-4Œ¥ùõø\\delta, Œ¥ùõø\\delta=0.005) as primary metrics [ref]38. To evaluate the performance of semantic segmentation, we report the standard metrics including the mean IoU (mIoU, ‚Üë‚Üë\\uparrow) and Overall Accuracy (OA, ‚Üë‚Üë\\uparrow) of all classes. Following NDF and ConvOcc, all scores are computed by comparing the point clouds sampled from predicted implicit surfaces and ground truth meshes.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: We evaluate our RangeUDF in two categories of experiments.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
