      "content": "Paper Title: Split-GCN: Effective Interactive Annotation for Segmentation of Disconnected Instance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPixel-based methods:\nMost interactive annotation models adopt a pixel-wise approach, which predicts an instance based on the pixel unit.\nEarly studies introduced the methods that scribble instance to discriminate a foreground/background and use graph-cuts to segment  . Later, Rother et al. [ref]39 proposed GrabCut, which uses graph-cuts iteratively and requests bounding boxes to the user to perform segmentation. Many studies have recently applied deep neural networks-based models and achieved exceptional performance in the interactive annotation field [ref]24  . The first study using deep architecture was deep interactive object selection 7, which converts positive/negative clicks received by the users into the Euclidean distance map to segment objects of interest. Following 7, Mahadevan et al.  improved the performance by iterating added user clicks on the errors in the current segmentation. Utilizing extreme clicks  provided by annotators as inputs, DEXTR  achieved outstanding results in the interactive annotation. However, as applying the pixel-wise method, it is challenging for most of these models to distinguish between foreground and background pixels, especially when they are similar.\n\n\nContour-based methods:\nThere are two major contour-based methods: the level sets approach and the polygon-based approach.\nThe level sets  method predicts object boundaries by continuously taking derivative on the energy function of the curve and data.\nPing Hu et al.  derived the level sets function using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Marcos et al.  and Wang et al. 6 optimized CNN based level sets in end-to-end fashion.\nOne of the earliest polygon-based annotation studies was Polygon-RNN , which sequentially predicts vertices of an instance one by one using CNN and the recurrent neural network (RNN). To solve the low-resolution accuracy from , PolygonRNN++  improved the performance by applying a gated graph sequence neural network  to increase the output resolution. Curve-GCN  used the GCN to predict all vertices at once and significantly saved the inference time than PolygonRNN++. However, Curve-GCN shows a limited prediction of disconnected objects because it keeps the connected initial topology until the final prediction. \nOur proposed model follows the polygon-based approach. We directly predict the object boundary using numerous uniformly spaced points. Especially, our approach allows an efficient prediction for the split of edge instances by transforming the initial topology.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: an instance based on the pixel unit.\nEarly studies introduced the methods that scribble instance to discriminate a foreground/background and use graph-cuts to segment  .
