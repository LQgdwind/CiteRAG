      "content": "Paper Title: Predicting Visual Overlap of Images Through Interpretable Non-Metric Box Embeddings\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany computer vision applications require learning an embedding, such that the relative distances between inputs can be predicted. For example, face recognition 9, descriptor learning     , image retrieval , person re-identification , etc. The common approach is metric learning: models are learned to encode the input data (e.g. image, patch, etc.) as a vector, such that a desirable distance between input data points is approximated by distances in corresponding vector representations. Typically, the setup uses siamese neural networks, and contrastive loss , triplet loss 9, average precision loss  and ranking loss [ref]8 is used to train the network.\nThe distances in the embedding space can be computed as Euclidean distance between two vectors, an inner product of two vectors, a cosine of the angle between two vectors, etc. However, learned embeddings can be used to estimate the order of data points, but not other types of relations, due to symmetric distance function used for similarity measure. Other relations, for example, hierarchies require asymmetric similarity measures, which is often encountered in word embeddings  [ref]26    . Some methods learn representations that are disentangled, so that they correspond to meaningful variations of the data. For example    model geometric transformations of the data in the representation space. However these representations are typically learned for a single class of objects, and it is not straight-forward how to use these embeddings for retrieval.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: approximated by distances in corresponding vector representations. Typically, the setup uses siamese neural networks, and contrastive loss , triplet loss 9, average precision loss  and ranking loss [ref]8 is used to train the network.\nThe distances in the embedding space can be computed as Euclidean distance between two vectors, an inner product of two vectors, a cosine of the angle between two\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
