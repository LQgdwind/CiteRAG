Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Reinforced Causal Explainer for Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs a prevalent technique, feature attribution  [ref]10 [ref]11 [ref]12 has shown great potential to generate post-hoc explanations for neural networks, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\nIn general, the existing attribution methods roughly fall into three groups:\n One research line    [ref]10  decomposes the model outcome to the input features via backpropagation, such that the gradient-like signals are viewed as the importance of input features.\nFor example, Gradient  uses pure gradients w.r.t. input features.\nGrad-CAM  additionally leverages the layer-wise context to improve gradients. Another research line   introduces the trainable attention or masking networks and generates attention scores on input features.\nThe networks are trained to approximate the decision boundary of the model via the attentive or masked features.\nFor example, L2X  learns to generate feature masks, with the aim of maximizing the mutual information between the masked features and the target predictions. Some works   perform the input perturbations and monitor the changes on model behaviors (e.g., prediction, loss), so as to reveal the input-outcome relationships.\nThe basic idea is that the model outcomes are highly likely to significantly change if essential features are occluded.\nFor example, CXPlain  learns the marginal effect of a feature by occluding it.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: As a prevalent technique, feature attribution  [ref]10 [ref]11 [ref]12 has shown great potential to generate post-hoc explanations for neural networks, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\nIn general, the existing attribution methods\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
