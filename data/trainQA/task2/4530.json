      "content": "Paper Title: Towards a General Pre-training Framework for Adaptive Learning in MOOCs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAdaptive learning aims to address the unique needs of self-paced students by delivering custom learning experiences instead of one-size-fits-all learning patterns . With optimal learning path planning at its core, adaptive learning consists of multiple components, such as modeling learning resources, estimating students’ mastery of skills, and making personalized learning recommendations, highly relevant to pedagogy theory, educational data mining, and learning analytics . It is widely accepted that adaptive learning can be categorized into three research directions . Adaptive Content, the expert module, focuses on the modeling, evaluation, and analysis of learning resources, whose typical tasks include education knowledge modeling [ref]2  and automatic evaluation of materials . It typically adopts the methods of natural language processing , data mining [ref]3 and knowledge modeling 4 for resource understanding and comparison. Adaptive Assessment, the student module, comprises both micro and macro levels, with the former focusing on students’ fine-grained behaviors on specific videos or questions and the latter on modeling the long-term traits. Micro-level attempts include cognitive modeling  and knowledge tracing  , which entails analyzing students’ problem-solving records, while macro-level tasks apply to steady tendency prediction 0  . Adaptive Sequence, the instruction module, is a crucial topic in adaptive learning. It requires simultaneous modeling of learning resources and students and fully considering the students’ historical performance, knowledge states, and candidates’ content to recommend proper learning resources  [ref]6. Existing studies on this topic tend to relate it to sequence recommendation  or knowledge structure acquisition . With the prosperity of deep learning, neural networks are widely employed in diverse adaptive learning approaches. Despite their significant improvement over traditional statistical methods, these efforts still rely on expert-annotated coarse-grained data, which makes them suffer from low transferability and insufficient capacity. Recently, researchers have summarized the existing methods and identified that the urgent future of adaptive learning research is to construct a systematical adaptive learning framework 6, which inspires a few pioneers to explore how to integrate different components of adaptive learning [ref]6  to build general adaptive systems based on pedagogy insights .\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: three research directions . Adaptive Content, the expert module, focuses on the modeling, evaluation, and analysis of learning resources, whose typical tasks include education knowledge modeling [ref]2  and automatic evaluation of materials . It typically adopts the methods of natural language processing , data mining [ref]3 and knowledge modeling 4 for resource understanding and comparison.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
