Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: UET-Headpose: A sensor-based top-view head pose dataset\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAfter collection, the UET-Headpose dataset includes 12.84812.84812.848 images obtained from 999 people with the distribution of yaw angles as shown in Fig. 3. So, the UET-Headpose dataset will be divided into seven people for training with 10.84810.84810.848 images and two people for evaluation with 2.0002.0002.000 images. These images will be cropped to the face on a scale increased by 40%percent4040\\% vertically and 60%percent6060\\% horizontally compared to the face. Label files also have additional coordinate information (x-min, y-min, x-max, y-max) so that the face can be accurately cut from the cropped image. The UET-Headpose dataset had a uniform yaw angle distribution for all directions from [−179,179]179179[-179,179]. The dataset is obtained by having the annotated people rotated all yaw directions when collecting the dataset. So the dataset will make it possible for the model to learn all yaw angles within a 360∘superscript360360^{\\circ} range. Fig.3 illustrates a more extensive coverage of the yaw angle of our proposed dataset, the yaw angle of our proposed dataset covers a wider range than 300W-LP and also fixes the drawbacks of the CMU-Headpose dataset. Model FSANet-Wide FSA-Net  model was introduced by Yang et al. at the 2019 CVPR conference. This model has the advantage of being a very lightweight model with only 1.21.21.2 million parameters for combining three sub-models, which gives good results when the average error with each angle is only 4∘superscript44^{\\circ}. Therefore, the baseline will be based on the FSA-Net  model, doing experiments and improving it. Original FSANet  model achieves good results in 300W-LP [ref]5, as described above, the 300W-LP [ref]5 dataset has yaw pose in a range [−99,99]9999[-99,99]. So this model results in the yaw pose range in [−99,99]9999[-99,99]. We will improve the SSR module in FSANet  and fusion mechanism by expand range of output model in a full-range yaw pose [−179,179]179179[-179,179].\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: each angle is only 4∘superscript44^{\\circ}.
