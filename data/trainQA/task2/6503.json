      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Algorithms for \\ESMTon Near-Convex Terminal Sets\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe \\ESMTproblem asks for a network of minimum total length interconnecting a given finite set 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} of n𝑛n points in the Euclidean plane. Formally, we define the problem as follows, taken from : \n\n\n\n\n\\ESMT\n\n\nInput: A set 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} of n𝑛n points in the Euclidean plane\nQuestion: Find a connected plane graph 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} such that 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} is a subset of the vertex set V​(𝒯)𝑉𝒯V(\\mathcal{T}), and for the edge set E​(𝒯)𝐸𝒯E(\\mathcal{T}), Σe∈E​(𝒯)​e¯subscriptΣ𝑒𝐸𝒯¯𝑒\\Sigma_{e\\in E(\\mathcal{T})}\\overline{e} is minimized over all connected plane graphs with 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} as a vertex subset.\n\n Note that the metric being considered is the Euclidean metric, and for any edge e∈E​(𝒯)𝑒𝐸𝒯e\\in E(\\mathcal{T}), e¯¯𝑒\\overline{e} denotes the Euclidean length of the edge. Here, the input set 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} of points is often called a set of terminals, the points in 𝒮=V​(𝒯)∖𝒫𝒮𝑉𝒯𝒫\\mathcal{S}=V(\\mathcal{T})\\setminus\\mathcal{P} are called Steiner points. A solution graph 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} is referred to as a Euclidean Steiner minimal tree, or simply an SMT. The \\ESMTproblem is a classic problem in the field of Computational Geometry. The origin of the problem dates back to Fermat (1601-1665) who proposed the problem of finding a point in the plane such that the sum of its distance from three given points is minimized. This is equivalent to finding the location of the Steiner point when given three terminals as input. Torricelli proposed a geometric solution to this special case of 3 terminal points. The idea was to construct equilateral triangles outside on all three sides of the triangle formed by the terminals, and draw their circumcircles. The three circles meet at a single point, which is our required Steiner point. This point came to be known as the Torricelli point. When one of the angles in the triangle is at least 120∘superscript120120^{\\circ}, the minimizing point coincides with the obtuse angle vertex of the triangle. In this case, the Torricelli point lies outside the triangle and no longer minimizes the sum of distances from the vertices. However, when vertices of polygons with more than 3 sides are considered as a set of terminals, a solution to the Fermat problem does not in general lead to a solution to the \\ESMTproblem. For a more detailed survey on the history of the problem, please refer to  [ref]9. For convenience, we refer to the \\ESMTproblem as ESMT. ESMT is NP-hard. In , Garey et al. prove a discrete version of the problem (Discrete ESMT) to be strongly NP-complete via a reduction from the Exact Cover by 3-Sets (X3C) problem. Although it is not known if the ESMT problem is in NP, it is at least as hard as any NP-complete problem. So, we do not expect a polynomial time algorithm for it. A recursive method using only Euclidean constructions was given by Melzak in  for constructing all the Steiner minimal trees for any set of n𝑛n points in the plane by constructing full Steiner trees of subsets of the points. Full Steiner trees are interconnecting trees having the maximum number of newly introduced points (Steiner points) where all internal junctions are of degree 333. Hwang improved the running time of Melzak’s original exponential algorithm for full Steiner tree construction to linear time in . Using this, we can construct an Euclidean Steiner minimal tree in 2𝒪​(n​log⁡n)superscript2𝒪𝑛𝑛2^{\\mathcal{O}(n\\log n)} time for any set of n𝑛n points. This was the first algorithm for \\ESMT. The problem is known to be NP-hard even if all the terminals lie on two parallel straight lines, or on a bent line segment where the bend has an angle of less than 120∘superscript120120^{\\circ} . Since the above sets of terminals all lie on the boundary of a convex polygon (or, are in convex position), this shows that ESMT is NP-hard when restricted to a set of points that are in weakly convex position. Although the ESMT problem is NP-hard, there are certain arrangements of points in the plane for which the Euclidean Steiner minimal tree can be computed efficiently, say in polynomial time. One such arrangement is placing the points on the vertices of a regular polygon. This case was solved by Du et al. . Their work gives exact topologies of the Euclidean Steiner minimal trees. Weng et al.  generalized the problem by incorporating the centre point of the regular polygon as part of the terminal set, along with the vertices. This case was also found to be polynomial time solvable. Tractability in the form of approximation algorithms for ESMT has been extensively studied. It was proved in  that a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) cannot exist for this problem unless P=NPPNP\\mbox{P}=\\mbox{NP}. However, we do have an FPTAS when the terminals are in convex position . Arora’s celebrated polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for the ESMT and other related problems is described in . Around the same time, Rao and Smith gave an efficient polynomial time approximation scheme (EPTAS) in 2. In recent years, an EPTAS with an improved running time was designed by Kisfaludi-Bak et al. 0.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: as a set of terminals, a solution to the Fermat problem does not in general lead to a solution to the \\ESMTproblem.
