      "content": "Paper Title: Influential Simplices Mining via Simplicial Convolutional Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInfluential nodes, also referred to as vital nodes, are special nodes within a network that exert a greater influence on the structure and function compared to other nodes.\nThey play a crucial role in various network tasks such as information spreading , synchronization, and control .\nNotably, a small fraction of vital nodes can influence a large number of nodes within the entire network [ref]11.\nTo identify these vital nodes, different methods have been developed, including structural centralities, iterative refinement centralities, and deep-learning-based approaches. Structural centrality measures the importance of nodes in terms of a particular topology in a network.\nDegree centrality, for instance, calculates the number of neighbors of node visubscriptùë£ùëñv_{i}, which is widely used due to its straightforward interpretation and computational efficiency.\nNeighbor degree, an extension of degree centrality, quantifies the average degree of a node‚Äôs neighbors.\nOther metrics such as H-index  and coreness centrality  also consider the degree of a node‚Äôs neighbors when assessing its importance. Closeness centrality  and betweenness centrality  are computed by evaluating the shortest paths between nodes. Iterative refinement centralities take into account both the topological structure of nodes and the influence of their neighbors.\nEigenvector centrality  assigns centrality scores to nodes based on the sum of the centralities of their connected nodes.\nPageRank , a well-known variant of eigenvector centrality, measures the importance of web pages by considering the quantity and quality of the pages that link to them. A brief introduction to deep-learning-based methods is deferred to the next section.\nAdditionally, some algorithms cannot be classified as above, other algorithms also include the entanglement models  , and the random walk-based gravity model .\nA more detailed overview can be found in the following reference [ref]11.\nIn Table LABEL:index_intro, we list some widely used centrality metrics along with their formulas and explanations, and some of them serve as baselines for comparison with our model.\nHowever, it is worth noting that these methods solely focus on assessing the influence of individual nodes in isolation and typically overlook the group interactions between node sets. Furthermore, we find that influential nodes and influential simplices do not exhibit a one-to-one correspondence, highlighting the need for specialized algorithms for influential simplices mining tasks.\nCurrently, there are few metrics specifically designed for identifying influential simplices.\nOne such metric is the generalized degree kd,m‚Äã(Œ±)subscriptùëòùëëùëöùõºk_{d,m}(\\alpha) [ref]10, a direct extension of the degree concept employed in pairwise networks, which measures the number of dùëëd-dimensional simplices incident to the mùëöm-simplex Œ±ùõº\\alpha.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: role in various network tasks such as information spreading , synchronization, and control .\nNotably, a small fraction of vital nodes can influence a large number of nodes within the entire network [ref]11.\nTo identify these vital nodes, different methods have been developed, including structural centralities, iterative refinement centralities, and deep-learning-based approaches.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
