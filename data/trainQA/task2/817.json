This work has demonstrated a time unrolled variable DBB scheme (Section III) implemented in a reuse optimized accelerator (Section IV).\nHere, we illustrate the benefit of these two contributions by comparing our work with previously published INT8 CNN inference accelerators in Table V.\nThe proposed designs shown include the nominal 4 TOPS design in Table IV at multiple model sparsity points, as well as a 65nm version of the same design to allow a broader comparison with results in the older technology. We first evaluate our results specifically against the state-of-the-art sparse CNN accelerator work, Laconic [ref]32.\nThis paper includes a thorough survey against the latest work, including: DaDianNao++ [ref]8, Eyeriss , SCNN , Pragmatic , and BitFusion , which convincingly demonstrates it is the current state-of-the-art.\nTherefore, this is a useful comparison point at the same INT8 precision, 1 GHz clock frequency and comparable 15nm technology.\nThe energy efficiency result reported for Laconic is just under 2 TOPS/W energy efficiency.\nOur nominal 4 TOPS VDBB design (Table IV) achieves 16.8 TOPS/W at 50% model sparsity, which is more than 8×\\times higher. The only other DBB accelerator is Kang , which uses a fixed 2/8282/8 DBB implemented in a dot-product microarchitecture, and reports 1.65 TOPS/W in 65nm technology for 75% sparse DBB.\nOur design implements variable DBB in a reuse optimized accelerator and in 65nm achieves 2.8 TOPS/W at the same 75% model sparsity, which is 70% higher.\nWe also note that such a high fixed DBB sparsity would not be practical for compact models like MobileNet, ResNet on the ImageNet dataset, based on our results (Table I). The only other sparse systolic array design we are aware of is SMT-SA .\nTo compare against this work, which was reported in 45nm, we implemented the same design ourselves, which achieves 7.4 TOPS/W compared to the proposed design at 21.9 for the same sparsity.\nThis is largely due to the cost of the FIFOs required in the array, and the advantages of DBB vs random weight sparsity (Section II). Finally, SCNN  and Eyeriss v2  are also included in the comparison (Table V).\nIn summary, we found that our work outperforms: 1) Laconic [ref]32, the latest sparse accelerator, 2) SMT-SA , the only other sparse systolic array, and 3) Kang , the only other DBB accelerator.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: of the same design to allow a broader comparison with results in the older technology.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
