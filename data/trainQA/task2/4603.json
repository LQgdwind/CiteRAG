      "content": "Paper Title: Parameterized Complexity of Binary CSP: Vertex Cover, Treedepth, and Related Parameters\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Binary Constraint Satisfaction Problem (BinCSP, for short) is a fundamental problem defined as follows. We are given an undirected graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E), called the primal or the Gaifman graph, where V𝑉V is a set of variables, each with a prescribed domain of possible values. Further, each edge u​v𝑢𝑣uv of G𝐺G corresponds to a binary constraint that restricts the possible pairs of values that can be assigned to u𝑢u and v𝑣v. The task is to decide whether every variable can be mapped to a value from its domain so that all the constraints are satisfied. Due to immense modeling power, constraint satisfaction problems are of great importance in multiple applications, and the theoretical study of their complexity is a field on its own. In this work we are interested in parameterized algorithms for BinCSP, with a particular focus on structural parameters of the Gaifman graph. An example of such a result is a classic observation, usually attributed to Freuder : using dynamic programming, BinCSP can be solved in time nk+𝒪​(1)superscript𝑛𝑘𝒪1n^{k+{\\mathcal{O}}(1)}, where n𝑛n is the maximum size of a domain and k𝑘k is the treewidth of the Gaifman graph. In the language of parameterized complexity, this means that BinCSP parameterized by treewidth is slice-wise polynomial, or in the complexity class XPXP\\mathrm{XP}. The class XPXP\\mathrm{XP} is very general and just placing BinCSP parameterized by treewidth within XPXP\\mathrm{XP} does not provide much insight into the actual complexity of the problem. A more detailed study of the parameterizations of BinCSP by pathwidth and by treewidth was recently performed by Bodlaender, Groenland, Nederlof, and Swennenhuis in , and by Bodlaender, Groenland, Jacob, Pilipczuk, and Pilipczuk in . In particular, as shown in , BinCSP parameterized by pathwidth is complete for XNLPXNLP\\mathrm{XNLP}: the class of all parameterized problems that can be solved by a nondeterministic Turing machine using f​(k)​log⁡n𝑓𝑘𝑛f(k)\\log n space and f​(k)⋅n𝒪​(1)⋅𝑓𝑘superscript𝑛𝒪1f(k)\\cdot n^{{\\mathcal{O}}(1)} time, where k𝑘k is the parameter and f𝑓f is a computable function. A “tree variant” of XNLPXNLP\\mathrm{XNLP}, called XALPXALP\\mathrm{XALP}, was studied in ; it can be defined using the same model of a Turing machine, except that the machine additionally has access to a stack of unbounded size that can be manipulated by pushing and popping. As proved in , BinCSP parameterized by treewidth is complete for XALPXALP\\mathrm{XALP}. All in all, the recent works [ref]8 0    present a variety of problems on graphs with linear or tree-like structure that are complete for XNLPXNLP\\mathrm{XNLP} and XALPXALP\\mathrm{XALP}, respectively. This is an evidence that XNLPXNLP\\mathrm{XNLP} and XALPXALP\\mathrm{XALP} capture certain fundamental varieties of computational problems: those amenable to linearly and tree-structured dynamic programming with state space of slice-wise polynomial size. The contemporary research in parameterized algorithms features many more structural parameters of graphs, besides treewidth and pathwidth. In this work we explore the complexity of BinCSP parameterized by the following parameters of the Gaifman graph: (1) the vertex cover number, (2) the treedepth, and (3) a selection of related modulator-based parameters lying between the vertex cover number and the treedepth. The WW\\mathrm{W}-hierarchy was introduced around thirty years ago\nin the work by Downey and Fellows that founded the field of parameterized\nalgorithms and complexity. In this hierarchy, we have a collection of classes,\nincluding W​⊆W​⊆…⊆W​[SAT]⊆W​[P]Wdelimited-[]1Wdelimited-[]2…Wdelimited-[]SATWdelimited-[]P\\mathrm{W}\\subseteq\\mathrm{W}\\subseteq\\ldots\\subseteq\\mathrm{W}[\\mathrm{SAT}]\\subseteq\\mathrm{W}[\\mathrm{P}]; see 0 1  for an overview and for bibliographic references.\nA large variety of problems are known to be complete (under fpt reductions) for W​Wdelimited-[]1\\mathrm{W} and for W​Wdelimited-[]2\\mathrm{W}. However, for classes W​[t]Wdelimited-[]𝑡\\mathrm{W}[t] with\nt⩾3𝑡3t\\geqslant 3, there is so far only a handful of examples\nof natural problems known to be complete   [ref]7 4 5 . Our first contribution is to give new examples of complete problems for W​[t]Wdelimited-[]𝑡\\mathrm{W}[t] for all odd t⩾3𝑡3t\\geqslant 3. Our first example concerns BinCSP parameterized by the vertex cover number: the minimum size of a vertex cover in the Gaifman graph. BinCSP parameterized by the vertex cover number of the Gaifman graph is complete\nfor the class W​Wdelimited-[]3\\mathrm{W}. It was known that BinCSP parameterized by the vertex cover number is W​Wdelimited-[]1\\mathrm{W}-hard 0 . The W​Wdelimited-[]3\\mathrm{W}-completeness is surprising, not only due to the small number of examples of natural W​Wdelimited-[]3\\mathrm{W}-complete problems, but also because many problems appear\nto be fixed-parameter tractable or even have a kernel of polynomial size, when the vertex cover number is used as the parameter (e.g., 9 0 2 5). For a graph G𝐺G and a graph class 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}, a modulator to 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} in G𝐺G is a set of vertices W𝑊W such that G−W∈𝒞𝐺𝑊𝒞G-W\\in\\mathcal{C}. For instance, vertex covers are modulators to the class of edgeless graphs. A feedback vertex set is another type of a\nmodulator, now to graphs without cycles, i.e., to forests. The feedback vertex number of a graph G𝐺G is the minimum size of a feedback vertex set in G𝐺G. We prove that the parameterization by the feedback vertex number yields a much harder problem. BinCSP parameterized by the feedback vertex number of the Gaifman graph is W​[SAT]Wdelimited-[]SAT\\mathrm{W[SAT]}-hard and in W​[P]Wdelimited-[]P\\mathrm{W[P]}. Finally, with similar techniques, we obtain the following completeness results for W​[t]Wdelimited-[]𝑡\\mathrm{W}[t] for all odd t⩾3𝑡3t\\geqslant 3. Here, treedepth is a structural parameter measuring the “depth” of a graph, we will expand on it later on. For each integer d⩾1𝑑1d\\geqslant 1,\nBinCSP is complete for W​[2​d+1]Wdelimited-[]2𝑑1\\mathrm{W}[2d+1] when parameterized by the minimum size of a modulator to a graph of treedepth at most d𝑑d, and when parameterized by the minimum size of a modulator to a forest of depth at most d𝑑d. Interestingly, each increase of the depth of the trees by one corresponds to an increase in the W-hierarchy by two levels: this\nis because one level of depth in the tree or forest corresponds to a conjunction (looking at all children of a node) with a\ndisjunction (the choice of a value).\nTheorem 1.3 can be seen as an interpolation between Theorems 1.1 and 1.2: by allowing the forest to have larger and larger depth, we obtain harder and harder parameterized problems. This yields a family of natural complete problems for the odd levels of the WW\\mathrm{W}-hierarchy. Theorem 1.1 is proved in Section 3, and Theorems 1.2 and 1.3 are proved in Section 4. As we argued, the classes XNLPXNLP\\mathrm{XNLP} and XALPXALP\\mathrm{XALP} can be seen as the “natural home” for BinCSP parameterized by pathwidth and treewidth respectively, and for many other problems on “path-like” or “tree-like” graphs. We introduce a new parameterized complexity class XSLPXSLP\\mathrm{XSLP} which is the “natural home” for the parameter treedepth instead, reflecting “shallow” graphs (this is what the letter S stands for). The treedepth of a graph G𝐺G is the minimum depth of a rooted forest F𝐹F on the same vertex set as G𝐺G such that every edge of G𝐺G connects a vertex with its ancestor in F𝐹F; thus, it is a measure of shallowness of a graph. While treedepth is never smaller than pathwidth, it can be arbitrarily large even on graphs of bounded pathwidth: a path on n𝑛n vertices has pathwidth 111 and treedepth ⌈log2⁡(n+1)⌉subscript2𝑛1\\lceil\\log_{2}(n+1)\\rceil. Despite being relatively lesser known than treewidth or pathwidth, treedepth appears naturally in many seemingly disconnected areas. For instance, it features a prominent role in the theory of Sparsity (see [48, Chapters 6 and 7] for an overview), has interesting combinatorics of its own (see e.g. 6 9 2 ), corresponds to important dividing lines in finite model theory (see e.g. 5 ), and governs the parameterized complexity of block-structured integer programming (see 4 for an overview). More importantly for us, a line of work 4      uncovered that for many classic problems, on graphs of low treedepth one can design fixed-parameter algorithms that are both time- and space-efficient, which is conjectured not to be possible for the pathwidth or treewidth parameterizations . This makes treedepth a prime candidate for a parameter that can be interesting from the point of view of BinCSP. And so, we define two complexity classes: XSLPXSLP\\mathrm{XSLP} consists of all parameterized problems that can be reduced to BinCSP parameterized by treedepth in parameterized logspace (that is, in deterministic space f​(k)+𝒪​(log⁡n)𝑓𝑘𝒪𝑛f(k)+{\\mathcal{O}}(\\log n) for a computable f𝑓f), while XSLP+superscriptXSLP\\mathrm{XSLP}^{+} has the same definition, except we consider fpt reductions. This distinction is of technical nature: on one hand we use parameterized logspace reductions to match the definitions of XALPXALP\\mathrm{XALP} and XNLPXNLP\\mathrm{XNLP} and retain the inclusion XSLP⊆XNLP⊆XALPXSLPXNLPXALP\\mathrm{XSLP}\\subseteq\\mathrm{XNLP}\\subseteq\\mathrm{XALP}, and on the other hand we would like to compare XSLPXSLP\\mathrm{XSLP} with the WW\\mathrm{W}-hierarchy, which requires closure under fpt reductions. In fact, XSLP+⊇W​[t]Wdelimited-[]𝑡superscriptXSLP\\mathrm{XSLP}^{+}\\supseteq\\mathrm{W}[t] for every integer t𝑡t (this will follows from Proposition 1.4). We prove two alternative characterizations of XSLPXSLP\\mathrm{XSLP}. The first one is through a machine model: we prove that XSLPXSLP\\mathrm{XSLP} can be equivalently defined as problems that can be solved by an alternating Turing machine with the following resource bounds: (1) f​(k)​log⁡n𝑓𝑘𝑛f(k)\\log n bits of nondeterminism, (2) f​(k)+𝒪​(log⁡n)𝑓𝑘𝒪𝑛f(k)+{\\mathcal{O}}(\\log n) bits of conondeterminism, (3) alternation at most f​(k)𝑓𝑘f(k), and (4) working space f​(k)+𝒪​(log⁡n)𝑓𝑘𝒪𝑛f(k)+{\\mathcal{O}}(\\log n) plus a read-once stack of size f​(k)​log⁡n𝑓𝑘𝑛f(k)\\log n that can be only pushed upon and read only at the end of the computation. See Theorem 6.1 in Section 6.1 for a formal statement. This reflects the characterization of XALPXALP\\mathrm{XALP} through alternating Turing machines with different bounds on conondeterminism and the size of a computation tree, see [11, Theorem 1]. The main step in the proof of our machine characterization of XSLPXSLP\\mathrm{XSLP} is a regularization lemma for the considered machine model, allowing us to assume that the computation tree has always a very concrete shape. Interestingly, this step crucially uses the existence of fpt-sized universal trees, a tool fundamentally underlying the recent advances in the complexity of parity games. While universal trees can be seen only implicitly in the breakthrough work of Calude et al. 3, their central role in the approach was exposed in subsequent works 8 . The second characterization is through model-checking first-order logic, and is inspired by the definition of the AA\\mathrm{A}-hierarchy; see [31, Chapter 8]. In essence, we provide a complete problem for XSLPXSLP\\mathrm{XSLP}, which amounts to model-checking first-order sentences in which universal quantification must follow a root-to-leaf path in a rooted forest present in the structure. Details and formal statements can be found in Section 6.2. Next, we “project” the class XSLPXSLP\\mathrm{XSLP} closer to lower levels of the WW\\mathrm{W}-hierarchy, thus obtaining a new hierarchy of parameterized classes sandwiched between the WW\\mathrm{W}-hierarchy and the AA\\mathrm{A}-hierarchy. For this, we introduce the following parameter. The 111-fold vertex cover number of a graph G𝐺G is simply the number of vertices of G𝐺G. Inductively, for d⩾2𝑑2d\\geqslant 2, the d𝑑d-fold vertex cover number is the smallest integer k𝑘k with the following property: there is a subset of vertices U⊆V​(G)𝑈𝑉𝐺U\\subseteq V(G) with |U|⩽k𝑈𝑘|U|\\leqslant k such that every connected component of G−U𝐺𝑈G-U has (d−1)𝑑1(d-1)-fold vertex cover number at most k𝑘k.\nAlternatively, we can also define the parameter using a “fattened” variant of elimination trees (the decomposition notion underlying treedepth). Namely, G𝐺G has d𝑑d-fold vertex cover number at most k𝑘k if and only if there is a rooted tree T𝑇T of depth at most d𝑑d, and a vertex partition {Vt:t∈V​(T)}conditional-setsubscript𝑉𝑡𝑡𝑉𝑇\\{V_{t}\\colon t\\in V(T)\\} of V​(G)𝑉𝐺V(G) such that |Vt|⩽ksubscript𝑉𝑡𝑘|V_{t}|\\leqslant k for all t∈V​(T)𝑡𝑉𝑇t\\in V(T), and edges in G𝐺G between vertices of Vssubscript𝑉𝑠V_{s} and Vtsubscript𝑉𝑡V_{t} are only allowed when s𝑠s and t𝑡t are equal or are in an ancestor-descendant relationship in T𝑇T. We now define the parameterized complexity class111We remark that there is an already existing concept called the SS\\mathrm{S}-hierarchy, related to subexponential parameterized algorithms; see [31, Definition 16.9]. Since we are not aware of any subsequent work on the structure of this hierarchy, we took the liberty of using the same naming scheme for our classes. S​[2​d−1]Sdelimited-[]2𝑑1\\mathrm{S}[2d-1] as the fpt-closure of BinCSP parameterized by the d𝑑d-fold vertex cover number, for all integers d⩾1𝑑1d\\geqslant 1. The following result relates the introduced classes to the WW\\mathrm{W}-hierarchy, the AA\\mathrm{A}-hierarchy, and the class XSLP+superscriptXSLP\\mathrm{XSLP}^{+}. For every integer d⩾1𝑑1d\\geqslant 1,\nwe have W​[2​d−1]⊆S​[2​d−1]⊆A​[2​d−1]Wdelimited-[]2𝑑1Sdelimited-[]2𝑑1Adelimited-[]2𝑑1\\mathrm{W}[2d-1]\\subseteq\\mathrm{S}[2d-1]\\subseteq\\mathrm{A}[2d-1] and\nS​[2​d−1]⊆XSLP+Sdelimited-[]2𝑑1superscriptXSLP\\mathrm{S}[2d-1]\\subseteq\\mathrm{XSLP}^{+}. The proof is straightforward and is given in Section 7. While the definition of d𝑑d-fold vertex cover seems not to have been discussed explicitly in the literature, the idea of alternating deletions of batches of vertices and splitting into connected components is not entirely new, as similar parameters that interpolate between vertex cover and treedepth have previously been studied. For example, 222-fold vertex cover is within a multiplicative factor of two of vertex integrity, a parameter that was introduced by Barefoot, Entringer and Swart  in 1987 (see  for a survey). In the context of block-structure integer programs, the fracture number 3 can be seen as an analogue of 222-fold vertex cover, while the concept of topological height 4 serves a role similar to that of d𝑑d in the definition of d𝑑d-fold vertex cover. The classic\nList Coloring problem can be interpreted as the special case of BinCSP where every constraint just stipulates that the values assigned to adjacent variables are different from each other.\nTherefore, a hardness result for List Coloring implies one for BinCSP.\nVice versa, we can attempt to turn an instance of BinCSP on graph G𝐺G into an instance of List Coloring by adding, for each edge u​v𝑢𝑣uv in G𝐺G and each forbidden pair of values (a,b)𝑎𝑏(a,b), a vertex to G𝐺G adjacent to u𝑢u and v𝑣v with color list {a,b}𝑎𝑏\\{a,b\\}. This transformation does not significantly affect graph parameters such as treedepth, treewidth or pathwidth, so hardness and completeness results of BinCSP may also be inherited to List Coloring. However, the transformation may make dramatic changes to other parameters such as vertex cover and vertex modulator to a graph of treedepth at most d𝑑d, where we can only easily deduce W​[2​d−1]Wdelimited-[]2𝑑1\\mathrm{W}[2d-1]-hardness from our W​[2​d+1]Wdelimited-[]2𝑑1\\mathrm{W}[2d+1]-hardness results. In fact, we separate the two problems with the following result, proved in Section 5. List Coloring is in W​Wdelimited-[]2\\mathrm{W} when parameterized by the vertex cover number and in W​[2​d]Wdelimited-[]2𝑑\\mathrm{W}[2d] when parameterized by the size of a modulator to a treedepth-d𝑑d graph. We believe that due to its robustness, BinCSP better suited to measure the complexity of parameters than List Coloring is. This is also witnessed by the (nearly) tight completeness results presented in Theorems 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3. Table 1 below presents a comparison of the parameterized complexity landscapes of BinCSP and of List Coloring under various structural parameterizations. We postpone the discussion of this table to Section 8.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: to a stack of unbounded size that can be manipulated by pushing and popping.
