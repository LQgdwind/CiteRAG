      "content": "Paper Title: PrivHAR: Recognizing Human Actions From Privacy-preserving Lens\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe are at the beginning of a new era of smart systems. From health care to video games, computer vision applications have provided successful solutions to real-world problems   . For decades, cameras have been engineered to imitate the human vision system, and machine learning algorithms are always constrained to be optimized using high-quality images as inputs. However, the abundance and growing uses of smart devices are also causing a social dilemma: we want intelligent systems (e.g., in our home) to recognize relevant events and assist us in our activities, but we also want to ensure they protect our privacy. There have been some previous studies dealing with such a social dilemma. For instance, some early works rely on hand-crafted strategies, e.g., pixelation [ref]52, blurring 3, face/object replacement [ref]7, and person de-identification , to degrade sensitive information. More recently, Ren et al. [ref]40 proposed an adversarial training strategy to learn to anonymize faces in videos and then perform activity detection. Similarly, using adversarial training,   proposed to optimize privacy attributes and recognition performance. However, all these methods rely on software-level processing of original high-resolution videos, which may already contain privacy-sensitive data. Hence, there is a possibility of these original videos being snatched by an attacker. Instead of developing new algorithms or designing software-level solutions that still rely on high-resolution images and videos as input, we believe that the privacy-preserving problem in computer vision should be addressed directly within the camera hardware, i.e., sensible visual data should be protected before the images are acquired in the sensor. Currently, few works have been developed in this direction. For instance,   proposed to use low-resolution cameras to create privacy-preserving anonymized videos and perform human action recognition. Also, Pittaluga et al. 7 introduced a defocusing lens to provide a certain level of privacy over a working region. On the other hand, several works used depth cameras to protect privacy and perform human action recognition  . These approaches rely on a fixed optical system; thus, their main contribution included designing an algorithm for a specific input type. More recently, 7 proposed to jointly design the lens of a camera and optimize a deep neural network to achieve two goals: privacy protection and human pose estimation. However, the formulation of the optimization in this work poses different problems: the privacy-preserving loss is not bounded as it maximizes an ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2} term to enforce degradation, which may cause instability in the optimization; authors only used one human pose estimation model (OpenPose ) in all experiments and its not clear if the method works with other pose estimators. More importantly, to test and measure privacy, authors performed adversarial attacks after training the network; hence such attacks were not considered in the lens design. In this paper, we address the problem of privacy-preserving human action recognition and propose a novel adversarial framework to provide robust privacy protection along the computer vision pipeline, see Fig. 1. We adopt the idea of end-to-end optimization of the camera lens and vision task 7 1  and propose an optimization scheme that: (1) Incorporates adversarial defense objectives into the learning process across a diversity of canonical privacy categories, including face, skin color, gender, relationship, and nudity detection. (2) Encourages distortions in the videos without compromising the training stability by including the structural similarity index (SSIM) 8 in our optimization loss. (3) To further preserve the temporal information in the distorted videos, we use temporal similarity matrices (TSM) and constrain the structure of the temporal embeddings from the private videos to match the TSM of the original video. We test our approach with two popular human action recognition backbone networks. To experimentally test our privacy-preserving human action recognition network (PrivHAR) and lens design, we built a proof-of-concept optical system in our lab. Our testbed acquires distorted videos and their non-distorted version simultaneously. Our experimental results in hardware match the simulations. While we do observe a trade-off between Human Action Recognition (HAR) accuracy and image distortion level, our proposed PrivHAR system offers robust protection with reasonable accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [52]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]52: want to ensure they protect our privacy.
