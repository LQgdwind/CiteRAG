Explanations consist of ex post, human-interpretable descriptions illuminating how complex systems arrive at certain predictions from certain inputs. The condition on human-interpretability is fluid, such that a description that counts as explanatory for one person may not count as explanatory for another. Consider, for example, AI scientists explaining their novel findings to one another at a conference. Their explanations are explanatory in context, but likely useless to anyone with a non-technical background. Transparency, a related concept, measures the extent to which opaque systems can be understood via explanation. Kathleen Creel defines transparency, in this setting, as the inverse of opacity.  Transparency is a property of models themselves, whereas explanations attach themselves to certain procedures, such as model subroutines or the general functioning of a family of related models, such as the transformer architecture. There is therefore a certain respect in which one needs transparency to give good explanations. The philosophical literature on each is significant, though, and their relationship is not strictly as simple as necessity. It is worth mentioning that in the AI literature, the supposed utility of explanation and transparency is not unanimously entertained. Zachary Lipton comments on the tenuous relationship between transparency and the very performance achievements that make AI systems so valuable to begin with: “In some cases, transparency may be at odds with the broader objectives of AI (artificial intelligence). Some arguments against black-box algorithms appear to preclude any model that could match or surpass human abilities on complex tasks. As a concrete example, the short-term goal of building trust with doctors by developing transparent models might clash with the longer-term goal of improving health care.”[ref]32 [ref]21 XAI systems and techniques such as LIME, QII, and SHAP[ref]33 take complex model behaviors and produce simplified explanations in human-interpretable formats. The medium can vary – for example, LIME uses linear approximations of the base model’s decision boundary near the prediction point, such that individual model features can be weighted by importance and reviewed by human interpreters. Other techniques use sections of images to report regions of interest in computer vision classifiers, or explanations via counterfactual statements, like “the model would have predicted ACCEPT had your reported annual income been $10,000 higher.” The precise mathematical techniques and theory at work in these systems is regrettably out of scope here. There is a more general question in need of answer: how do we go about assessing model transparency in the first place, and how can transparency influence contextual trust?\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: abilities on complex tasks.
