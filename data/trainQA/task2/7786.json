      "content": "Paper Title: Metric Dimension and Geodetic Set Parameterized by Vertex Cover\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this article, we study two metric-based graph problems,\none of which is defined through distances, while the other relies on shortest paths.\nMetric-based graph problems are\nubiquitous in computer science; for example, the classical\n(Single-Source) Shortest Path, (Graphic) Traveling\nSalesperson or Steiner Tree problems fall into this\ncategory.\nThose are fundamental problems, often stemming from\napplications in network design, for which a considerable amount of algorithmic research\nhas been done.\nMetric-based graph packing and\ncovering problems, like Distance\nDomination 7 or Scattered Set ,\nhave recently gained a lot of attention.\nTheir non-local nature leads to non-trivial algorithmic properties\nthat differ from most\ngraph problems with a more local nature. We focus here on the Metric Dimension and Geodetic Set problems, which arise from\nnetwork monitoring and network design, respectively. As noted in the\nintroduction of [ref]6 and the conclusion of ,\nand recently demonstrated in  ,\nthese two metric-based graph covering problems share many algorithmic\nproperties.\nThey have far-reaching applications, as exemplified by,\ne.g., the recent work  where\nit is shown that enumerating minimal solution sets for the\nMetric Dimension and Geodetic Set problems in (general) graphs and split graphs, respectively, is equivalent to\nthe enumeration of minimal transversals in hypergraphs, whose solvability in total-polynomial time is arguably\nthe most important open problem in algorithmic enumeration.\nFormally, these two problems are defined as follows. \n\n\n\n\nMetric Dimension\n\n\nInput: A graph G𝐺G and a positive integer k𝑘k.\nQuestion: Does there exist S⊆V​(G)𝑆𝑉𝐺S\\subseteq V(G) such that |S|≤k𝑆𝑘|S|\\leq k and, for any pair of vertices u,v∈V​(G)𝑢𝑣𝑉𝐺u,v\\in V(G),\nthere exists a vertex w∈S𝑤𝑆w\\in S with d​(w,u)≠d​(w,v)𝑑𝑤𝑢𝑑𝑤𝑣d(w,u)\\neq d(w,v)?\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGeodetic Set\n\n\nInput: A graph G𝐺G and a positive integer k𝑘k.\nQuestion: Does there exist S⊆V​(G)𝑆𝑉𝐺S\\subseteq V(G) such that |S|≤k𝑆𝑘|S|\\leq k and, for any vertex u∈V​(G)𝑢𝑉𝐺u\\in V(G), there are two\nvertices s1,s2∈Ssubscript𝑠1subscript𝑠2𝑆s_{1},s_{2}\\in S such that u𝑢u lies on a shortest path from s1subscript𝑠1s_{1} to\ns2subscript𝑠2s_{2}?\n\n Metric Dimension dates back to the 1970s  6,\nwhereas Geodetic Set was introduced in 1993 .\nThe non-local nature of these problems\nhas since posed interesting algorithmic challenges.\nMetric Dimension was first shown to be \\NP-complete in general graphs in Garey and\nJohnson’s book , and this was later extended to many\nrestricted graph classes (see ‘Related work’ below).\nGeodetic Set was proven to be \\NP-complete in the seminal paper ,\nand later shown to be \\NP-hard on restricted graph\nclasses as well. As these two problems are \\NP-hard even in very restricted cases,\nit is natural to ask for ways to confront this hardness.\nIn this direction, the parameterized complexity paradigm allows for a more refined analysis of a problem’s complexity.\nIn this setting, we associate each instance I𝐼I of a problem with a parameter ℓℓ\\ell, and are interested in algorithms running in time f​(ℓ)⋅|I|𝒪​(1)⋅𝑓ℓsuperscript𝐼𝒪1f(\\ell)\\cdot|I|^{\\mathcal{O}(1)} for some computable function f𝑓f.\nParameterized problems that admit such an algorithm are called fixed-parameter tractable (\\FPT for short) with respect to the considered parameter.\nOn the other hand, under standard complexity assumptions, parameterized problems that are hard for the complexity class \\W or \\W do not admit such algorithms.\nA parameter may originate from the formulation of the problem itself (called a natural parameter) or it can be a property of the input (called a structural parameter). This approach, however, had limited success in the case\nof these two problems.\nIn the seminal paper 6, Metric Dimension was proven to be\n\\W-hard parameterized by the solution size k𝑘k, even in subcubic\nbipartite graphs.\nSimilarly, Geodetic Set is \\W-hard parameterized by the solution size 5 , even on chordal bipartite graphs.\nThese initial hardness results drove the ensuing meticulous study of the problems under structural\nparameterizations.\nWe present an overview of such results in ‘Related work’ below.\nIn this article, we focus on the vertex cover number,\ndenoted by 𝚟𝚌𝚟𝚌\\mathtt{vc}, of the input graph and prove\nthe following positive results. Metric Dimension and Geodetic Set admit algorithms running in time\n2𝒪​(𝚟𝚌2)⋅n𝒪​(1)⋅superscript2𝒪superscript𝚟𝚌2superscript𝑛𝒪12^{\\mathcal{O}(\\mathtt{vc}^{2})}\\cdot n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}, and kernelization algorithms that\noutput kernels with 2𝒪​(𝚟𝚌)superscript2𝒪𝚟𝚌2^{\\mathcal{O}(\\mathtt{vc})} vertices. The second set of results follows from simple reduction rules, and was\nalso observed in 6 for Metric Dimension.\nThe first set of results builds on the second set by using a simple,\nbut critical observation.\nFor Metric Dimension, this also improves upon the 22𝒪​(𝚟𝚌)⋅n𝒪​(1)⋅superscript2superscript2𝒪𝚟𝚌superscript𝑛𝒪12^{2^{\\mathcal{O}(\\mathtt{vc})}}\\cdot n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}\nalgorithm mentioned in 6.\nOur main technical contribution, however, is in proving that\nthese results are optimal assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). Unless the ETH fails,\nMetric Dimension and Geodetic Set do not admit algorithms running in time\n2o​(𝚟𝚌2)⋅n𝒪​(1)⋅superscript2𝑜superscript𝚟𝚌2superscript𝑛𝒪12^{o(\\mathtt{vc}^{2})}\\cdot n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}, nor kernelization algorithms that reduce the solution size and\noutput kernels with 2o​(𝚟𝚌)superscript2𝑜𝚟𝚌2^{o(\\mathtt{vc})} vertices, even on graphs of bounded diameter. Both of these statements constitute a rare set of results in the existing literature.\nWe know of only one other problem in the literature that admits a lower\nbound of the form 2o​(𝚟𝚌2)⋅n𝒪​(1)⋅superscript2𝑜superscript𝚟𝚌2superscript𝑛𝒪12^{o(\\mathtt{vc}^{2})}\\cdot n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)} and a matching upper\nbound  - whereas such results\nparameterized by pathwidth are mentioned in 4 and 5.\nVery recently, the authors in \nalso proved a similar result with respect to solution size.\nSimilarly, the list of known problems with exponential lower bounds on the number of vertices in kernelized instances is very short.111For the definition of a kernelized instance and kernelization algorithm, refer to Section 2 or\n2.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the only known results of this kind (that is, ETH-based lower bounds on the number of vertices in a kernel) are for\nEdge Clique Cover 3,\nBiclique Cover ,\nStrong Metric Dimension ,\nB-NCTD+ ,\nand Locating Dominating Set .222Point Line Cover also does not admit a kernel with 𝒪​(k2−ϵ)𝒪superscript𝑘2italic-ϵ\\mathcal{O}(k^{2-\\epsilon}) vertices, for any ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0, unless \\NP⊆\\coNP/p​o​l​y\\NP\\coNP𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑦\\NP\\subseteq\\coNP/poly 0.\nFor Metric Dimension, the above also improves a result\nof 3, which states that Metric Dimension parameterized by k+𝚟𝚌𝑘𝚟𝚌k+\\mathtt{vc} does not admit a polynomial kernel unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to its third level. Indeed, the result\nof 3 does not rule out a kernel of super-polynomial or sub-exponential size. In a recent work , the present set of authors proved that\nunless the ETH fails,\nMetric Dimension and Geodetic Set on graphs of bounded diameter do not admit\n22o​(𝚝𝚠)⋅n𝒪​(1)⋅superscript2superscript2𝑜𝚝𝚠superscript𝑛𝒪12^{2^{o(\\mathtt{tw})}}\\cdot n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}-time algorithms,\nthereby establishing one of the first such results for\n\\NP-complete problems.\nNote that n≻𝚟𝚌≻𝚏𝚟𝚜≻𝚝𝚠succeeds𝑛𝚟𝚌succeeds𝚏𝚟𝚜succeeds𝚝𝚠n\\succ\\mathtt{vc}\\succ\\mathtt{fvs}\\succ\\mathtt{tw} and n≻𝚟𝚌≻𝚝𝚍≻𝚙𝚠≻𝚝𝚠succeeds𝑛𝚟𝚌succeeds𝚝𝚍succeeds𝚙𝚠succeeds𝚝𝚠n\\succ\\mathtt{vc}\\succ\\mathtt{td}\\succ\\mathtt{pw}\\succ\\mathtt{tw} in the parameter hierarchy, where n𝑛n is the number of vertices, 𝚏𝚟𝚜𝚏𝚟𝚜\\mathtt{fvs}\nis the feedback vertex set number, 𝚝𝚍𝚝𝚍\\mathtt{td} is the treedepth,\nand 𝚝𝚠𝚝𝚠\\mathtt{tw} is the treewidth of the graph.\nThe authors further proved that their lower bound\nalso holds for 𝚏𝚟𝚜𝚏𝚟𝚜\\mathtt{fvs} and 𝚝𝚍𝚝𝚍\\mathtt{td} in the case of Metric Dimension, and for 𝚝𝚍𝚝𝚍\\mathtt{td} in the case of Geodetic Set .\nNote that a simple brute-force algorithm enumerating all possible candidates\nruns in time 2𝒪​(n)superscript2𝒪𝑛2^{\\mathcal{O}(n)} for both of these problems.\nThus, the next natural question is whether such a lower bound for\nMetric Dimension and Geodetic Set can be extended to larger\nparameters, in particular 𝚟𝚌𝚟𝚌\\mathtt{vc}.\nOur first results answer this question in the negative.\nTogether with the lower bounds with respect to 𝚟𝚌𝚟𝚌\\mathtt{vc},\nthis establishes the boundary between parameters yielding\nsingle-exponential and double-exponential running\ntimes for Metric Dimension and Geodetic Set. We mention here results concerning structural parameterizations\nof Metric Dimension and Geodetic Set, and refer the reader to the full version of \nfor a more comprehensive overview of applications and\nrelated work regarding these two problems. As previously mentioned, Metric Dimension is\n\\W-hard parameterized by the solution size k𝑘k, even in subcubic\nbipartite graphs 6.\nSeveral other parameterizations have\nbeen studied for this problem, on which we elaborate next (see also [20, Figure 1]).\nThrough careful algorithmic design, kernelization, and/or meta-theorems,\nit was proven that there is an \\XP algorithm parameterized by the\nfeedback edge set number 8, and \\FPT algorithms\nparameterized by the max leaf number 7, the modular-width\nand the treelength plus the maximum degree ,\nthe treedepth and the clique-width plus the diameter 2,\nand the distance to cluster (co-cluster, respectively) 0.\nRecently, an \\FPT algorithm parameterized by the treewidth in chordal\ngraphs was given in .\nOn the negative side, Metric Dimension is \\W-hard parameterized by the pathwidth even\non graphs of constant degree , para-\\NP-hard parameterized\nby the pathwidth 2, and \\W-hard parameterized by\nthe combined parameter feedback vertex set number plus pathwidth 0. The parameterized complexity of Geodetic Set was first addressed in , in which they observed that the reduction\nfrom 5 implies that the problem is \\W-hard\nparameterized by the solution size (even for chordal\nbipartite graphs). This motivated the authors of  to investigate\nstructural parameterizations of Geodetic Set. They proved the problem to\nbe \\W-hard for the combined parameters solution size, feedback vertex set\nnumber, and pathwidth, and \\FPT for the parameters treedepth,\nmodular-width (more generally, clique-width plus diameter), and\nfeedback edge set number . The problem was also shown to be \\FPT on\nchordal graphs when parameterized by the treewidth [ref]6.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: with a more local nature. We focus here on the Metric Dimension and Geodetic Set problems, which arise from\nnetwork monitoring and network design, respectively.
