      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Conditional Instrumental Variable Representation for Causal Effect Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe selected three real-world datasets with their empirical causal effect values available and commonly used in the literature to assess the performance of DVAE.CIV in ACE estimations. We did not conduct experiments on CACE estimation on the three datasets since there were no ground truth or empirical estimates of CACEs available for these datasets. The three real-world datasets are SchoolingReturns , Cattaneo [ref]9, and RHC . These datasets are widely utilized in the evaluation of either IV estimators or data-driven causal effect estimators . Note that SchoolingReturns has a nominated CIV, and the last two datasets do not have a nominated IV for causal effect estimation. Thus, we only compared the DVAE.CIV model with all the aforementioned estimators on SchoolingReturns and the ML-based, tree-based, and VAE-based estimators on both Cattaneo and RHC datasets. The dataset is from the national longitudinal survey of youth (NLSY), a well-known dataset of US young employees, aged range from 24 to 34 . The dataset has 3,010 samples and 19 variables . The variable of the education of employees is the treatment variable, and the variable of the raw wages in 1976 (in cents per hour) is the outcome variable. The dataset was collected to study the causal effect of education on earnings. Note that the variable of geographical proximity to a college, i.e. nearcollege is nominated to be an IV by Card . The empirical estimate ACE(W,Y)=0.1329𝑊𝑌0.1329(W,Y)=0.1329 with 95% confidence interval (0.0484, 0.2175) is from  and used as the reference value. The dataset has the birth weights of 4,642 singleton births with 20 variables ([ref]9) that were collected from Pennsylvania, USA for the study of the average of maternal smoking status during pregnancy (W𝑊W) on a baby’s birth weight (Y𝑌Y, in grams). The dataset contains several covariates: mother’s age, mother’s marital status, an indicator for the previous infant where the newborn died, mother’s race, mother’s education, father’s education, number of prenatal care visits, months since last birth, an indicator of firstborn infant and indicator of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. The authors [ref]9 found a strong negative effect of maternal smoking on the weights of babies, i.e., about 200​g200𝑔200g to 250​g250𝑔250g lighter for a baby with a mother smoking during pregnancy. RHC is a real-world dataset obtained from an observational study regarding a diagnostic procedure for the management of critically ill patients . The RHC dataset can be downloaded from the 𝐑𝐑\\mathbf{R} package Hmisc3††3 https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Hmisc. The dataset contains 2,707 samples with 72 covariates  [ref]25. RHC was for investigating the adult patients who participated in the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT). The treatment variable W𝑊W is whether a patient received an RHC within 24 hours of admission, and the outcome variable Y𝑌Y is whether a patient died at any time up to 180 days after admission. Note that the empirical conclusion is that applying RHC leads to higher mortality within 180 days than not applying RHC . All results on the three real-world datasets are reported in Table 3. From Table 3, we make the following observations: (1) the estimated causal effects by DVAE.CIV and CF on SchoolingReturns and Cattaneo fall within the empirical intervals, while DML, DRL, and BART provide an opposite estimate to the empirical value on SchoolingReturns; (2) as there is no nominated IV on Cattaneo and RHC, the estimators OrthIV, DMLIV, DeepIV, and CFIVR do not work on both datasets; (3) all estimators, including DVAE.CIV, obtain a consistent estimation on the RHC data, and they reach the same conclusion as the empirical conclusion . These observations further confirm that DVAE.CIV is capable of removing the bias between W𝑊W and Y𝑌Y in real-world datasets. In conclusion, our simulation studies show the high performance of DVAE.CIV in ACE and CACE estimations from data with latent confounders, and our experiments on three real-world datasets further confirm the capability of DVAE.CIV in ACE estimation from observational data. The performance of DVAE.CIV relies on the assumptions made in this work and the assumptions on the VAE model. Note that the identification of the VAE model  is an important issue for our proposed DVAE.CIV model. When some of the assumptions or the VAE identification do not hold, DVAE.CIV may obtain an inconsistent conclusion. To obtain a consistent conclusion, it would be better to conduct a sensitivity analysis   together with DVAE.CIV to achieve a reliable conclusion in real-world applications.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: on CACE estimation on the three datasets since there were no ground truth or empirical estimates of CACEs available for these datasets.
