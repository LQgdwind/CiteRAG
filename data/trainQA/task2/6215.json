      "content": "Paper Title: A Decentralized Spike-based Learning Framework for Sequential Capture in Discrete Perimeter Defense Problem\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTechnological advances in sensors and computer vision have enabled organizations to use autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for various applications such as logistics , search and rescue , agriculture , security and surveillance , fire-fighting and defence . The use of UAVs also pose a threat to the privacy and security of vital infrastructures . UAV-based methods for this purpose have been evaluated for the protection of critical airspace infrastructures in .\nThese methods employ a team of UAVs, termed as defenders, that patrol the boundary of critical infrastructures to prevent intruders from infiltrating them. This problem is termed as the Perimeter Defense Problem (PDP) [ref]8 . Generally, the defenders are constrained to operate on the perimeter of the territory. The PDP has been addressed for different boundary shapes like linear territory 0, conical territory 1, circular territory 2, and more generally for any convex territory [ref]8 . A detailed review of existing approaches and challenges for the PDP are presented in 3 4. The differential geometric approaches have been used to compute feasible regions for defenders. Then using these feasibility constraints, one-to-one assignments of the defenders to intruders are computed as in [ref]8 . However, these geometric approaches are limited to one-to-one capture and require full observation. In 5, the decentralized policy for communication and decision-making for defenders is obtained from a centralized solution. But this decentralized solution allows each defender to capture only one intruder. As a result, the solution obtained does not account for sequential capture, where a defender captures multiple intruders in a sequence.\nIn 6, a two-stage adaptive partitioning approach is proposed for protecting circular territories against multiple radially incoming intruders. The territory is divided into partitions in the first stage of the partitioning approach. In the second stage, intruders in each partition are independently assigned to the defenders. However, the defenders lack cooperation as the defender in each partition solves the assignments independently. In 7 and 8, PDP has been formulated as a spatio-temporal Multi-Task Assignment Problem (STMTA) for convex territories. In this formulation, each intruder‚Äôs arrival time and location on the perimeter are predicted by defenders. Then to neutralize an intruder, a defender has to reach that arrival location at the arrival time of that intruder, which represents a spatio-temporal task. The PDP is converted into an STMTA problem when there are multiple spatio-temporal tasks for a single defender to handle. The solution to the STMTA problem is necessary to compute assigned intruders for each defender. The trajectory, following which assigned intruders will be neutralized, is computed for each defender using the assignment solution. In 9, the dynamic programming approach has been presented to solve the STMTA formulation of PDP. However, due to its exponential computational complexity, it is not implementable in real-time. Analytical solutions for STMTA based on the exact time-constrained multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (mTSP) problem have been developed in 0 1 for music-playing robots, in 2 for warehouse automation, and in 7 8 for PDP. These approaches involve solving the linear sum assignment problem using the Hungarian solution for mTSP, which has a computational complexity of order (N+M‚àí1)3superscriptùëÅùëÄ13{(N+M-1)}^{3}. The aforementioned works based on analytical, geometric, and numerical approaches are not scalable. Their complexity grows with an increase in the number of intruders. Hence they are limited to the protection of small territories. Designing decentralized and scalable strategies with partial observability is one of the major challenges for real-time implementations of perimeter defense systems. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNN) are used to develop a learning-based decentralized approach for solving PDP as an assignment problem 3. Each defender is equipped with a vision camera that uses ANN to extract features of observed intruders and defenders. These features are used as input to GNN. The GNN communicates with its neighboring defender (i.e. another GNN) to share features dynamically. The maximum matching algorithm 4 is used as an expert policy for training the GNN. The GNN has a fixed number of output neurons representing the closest intruders to a defender (arranged in a specific order). The choice of the number of input and output channels affects performance. Also, as the number of input and output channels is hard-coded, the setting is not generic.\nHowever, the GNN approach is only suitable for one-to-one assignments of defenders to intruders. Thus, there is a need to develop a generic learning-based scalable solution for one-to-many assignments of defenders to intruders to protect large territories. In this paper, a discrete PDP (d-PDP) is considered in which a defender needs to capture an intruder by visiting the segment of that intruder at the arrival of that intruder.\nTo the best of the author‚Äôs knowledge for the first time in this paper, the STMTA problem posed by d-PDP is converted into a deterministic multi-label learning problem using a Spiking Neural Network (SNN). The conventional multi-label learning algorithms provide a probabilistic solution, but multi-task assignment problem posed by d-PDP requires a deterministic solution for better performance. For predicting the multi-label deterministically a novel multi-label classifier using SNN is developed in this paper.\nThe input to the SNN is obtained from the spatio-temporal information about the defenders and intruders. Each defender is trained using a different SNN, enabling the decentralized operation of the DSL framework. The DSL framework is executed for different sensing ranges of defenders. If a defender is capable of sensing the entire perimeter then it is termed a full observation scenario. Otherwise, it is termed a partial observation scenario. DSL framework is designed to handle the spatio-temporal problem posed by d-PDP. As the d-PDP has inherent spatio-temporal nature, the DSL framework does not require any pre-processing to generate input spikes. The DSL framework is event-triggered which means that a neuron in the framework emits a spike when an object (either a defender or intruder) is detected otherwise, the neuron remains silent. This spiking nature of DSL makes it energy efficient. For the deterministic multi-label learning, each label prediction is formulated as a binary classification problem using Synaptic Efficacy Function spiking neuRON (SEFRON) 5 network. Hence the classifier is termed a Multi-Label Classifier using SEFRON (MLC-SEFRON). A 3-layered MLC-SEFRON architecture is used for this purpose namely input layer, SEFRON layer and output layer. Each label prediction is evaluated using the response of two neurons in the SEFRON layer. If one neuron spikes earlier than the other then the output neuron connected to these two neurons in the SEFRON layer generates a label 111 and vice versa. If the response of the output neuron is 111 then the defender is assigned to the segment associated with that neuron and vice versa. Therefore MLC-SEFRON learning predicts the labels in a deterministic manner. Since the number of intruders exceeds the number of defenders considered in this paper, the MLC-SEFRON is designed to predict multiple labels of segments assigned for a single defender.\nEach defender has one MLC-SEFRON architecture. The DSL framework is designed such that all the defender uses the same trained MLC-SEFRON architecture. After training the MLC-SEFRON network with a single defender, it can be used for obtaining assignments of other defenders without retraining. Hence the DSL framework is scalable and can be used for any number of defenders without any extra learning computations.\nOnce defenders obtain their assigned labels, they may have conflicts in their trajectories due to the decentralized approach. These conflicts are resolved to generate the trajectories of each defender using the Consensus-Based Bundle Algorithm (CBBA).\nThe dataset and expert assignment labels for training are generated by solving d-PDP using expert policy derived from the simplified form of 8. The performance of MLC-SEFRON in training is evaluated using two different observation scenarios. One is the partial observation scenario and the other is the full observation scenario of the defender around the perimeter. In a partial observation scenario, the defender is assumed to have a sensing range of 150 degrees of the perimeter. Whereas in full observation, the defender has a sensing range of 360 degrees which covers the entire perimeter. The MLC-SEFRON trained for one defender can be used for other defenders without retraining, hence the learning in this paper is decentralized. The performance of the MLC-SEFRON is evaluated using mutli-label metrics such as P‚Äãr‚Äãe‚Äãc‚Äãi‚Äãs‚Äãi‚Äão‚ÄãnùëÉùëüùëíùëêùëñùë†ùëñùëúùëõPrecision, R‚Äãe‚Äãc‚Äãa‚Äãl‚ÄãlùëÖùëíùëêùëéùëôùëôRecall, and F‚Äã1‚àíS‚Äãc‚Äão‚Äãr‚Äãeùêπ1ùëÜùëêùëúùëüùëíF1-Score as in 6.\nThe DSL framework is trained with five defenders using the MLC-SEFRON algorithm, and then the same is tested.\nThe results indicate that the DSL framework‚Äôs success rate is on par with the expert solution.\nThe performance of DSL framework is then compared with the state-of-the-art adaptive partitioning approach 6 and the expert policy. The results indicate that the DSL framework performs better compared.\nFurthermore, the DSL performance is evaluated for different-sized teams of defenders without retraining, to illustrate the scalability of the DSL framework. The DSL framework performs at par compared to the centralized expert policy for the different sizes of defenders to showcase its generalization performance. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: The formulation of the d-PDP into the spiking multi-label learning problem with the help of MLC-SEFRON architecture.
