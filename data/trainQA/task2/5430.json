      "content": "Paper Title: Mathematical Capabilities of ChatGPT\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs a language model, (Chat)GPT can be universally employed to perform mathematical reasoning and therefore has to compete with technologies in this space that are sometimes decades old. Performing mathematical reasoning in an automated way has a long history and can be traced back to 1959 , the most focus being devoted to proving theorems . Presently, there is a realization that classical approaches, using a symbolic encoding of mathematics, have reached a plateau [ref]15. On the other hand, there is now a growing body of literature on learning mathematical relationships directly in a supervised-learning manner    or by using LLMs to perform mathematical reasoning directly on mathematics encoded in natural language [ref]19. Sometimes, the distinction is blurred because architectures of LLMs can also be used in a supervised-learning setting and have been employed successfully in learning mathematical relationships  . Among the supervised approaches, we mention , where a Transformer architecture  was used to generate symbolic, closed-form solutions to integrals and first and second-order differential equations, which outperformed classical solvers222For a given prompt, the computer algebra system is considered to have failed if it does not provide a closed-form solution or times out after 30 seconds (in case of Mathematica)., such as Mathematica, MATLAB, and Maple by at least 14% on a test set of integration problems. On the task of solving differential equations, the Transformer-based approach still exceeds the classical approach, but by a smaller margin (at least 4% in the case of first-order differential equations and with more varied results for second-order equations). Recent LLMs, for instance, PaLM  (released in 2022), are tested only on elementary-level mathematical reasoning datasets, such as the MathQA or GSM8K datasets  .\nWe suspect that this is due to a lack of advanced-level natural language mathematics datasets.\nMoreover, the results obtained indicate that the models at that time had difficulty with much simpler datasets than ours.\nFor example, the version of PaLM with 540 billion parameters only correctly solves 58% of the problems of the GSM8K dataset, even with chain-of-thought prompting and access to an external calculator [22, Table 10]. This model nonetheless outperforms GPT-3 , which only achieves 54% on the same dataset.\nVariations of BERT  have been shown to only solve between 28% and 37% of the problems when fine-tuned and tested on the Algebra Question Answering with Rationales (AQuA-RAT) dataset , which is the direct predecessor of MathQA. For some models, such as BLOOM  or the LaMDA model  (both released in 2022), an evaluation of the mathematical reasoning capability is entirely missing. An up-to-date survey on mathematical datasets and the performance of various LLMs can be found in . Among the aforementioned LLMs, Minerva [ref]19, based on PaLM, stands out, being trained in equal parts on websites that contain MathJax elements and arXiv preprints (additionally to general natural language data on which PaLM was trained). It achieves a score of roughly 50% on the significantly harder Mathematics Aptitude Test of Heuristics (MATH) dataset , which was sourced from various mathematical competitions. One distinguishing feature of the MATH dataset is that its problems admit a unique answer that can be condensed within a few characters (a number, for example). This is beneficial for the automatic evaluation of a model on such a dataset since one can simply check the final answer, ignoring the step-by-step solution. Most similar to our dataset is the NaturalProofs dataset [ref]31 and the NaturalProofs-Gen dataset . In this paragraph, we illustrate the similarities and differences between these datasets and ours. NaturalProofs and NaturalProofs-Gen are similar among themselves and cover graduate-level mathematics by focusing on data from ProofWiki333https://proofwiki.org/ (the latter dataset), as well as on the Stacks Project444https://github.com/stacks/stacks-project and two open-source textbooks (the former dataset). Using the LaTeX source code, which is available for all these resources, annotated theorems and their proof graphs are extracted.\nThe annotations consist of reference graphs highlighting references to other theorems or definitions, the idea being that these references capture the “skeleton” of a proof.\nThis task resembles the mathematical abilities that the Named Theorem Proof Completion subdataset from the GHOSTS dataset evaluates (see Table 1), although 1) we only retrieve a single reference and 2) (Chat)GPT, as far as known, does not use training objectives that make use of information from data annotation, in contrast to models evaluated in [ref]31 .\nOur framework pertains to general language model evaluation, which may be presented in a black-box manner (as is the case for (Chat)GPT), and therefore does not allow to leverage any additional information, such as reference graphs. This is also reflected in the human evaluation schema introduced in  (see Table 24), which classifies common model mistakes.\nAs reference graphs form the foundation of how the mathematical proofs are engineered, many elements of the evaluation schema are strongly tailored toward this representation of mathematical data. Our benchmark is not reference-centric and therefore allows evaluations of any type of proof (including computations, as featured in the Symbolic-Integration subdataset, which we consider to be a particular kind of proof).\nTherefore, our methodology includes further and more general failure modes to make for a more fine-grained evaluation that explains the nature of the errors.\nWe refer to Appendix A for further related works.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: traced back to 1959 , the most focus being devoted to proving theorems .
