      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Artistic Style Transfer with Conditional Adversarial Networks1footnote 11footnote 1\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImposing a style on an image is one of the most laborious tasks in graphic designing. Most of the time, this process is handled by a skillful graphic designer, and it will take hours to finish one image with good quality. Using a neural style transfer (NST) model like [ref]1 is not popular among the computer graphics community due to several reasons. Since a model is specialized for the trained style, a simple application that supports several style transfers would be significant in terms of storage, considering the size of one NST model. Furthermore, the NST model imposing alias artifacts on the input image makes the model less reliable. Our first goal in this paper is to develop a NST model that supports more than one style to transfer. The second goal is to introduce a reliable NST model that imposes only general features related to a style. Motivated by the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) [ref]2  [ref]4 based image-to-image translation and style transfer literature , we upgrade the convolutional neural network (CNN) based generator architecture into a conditional generative adversarial network(cGAN) based image synthesis process. Both proposed models have two independent discriminators to generate content based adversarial loss and style based adversarial loss. The concept introduced in the  on understanding and controlling latent space to impose desirable features on generated images lay the fundamental idea to the second model we introduce in this paper. Using a mapping network introduced in  for matrix learning  make the encoder learn style features like in Natural Language Processing semantic classification model generates feature embedding for tokenized words. CNN based NST models introduced so far [ref]1   are models that train thousands of content images only against a single image which will define the transform style of the model trained. The objective function of this supervised training was the weighted sum of content loss and style loss. Style loss function calculates the norm of correlation matrix between style and input images. Images generated using the above conventional NST embeds alias artifacts from the style image and changes the color palette of the generated image significantly from the content image, as shown in Fig. 1. Since neural artistic style translation is an unpaired image-to-image translation, by definition, it makes NST unfitting for the Pix-to-Pix GAN  model. Even though StyleGAN  model is designed on an unpaired image-to-image translation between two pixel spaces, it uses the same set of features to generate the image from a separate pixel space. In this paper, we explore GANs in the NST, where just as the StyleGAN model generates an image with the mixture of both input image features. The proposed model extracts style features from the style image and object features from the content image and generates a new image with objects from the content image painted in the style of the style image. For such a case, we propose a GAN model that can be used for NST, which can support unpaired image-to-image translation on independent input pixel spaces. Furthermore, the proposed model extracts and generates a different latent space on both style and content image, and the pixel space of the generated image differs from both input images’ pixel spaces. We introduce a new GAN architecture with two discriminative headers in the first approach. In the second approach, we introduce an advancement to the architecture of the first approach, which makes the training separate parameter spaces for discriminators disappear. In the revealing network architecture, the encoder sub-models in the generator work as the discriminative headers in the training phase. In this model training process, generator training and discriminator training optimize the same parameter space. Conditional adversarial network architecture has been extensively upgraded over the past few years to support various image synthesis tasks in the computer vision field. Even though there were improvements in CNN based NST models such as  , they were based on CNN supervised learning as in [ref]1. The major contribution of this paper is to introduce a new cGAN architecture where the discriminator and encoder sub model of the generator share the same parameter space in the training time. The generator model has been made more reliable and consistent in style transferring as in the CycleGAN paper  introduced.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: designing.
