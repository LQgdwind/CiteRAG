      "content": "Paper Title: XIRL: Cross-embodiment Inverse Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraditional formulations of imitation learning    assume access to a corpus of expert demonstration data which includes both state and action trajectories of the expert policy. In the context of third-person imitation learning, including when learning from expert agents with different embodiments, obtaining access to ground-truth actions is difficult or impossible. Inferring expert actions. To address this issue, several approaches either try to infer expert actions 0 1 2  – for example by training an inverse dynamics model on agent interaction data 0 – or employ forward prediction on the next state to imitate the expert without direct action supervision 3. In the case of , a video-based action classifier trained on a large-scale human activity dataset is leveraged to provide rewards for single-task RL policies, which are then used to provide expert state-action pairs for multi-task behavior cloning. While these methods successfully address learning from observation-only demonstrations, they either do not support skill transfer to different policy embodiments at all, or they cannot take advantage of multiple embodiments in order to improve generalization to unseen policy configurations. We explicitly address these problems in this work. Imitation via learned reward functions. In contrast to imitation via supervised methods, such as BCO 0, a recent body of work [ref]4 [ref]5 4  5  has focused on learning reward functions from expert video data and then training RL policies to maximize this reward. In [ref]4, the authors combine ImageNet pre-trained visual features with an L2-norm distance reward to match policy and expert observations in a latent feature space. In their follow-up work [ref]5, the reward is computed in a viewpoint-invariant representation that is self-supervised on video data. While both these methods are compelling in their use of cheap unlabeled data to learn invariant rewards, the use of a time index as a heuristic for defining weak correspondence is a constraining limitation for tasks that need to be executed at different speeds, or are not strictly monotonic (e.g., have ambiguous sub-task ordering).\nIn 4 a dense reward is learned via unsupervised learning on YouTube data and the authors make no assumption about time alignment. However, in their work, the expert and learned policy are executed in the same domain and embodiment, an assumption we relax in our work. Framed in a multi-task learning setting, 6 propose training policies with morphologically different embodiments first on a similar set of proxy tasks, in order to learn a latent space to map between domains, and then sharing skills on a held-out task from one policy to another. A time-index heuristic is used to define a metric reward when performing RL training of the new task. In our work, the learned embedding finds correspondences in a fully-unsupervised fashion, without the need for such strict time alignment. In 7, a small sub-set of states is human labeled for goal success and a convolutional network is then trained to detect successful task completion from image observations, where on-policy samples are used as negatives for the classifier. By contrast, our learned embedding encodes task progress in its latent representation without the use of expensive human labels. Imitation via domain adaptation. An additional category of approaches to third-person imitation learning are those that perform domain adaptation of expert observations 8 9  . For instance, in 8 a CycleGAN  architecture is used to perform pixel-level image-to-image translation between policy domains, which is then used to construct a reward function for a model-based RL algorithm. A similar model-free approach is proposed in 9. In , a generative model is used to predict robot high-level sub-goals conditioned on a third-person demonstration video, and a lower-level control policy is trained in a task-agnostic manner. Similarly,  uses high level task conditioning from zero-shot transfer of expert demonstrations, but they use KL matching to perform both high and low-level imitation. In contrast to these methods, the unsupervised TCC alignment in this work avoids performing explicit domain adaptation or pixel-level image translation by instead learning a robust and invariant feature space in a fully offline fashion. Inspired by maximum entropy inverse RL   and generative adversarial networks , the seminal GAIL algorithm  performs distribution matching between the expert and policy’s state-action occupancy via an adversarial formulation; a discriminator is trained with on-policy samples, which is then used as a reward in an RL framework. Many recent works      build upon GAIL in order to perform observation-only imitation learning using state-only occupancy matching , domain adaptation via domain confusion  , and state-alignment using a variational autoencoder next-state predictor . Likewise, the algorithm proposed in 5 combines a metric learning loss that uses temporal video coherence to learn a robust skill representation with an entropy-regularized adversarial skill transfer loss. Finally, the authors of   propose an adversarial formulation for learning across domains with dynamics, embodiment and viewpoint mismatch. In contrast to these methods, our unsupervised reward is robust to domain shift without requiring online fine-tuning or the additional complexity of dynamic reward learning. Reinforcement learning with demonstrations. Recent work in offline-reinforcement learning   explicitly tackles the problem of policy embodiment and domain shift. Their method, Reinforcement Learning from Videos (RLV), uses a labelled collection of expert-policy state pairs in conjunction with adversarial training to learn an inverse dynamics model jointly optimized with the policy. In contrast, we avoid the limitation of collecting human-labeled dense state correspondences by using a self-supervised algorithm (i.e., TCC ) which uses cycle-consistency to automatically learn the correspondence between states of two domains. We also show that this formulation improves generalization to unseen embodiments. Since the problem setup is similar to ours, we also compare to their method as a baseline.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: configurations.
