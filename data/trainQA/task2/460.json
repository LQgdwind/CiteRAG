For automatic analysis, images are often represented as a set of features. Most prior works in image feature extraction are focused on the content of images     . Features are extracted based on the visual information of images such as pixels, colors, objects, scenes, and so on. Compared to the existing traditional vision-based content features      , content features extracted from the pre-trained deep learning methods [ref]12 4 3  [ref]11  are found to be more effective. Though these content features are shown to work reasonably well in many image processing tasks   , the information they capture may be insufficient to discriminate complex and ambiguous images with inter-class similarities and intra-class dissimilarities such as scene images. Fig.¬†1 shows two images which look very similar but they belong to two different categories (hospital room and bedroom). In such a case, the contextual information of images can provide rich discriminating information. Contextual information about an image can be usually obtained from its annotations or descriptions. Though it is impossible to have descriptions or annotations for all images, such information can be searched from the web for certain types of images like objects and scenes. A very few studies in the literature considered the contextual information in scene image classification 3 . They extracted tag-based features from description/annotations of similar images. Despite that tag-based features produce better results than traditional vision-based content features and are comparable to some deep content features 3 , they still have some limitations. In general, they have a large feature size and low classification accuracy.\nThey use task-generic filter banks, which may miss the relevant tags in most cases. Furthermore, they also suffer from the repetition of semantically similar words such as plane and planes. These issues deteriorate the classification performance of scene images. In this paper, we introduce a new technique to extract tag features based on the pre-trained word embedding vectors   , which are used to define the associations between words/tags semantically. For content-based features, we adopt features extracted from pre-trained deep learning models. In most state-of-the-art methods, deep features are extracted\nfrom the intermediate layers of VGG16 model 7, GoogleNet , ResNet-152 [ref]12, etc.\nNevertheless, normally these features from such pre-trained models are extracted based on the fixed input image size of 224√ó224224224224\\times 224 pixels.  This is because pre-trained VGG-16 models have been trained with images of 224√ó224224224224\\times 224 pixels size during training.\nExisting methods have a limited capability to deal with varied sizes of images and may not yield stable performance in the case of multi-scale (or also called multi-size) images.\n\nAlso, existing deep content features based on ImageNet and Places pre-trained deep learning models impart foreground and background information, respectively. However, both information are equally important for scene image representation.\nAs such, the multi-scale deep features based on foreground and background information are needed to achieve good classification performance.\n In literature, either content-based or context-based features have been mostly used for image classification. Since these two sets of features capture different types of information about images, which may be complementary in many cases, we suppose that their fusion will boost the classification accuracy. Therefore, we propose to combine the two sets of features to produce Content and Context Features (abbreviated as C‚ÄãC‚ÄãFùê∂ùê∂ùêπCCF). The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows. We propose a novel approach to extract context features, which is tag-based features, of an image from tags in annotations/descriptions of its top kùëòk similar images available on the web.\nFor this, we first design a novel filter bank (codebook) with a size significantly smaller than the number of raw tags by eliminating redundant and outlier tags. Note that before achieving our codebook, we also devise a novel algorithm to perform the stemming of tokens during pre-processing step.\nLast, the tag-based context features (T‚ÄãFùëáùêπTF) of the image are extracted as the histogram based on the codebook, leading to features with a noticeably smaller size compared to existing tag-based context features. For content features, we design multi-scale deep features based on background and foreground information in images. Our deep features are multi-scale\nand have a smaller size compared to existing deep content features. We propose to fuse context and content features (C‚ÄãC‚ÄãFùê∂ùê∂ùêπCCF), to enable the ability of capturing different information in discriminating scene images of different classes. To validate the proposed tag-based (context) features (T‚ÄãFùëáùêπTF), deep (content) features (D‚ÄãFùê∑ùêπDF) and the fusion of the two types of features (C‚ÄãC‚ÄãF=T‚ÄãF+D‚ÄãFùê∂ùê∂ùêπùëáùêπùê∑ùêπCCF=TF+DF), we evaluate their performances against state-of-the-art features in the scene image classification task using Support Vector Machine (SVM) on three commonly used scene image datasets (MIT-67¬†5, Scene-15¬† and Event-8¬†). The results show that our proposed T‚ÄãFùëáùêπTF and D‚ÄãFùê∑ùêπDF produce better results than many existing context and content features, respectively and the combined C‚ÄãC‚ÄãFùê∂ùê∂ùêπCCF produce significantly better results than numerous existing tag-based and deep learning-based features. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related works in terms of content and context features extraction. Section 3 discusses the proposed methods to extract context-based, content-based and fused features. Section 4 details the implementation and results of our experiments in scene image classification.\nFinally, we conclude the paper and point out potential future work in the last section.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: Image representation in a machine readable form is an emerging field due to the wide use of camera technology in our daily life [ref]43.
