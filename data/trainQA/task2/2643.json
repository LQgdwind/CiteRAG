      "content": "Paper Title: 3D Human Texture Estimation from a Single Image with Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n3D human texture estimation.\nRecent years have witnessed significant progress in the field of 3D human texture estimation  8           3 9  [ref]3   .\nSome methods  [ref]3    solve this problem by taking multi-view images as input, and the 3D human texture can be synthesized by merging textures from different views with Graph-cut , median filters [ref]3, or deep learning .\nHowever, these methods cannot be easily used for single-image 3D human reconstruction     .\nMore recent approaches in this direction use RGBD videos  , which poses even higher demand for the input. For applications in single-image 3D human reconstruction     ,\nanother line of approaches use deep neural networks to reconstruct 3D human textures from a monocular image  8   .\nHowever, these methods usually need 3D supervision obtained via 3D scanning, which is both time-consuming and labor-intensive.\nMoreover, some methods 8  require high-quality dense human pose estimation for extracting partially observed textures, which would be challenging for in-the-wild images. More closely related to this work, some recent methods aim to address the problem of single-image texture reconstruction without 3D labels    3 9 , which are generally more applicable for real-world usage.\nFor instance, Wang et al.  propose a self-supervised training pipeline by building upon the success of existing 3D human mesh reconstruction algorithms 7 6 2 4 8 6.\nKanazawa et al. 3 also learn the 3D textures in a self-supervised manner and use texture flow to directly sample pixels from the input image.\nIn addition, Zhao et al.  exploit human part segmentation as input and use multi-view data as extra training labels for better performance.\nWhile these methods have achieved promising progress in this task, they usually rely on CNNs that cannot well exploit global information of the input.\nIn contrast, we propose a Transformer-based framework that effectively overcomes this issue.\nIn addition, we introduce a mask-fusion strategy to combine the advantages of both RGB predictions and texture flow.\nWe also propose part-style loss and face-structure loss to further improve the texture reconstruction results. Transformers.\nThanks to the remarkable ability to handle long-range information, the Transformer has become the dominant architecture in natural language processing 3 0.\nRecently, it has also been introduced in computer vision, and the applications include object detection , image classification 1, image restoration , and hand pose estimation 7.\nWe refer to 4 for a more comprehensive review of vision transformers. In this work, we demonstrate that the attention mechanism makes the Transformer particularly suitable for the task of 3D human texture estimation.\nWe provide new insights in designing the Transformer for this task, and the proposed network achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art approaches.\nWe also show that a common Transformer structure without specific design cannot perform as well as the proposed architecture.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: 3D human texture estimation.\nRecent years have witnessed significant progress in the field of 3D human texture estimation  8           3 9  [ref]3   .\nSome methods  [ref]3    solve this problem by taking multi-view images as input, and the 3D human texture can be synthesized by merging textures from different views with Graph-cut ,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
