The generic structures of such networks, especially when compared to the grid-like structure of the images, audio, and text, makes it difficult to analyze their representations. Since graphs are non-Euclidean and the number of vertices and edges can vary arbitrarily, they become a powerful tool for data representation in such irregular domains and therefore, it has been a surge in research on graph representation learning recently [ref]22. To incorporate high-dimensional non-Euclidean information of the graph structure, earlier approaches relied on hand-engineered features such as degrees or clustering coefficients , kernel functions  and engineered features to measure local neighborhood structures . However, using hand-engineered features could be an inflexible and expensive task. Recently learning representations is becoming more popular, which is based on learning a mapping that embeds nodes, or the entire (sub)graphs, as points in a low-dimensional vector space to summarize every nodeâ€™s position and the structure of its local neighborhood [ref]22. The learning representations facilitates downstream machine learning tasks like link prediction  or node classification [ref]27. Graph structure and methods have also been used to enhance the ability to learn a variety of tasks like image clustering and recognition , object identification , action recognition , and few-shot learning (FSL) . The approach to image clustering and recognition  investigates graph characteristics from the heat kernel trace by exploring three different methods to characterizing it as a function of time. To identify objects, spectral graph analysis of a hierarchical description of an image is applied to construct a feature vector of fixed dimension . Among the graph-based methods developing FSL are the EGNN , which learns to predict edge-labels rather than node-labels by iteratively updating the edge-labels using both intra-cluster similarity and the inter-cluster dissimilarity, and the DPGN , which incorporates distribution propagation in graph neural network to facilitate FSL tasks. In , however, a concept graph is used for weakly supervised FSL by applying a meta concept inference network, which quickly adapts to a novel task using the joint inference of the abstract concepts and a few annotated samples.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: and unstructured data represents a particular conceptual network like social networks, molecular networks, biological protein-protein networks, telecommunication networks or brain connectomes [ref]21.
