      "content": "Paper Title: Utilizing Active Machine Learning for Quality Assurance: A Case Study of Virtual Car Renderings in the Automotive Industry\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nComputer-generated imagery (CGI) has become a central element of leading car manufacturers‚Äô advertisement and sales concepts.\nVirtual car renderings are utilized for various marketing purposes as they enable advertisement campaigns that are efficiently customizable to different markets while not requiring costly physical car prototypes for elaborate photo shoots.\nMoreover, CGI introduces to customers the possibility to configure a selected car model in real-time online configurators according to their personal preferences. Similar to the physical car assembly, high-quality standards are a central requirement for the long-term success of all advertisement offerings. Thus, it is crucial to avoid erroneous content creation.\nHowever, the continuously growing number of design options of all existing car variants including their derivatives poses increasing challenges for currently human-led quality assurance (QA), turning high-volume visual inspection processes into procedural bottlenecks.\nMoreover, multiple studies have indicated that the accuracy of human visual inspections may decline with endlessly repetitive routine jobs   . In this context, the continuously evolving capabilities of machine learning (ML) algorithms have led to the successful entry of this technology in many industrial sectors over the last years.\nParticularly, in the area of QA, artificial perception systems offer the possibility to support humans through automatic visual inspection .\nApplications range from industrial tool wear analysis  over printing quality control  to quality estimation of porcelain .\nHowever, one of the major drawbacks of supervised ML is its dependency on a vast amount of high-quality labeled training data, constituting a major impediment for the launch of such systems in practice .\nEven though the amount of available data has been constantly increasing [ref]9, labeling of data instances is costly because it often requires the knowledge of domain experts. To overcome these difficulties for the deployment and operation of ML systems in practice, methods to decrease the data labeling effort, particularly when labeling resources are limited, can be applied, e.g., transfer learning 0, multi-task learning 1, few-shot learning 2, meta-learning 3 or active (machine) learning (AL) 4.\nThe key idea of AL is that a model can accomplish a certain performance level requiring fewer training instances if the most informative instances with regard to its learning process are selected.\nInitially, a model is trained on a small labeled data set.\nIn each AL round, new data instances are chosen by an acquisition function and labeled by an expert. Subsequently, they are added to the labeled data pool. This procedure is repeated until a specific termination criterion is met 4. In this work, we propose an active machine learning-based quality assurance (ALQA) system to assist the manual QA process for the CGI content production of virtual car renderings at Audi Business Innovation GmbH, a subsidiary of AUDI AG. Our ALQA system requires significantly less training data and therefore contributes to overcoming the initial start-up barrier of labeling a large number of data instances.\nSpecifically, our system is able to achieve an average performance (measured in terms of the F2subscriptùêπ2F_{2} metric) of 95.81%percent95.8195.81\\%, while reducing the labeling overhead by 35%percent3535\\% on average. Identified defective configurations are forwarded by the system to the responsible QA managers for further root cause analysis. With our research, we contribute to the body of knowledge with the following five core aspects: First, we propose a novel artifact‚Äîan ALQA system‚Äîto automatically identify defects in CGI of virtual car models as a support tool for human-led QA.\nSecond, we evaluate its performance and demonstrate its ability to significantly reduce the manual labeling effort of image data required to train the system while maintaining its prediction accuracy.\nThird, we discuss possible economic implications of the system and show its ability to overcome start-up difficulties while increasing the QA efficiency.\nFourth, by illustrating the feasibility of the artifact, we are the first to introduce deep learning into the QA of CGI within an industrial context‚Äîas similar approaches have (so far) only been utilized in the area of video game streaming 5.\nFinally, we provide generalizable prescriptive design knowledge by providing precise design principles to address the design requirements of ALQA systems. These ‚Äúblueprints‚Äù can serve as a foundation for the design of future artifacts within different domains. We utilize design science research (DSR) as an overall research design and base our approach on Hevner and Chatterjee 6. They recommend that a DSR project should consist of at least three cycles of investigation: a relevance cycle (addressing the practical problem, see Section¬†2), a rigor cycle (outlining the existing knowledge base, see Section¬†4), and one or multiple design cycles (instantiating and evaluating the research artifact, see Sections¬†3 and¬†5). We finish our work with a discussion of the potential economic impact of our artifact (Section¬†6) as well as a conclusion (Section¬†7).\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: amount of high-quality labeled training data, constituting a major impediment for the launch of such systems in practice .\nEven though the amount of available data has been constantly increasing [ref]9, labeling of data instances is costly because it often requires the knowledge of domain experts.
