These include the baseline CLIP [ref]31, TENT [ref]37, TPT [ref]34, CLIPArTT , and WATT  (both versions WATT-S and WATT-P), as well as the proposed CLIP-OT approach, across various datasets and corruption benchmarks. Datasets.‚ÄÉ All methods are benchmarked on standard TTA datasets known for their complexity and task diversity. These datasets include corrupted modifications from well-known datasets proposed in , such as CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, or Tiny-ImageNet-C. Also, we employ its non-corrupted versions, i.e., CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 , CIFAR-10.1 , and Tiny-ImageNet . Additionally, we include Domainbed datasets (PACS , VLCS , OfficeHome , VisDA-C ). More details can be found in Appendix¬†B. Architectures.‚ÄÉ We employed the Vision Transformer architecture as the backbone for our experiments. The choice of ViT is driven by its superior performance on image classification tasks due to its attention mechanisms, which effectively capture long-range dependencies and spatial relationships within images. If not stated the opposite, experiments are carried out using ViT-B/32, although we also provide further evaluations with larger ViT-backbones, e.g., ViT-B/16. Implementation details.‚ÄÉ Following the existing literature  , we used a batch size of 128 in our experiments and a learning rate of 10‚àí4superscript10410^{-4}. The only additional hyper-parameters specific to our formulation are the entropic constraint weight, œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon in Eq.¬†7, and the number of repetitions in the Sinkhorn algorithm. These are fixed to the same values across all experiments. First, œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon is incorporated through a temperature-scaling parameter, which is set to œµ=0.7italic-œµ0.7\\epsilon=0.7. The latter is fixed to T=3ùëá3T=3, which was enough for convergence, as in previous works . Finally, we ran the adaptation experiments for each corruption/dataset three times under different random seeds and averaged the obtained accuracy accordingly. ‚ñ≤ ‚ñ≤ ‚ñ≤ ‚ñ≤ ‚ñ≤ ‚ñ≤ ‚ñ≤ ‚ñ≤ ‚ñ≤ ‚ñ≤ ‚ñ≤ ‚ñ≤ ‚ñ≤ ‚ñ≤ ‚ñ≤ ‚ñ≤ ‚ñ≤\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: we present the results obtained from our evaluations of relevant CLIP-based TTA parameter-efficient adaptation approaches, i.e., modify a set of learnable parameters.
