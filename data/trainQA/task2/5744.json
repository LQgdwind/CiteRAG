      "content": "Paper Title: Experimenting with Normalization Layers in Federated Learning on non-IID scenarios\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe main challenges in FL are statistical heterogeneity (non-iidness) and systems heterogeneity (variability of the devices of the federation). In this work, we address the former. In , the most common non-IID data settings that are quantity skew, labels quantity skew (prior shift), feature distribution skew (covariate shift), same label but different features and same features but different labels, are reviewed. To the best of our knowledge, there are only a few benchmarks for FL dealing with non-IID data. Li et al. in 2 report the analysis of FedAvg¬†, FedNova¬†, FedProx¬†[ref]8 and SCAFFOLD¬†0 on nine public image datasets, including MNIST¬†5 and CIFAR10¬†6, split according to three of the previous mentioned non-IID partition strategies, i.e. quantity skew, labels quantity skew and three different versions of feature distribution skew: noise-based, synthetic and real-world feature imbalance. Authors show that none of those algorithms outperforms others in all the cases and that non-iidness degrades the performance of FL systems in terms of accuracy, especially in the case of labels quantity skew. Another recent work¬†3 reports an empirical assessment of the behaviour of FedAvg and FedCurv¬†1 on MNIST, CIFAR10 and MedMNIST¬†7. Datasets are split according to the same non-IID settings of 2. Authors show that aggregating models at each epoch is not necessarily a good strategy: performing local training for multiple epochs before the aggregation phase can significantly improve performance while also reducing communication costs. FedAvg produced better models in most non-IID settings despite competing with an algorithm explicitly developed to deal with these scenarios (FedCurv). Results in 3 also confirmed literature sentiment: labels quantity skew and its pathological variant are the most detrimental ones for the algorithms. The same non-IID partitions have already been tested in , which proposes a novel technique of non-gradient-descent FL on tabular datasets.\nOur paper extends 3, deepening the experiments about the number of epochs per round, a hyper-parameter that, if tuned appropriately, can lead to large performance gains. Moreover, we aim to investigate which type of normalization layer better fits FL on non-IID data. Indeed, when data are non-IID, batch statistics do not represent the global statistics, leading NNs equipped with BN to poor results. The most common alternatives to BN are: Group Normalization (GN)¬†8, Layer Normalization (LN)¬†9, Instance Normalization (IN)¬† and Batch Renormalization (BRN)¬†. To the best of our knowledge, there are no works benchmarking normalization layers for FL on non-IID data. A previous work , proposing a novel form of Transfer Learning through test-time parameters‚Äô aggregation, shows that a NN with Batch Normalization¬†4 does not learn at all, while performance improves only when using Group Normalization¬†8. Andreaux et al. propose a novel FL approach by introducing local-statistic BN layers . Their method, called SiloBN, consists in only sharing the learned BN parameters Œ≥ùõæ\\gamma and Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta across clients, while BN statistics Œºùúá\\mu and œÉ2superscriptùúé2\\sigma^{2} remain local, allowing the training of a model robust to the heterogeneity of the different centres. SiloBN showed better intra-centre generalization capabilities than existing FL methods. FedBN¬† is a FL algorithm that excludes BN layers from the averaging step, outperforming both FedAvg and FedProx in a feature distribution skew setting.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: but different labels, are reviewed.
