      "content": "Paper Title: Comparison Graphs: a Unified Method for Uniformity Testing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe task of uniformity testing, as well as the collision-based tester for it, were introduced in¬† (and implicitly in¬†). Later on, upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity of the problem were given by  (for most values of œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon), showing that the optimal sample complexity is in fact s=Œò‚Äã(n/œµ2)ùë†Œòùëõsuperscriptitalic-œµ2s=\\Theta\\left(\\sqrt{n}/\\epsilon^{2}\\right), where nùëõn is the world size, and œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon is a proximity parameter. A preliminary version of¬† giving a tester that achieves this complexity for any value of œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon.\nThe last two papers used two different testers: the first relied on the number of distinct elements in the sample set (this test is somewhat dual to counting collisions), and the second on a modified œá2superscriptùúí2\\chi^{2} tester. It was then shown by  that the collision-based tester does in fact achieve optimal sample complexity too. In the past few years there has been a growing interest in distribution testing under various computational models, including collaborative testing in multiparty model, the streaming model, privacy aspects of testing, and others (  [ref]17  [ref]2    [ref]1    and more). We mention in more details the works concerning uniformity testers in models we pursue. In a preliminary version of¬†  and¬†[ref]17 each, independently, the task of uniformity testing was considered in a simultaneous communication model. In this model, all players receive samples from the same global distribution PùëÉP, and all players report to a referee based on their own samples. The referee in turn uses the reports to output (with high probability) whether PùëÉP holds some property. In both lines of work, the focus was uniformity testing, but using two different perspectives: the former zeroes in on one sample per player, where the trade-off in question is between the number of bits each player is allowed in his report, and the number of players needed to the testing process. We think of the number of bits as too small to describe the sampled element fully.\nIn this setting, a full description of two samples is never available to a single player (nor the referee, whenever no player can describe fully the element it samples). We do note that the tester given there relies on a looser notion of collisions (Taking a coarser division of [n]delimited-[]ùëõ[n] into subsets). In the later, the focus is different: one now fixes instead the communication to one bit per player. Now, the trade-off is between the number of players and the number of samples each one of them takes. The upper bound devised there discuss each player taking the right amount of samples, and notifying the referee 00 if no collision occurred, and 111 otherwise. In some sense, the referee ends up counting collisions (notice the count is trimmed, as one player might see more than 111 collision, but is only able to report 0 or 1). This tester is then used as a black-box to solve uniformity testing in the classic distributed models (CONGEST, and LOCAL), in a setting where each player initially draws one sample. One other paper to specifically discuss uniformity testing is¬†, in which a streaming version of the problem is defined, as well as another distributed version, in a blackboard model, where all players are privy to the messages sent by others. As opposed to the simultaneous models mentioned above ‚Äì here several rounds of communication are allowed. As it turns out, the streaming algorithm, as well one of two algorithms suggested for the distributed version, boil down yet again to counting collisions under the limitations of the model. In addition to these, quite a few works had the focus of showing impossibility results both in the classic and the entire variety of models. For out interest, we mention¬†  for the classic version, as well as¬† for the simultaneous model (with multiple samples per machine), and ¬†  for the streaming model.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: a growing interest in distribution testing under various computational models, including collaborative testing in multiparty model, the streaming model, privacy aspects of testing, and others (  [ref]17  [ref]2    [ref]1    and more).
