      "content": "Paper Title: Noise2Same: Optimizing A Self-Supervised Bound for Image Denoising\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe show that, in mask-based blind-spot approaches, the optimal denoising function obtained through training is not strictly 𝒥𝒥\\mathcal{J}-invariant, which contradicts the theory behind these methods.\nAs introduced in Section 2, mask-based blind-spot methods implement blindness on J𝐽J through masking. Original values on J𝐽J are masked out and replaced by other values. Concretely, in Equation (3), 𝒙Jcsubscript𝒙superscript𝐽𝑐\\bm{x}_{J^{c}} becomes 𝟙Jc⋅𝒙+𝟙J⋅𝒓⋅subscript1superscript𝐽𝑐𝒙⋅subscript1𝐽𝒓\\mathds{1}_{J^{c}}\\cdot\\bm{x}+\\mathds{1}_{J}\\cdot\\bm{r}, where 𝒓𝒓\\bm{r} denotes the new values on the masked locations (J𝐽J).\nAs introduced in Section 2, Noise2Void  and Noise2Self [ref]1 are current mask-based blind-spot methods. The main difference between them is the choice of the replacement strategy, i.e., how to select 𝒓𝒓\\bm{r}. Specifically, Noise2Void applies the Uniform Pixel Selection (UPS) to randomly select 𝒓𝒓\\bm{r} from local neighbors of the masked locations, while Noise2Self directly uses a random value. Although the masking prevents f𝑓f from accessing the original values on J𝐽J during training, we point out that, during inference, f𝑓f still shows a weak dependency on values on J𝐽J, and thus does not strictly satisfy the 𝒥𝒥\\mathcal{J}-invariance property. In other words, mask-based blind-spot methods do not guarantee the learning of a 𝒥𝒥\\mathcal{J}-invariant function f𝑓f.\nWe conduct experiments to verify the above statement. Concretely, given a denoising function f𝑓f trained through mask-based blind-spot methods, we quantify the strictness of 𝒥𝒥\\mathcal{J}-invariance by computing the following metric: where x𝑥x is the raw noisy image and 𝒙Jcsubscript𝒙superscript𝐽𝑐\\bm{x}_{J^{c}} denotes the image whose values on J𝐽J are replaced with random Gaussian noises (σmsubscript𝜎𝑚\\sigma_{m}=0.5). Note that the replacement here is irrelevant to the the replacement strategy used in mask-based blind-spot methods. If the function f𝑓f is strictly 𝒥𝒥\\mathcal{J}-invariant, 𝒟​(f)𝒟𝑓\\mathcal{D}(f) should be close to 00 for all 𝒙𝒙\\bm{x}. Smaller 𝒟​(f)𝒟𝑓\\mathcal{D}(f) indicates more 𝒥𝒥\\mathcal{J}-invariant f𝑓f. To mitigate mutual influences among the locations within J𝐽J, we use saturate sampling  to sample J𝐽J and make the sampling sparse enough (at a portion of 0.01%). 𝒟​(f)𝒟𝑓\\mathcal{D}(f) is computed on the output of f𝑓f before re-scaling back to  . In our experiments, we compare 𝒟​(f)𝒟𝑓\\mathcal{D}(f) and the testing PSNR for f𝑓f trained with different replacement strategies and on different datasets. Table LABEL:tab:2 provides the comparison results between f𝑓f trained with different replacement strategies on the BSD68 dataset [ref]15. We also include the scores of the convolutional blind-spot neural network  for reference, which guarantees the strict 𝒥𝒥\\mathcal{J}-invariance through shifting receptive field, as discussed in Section 3.2. As expected, it has a close-to-zero 𝒟​(f)𝒟𝑓\\mathcal{D}(f), where the non-zero value comes from mutual influences among the locations within J𝐽J and the numerical precision. The large 𝒟​(f)𝒟𝑓\\mathcal{D}(f) for all the mask-based blind-spot methods indicate that the 𝒥𝒥\\mathcal{J}-invariance is not strictly guaranteed and the strictness varies significantly over different replacement strategies. We also compare results on different datasets when we fix the replacement strategy, as shown in Table 2. We can see that different datasets have strong influences on the strictness of 𝒥𝒥\\mathcal{J}-invariance as well. Note that such influences are not under the control of the denoising approach itself. In addition, although the shown results in Tables LABEL:tab:2 and 2 are computed on testing dataset at the end of training, similar trends with 𝒟​(f)≫0much-greater-than𝒟𝑓0\\mathcal{D}(f)\\gg 0 is observed during training. Given the results in Tables LABEL:tab:2 and 2, we draw our conclusions from two aspects. We first consider the mask together with the network f𝑓f as a 𝒥𝒥\\mathcal{J}-invariant function g𝑔g, i.e., g​(x):=f​(𝟙Jc⋅𝒙+𝟙J⋅𝒓)assign𝑔𝑥𝑓⋅subscript1superscript𝐽𝑐𝒙⋅subscript1𝐽𝒓g(x):=f(\\mathds{1}_{J^{c}}\\cdot\\bm{x}+\\mathds{1}_{J}\\cdot\\bm{r}). In this case, the function g𝑔g is guaranteed to be 𝒥𝒥\\mathcal{J}-invariant during training, and thus Equation (2) is valid. However, during testing, the mask is removed and a different non-𝒥𝒥\\mathcal{J}-invariant function f𝑓f is used because f𝑓f achieves better performance than g𝑔g, according to [ref]1. This contradicts the theoretical results of [ref]1. On the other hand, we consider the network f𝑓f and the mask separately and perform training and testing with the same function f𝑓f. In this case, the use of mask aims to help f𝑓f learn to be 𝒥𝒥\\mathcal{J}-invariant during training so that Equation (2) becomes valid. However, our experiments show that f𝑓f is neither strictly 𝒥𝒥\\mathcal{J}-invariant during training nor till the end of training, indicating that Equation (2) is not valid. With findings interpreted from both aspects, we ask whether minimizing 𝔼x​∥f​(𝒙)−𝒙∥2subscript𝔼𝑥superscriptdelimited-∥∥𝑓𝒙𝒙2\\mathds{E}_{x}\\left\\lVert f(\\bm{x})-\\bm{x}\\right\\rVert^{2} with 𝒥𝒥\\mathcal{J}-invariant f𝑓f yields optimal performance for self-supervised denoising.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: where 𝒓𝒓\\bm{r} denotes the new values on the masked locations (J𝐽J).\nAs introduced in Section 2, Noise2Void  and Noise2Self [ref]1 are current mask-based blind-spot methods.
