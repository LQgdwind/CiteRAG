      "content": "Paper Title: Temporal Difference Learning with Compressed Updates: Error-Feedback meets Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBelow, we provide a more comprehensive description of related work. ∙∙\\bullet Analysis of TD Learning Algorithms. An analysis of the classical temporal difference learning algorithm  with value function approximation was first provided by . They employed the ODE method  - commonly used to study stochastic approximation algorithms - to provide an asymptotic convergence rate analysis of TD learning algorithms. Finite-time rates for such algorithms remained elusive for several years, till the work by . Soon after,  noted some issues with the proofs in . Under the i.i.d. observation model described in Section 4,  and  went on to provide finite-time rates for TD learning algorithms. For the more challenging Markovian setting, finite-time rates have been recently derived using various perspectives: (i) by making explicit connections to optimization ; (ii) by taking a control-theoretic approach and studying the drift of a suitable Lyapunov function ; and (iii) by arguing that the mean-path temporal difference direction acts as a “gradient-splitting” of an appropriately chosen function . Each of these interpretations provides interesting new insights into the dynamics of TD algorithms. ∙∙\\bullet Communication-Efficient Algorithms for (Distributed) Optimization and Learning. The literature in this area is vast, and has grown considerably over the last few years. Broadly speaking, compression either involves quantization [ref]2  [ref]4 [ref]3       to reduce the precision of transmitted information, or biased sparsification         to transmit only a few components of a vector with the largest magnitudes. In terms of quantization, while some of the earlier works focused on quantizing gradients [ref]4 [ref]3 , the convergence guarantees of these methods were subsequently improved in  where the authors proposed DIANA - a new algorithm based on quantizing differences of gradients. The DIANA technique was further generalized in  to account for a variety of compressors. An accelerated variant of DIANA was also proposed recently in . As far as gradient sparsification is concerned, although empirical studies   have revealed the benefits of aggressive sparsification techniques, theoretical guarantees for such methods are much harder to establish relative to simple unbiased quantizers. To counter the effect of the bias introduced by sparsification mechanisms, the error-feedback idea was introduced in [ref]2 to study 1-bit SGD. Follow-up work has explored this idea for studying SignSGD in , and sparse SGD in    - all for single-worker settings. Very recently,  and  provided theoretical results on biased sparsification for a master-worker type distributed architecture, and  studied sparsification in a federated learning context. For more recent work on the error-feedback idea, we refer the reader to  0. Finally, we note that while several compression algorithms have been proposed and analyzed over the years, fundamental performance bounds were only recently identified in   . Computationally efficient algorithms that match such performance bounds were developed in 1. While all the above results pertain to static optimization, some recent works have also explored quantization schemes in the context of sequential-decision making problems, focusing on multi-armed bandits 2 3 4.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: for (Distributed) Optimization and Learning.
