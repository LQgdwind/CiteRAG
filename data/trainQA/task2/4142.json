These features were used to\npredict firms‚Äô earnings and stock returns. A novel tree-structured LSTM was\nproposed to automatically measure the usefulness of financial news using\nboth text and cumulative abnormal returns . A\ndual-layer attention-based neural network model was developed to predict\nstock price movement using the text in financial news\n. Estimating the value of text in financial news\nis important because it drives the investment decision making process. Financial sentiment analysis is challenging because of lack of labeled data\nspecific to this domain. Moreover, the general-purpose pre-trained language\nmodels fail to capture the financial context.  proposed the\nFinBERT model, which can be fine-tuned on the financial sentiment analysis\ndataset (FiQA) to outperform the general BERT model. Besides financial news,\nin , the authors constructed textual features from\n10-K reports. They used these features to predict the future stock\nvolatility indicating the effectiveness of text. A deep learning model\ntrained on the SEC filings was used to improve the prediction of company‚Äôs\nstock price over the traditional ML models . The authors in  and [ref]11 extracted\nadditional textual features by expanding the L&M sentiment word\nlist¬† semantically and syntactically, using\nword2vec . Similarly, the uncertainty word list\nin L&M dictionary was expanded using word2vec to predict stock volatility\n. The authors in 0 expanded the\nL&M dictionary by training industry-specific word embedding models using\nword2vec to predict volatility, analyst forecast error and analyst\ndispersion. 1 showed how automatic domain\nadaption of the L&M sentiment list using word2vec\n improved the prediction of excess return and\nvolatility. The aforementioned dictionary expansion approaches used word2vec\nmodel to select the top kùëòk closest words to the words existing in the L&M\ndictionary. Since word2vec is a model based on static word embeddings, it\nfails to capture the dynamic context of the words.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: the effectiveness of text. A deep learning model\ntrained on the SEC filings was used to improve the prediction of company‚Äôs\nstock price over the traditional ML models .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
