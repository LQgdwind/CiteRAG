      "content": "Paper Title: ChiNet: Deep Recurrent Convolutional Learning for Multimodal Spacecraft Pose Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSpacecraft relative pose estimation is the problem of determining the rigid transformation between two\nspace bodies – one of which is controllable and carries the navigation sensors – in\nterms of their relative position and attitude. This is a requirement for close-range rendezvous (RV) which has traditionally been solved using active sensors such as lidar ; the task is significantly hampered when the target is said to be non-cooperative, i.e. it does not bear any supportive equipment towards the RV . Non-cooperative rendezvous (NCRV) operations involve the management of large relative velocities and minimal reaction times, justifying the need for autonomous operations and redundant sensors. As such, compact and lightweight passive digital cameras have become the cost-effective sensor for the task. Accordingly, the last couple of decades have focused on the development of robust image processing (IP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to accurately estimate the target’s six degree-of-freedom (DOF) pose from images obtained aboard the chaser . As the target is generally known beforehand, the followed strategies often choose to solve the model-to-image registration problem, under which the pose is retrieved via \\glsxtrlongpnp (\\glsxtrshort*pnp ) and \\glsxtrshortransac-based (\\glsxtrlong*ransac ) methods from correspondences between two-dimensional image features and three-dimensional model points. The challenge lies in robustly retrieving these correspondences in the face of hindering conditions such as shadows and sun glare, tumbling targets, or unknown initial poses. The former have been tackled in ground-based systems through multimodal sensing, but the fusion of each wavelength typically requires hand-crafted features, making its execution challenging  . On the other hand, it represents an area with the potential of largely benefiting from \\glsxtrshortdnn-based (\\glsxtrlong*dnn) estimation methods. In particular, \\glsxtrlongplcnn (\\glsxtrshortpl*cnn [ref]8) are naturally tailored to process such image inputs: here, the IP task is shifted completely to the network, and the effort becomes concentrated towards parameter optimisation and data modelling, allowing for the generalisation of the model to a wider swath of imaging conditions. The popularity of CNNs permeated onto the field of spacecraft relative pose estimation for rendezvous near the end of the past decade, mainly due to the European Space Agency (ESA) Kelvins Satellite Pose Estimation Challenge (SPEC),111https://kelvins.esa.int/satellite-pose-estimation-challenge. where the vast majority (if not all) of the competitors used \\glsxtrshortdnn-based approaches. SPEC benchmarked the participating algorithms on the \\glsxtrlongspeed (\\glsxtrshort*speed ), which consists of images of the Tango satellite generated under unrelated randomised poses. However, during an RV sequence, it is expected that the pose of the observed target continually varies as the operation progresses, i.e. the poses are correlated through time. This paper proposes the adoption of a recurrent neural network (RNN) module to process the features extracted by a CNN front-end model and to exploit this temporal correlation between acquired image frames in NCRV sequences. The resulting deep recurrent convolutional neural network (DRCNN) architecture, dubbed ChiNet,222Pronounced “kai-net”, the first term is an abbreviation of the Greek word “chimera”, meaning “something made up of parts of things that are different from each other”. is shown to provide a smoother and lower-error estimate of the 666-DOF pose when compared to a single CNN (Fig. 1 illustrates qualitative results on two NCRV sequences). Furthermore, ChiNet proposes a new three-step training regimen to learn features in a coarse-to-fine manner, which is inspired from traditional ML approaches. Lastly, ChiNet also explores the impact of multimodal sensing in the pose estimating by augmenting the number of input channels to the network with images from a long wavelength infrared (LWIR) camera, thus exploiting the natural ability of CNNs to autonomously extract features from images. The following contributions are proposed, to the best of the authors’ knowledge:\n\n\n1. The work represents the first use of RNNs, in particular long short-term memories (LSTMs), to tackle the problem of spacecraft pose estimation for RV using on-board cameras as the sole sensor;\n\n2. It is also the first to explore the potential benefit of a multimodal sensor input for the task, in particular in the visible and LWIR modalities, leveraging the power of deep learning to formulate it as an optimal process and surpassing the hurdles of classical approaches; and\n\n3. A multi-step optimisation approach to DNN training is devised to facilitate the learning and reduce the overall estimation error.\n\n The paper is organised as follows. Section II surveys the literature to highlight pertinent related work. Section III thoroughly details the methodology of each proposed contribution. Section IV presents the attained results. Lastly, Section V shares the conclusions of the work.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: On the other hand, it represents an area with the potential of largely benefiting from \\glsxtrshortdnn-based (\\glsxtrlong*dnn) estimation methods.
