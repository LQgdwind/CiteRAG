      "content": "Paper Title: PLE-SLAM: A Visual-Inertial SLAM Based on Point-Line Features and Efficient IMU Initialization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSimultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is the basis for realizing autonomous navigation of mobile robots and has received close attention from researchers in recent years. Although vision-based SLAM systems  [ref]3  are popular for their low hardware costs and good localization performance, they still have problems with challenging scenes such as fast motion, dynamic illumination, viewpoint change, and occlusion, etc. Inertial navigation is fearless of visual challenges, but cumulative drift makes it difficult to achieve long-term SLAM. Visual-inertial SLAM effectively makes up for the shortcomings of a single sensor by combining high-frequency inertial measurements and visual geometric information from different sensors. Nowadays, VI-SLAM and VIO systems[ref]5 [ref]6    0 are widely used in lots of practical products and have broad application prospects. This paper proposes a complete visual-inertial SLAM system consisting of a stereo camera and a signal IMU. Most existing visual-inertial SLAM systems are based on only point features and track through optical flow or descriptor matching. Due to the low calculation cost and high tracking efficiency of manual feature points1, point-based VI-SLAM systems are extensively researched and developed. However, these methods may suffer from issues in low-texture environments, such as tracking drift and failure of visual pose estimation. Although IMU can compensate for the pose estimation error caused by the lack of point features to a certain extent, long-term feature loss will cause the IMU accumulated error to be too unable to be effectively eliminated. Some methods2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 introduce line features that are common in artificial scenes in vision-based methods to provide more geometric constraints. Line features are more prevalent in artificial scenes and more robust to lighting and viewpoint change. We then incorporate line features0 into a stereo-inertial SLAM system. The proposed method uses two line segment projection constraints and one point projection constraints for visual bundle adjustment, dramatically improving tracking performance in challenging environments. In addition to stable tracking, the IMU initialization is also crucial for a visual-inertial system. Accurate initial values enable faster convergence of optimization functions. The IMU parameters that need to be estimated by VI-SLAM or VIO mainly include gyroscope bias, accelerometer bias, gravity vector, velocity and scale. Due to the constraints of the stereo extrinsic matrix in this work, we fix the scale to 1.0. IMU initialization is mainly divided into tightly-coupled methods1 2 and loosely-coupled methods3 4 5. Tightly-coupled methods estimate rotation with raw gyroscope measurements and calibrated camera IMU extrinsic matrix and then get the initialization parameters by solving a large matrix containing camera and accelerometer observations. These methods are time-consuming and ignore bias, which may lead to bad initial values on consumer-grade IMU devices. Some loosely-coupled methods estimate rotation using camera and gyroscope measurements, respectively, and then estimate inertial parameters iteratively. However, purely visual pose estimation is not robust enough for rotation and insufficient features. Inspired by 6 and 7, we convert point observations under a multi-camera system into line observations under a signal camera and propose an efficient visual-inertial initialization algorithm. The method estimates gyroscope bias utilizing 2D point-line observations and gyroscope measurements and solves other initial state variables through an analytical solution. In this work, we further employ deep neural networks (DNN) to improve the intelligence level of the system. First, a dynamic feature elimination module is integrated into the system to improve the localization accuracy in dynamic scenes. Second, the loop closing thread is modified to use deep features and matching technology to adapt to challenging environments and obtain more accurate loop frame pose estimation. All DNN-based modules are accelerated with TensorRT to ensure real-time. In summary, the main contributions of this study are as follows: To improve the accuracy and robustness of SLAM systems in challenging environments, we propose a visual-inertial SLAM based on point-line features. We merge or suppress unstable lines to ensure the stability of line features during tracking. The point and line features are tightly coupled in tracking and bundle adjustment processes. An efficient visual-inertial initialization method that contains a hybrid process of iterative and analytical solutions is presented. The gyroscope bias is directly optimized by a point-line rotation-only solution with visual observations. Accelerometer bias and gravity are solved by an analytical solution, which is faster than an iterative solution. All inertial parameters are refined through MAP in the back-end. To better adapt to complex scenes, we employ DNN-based methods in our system, which contains a dynamic feature elimination module and a modified loop closing thread using SuperPoint8 and SuperGlue9. The employment of DNN-based methods improves the stability and localization accuracy of the system in long-term operation in complex environments. All these innovations and engineering implementations of code make PLE-SLAM one of the state-of-the-art visual-inertial SLAM methods in complex environments. We release the code at https://github.com/HJMGARMIN/PLE-SLAM for the benefit of the community.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: and mapping (SLAM) is the basis for realizing autonomous navigation of mobile robots and has received close attention from researchers in recent years.
