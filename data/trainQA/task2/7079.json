      "content": "Paper Title: SC-MIL: Sparsely Coded Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe conducted various experiments on multiple datasets, including five classical MIL benchmarks, the MNIST-bags dataset , the CAMELYON16 dataset , and the Cancer Genome Atlas non-small cell lung cancer (TCGA-NSCLC) dataset to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Classical MIL benchmarks. The five classical MIL benchmark datasets consist of MUSK1, MUSK2, FOX, TIGER, and ELEPHANT dataset. The MUSK1 and MUSK2 datasets are used to predict the impacts of drugs given the molecule conformations. Each bag consists of several conformations of the same molecule.\nThe label for the bag is positive if at least one of its conformations has the desired drug effect and negative if none is effective . The FOX, TIGER, and ELEPHANT datasets identify if the target animal is presented in a bag. Each bag consists of a set of features extracted from segments of an image. Positive bags refer to images that contain the animals of interest, whereas negative bags are images where no such animal is present . MNIST-bags dataset. The MNIST-bags dataset  consists of bags made up of a random number of grayscale handwritten digits (instances) from the MNIST dataset. Following , the digit of interest was designated as ’9’, and any bag containing at least one instance of ’9’ was labeled as positive. The average number of instances per bag was set to ten, with a standard deviation of two.\nWe used this dataset for explanations after incorporating the proposed SC module into attention-based MIL . CAMELYON16 dataset. The CAMELYON16 is a publicly available WSI dataset for detecting metastatic breast cancer in lymph node tissue. The dataset consists of 399 WSIs (one corrupted sample was discarded) of lymph node tissue, officially split into a training set of 270 samples and a testing set of 129 samples. Each WSI is accompanied by a binary label, annotated by pathologists, indicating the presence or absence of metastatic cancer in the lymph node tissue. The dataset also includes detailed annotations of the regions of interest within each WSI that contains cancerous tissue. By following the preprocessing procedures outlined in [ref]7, we cropped the WSIs into non-over-lapping patches of size 224×224224224224\\times 224. This resulted in\na total of around 3.37 million patches at ×20absent20\\times 20 magnification, with an average of 8451 patches per bag. TCGA-NSCLC dataset. The TCAGA-NSCLC is a different WSI dataset that is used for identifying two sub-types of lung cancer: lung squamous cell carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma. Following [ref]7, we divided a total of 1037 diagnostic WSIs into a training set of 744, a validation set of 83, and a testing set of 210 WSIs. After performing the identical preprocessing applied to the CAMELYON16 dataset, roughly 10.30 million patches were extracted at a ×20absent20\\times 20 magnification level. On average, each bag consisted of 10355 patches. Feature Extractor. The five classical MIL benchmarks comprise pre-extracted feature vectors of instances. A simple FFN with the same architecture as in [ref]21  was deployed for further feature embedding.\nIn the case of the MNIST-bags dataset, we employed the identical feature extractor (i.e., LeNet5 [ref]40) and instance-level embedding network as those used in .\nWe adopted the ResNet-18  as the feature extractor for WSI classification by removing the last fully-connected layer (see Figure 1). After passing through the feature extractor, each patch in WSIs is embedded into a 512-dimensional vector.\nWe evaluated two distinct pre-training techniques. The first one involved pre-training ResNet-18 on the ImageNet, which is released by PyTorch. Given the effectiveness of self-supervised pre-training, we adapted contrastive learning as the second pre-training method.\nFollowing the same experimental settings of [ref]7, we pre-trained the feature extractor on the training set of CAMELYON16 and TCGA-NSCLC, separately, using the SimCLR framework .\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: the lymph node tissue. The dataset also includes detailed annotations of the regions of interest within each WSI that contains cancerous tissue. By following the preprocessing procedures outlined in [ref]7, we cropped the WSIs into non-over-lapping patches of size 224×224224224224\\times 224. This resulted in\na total of around 3.37 million patches at ×20absent20\\times 20 magnification, with an\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
