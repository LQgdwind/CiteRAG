      "content": "Paper Title: Backtracking (the) Algorithms on the Hamiltonian Cycle Problem\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIt is a fresh awakening that even for graphs of v=32ùë£32v=32, which is relatively small, and the theoretical computational effort required relatively futile, the optimization procedures still make such a large difference. Generally speaking, these procedures appear to pay off in the number of recursions required to decide a graph, especially further away from the Koml√≥s-Szemer√©di bound. When measured in system time however, a different view emerges. The average time to decide a graph hugely increases, especially in denser regions away from the Koml√≥s-Szemer√©di bound. The big question is how these effects scale up, and whether the increase in search pruning effort really pays off on a larger scale, and whether that counts for recursions, for system time, or for both. Furthermore, the distribution of edge pruning techniques, branching heuristics and non-Hamiltonicity checks among the algorithms is largely haphazard. This is because for now, we tried to stick as closely as possible to historical conventions handed down to us from literature, but a more structured approach might be desirable. Furthermore, it is quite surprising to see the Rubin‚Äôs algorithm, which is the second oldest algorithm, overaging Van Horn‚Äôs by more than four decades, contained the most sophisticated procedures, but also performed best. On the other side, it is a little desillusioning to find Cetal‚Äôs algorithm, so oftenly cited, finishing last in this test. Finally, some thought must be given to whether other edge pruning techniques, branching heuristics or checks could be devised, and in what order such procedures should be applied. Last but not least, it might still pay off to dynamically rearrange the data structure in some way as to make the degree preference in branching dynamically applicable. It should be noted though that this might be programmistically tough, as backtracking would the require un-sorting the dynamically rearranged data structure. For this study, we made 20 graphs for every possible edge density. Although this procedure is rigourously systematic, it also allows for some skewness in the results: in the end, there is structurally speaking, just one possible graph with one edge. On the other end of the density spectrum, we have 20 ‚Äòrandom‚Äô graphs with with 496 edges, all being fully connected, and thereby isomorphic. As the number of different graphs for vùë£v vertices and eùëíe edges is equal to (12‚Äãv‚Äã(v‚àí1)e)binomial12ùë£ùë£1ùëí{\\frac{1}{2}v(v-1)}\\choose{e}, the maximum number of different graphs can be found at 248 edges for 32 vertices, which is exactly halfway the Figures 4 and 5. So if every existible graph of for v=32ùë£32v=32 was equally likely, most of the graphs would a) be Hamiltonian and b) be easy, at least for the best three of our algorithms. For larger graphs, this effect grows stronger as the Koml√≥s-Szemer√©di bound grows (double) logarithmically in vùë£v, whereas the peak existence grows (half) quadratically. A really weird but inescapable conclusion therefore is, that for larger values of vùë£v, nearly all instances are Hamiltonian, and many of those might be easy. This does not hold for our results, or that of Cetal, Vacul and Van Horn et al., who all ‚Äòcolumnized‚Äô their graphs into different degree categories. But combined, the combinatorial assessment and the columnized results show that the prediction of instance hardness for the Hamiltonian cycle problem critically relies on the a priori availability of information of the graph(s) to be solved, even if one future algorithm turns out to be superior. And this brings us to the last point, tying the discussion back to the preamble. It has been shown that for at least one algorithm, Vacul‚Äôs in this case, the hardest instances are non-Hamiltonian, very far away from the Koml√≥s-Szemer√©di bound, in a very dense region of the combinatorial space  (also see ). This observation apparently contradicts nearly everything that was written in the previous paragraph, but can be explained from the randomness in large ensembles of problem instances such as used in this study. The found extremely hard instances were structured, and abiding by the teachings of A. N. Kolmogorov, structured objects in large randomized ensembles are rare . So finding these instances paradoxically means knowing where to look, and one way to do that is to use a parameter-unsensitive evolutionary algorithm such as Plant Propagation . For very large graphs, one could better resort to a single-individual search heuristic, such as HillClimbing or simulated annealing [ref]48. On the other end of the scale, the use of large randomized ensembles for algorithmic performance raises some questions. Although proper benchmarking is becoming a hot topic , the issue of randomness herein is still seldomly discussed and needs more attention.\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: evolutionary algorithm such as Plant Propagation .
