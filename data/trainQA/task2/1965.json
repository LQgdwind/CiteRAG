      "content": "Paper Title: Audio Retrieval with Natural Language Queries\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe large amounts of data being generated in recent years have prompted a real need to search evergrowing databases.\nA search query typically comprises natural language (text), which allows expressing virtually any concept.\nSpanning multiple modalities, different retrieval strategies were developed for content as diverse as text (including webpages and books), images [ref]1, and videos  .\nSurprisingly, while search engines currently exist for these modalities (e.g. Google, Flickr and YouTube, respectively), unstructured audio is not accessible in the same way.\nThe aim of this paper is to address this gap. It is important to distinguish content-based retrieval from that based on meta-data, such as the title of a video or song or an audio tag.\nMeta-data retrieval is feasible for manually-curated databases such as song or movie catalogs. However, content-based retrieval is more important in user-generated data, which often has little structure or meta-data.\nThere are methods to search for audio which matches an audio query  [ref]5, but satisfying the requirement to input an example audio query can be difficult for a human (e.g. making convincing frog sounds is difficult).\nWe, on the other hand, propose a framework which enables the querying of a sound database using detailed free-form natural language descriptions of the desired sound (e.g. “A man talking as music is playing followed by a frog croaking.”).\nThis enables the retrieval of audio data which matches the temporal sequence of events in the query instead of just a single class tag.\nFurthermore, natural language queries are a familiar user interface widely used in current search engines. Therefore, our proposed audio retrieval with free-form text queries could be a first step towards more natural and flexible audio-only search. Text-based audio retrieval could also be beneficial for video retrieval. The majority of recent works that address the text-based video retrieval task focuses heavily on the visual and text domains [ref]1   . Since audio and visual information inherently have natural semantic alignment for a significant portion of video data, text-based audio retrieval could also be used for querying video databases by only considering the audio stream of the video data.\nThis would allow for video retrieval in the audio domain at reduced computational cost for cases in which audio and visual information correspond, with applications for low-power IoT devices, such as microphones in natural habitats, of particular interest for conservation and biology.\nHistorical archives with extensive sound collections, such as the BBC Sound Effects Archive, would be easier to search, facilitating historical research and public access.\nFurthermore, text-based retrieval could enable appealing creative applications, such as automatically finding sounds which correspond to input text. This could be especially useful given the growing popularity of audio podcasts and audiobooks which are often supplemented with (background) sounds that match their content. We propose two new benchmarks for text-based audio retrieval, based on the AudioCaps [ref]8 and Clotho  datasets. The former consists of a subset of 10-second audio clips from the AudioSet dataset  with additional human-written audio captions, while the latter contains audio captions for sounds sourced from the Freesound platform , varying between 15 and 30 seconds in duration.\nIn contrast to sound event class labels, audio captions contain detailed information about the sounds. A user searching for a particular sound would usually describe the sound using text similar to an audio caption. AudioCaps [ref]8 and Clotho  allow to leverage the matching audio-caption pairs to train text-based audio retrieval frameworks. To establish baselines for this task, we adapt existing video retrieval frameworks for audio retrieval. We employ multiple pre-trained audio expert networks and show that using an ensemble of audio experts improves audio retrieval. In summary, we make three contributions:\n(1) we introduce two new benchmarks for free-form text-based audio retrieval—to the best of our knowledge, these represent the first public benchmarks for this task;\n(2) we provide baseline performances with existing multi-modal video retrieval models that we adapt to text-based audio retrieval;\n(3) we demonstrate the benefits of combining multiple pre-training datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: which allows expressing virtually any concept.\nSpanning multiple modalities, different retrieval strategies were developed for content as diverse as text (including webpages and books), images [ref]1, and videos  .\nSurprisingly, while search engines currently exist for these modalities (e.g. Google, Flickr and YouTube, respectively), unstructured audio is not accessible in the same\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
