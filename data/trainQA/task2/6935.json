      "content": "Paper Title: Iterative Multi-granular Image Editing using Diffusion Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate the ‘iterative’ and ‘multi-granular’ aspects of our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively. We use examples from IMIE-Bench and compare against three baseline approaches. Two of these include iteratively passing the edited image through two image editing methods: InstructPix2Pix [ref]2 and Plug and Play [ref]28. These methods are representative of two kinds of approaches for diffusion-based image editors. Plug and Play uses DDIM inversion to project the image to the latent space of the diffusion model, while InstructPix2Pix learns a few new layers to directly pass the input image into the model. The third baseline is to concatenate all the instructions received until a time step, and pass it through InstructPix2Pix along with the original image. We show these results in the following sections. Further, to better understand the multi-granular local editing aspect of EMILIE, we compare with two recent state-of-the-art mask-based image editing methods:\nDiffEdit [ref]4 and Blended Latent Diffusion  on the EditBench  dataset. We could not compare with Imagen Editor  because their code, models or results are not publicly available. We use two complementary metrics for quantitative evaluation: first, we compute the CLIP  similarity score of the edited image with the input edit instruction and the second is a text-text similarity score, where BLIP 4 is used to first caption the generated image, and it is then compared with the edit instruction.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: We use examples from IMIE-Bench and compare against three baseline approaches.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
