      "content": "Paper Title: A Case for Transparent Reliability in DRAM Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo effectively mitigate RowHammer bit flips, a mitigation mechanism must be\nconfigured based on the vulnerability level of a given DRAM chip. This requires\nestimating the chip’s RowHammer error characteristics for different operating\nconditions and access patterns. Each of the four mechanism types introduced in\nSection 2.1.4 requires estimating different\ncharacteristics. Table 1 summarizes the different\npieces of information required for each mitigation type. The first is known as\nHCfirstsubscriptHCfirst\\mathrm{HC}_{\\mathrm{first}}   or RowHammer\nThreshold   , which describes the worst-case number of RowHammer\nmemory accesses required to induce a bit-flip. The second is known as the blast\nradius  , which describes how many rows\nare affected by hammering a single row. The third is the DRAM’s internal\nphysical row address mapping  , which is\nnecessary to identify the locations of victim rows. All three RowHammer error characteristics vary between DRAM manufacturers,\nchips, and cells based on a combination of random process variation, a\nmanufacturers’ particular circuit design (including yield-management techniques\nsuch as post-manufacturing repair, target row refresh, and error correcting\ncodes), and operating conditions such as temperature and\nvoltage         [ref]298. Therefore, as with estimating DRAM refresh and\naccess timings (discussed in Sections 5.2\nand 6.2), these studies rely on extensive\nexperimental testing to estimate RowHammer error characteristics that are needed\nto design and/or configure the RowHammer defenses discussed in\nSection 2.1.4.\n\nReference markers found: [298]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]298: design (including yield-management techniques\nsuch as post-manufacturing repair, target row refresh, and error correcting\ncodes), and operating conditions such as temperature and\nvoltage         [ref]298. Therefore, as with estimating DRAM refresh and\naccess timings (discussed in Sections 5.2\nand 6.2), these studies rely on extensive\nexperimental testing to estimate RowHammer error\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
