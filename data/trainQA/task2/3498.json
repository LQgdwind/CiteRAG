      "content": "Paper Title: Amodal Panoptic Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe introduce a total of six baselines for our proposed amodal panoptic segmentation task. We create the baselines by building upon the EfficientPS  model which is a state-of-the-art top-down panoptic segmentation network. The EfficientPS architecture consists of four parts. The first part is the shared backbone which is a combination of an encoder and a feature pyramid network (FPN) variant. We employ the EfficientNet-B5  model as the encoder and remove its squeeze and excitation  connections. We also replace the batch normalization and activation layers with synchronized Inplace Activated Batch Normalization (iABN sync)  and Leaky ReLU activations respectively. The backbone uses the 2-way FPN  on top of the encoder to bidirectionally aggregate multi-scale features. The encoded multi-scale features from the backbone are then propagated to an instance and semantic head. The instance head is a variant of Mask R-CNN  where the convolution operation in the mask prediction heads is replaced by depth-wise separable convolutions. The semantic segmentation head incorporates various modules to focus on modeling of different feature representations: DPC  for capturing long-range contextual information, LSFE  for capturing characteristic features, and MC  for aligning mismatched correction modules. The final component of EfficientPS is an adaptive fusion module that fuses the output of instance and semantic head based on their logits. In the baseline architectures, we keep all the components of EfficientPS intact except for the instance segmentation head which is replaced by different state-of-the-art amodal instance segmentation heads namely, Amodal EfficientPS, ORCNN [ref]6, VQ-VAE [ref]12, Shape Prior 6, ASN 5, and BCNet . In the following, we provide a brief overview of the amodal instance segmentation heads of the baselines. Amodal-EfficientPS is an extension of its inmodal variant and relies implicitly on the network to learn the relationship between the occluder and occludee along with modeling the appropriate class-specific structures. Fig. 8.1 3(a) presents the amodal instance head of Amodal-EfficientPS. ORCNN [ref]6 employs an invisible mask prediction head in addition to the inmodal and amodal mask prediction heads, to explicitly learn the propagation from visible mask to amodal mask. To do so, the approach designs the invisible mask prediction by abstracting the amodal mask from the visible mask. Fig. 8.1 3(b) shows the amodal instance head of ORCNN. ASN 5 head emphasizes the importance of global information in addition to visible cues for amodal mask prediction. Fig. 8.1 3(c) presents the ASN amodal instance head. It consists of an additional occlusion classification branch and uses the features from this branch through a multi-level coding (MLC) block to impart the learned global information to the individual inmodal and amodal mask prediction head. The MLC block essentially takes the concatenation of bounding box features and occlusion features from their respective classification branches, performs a series of transpose convolution-convolution operations to process the collective features, and then concatenates it with the model-specific mask features. This is followed by another series of convolution operations to generate the final modal-specific mask predictions. Shape Prior 6 approach strongly supports the idea of using the visible region segmentation in conjunction with shape priors as the key to better amodal mask segmentation. Fig. 8.1 3(d) depicts the amodal instance head of this approach. The aforementioned head employs two modal-specific fully convolutional network heads with parameter sharing. The first modal-specific heads give the initial mask predictions that are further used as attention for refining the final mask predictions with a feature matching loss and pre-trained shape prior autoencoder. Additionally, the approach also incorporates the shape-prior autoencoder in the non-maximum suppression step of the amodal bounding boxes 7. VQ-VAE [ref]12 seeks to incorporate shape prior information through discrete shape codes while using Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder for mask segmentation. Fig. 8.1 3(e) shows the amodal instance head of VQ-VAE. BCNet  models occluder and occludee with a bilayer GCN layer. To be precise, the approach first predicts the occluder mask and contour segmentation and uses these occluder features in conjunction with the ROI features to segment the occludee or the target object in a class agnostic manner. Fig. 8.1 3(f) presents the amodal instance head of this approach. In contrast, our APSNet employs FCN based class agnostic occluder mask segmentation head to coarsely model the occlusion regions of the target object as a strong prior and is further refined in a spatially independent manner with an occlusion mask segmentation head. Moreover, we use additional processing blocks with spatio-channel attention to explicitly model the underlying relationship among occluder (general location and shape of the occluded region), occludee (visible region), and the occlusion (precise shape of the occluded region) features before finally computing the amodal mask segmentation. Fig. 4 illustrates our fragmentation of the amodal bounding box of a target object. To summarize, for a better amodal perception performance, an amodal instance head should have the ability to decipher the existence of occlusion regions and be able to reason about the shape given the visible region features. We build our APSNet on these two core ideas.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: the components of EfficientPS intact except for the instance segmentation head which is replaced by different state-of-the-art amodal instance segmentation heads namely, Amodal EfficientPS, ORCNN [ref]6, VQ-VAE [ref]12, Shape Prior 6, ASN 5, and BCNet .
