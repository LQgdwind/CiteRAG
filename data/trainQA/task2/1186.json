      "content": "Paper Title: Logically Consistent Loss for Visual Question Answering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA Visual Question Answering task is correctly answering a question given visual clues. It comprises of understanding this visual signal structurally and the question semantically; then, systematically reasoning and inferring a probable answer. Inconsistency in answering related questions about the same object or subject given makes claims of truly intelligent Visual Question Answer (VQA) solutions , questionable and brittle. State-of-the-art VQA methods     are often trained with batches of random questions regardless of its semantic relation to other questions. Therefore, such VQA solutions would struggle to understand underlying intents, occurring in other related questions.\nIn addition, this may cause inconsistencies between answers if the questions are not parsed correctly or a reasoning system is unable to extract and chain question-relevant concepts and relations accurately. As an example, Figure 1 shows that they easily give wrong answer (red answer) to one of questions in three families of questions given corresponding images. One wrong answer puts the cloud of skeptism over whether a VQA can truly do visual reasoning task or it simply exhibits statistical correlation between questions and answers. Two main causes of inconsistent VQA solutions are the inability to comprehend rephrased queries with different linguistic forms and the ignorance of semantically related queries. Existing works to enhance consistency form two lines of research: introducing more consistent samples [ref]22[ref]20[ref]6 and using logic in parsing textural questions into logical queries  . These works focus on a pair of consistent samples or logically parse an individual question; however, they ignore semantic structures between related questions about the same subject / object in an image. Different from above solutions, our work enforces consistency across families of questions with unique semantic tasks. In particular, we make use of the recently introduced GQA data set, where each question is assigned a semantic task, and the relationships between questions are specified. These extra pieces of knowledge are utilized to form a logic-induced loss at training time in a multi-task learning setting. At test time, however, the trained model does not assume the availability of these labels. For an arbitrary question posed by the end user, the model recognizes the semantic task and provides an answer instead. This strategy of ”train jointly - test independently” is practical because questions at test time can be random in order and in time. More specifically, the semantic relations between these tasks are pre-defined by entailment graphs (c.f. Fig. 14 in Supplementary Material of ). In line with Tarski et al.  who define consistency in the context of deductive logic that evidences should not generate entailed contradiction, we introduce a logic rule for consistency: for all questions in a family if semantic tasks of two related questions are correctly predicted, their respective answers are both correctly predicted as well. We introduce our method, that is, applying T-norm fuzzy logic to translate the stated logic into a consistent-augmented loss function which can be used for a wide-rage of VQA solutions. In this work, we are experimenting this novel loss function with MAC-net  as our chosen VQA machine but we wish to emphasize that the solution is general and agnostic of the underlying backbone model.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: queries with different linguistic forms and the ignorance of semantically related queries.
