      "content": "Paper Title: Planning from Pixels in Environments with Combinatorially Hard Search Spaces\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe idea of learning to model an environment has been widely explored in recent years.\nWork by Oh et al.  and Chiappa et al.  has argued that modern machine learning architectures are capable of learning to model the dynamics of a generic environment reasonably well for non-trivial time horizons.\nThe seminal work by Ha and Schmidhuber  built upon this by learning a world model in a low-dimensional latent space instead of conditioning predictions on observations. They achieved this by training a VAE on reconstructing observations and a recurrent network for sampling latent trajectories conditioned on an action sequence. Moreover, they showed how sample efficiency could be addressed by recovering a simple controller acting directly on latent representations through an evolutionary approach. This initial idea was iteratively improved along two main directions. On one hand, some subsequent works focused on learning objectives and suggested to jointly train encoding and dynamics components.\nHafner et al. [ref]18 introduced a multi-step variational inference objective to encourage latent representations to be predictive of the future and propagate information through both deterministic and stochastic paths.\nOn the other hand, authors proposed to learn to act in the latent space by using zero-order methods [ref]18 such as CEM  or policy gradient techniques [ref]19 [ref]20. These improvements gradually led to strong model-based RL agents capable of achieving very competitive performance in continuous control tasks [ref]19 and on the Atari Learning Environment   [ref]20. Relying on image reconstruction can however lead to vulnerability to visual noise: to overcome this limitation Okada and Taniguchi  and Zhang et al.  forgo the decoder network, while the latter proposes to rely on the notion of bisimilarity to learn meaningful representations.\nSimilarly, Gelada et al.  only learn to predict rewards and action-conditional state distributions, but only study this task as an additional loss to model-free reinforcement learning methods.\nAnother relevant approach is that of , who propose to learn a discrete graph representation of the environment, but their final goal is that of recovering a series of subgoals for model-free RL. A strong example of how world models can be coupled with classical planners is given by MuZero . MuZero trains a recurrent world model to guide a Monte Carlo tree search by encouraging hidden states to be predictive of future states and a sparse reward signal. While we adopt a similar framework, we focus on recovering a discrete structure in the latent space in order to reidentify states and lower the complexity of the search procedure. Moreover, we do not rely on reward signals, but only focus on learning the dynamics of the environment. In recent years, several other authors have explored the intersection between representation learning and classical algorithms. This is the case, for instance,\nof Kuo et al. , Kumar et al. , Ichter and Pavone  who rely on sequence models or VAEs to propose trajectories for sampling-based planners.\nWithin planning research, Yonetani et al.  introduce a differentiable version of the A* search algorithm that can learn suitable representations from images with supervision.\nThe most relevant line of work to us is perhaps the one that attempts to learn representations that are suitable as an input for classical solvers.\nWithin this area, Asai and Fukunaga , Asai and Muise  show how symbolic representations can be extracted from complex tasks in an end-to-end fashion and directly fed into off-the-shelf solvers.\nMore recently, Vlastelica et al. 0 frames MDPs as shortest-path problems and trains a convolutional neural network to retrieve the weights of a fixed graph structure.\nThe extracted graph representation can be solved with a combinatorial solver and trained end-to-end by leveraging the blackbox differentiation method . A further direction of relevant research is that of planning to achieve multiple goals . While the most common approaches involve learning a goal-conditioned policy with experience relabeling , the recently proposed GLAMOR 4 relies on learning inverse dynamics and retrieves policies through a recurrent network. By doing so, it can achieve visual goals without explicitly modeling a reward function, an approach that is sensibly closer to ours and can serve as a relevant comparison.\nAnother method that sharing a similar setting to ours is LEAP 1, which also attempts to fuse reinforcement learning and planning; however, its approach is fundamentally different and designed for dense rewards and continuous control.\nSimilarly, SPTM 7 pursues a similar direction, but requires exploratory traversals in the current environment, which would be particularly hard to obtain due to procedural generation.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: was iteratively improved along two main directions. On one hand, some subsequent works focused on learning objectives and suggested to jointly train encoding and dynamics components.\nHafner et al.
