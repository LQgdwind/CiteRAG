Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

All implementations work for both ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2} and ℝ3superscriptℝ3\\mathbb{R}^{3}. CGAL: sequential C++ implementation of Welzl’s algorithm in CGAL . Orthant-scan: our implementation of Larsson et al.’s orthant-scan algorithm [ref]41. Sampling: our parallel sampling algorithm described in\nSection 4. Welzl: our parallel implementation of Welzl’s\nalgorithm described in Section 4. WelzlMtf: the same as Welzl, but with the move-to-front heuristic . WelzlMtfPivot: the same as Welzl, but with both the move-to-front and the pivoting heuristic . For smallest enclosing ball,\nwe show the comparison across implementations using 36 cores with two-way hyper-threading in\nFigure 10.\nOur fastest parallel implementations\nhave speedups of 70–178x (109x on average) over CGAL.\nOn one thread, our fastest implementations achieve speedup of 2.81–7.05x\n(4.96x on average) over CGAL. Our sampling-based method is the fastest for eight out of the twelve\ndata sets,\nwhereas Orthant-scan without sampling is the fastest for the\nother four.\nWe observe that the sampling phase on average scans\nonly about 5%percent55\\% of the data set, and results in up to 2.55x (1.47x on average) speedup\ncompared to just running Orthant-scan.\nComparing across different implementations of Welzl’s algorithms,\nwe see that the move-to-front, and the pivoting heuristic implemented\nin parallel consistently improve the running times.\nSpecifically,\nWelzlMtf is 2.09–13.9x\nfaster than Welzl, and WelzlMtfPivot is 3.4–58.6x faster than Welzl.\nWe also see that Sampling and Orthant-scan are\n4.63–34.8x and 2.96–40.3x faster than WelzlMtfPivot, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: and ℝ3superscriptℝ3\\mathbb{R}^{3}.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
