      "content": "Paper Title: DyEdgeGAT: Dynamic Edge via Graph Attention for Early Fault Detection in IIoT Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe increasing deployment of sensors in industrial systems has enabled the collection of extensive Multivariate Time Series (MTS) data, facilitating the condition monitoring of complex systems to detect the onset of critical faults as early as possible .\nThe complex dynamics of monitored systems, characterized by interconnected subsystems and components, often result in strong spatial-temporal dynamics of the heterogeneous MTS data [ref]2 . Due to the high interdependencies in the data, it becomes more challenging to detect incipient faults in such systems. Effective fault detection is crucial for preventing severe system failures and improving system reliability.\nParticularly, detecting faults at their early stage can also contribute to extending the useful lifetime of components by preventing too early preventive replacements. Taking preemptive actions based on early fault detection can be instrumental in maintaining optimal system performance and avoiding costly disruptions.\nWhile fault detection is relatively straightforward at higher severity levels when faults have fully manifested in the sensor measurements, identifying incipient faults, where they have not yet caused noticeable impacts on the system’s performance, poses a greater challenge [ref]4.\nThe primary difficulty lies in detecting subtle changes, while an additional challenge arises from the risk of overly sensitive algorithms, potentially leading to an excessive number of false alarms . Different types of faults, each with different difficulties to detect, can affect the system. These range from sensor faults that only impact one signal and are relatively straightforward to detect, to complex faults that affect multiple components. The latter often leads to secondary fault impacts and are considerably harder to detect . Since faults are rare, recently unsupervised fault detection methods have been increasingly applied, influenced by advancements in anomaly detection research. One type of faults that current state-of-the-art methods have insufficiently addressed is the detection of changes in relationship between signals and components. Such faults can remain undetected for extended periods because the individual observations may appear to exhibit healthy conditions in terms of their functional behavior . To effectively detect a change in these functional relationships, it is essential to accurately model these relationships.\nTraditionally, modeling relationships between MTS in the IIoT context has mainly focused on two aspects: explicit functional relationship modeling and dynamics modeling.\nFeedford Neural Networks (FNN)  and Autoencoders (AE)  have been successful in explicit functional relationship modeling. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) 0 and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) 1 have been successful at capturing system dynamics. However, these methods often fall short of addressing spatial-temporal dynamics within complex systems.\nIn response to these limitations, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising alternative 23.\nBy establishing a graph structure from the MTS data, with each time series represented as a node and edges indicating interactions between different time series, GNNs can learn the spatial-temporal relationships between the sensors 4.\nTable I provides a comparative analysis of different approaches in modeling these relationships.\nSeveral Spatial-Temporal GNN (STGNN)-based methods have been developed specifically for modeling spatial-temporal dynamics within IIoT systems.\nFor instance, Multivariate Time-series Anomaly Detection via Graph Attention Networks (MTADGAT) 5 utilizes graph attention networks (GATs) to simultaneously construct a feature-oriented graph and a time-oriented graph, capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Additionally, Graph Deviation Network (GDN) 6 employs node embeddings to capture the unique characteristics of each sensor and utilizes an attention mechanism incorporating these sensor embeddings to better predict the future behavior of sensors, addressing the heterogeneity of sensor data in IIoT. While these methods effectively model spatial-temporal dynamics within MTS, they generally overlook the evolution of functional relationships between system variables. This aspect is crucial for accurately detecting changes in relationships, which are often indicative of system faults. Current spatial-temporal GNNs are unable to capture these dynamic changes.\nTracking relationship shifts within IIoT systems to enable early fault detection poses two main challenges:\n Static graph relation. Existing STGNNs typically assume the relationship in the MTS data within a defined observation time period does not change. While these approaches can partially account for the dynamics within the data by constructing a new graph for a new observation window, they cannot capture the temporal evolution of relationships (edge weights) within the data. Distinguishing faults from novel operating conditions. Training data collected under healthy conditions may not contain all operational scenarios. Identifying whether relationship shifts in test time arise from faults or novel operating conditions remains challenging. To address the limitations outlined above, we introduce DyEdgeGAT (Dynamic Edge via Graph Attention), a novel framework designed to capture relationship shifts in MTS data for effective early fault detection.\nDyEdgeGAT addresses the challenge of static graph inference by dynamically inferring edges between time series, and constructing an aggregated temporal graph for MTS data. This enables us to capture not only node dynamics (i.e., the intrinsic dynamics of a sensor) but also edge dynamics (i.e., the evolving relationships between sensors). The term “dynamic” in DyEdgeGAT specifically refers to the evolving sequence of edge weights over time, reflecting the evolution of pairwise relationships between nodes in the temporal graph. This is contrary to the definition used in previous methods that define it as constructing a new static graph per observation window.\nTo address the challenge of distinguishing fault-induced relationship changes from novel operating conditions, DyEdgeGAT innovatively differentiates between system-dependent variables (e.g., control variables that are explicitly set and external factors outside of the system) and system-independent variables (e.g., measurement variables of system internal states) during model construction. Faults typically manifest in system-dependent variables, while system-independent variables, which contain information on operating conditions, may remain unaffected by faults but significantly influence system-dependent variables. Incorporating the context of operating conditions into node dynamics extraction enables the model to more accurately separate actual faults from novel operating conditions.\n\n\nTo summarize, our key contributions are as follows: Dynamic edge construction for MTS graph inference: The proposed DyEdgeGAT algorithm dynamically constructs edges between time series signals, enabling the model to capture the evolution of pairwise relationships. Operating condition-aware node dynamics modeling: System-independent variables in the node dynamics extraction and reconstruction are modeled in different ways within DyEdgeGAT, enabling the distinction between faults and novel operating conditions. Temporal topology-informed anomaly scoring: The proposed anomaly score incorporates temporal topology to account for the diverse strengths in sensor dynamics within IIoT systems with heterogeneous signals. Comprehensive performance evaluation: We evaluated the proposed DyEdgeGAT algorithm on synthetic and real-world datasets across varying fault severities, multiple fault types, and novel operating conditions and compared it to a wide range of algorithms. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:\nSec. II reviews related work in unsupervised fault and anomaly detection for time series data, graph learning from multivariate time series, and GNN-based fault and anomaly detection. Sec. III elaborates on DyEdgeGAT’s core components. Sec. IV introduces the case studies along with data statistics. Sec. V outlines the experimental design, including baseline methods and the evaluation metrics. Sec. VI presents and discusses our results. Finally, Sec. VII provides conclusions and suggests future research directions.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: as possible .\nThe complex dynamics of monitored systems, characterized by interconnected subsystems and components, often result in strong spatial-temporal dynamics of the heterogeneous MTS data [ref]2 .
