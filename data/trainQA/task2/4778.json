      "content": "Paper Title: Option-Aware Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Control\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs proposed in [ref]6, an option Z∈𝒵𝑍𝒵Z\\in\\mathcal{Z} can be described with three components: an initiation set IZ⊆𝒮subscript𝐼𝑍𝒮I_{Z}\\subseteq\\mathcal{S}, an intra-option policy πZ​(A|S):𝒮×𝒜→ :subscript𝜋𝑍conditional𝐴𝑆→𝒮𝒜01\\pi_{Z}(A|S):\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow , and a termination function βZ​(S):𝒮→ :subscript𝛽𝑍𝑆→𝒮01\\beta_{Z}(S):\\mathcal{S}\\rightarrow . An option Z𝑍Z is available in state S𝑆S if and only if S∈IZ𝑆subscript𝐼𝑍S\\in I_{Z}. Once the option is taken, actions are selected according to πZsubscript𝜋𝑍\\pi_{Z} until it terminates stochastically according to βZsubscript𝛽𝑍\\beta_{Z}, i.e., the termination probability at the current state. A new option will be activated in this call-and-return\nstyle by a high-level policy π𝒵​(Z|S):𝒮×𝒵→ :subscript𝜋𝒵conditional𝑍𝑆→𝒮𝒵01\\pi_{\\mathcal{Z}}(Z|S):\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{Z}\\rightarrow  once the last option terminates. In this way, π𝒵​(Z|S)subscript𝜋𝒵conditional𝑍𝑆\\pi_{\\mathcal{Z}}(Z|S) and πZ​(A|S)subscript𝜋𝑍conditional𝐴𝑆\\pi_{Z}(A|S) constitute a hierarchical policy for a certain task. However, it’s inconvenient to deal with the initiation set IZsubscript𝐼𝑍I_{Z} and termination function βZsubscript𝛽𝑍\\beta_{Z} while learning this hierarchical policy. Thus, in  , they adopt the one-step option framework. It’s assumed that each option is available in each state, i.e., IZ=𝒮,∀Z∈𝒵formulae-sequencesubscript𝐼𝑍𝒮for-all𝑍𝒵I_{Z}=\\mathcal{S},\\forall Z\\in\\mathcal{Z}. Also, the high-level and low-level (i.e., intra-option) policy are redefined as πθsubscript𝜋𝜃\\pi_{\\theta} and πϕsubscript𝜋italic-ϕ\\pi_{\\phi} respectively: where Z′superscript𝑍′Z^{\\prime} denotes the option in the last time step and δZ=Z′subscript𝛿𝑍superscript𝑍′\\delta_{Z=Z^{\\prime}} is the indicator function. We can see that if the previous option terminates (with probability βZ′​(S)subscript𝛽superscript𝑍′𝑆\\beta_{Z^{\\prime}}(S)), the agent will select a new option according to π𝒵​(Z|S)subscript𝜋𝒵conditional𝑍𝑆\\pi_{\\mathcal{Z}}(Z|S); otherwise, it will stick to Z′superscript𝑍′Z^{\\prime}. With the new definition and assumption, we can optimize the hierarchical policy πθsubscript𝜋𝜃\\pi_{\\theta} and πϕsubscript𝜋italic-ϕ\\pi_{\\phi} without the extra need to justify the exact beginning and breaking condition of each option. Nevertheless, πθ​(Z|S,Z′)subscript𝜋𝜃conditional𝑍𝑆superscript𝑍′\\pi_{\\theta}(Z|S,Z^{\\prime}) still includes two separate parts, i.e., βZ′​(S)subscript𝛽superscript𝑍′𝑆\\beta_{Z^{\\prime}}(S) and π𝒵​(Z|S)subscript𝜋𝒵conditional𝑍𝑆\\pi_{\\mathcal{Z}}(Z|S), and due to the indicator function, the update gradients of π𝒵subscript𝜋𝒵\\pi_{\\mathcal{Z}} will be blocked/gated by the termination function βZ′​(S)subscript𝛽superscript𝑍′𝑆\\beta_{Z^{\\prime}}(S). In this case, the authors of [ref]29 propose to marginalize the termination function away, and instead implement πθ​(Z|S,Z′)subscript𝜋𝜃conditional𝑍𝑆superscript𝑍′\\pi_{\\theta}(Z|S,Z^{\\prime}) as an end-to-end neural network (NN) with the Multi-Head Attention (MHA) mechanism  which enables their algorithm to temporally extend options in the absence of the termination function. We provide more details on MHA and the structure design of πθsubscript𝜋𝜃\\pi_{\\theta} and πϕsubscript𝜋italic-ϕ\\pi_{\\phi} in Appendix A 111All the appendices are available in the extended version of our paper at https://github.com/LucasCJYSDL/HierAIRL/blob/main/ICRA.pdf. With the marginalized one-step option framework, we only need to train the two NN-based policy, i.e., πθsubscript𝜋𝜃\\pi_{\\theta} and πϕsubscript𝜋italic-ϕ\\pi_{\\phi}. In particular, we adopt the Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning algorithm, i.e., SA, proposed in [ref]29 to learn πθsubscript𝜋𝜃\\pi_{\\theta} and πϕsubscript𝜋italic-ϕ\\pi_{\\phi}.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: As proposed in [ref]6, an option Z∈𝒵𝑍𝒵Z\\in\\mathcal{Z} can be described with three components: an initiation set IZ⊆𝒮subscript𝐼𝑍𝒮I_{Z}\\subseteq\\mathcal{S}, an intra-option policy πZ​(A|S):𝒮×𝒜→\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
