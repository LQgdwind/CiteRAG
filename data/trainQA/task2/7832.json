      "content": "Paper Title: Nominal Tree Automata With Name Allocation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe assume basic familiarity with category theory\n(e.g. ). We briefly recall some background on nominal\nsets (see  for a textbook treatment), as well as on tree\nautomata (e.g. [ref]9), register\nautomata , and nominal\nautomata . We fix a countably\ninfinite set 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} of names. Throughout, we let G𝐺G denote\nthe group of finite permutations on 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A}, which is generated by\nthe permutations (a​b)𝑎𝑏(ab) that swap two names a,b∈𝔸𝑎𝑏𝔸a,b\\in\\mathbb{A}; we write\n𝑖𝑑𝑖𝑑\\mathit{id} for the identity permutation, and (−)⋅(−)⋅(-)\\cdot(-) for the group\noperation, i.e. applicative-order composition of permutations. A\nG𝐺G-set consists of a set X𝑋X and a left action\n(−)⋅(−):G×X→X:⋅→𝐺𝑋𝑋(-)\\cdot(-)\\colon G\\times X\\to X of G𝐺G on X𝑋X (subject to\n𝑖𝑑⋅x=x⋅𝑖𝑑𝑥𝑥\\mathit{id}\\cdot x=x and π⋅(π′⋅x)=(π⋅π′)⋅x⋅𝜋⋅superscript𝜋′𝑥⋅⋅𝜋superscript𝜋′𝑥\\pi\\cdot(\\pi^{\\prime}\\cdot x)=(\\pi\\cdot\\pi^{\\prime})\\cdot x). Given G𝐺G-sets X,Y𝑋𝑌X,Y, a map f:X→Y:𝑓→𝑋𝑌f\\colon X\\to Y is\nequivariant if f​(π⋅x)=π⋅f​(x)𝑓⋅𝜋𝑥⋅𝜋𝑓𝑥f(\\pi\\cdot x)=\\pi\\cdot f(x) for all x,y𝑥𝑦x,y. The\norbit of x∈X𝑥𝑋x\\in X is G⋅x={π⋅x∣π∈G}⋅𝐺𝑥conditional-set⋅𝜋𝑥𝜋𝐺G\\cdot x=\\{\\pi\\cdot x\\mid\\pi\\in G\\}. The\norbits form a disjoint decomposition of X𝑋X; the G𝐺G-set X𝑋X is\norbit-finite if it has only finitely many orbits. We write 𝖿𝗂𝗑(x)={π∈G∣π​(x)=x}𝖿𝗂𝗑𝑥conditional-set𝜋𝐺𝜋𝑥𝑥\\mathop{\\mathsf{fix}}(x)=\\{\\pi\\in G\\mid\\pi(x)=x\\} for x∈X𝑥𝑋x\\in X, and\n𝖥𝗂𝗑(A)=⋂_x∈A​𝖿𝗂𝗑(x)𝖥𝗂𝗑𝐴subscript_𝑥𝐴𝖿𝗂𝗑𝑥\\mathop{\\mathsf{Fix}}(A)=\\bigcap_{\\_}{x\\in A}\\mathop{\\mathsf{fix}}(x) for A⊆X𝐴𝑋A\\subseteq X. The set 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A}\nitself is a G𝐺G-set in a canonical manner. A set S⊆𝔸𝑆𝔸S\\subseteq\\mathbb{A} is\na support of an element x∈X𝑥𝑋x\\in X if that is, if every permutation that fixes all names in S𝑆S also\nfixes x𝑥x, which we understand as x𝑥x depending only on the names\nin S𝑆S. Then, a G𝐺G-set X𝑋X is a nominal set if every element of X𝑋X\nhas a finite support. It follows that every x∈X𝑥𝑋x\\in X has a\nleast finite support 𝗌𝗎𝗉𝗉​(x)𝗌𝗎𝗉𝗉𝑥\\mathsf{supp}(x), also just called the\nsupport of x𝑥x. A name a∈𝔸𝑎𝔸a\\in\\mathbb{A} is fresh for x𝑥x if\na∉𝗌𝗎𝗉𝗉​(x)𝑎𝗌𝗎𝗉𝗉𝑥a\\notin\\mathsf{supp}(x), in which case we write a#x#𝑎𝑥a\\mathbin{\\#}x. We write 𝖭𝗈𝗆𝖭𝗈𝗆\\mathsf{Nom}\nfor the category of nominal sets and equivariant maps. Examples of\nnominal sets include 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} itself (with 𝗌𝗎𝗉𝗉​(a)={a}𝗌𝗎𝗉𝗉𝑎𝑎\\mathsf{supp}(a)=\\{a\\} for\na∈𝔸𝑎𝔸a\\in\\mathbb{A}); the product X×Y𝑋𝑌X\\times Y of nominal sets X,Y𝑋𝑌X,Y (with\n𝗌𝗎𝗉𝗉​(x,y)=𝗌𝗎𝗉𝗉​(x)∪𝗌𝗎𝗉𝗉​(y)𝗌𝗎𝗉𝗉𝑥𝑦𝗌𝗎𝗉𝗉𝑥𝗌𝗎𝗉𝗉𝑦\\mathsf{supp}(x,y)=\\mathsf{supp}(x)\\cup\\mathsf{supp}(y)); and the finitely supported\npowerset 𝒫𝖿𝗌​Xsubscript𝒫𝖿𝗌𝑋\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathsf{fs}}X of a nominal set X𝑋X, which consists of the\nsubsets of X𝑋X that have finite support under the pointwise action\nof G𝐺G on the full powerset. A set A⊆X𝐴𝑋A\\subseteq X is uniformly\nfinitely supported if ⋃_x∈A​𝗌𝗎𝗉𝗉​(x)subscript_𝑥𝐴𝗌𝗎𝗉𝗉𝑥\\bigcup_{\\_}{x\\in A}\\mathsf{supp}(x) is finite; we\nwrite\n𝒫𝗎𝖿𝗌​X={A⊆X∣A​ uniformly finitely supported}subscript𝒫𝗎𝖿𝗌𝑋conditional-set𝐴𝑋𝐴 uniformly finitely supported\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathsf{ufs}}X=\\{A\\subseteq X\\mid A\\text{ uniformly finitely supported}\\}\nfor the uniformly finitely supported powerset of X𝑋X. If X𝑋X is\norbit-finite, then the uniformly finitely supported subsets of X𝑋X are\nprecisely the finite subsets. An important role in the technical development is played by the\nabstraction functor [𝔸]delimited-[]𝔸[\\mathbb{A}] on 𝖭𝗈𝗆𝖭𝗈𝗆\\mathsf{Nom}. For a nominal\nset X𝑋X, [𝔸]​Xdelimited-[]𝔸𝑋[\\mathbb{A}]X is defined as the quotient 𝔸×X/∼\\mathbb{A}\\times X/\\sim\nof 𝔸×X𝔸𝑋\\mathbb{A}\\times X by the equivalence relation ∼similar-to\\sim defined by Equivalently, (a,x)∼(b,y)similar-to𝑎𝑥𝑏𝑦(a,x)\\sim(b,y) iff either (a,x)=(b,y)𝑎𝑥𝑏𝑦(a,x)=(b,y) or\ny=(a​b)⋅x𝑦⋅𝑎𝑏𝑥y=(ab)\\cdot x and b#x#𝑏𝑥b\\mathbin{\\#}x. We write ⟨a⟩​xdelimited-⟨⟩𝑎𝑥\\langle a\\rangle x for the\nequivalence class of (a,x)𝑎𝑥(a,x) under ∼similar-to\\sim. Thus, ⟨a⟩​xdelimited-⟨⟩𝑎𝑥\\langle a\\rangle x\nmay be read as arising from x𝑥x by binding the name a𝑎a. The\nequivalence ∼similar-to\\sim then captures α𝛼\\alpha-equivalent renaming of the\nbound name a𝑎a; in particular, note that by the alternative\ndescription of ∼similar-to\\sim, renaming a𝑎a into b𝑏b in ⟨a⟩​xdelimited-⟨⟩𝑎𝑥\\langle a\\rangle x\nis blocked when b∈𝗌𝗎𝗉𝗉​(x)𝑏𝗌𝗎𝗉𝗉𝑥b\\in\\mathsf{supp}(x). The classical\nnotion of nondeterministic finite automaton can be transferred\ncanonically to the category of nominal sets, where finiteness\ncorresponds to orbit-finiteness; this gives rise to the notion of\nnondeterministic orbite-finite automaton\n(NOFA) . For simplicity, we use the\nset 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} of names as the alphabet (more generally, one can work\nwith any orbit-finite alphabet). Then, a NOFA consists of an\norbit-finite set Q𝑄Q of states; an equivariant transition relation\nΔ⊆Q×𝔸×QΔ𝑄𝔸𝑄\\Delta\\subseteq Q\\times\\mathbb{A}\\times Q; an equivariant initial\nstate q_​0subscript𝑞_0q_{\\_}0 (or more generally a set of initial states); and an\nequivariant set F⊆Q𝐹𝑄F\\subseteq Q of final states. NOFAs accept finite\nwords over 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A}, with the notions of run and acceptance defined\nexactly as in the classical case. NOFAs are equivalent to a flavour of nondeterministic register\nautomata with nondeterministic reassignment, roughly described as\nfollows (see  for details). A register automaton\nhas a finite set Q𝑄Q of control states; a fixed finite number of\nregisters, which at any point in time can be either empty or contain a\nletter (i.e. a name from 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A}); an initial control state q_​0subscript𝑞_0q_{\\_}0; a\nset F𝐹F of final control states; and a transition relation δ𝛿\\delta\nconsisting of triples (q,ϕ,q′)𝑞italic-ϕsuperscript𝑞′(q,\\phi,q^{\\prime}) where q,q′∈Q𝑞superscript𝑞′𝑄q,q^{\\prime}\\in Q and where ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi\nis a boolean combination of equality constraints concerning register\ncontents before and after the transition and the current input\nletter. For simplicity, we require that all registers are initially\nempty. A configuration of the automaton consists of a control\nstate and an assignment of letters to some of the registers (the\nothers are empty). A run of the automaton is a sequence of\nconfigurations starting in the initial configuration (consisting\nof q_​0subscript𝑞_0q_{\\_}0 and all registers empty) such that every next configuration\nis justified by some transition (q,ϕ,q′)𝑞italic-ϕsuperscript𝑞′(q,\\phi,q^{\\prime}) in the sense that the\nboolean combination ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi of equality constraints is satisfied by the\nregister contents in the configurations before and after the\ntransition and by the current input letter. A run is accepting if it ends\nin a configuration over a final control state. The language of the\nautomaton is the set of accepted words. What this means is that the\nautomaton can, in each transition step, perform any combination of the\nfollowing actions as specified by the transition constraint ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi:\nstore the current letter in a register; copy content among registers;\ndelete content from a register; nondeterministically store any name in\na register (nondeterministic reassigment). These actions are\nconditioned on tests for equality or inequality among the registers\nand the input letter. In the correspondence between NOFAs and register\nautomata, a configuration c𝑐c of a register automaton becomes a state\nin the corresponding NOFA, whose support contains precisely the\nletters stored in the registers in c𝑐c. Both nondeterminism and nondeterministic reassignment strictly\nincrease expressive power. For instance, the language L_​2subscript𝐿_2L_{\\_}2 “some\nletter occurs twice” can be accepted by a nondeterministic register\nautomaton but not by a deterministic one; and the language “the\nlast letter has not been seen before” can only be accepted using\nnondeterministic reassignment. Also, the nondeterministic model is not\nclosed under complement: The complement of the above-mentioned\nlanguage L_​2subscript𝐿_2L_{\\_}2 is the language “all letters are distinct”, which\ncannot be accepted by a nondeterministic register automaton. Throughout, we fix a finite ranked\nalphabet (or signature) ΣΣ\\Sigma, consisting of finitely\nmany (function) symbols, each equipped with an assigned finite\narity; we write f/n∈Σ𝑓𝑛Σf/n\\in\\Sigma to indicate that f𝑓f is a symbol\nof arity n𝑛n in ΣΣ\\Sigma. We assume that ΣΣ\\Sigma contains at least\none constant, i.e. a symbol of arity 00. The set\n𝒯​(Σ)𝒯Σ\\mathcal{T}(\\Sigma) of (ground) ΣΣ\\Sigma-Terms is defined\ninductively by stipulating that whenever f/n∈Σ𝑓𝑛Σf/n\\in\\Sigma and\nt_​1,…,t_​n∈𝒯​(Σ)subscript𝑡_1…subscript𝑡_𝑛𝒯Σt_{\\_}1,\\dots,t_{\\_}n\\in\\mathcal{T}(\\Sigma), then f​(t_​1,…,t_​n)𝑓subscript𝑡_1…subscript𝑡_𝑛f(t_{\\_}1,\\dots,t_{\\_}n)\nin ΣΣ\\Sigma. Terms are regarded as a representation of trees, with\neach node of the tree labelled with a symbol from ΣΣ\\Sigma whose arity\ndetermines the number of child nodes. A (classical, finite-alphabet) nondeterministic top-down tree\nautomaton (NFTA) (e.g. [ref]9) over ΣΣ\\Sigma is a tuple\nA=(Q,q_​0,Δ)𝐴𝑄subscript𝑞_0ΔA=(Q,q_{\\_}0,\\Delta) (we elide the fixed signature ΣΣ\\Sigma) where\nQ𝑄Q is a finite set of states, q_​0∈Qsubscript𝑞_0𝑄q_{\\_}0\\in Q is the initial\nstate, and ΔΔ\\Delta is a set of rewrite rules or\ntransitions of the form where f/n∈Σ𝑓𝑛Σf/n\\in\\Sigma, q,q_​1,…,q_​n∈Q𝑞subscript𝑞_1…subscript𝑞_𝑛𝑄q,q_{\\_}1,\\dots,q_{\\_}n\\in Q, and the x_​isubscript𝑥_𝑖x_{\\_}i are\nvariables; these rules thus manipulate extended terms\ncontaining automata states as unary symbols (with at most one\noccurrence of such a symbol per tree branch). Much as usual\n(e.g.  [ref]9), such rewrite rules are applied\nwithin a surrounding context, and with the variables x_​isubscript𝑥_𝑖x_{\\_}i substituted\nwith ground terms; we continue to write →→\\to for the arising rewrite\nrelation on extended terms. The NFTA A𝐴A accepts a\nterm t𝑡t if q_​0​(t)→∗tsuperscript→subscript𝑞_0𝑡𝑡q_{\\_}0(t)\\to^{*}t. The language L​(A)𝐿𝐴L(A) is\nthe set of terms (trees) accepted by A𝐴A. NFTAs have the\nsame expressiveness as bottom-up tree automata, in which the\nrewrite rules propagate automata states from the leaves to the\nroot. Deterministic top-down tree automata, on the other hand, are\nstrictly less expressive than NFTA. In the present work, our focus is\non nondeterministic top-down models. The inclusion problem for\nNFTA, i.e. to decide whether L​(A)⊆L​(ℬ)𝐿𝐴𝐿ℬL(A)\\subseteq L(\\mathcal{B})\nfor given NFTAs A,ℬ𝐴ℬA,\\mathcal{B}, is\nExpTime-complete .\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: We assume basic familiarity with category theory\n(e.g. ).
