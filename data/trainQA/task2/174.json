      "content": "Paper Title: CheXclusion: Fairness gaps in deep chest X-ray classifiers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nChest X-ray imaging is an important screening and diagnostic tool for several life-threatening diseases, but due to the shortage of radiologists, this screening tool cannot be used to treat all patients.  [ref]2\nDeep-learning-based medical image classifiers are one potential solution, with significant prior work targeting chest X-rays specifically,  leveraging large-scale publicly available datasets,   and demonstrating radiologist-level accuracy in diagnostic classification.   Despite the seemingly clear case for implementing AI-enabled diagnostic tools,  moving such methods from paper to practice require careful thought. 0 Models may exhibit disparities in performance across protected subgroups, and this\ncould lead to different subgroups receiving different treatment. 1 During evaluation, machine learning algorithms usually optimize for, and report performance on, the general population rather than balancing accuracy on different subgroups. While some variance in performance is unavoidable, mitigating any systematic bias against protected subgroups may be desired or required in a deployable model. In this paper, we examine whether state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep neural classifiers trained on large public medical imaging datasets are fair across different subgroups of protected attributes. We train classifiers on 3 large, public chest X-ray datasets: MIMIC-CXR,  CheXpert, Chest-Xray8 , as well as an additional datasets formed of the aggregation of those three datasets on their shared labels. In each case, we implement chest X-ray pathology classifiers via a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) chest X-ray images as inputs, and optimize the multi-label probability of 14 diagnostic labels simultaneously.\nBecause researchers have observed health disparities with respect to race, 2 sex, 3 age, 4 and socioeconomic status, 2 we extract structural data on race, sex, and age; we also use insurance type as an imperfect proxy 1 for socioeconomic status. To our knowledge, we are the first to examine whether SOTA chest X-ray pathology classifiers display systematic bias across race, age, and insurance type. We analyze equality of opportunity 5 as our fairness metric based on the needs of the clinical diagnostic setting.\nIn particular, we examine the differences in true positive rate (TPR) across different subgroups per attributes. A high TPR disparity indicates that sick members of a protected subgroup would not be given correct diagnoses—e.g., true positives—at the same rate as the general population, even in an algorithm with high overall accuracy. We find three major findings: First, that there are indeed extensive patterns of bias in SOTA classifiers, shown in TPR disparities across datasets. Secondly, the disparity rate for most attributes/ datasets pairs is not significantly correlated with the subgroups’ proportional disease membership. These findings suggest that underrepresented subgroups could be vulnerable to mistreatment in a systematic deployment, and that such vulnerability may not be addressable simply through increasing subgroup patient count. Lastly, we find that using the multi-source dataset which combines all the other datasets yields the lowest TPR disparities, suggesting using multi-source datasets may combat bias in the data collection process.\nAs researchers increasingly apply artificial intelligence and machine learning to precision medicine, we hope that our work demonstrates how predictive models trained on large, well-balanced datasets can still yield disparate impact.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: X-ray imaging is an important screening and diagnostic tool for several life-threatening diseases, but due to the shortage of radiologists, this screening tool cannot be used to treat all patients.  [ref]2\nDeep-learning-based medical image classifiers are one potential solution, with significant prior work targeting chest X-rays specifically,  leveraging large-scale publicly available datasets,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
