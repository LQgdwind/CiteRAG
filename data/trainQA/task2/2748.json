      "content": "Paper Title: StereoSpike: Depth Learning with a Spiking Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning approaches for depth estimation have had a long tradition on the timescale of modern deep learning techniques. First methods were based on luminance-field data from traditional frame-based cameras, either in mono- or binocular setups. The model in  was the first successful multi-scale architecture designed for depth estimation from RGB images, and was consequently followed by advances based on similar approaches  [ref]23 . Consistently with the recent interest of the scientific community in event-based cameras, a few works successfully tackled the problem with neuromorphic data. Historically, several groups used bio-inspired approaches such as Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), in a very hardware-oriented direction, but not in a “deep learning” setting. For instance, the authors of 6 implemented a spike-based algorithm on a FPGA to regress low-resolution depth maps on a small size dataset. Furthermore,  proposed a SNN for processing depth from defocus (DFD); this work targeted neuromorphic chips and was able of recovering depth at full resolution, but reconstructions were not dense and the approach was not based on learning. Following the latter,  proposed a neural network that jointly predicted camera pose and per-pixel disparity from stereo inputs. However, their reconstructed depth maps remained sparse as they restricted their analyses to pixels where events occurred.  addressed this problem and pushed even further the state-of-the-art on indoor scenarios thanks to 3D convolutions exploiting a specific event embedding.\nThe model in  used the same input embedding and backbone as , but proposed a preliminary network using spatially-adaptive normalization (SPADE)  to reconstruct grayscale intensity images jointly with depth maps. If the performance gain in this case is indeed important, this paradigm is very intensive as it adds much more parameters and FLOPs but also imposes to have access to ground-truth intensity images for training.\n also used a similar matching backbone as well as SPADE, but differed in its input encoding. In this work, subsequent spike histograms are fed sequentially into a layer of recurrent, non-spiking Leaky-Integrate and Fire (LIF) neurons with different time constants to capture time dependencies at different scales. Although this approach can be considered the current state-of-the-art of stereo matching DVS events, this model is difficult to implement on neuromorphic chips, as its activations are dense and not binary.\nFinally, in 9, dense metric depth was recovered from only one camera, and showed good performances with a recurrent, monocular encoder-decoder architecture on outdoor sequences. However, we argue that the task of depth recovery from events has a minor temporal component and can be solved by a fully feedforward model with minimal temporal knowledge; therefore the use of convLSTMs in 9 is suboptimal and unnecessarily costly in terms of computation. Another inspiration for our work has been the task of optical flow regression from neuromorphic data, which is similar to depth reconstruction because it is also a large-scale image regression task.\nDespite this similarity, it inspired lighter and hardware-friendly approaches, closer to the philosophy of SNNs, but still no fully spiking –to the strict sense– models have been proposed for this purpose.\nEV-FlowNet , arguably considered as the precursor of encoder-decoder models for optical flow reconstruction from event data, consisted in a feedforward analog encoder-decoder architecture. As a direct sequel, the hybrid model Spike-FlowNet  used spiking neurons in the encoder of a similar backbone, while maintaining the same levels of performances. In this approach, spiking neurons were shown to be able of encoding abilities close to analog ones and with a reduced computational cost. On the other hand, authors kept the remaining part of their network analog, to counteract the lack of expressivity in SNNs. More recently, the model proposed in  showed very good performances but it cannot be considered as a fully spiking network because real-valued intermediate predictions of the outputs were reinjected within the network and mixed with binary spike tensors. In addition, they upsampled low-scale representations with the bilinear upsampling method, which breaks the binary spike constraint necessary for an implementation on neuromorphic hardware. Nevertheless, it is the first success in a large-scale regression task with a network that is spiking for its vast majority. So far, SNNs have been used for classification tasks like image recognition 0 , object detection  , or motion segmentation 1. Only a few works employed them for regression tasks. A notable exception is 2, but they only regressed 3 variables, while we propose here to regress the values of 260×346=8996026034689960260\\times 346=89960 pixels.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: setups.
