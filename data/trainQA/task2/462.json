Work supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) under grant no. PR1266/4-1, Conflict resolution and causal inference with integrated socio-technical models.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nActual causality is the retrospective linking of effects to causes  .\nAs part of their cognition, humans reason about actual causality to explain particular past events, to control future events, or to attribute moral responsibility and legal liability . Similar to humans, it is useful for systems in investigating security protocols , safety accidents , software or hardware models   , and database queries 8.\nMore importantly, actual causality is central for enabling social constructs such as accountability in Cyber-Physical systems   , in information systems ,\nand explainability in artificial intelligence systems . Attempts to formalize a precise definition of an actual cause go back to the eighteenth century when Hume  introduced counterfactual reasoning. Simply put, counterfactual reasoning concludes that event A𝐴A is a cause of event B𝐵B if B𝐵B does not occur if A𝐴A does not occur. However, this simple reasoning cannot be used with interdependent, multi-factorial, and complex causes . Recently, Halpern and Pearl formalized HP–a seminal model-based definition of actual causality that addresses many of the challenges facing naive counterfactual reasoning . Because of its formal foundation, HP enables automated causality reasoning. We distinguish two notions of reasoning: checking and inference.\nChecking refers to verifying if a candidate cause is an actual cause of an effect, i.e., answering the question “is X→→𝑋\\vec{X} a cause of φ𝜑\\varphi?” Inference involves finding a cause without any candidates, i.e., answering the question “why φ𝜑\\varphi?” Using HP, causality checking is, in general, D1Psubscriptsuperscript𝐷𝑃1D^{P}_{1}-complete and 𝑁𝑃𝑁𝑃\\mathit{NP}-complete for singleton (one-event) causes ; the difference is due to a minimality requirement in the definition (details in Section 2). Intuitively, inference is at least as hard. The complexity led to restricted (e.g., singleton causes, single-equation models 8) utilizations of HP (Section 5).\nAll these utilizations exploit domain-specificities (e.g., database repairs 8  ), which hinders taking advantage of the available approximations for general queries. In prior work, we proposed an approach to check causality in acyclic models with binary variables based on the satisfiability problem (SAT) [ref]18.\nThe approach required enumerating all the satisfying assignments of a formula (ALL-SAT), which obviously is impacted by the solver’s performance .\nThus, previous approaches fail to automate answering queries for larger models. Large models of causal factors are likely to occur especially when generated automatically from other sources for purposes of accountability and explainability   . Further, models of real-world accidents are sufficiently large to require efficient approaches. For instance, a model of the 2002 mid-air collision in Germany consists of 95 factor  (discussed in ).\nThus, in this paper, we present a novel approach to formulate actual causality computations in binary models as optimization problems. We show how to construct quantifiable notions within counterfactual computations, and use them for checking and inference. We encode our checking approach as integer linear programs (ILP), or weighted MaxSAT formulae .\nBoth are well-suited alternatives for Boolean optimization problems. However, MaxSAT has an inherent advantage with binary propositional constraints . On the other hand, ILP has an expressive objective language that allows us to tackle the problem of causality inference as a multi-objective program. Accordingly, we contribute an approach with three encodings. The first two cover causality checking, and better they can determine a minimal HP cause from a potentially non-minimal candidate cause; we refer to this ability as semi-inference.\nThe third encoding tackles causality inference.\nAll these encodings benefit from the rapid development in solving complex and large (tens of thousands of variables and constraints) optimization problems  . We consider our work to be the first to provide an efficient solution to the problem of checking and inferring HP causality, for a large class of models (binary models) without any dependency on domain-specific technologies. We contribute: 1.) A sound formulation of causality computations for acyclic binary models as optimization problems, 2.) A Java library111https://github.com/amjadKhalifah/HP2SAT1.0/tree/hp-optimization-library\nthat implements the approaches. 3.) An empirical evaluation, using models from multiple domains, of the efficiency and scalability of the approaches in comparison with previous work.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: of the available approximations for general queries.
