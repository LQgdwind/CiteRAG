Deep Graph InfoMax (DGI) [ref]38 first applies the InfoMax principle to graph representation learning.\nDGI relies on maximizing the mutual information between patch-level and global-level representation of one graph.\nGMI [ref]29 jointly maximizes feature MI and edge MI individually, without augmentation.\nMVGRL  generates two augmented graph view via graph diffusion and subgraph sampling.\nBased on SimCLR [ref]6, GraphCL  enforces the embedding of positive pair (i.e., augmented views of the same graph) to be close and the embedding of negative pair (i.e., augmented views of different graphs) to be distant in the Euclidean space.\nCuCo  further utilizes the curriculum learning to select the negative samples.\nAD-GCL  optimizes adversarial graph augmentation to prevent learning redundant information.\nJOAO  adaptively selects the augmentation for specific dataset. Collapse in Self-Supervised Learning. Self-supervised contrastive learning methods may suffer from collapse problem as shown in Fig. 1(a), i.e., obtained embeddings degenerate to an constant vector.\nMoCo  and SimCLR [ref]6 address the collapse problem by repulsing negative pairs in optimization objective.\nBYOL  propose momentum encoder, predictor and stop gradient operator to avoid the collapsed solution.\nSimSiam  simplifies the BYOL by removing the momentum encoder and shows that the remaining stop-gradient mechanism is the key component to prevent collapse in self-supervised learning.\n theoretically analyze how SimSiam avoid collapse solution without negative samples.\n  point out the dimensional collapse and further show that strong augmentation and the weight matrices alignment cause the dimensional collapse in vision field.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: one of the main approaches of self-supervised representation learning, contrastive learning based on mutual information maximization(MI) principle has raised a surge of attraction in computer vision [ref]6  and natural language processing  .\nInspired by visual contrastive learning, a series of graph contrastive learning methods are devised.
