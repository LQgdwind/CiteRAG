      "content": "Paper Title: Spatiotemporal Persistence Landscapes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTopological Data Analysis (TDA) is a branch of applied mathematics that arose in the early 2000s. The aim of TDA is to utilize topological methods to obtain information from high-dimensional and noisy datasets. So far, it has been successfully applied to a broad variety of real world data, for example biological/biomedical applications     , financial data 4 5, dynamical systems   [ref]26 6 and robotics [ref]2 , to name just a few. \nOne of the most important methods in TDA is persistent homology, which is based on the algebraic topological concept of homology. The initial idea behind homology was to characterize shapes by their holes. Mathematically, holes are described by a sequence of homology groups that contain the information about the pp-dimensional holes. The generators of zeroth homology group correspond to the connected components of the topological space, the first homology group describes loops and tunnels, the second voids, and the higher homology groups describe higher dimensional holes. Given point cloud data, persistent homology tracks the homology of that data across several spatial scales and in turn visualizes the information about the parameter values of the birth and death of the homological features in the so-called barcode. Features that survive over a large number of scales are said to be persistent and correspond to actual features of the data, whereas those features that survive only for a short scale are regarded as noise, making persistent homology robust with respect to small perturbations.\nA different way to visualize persistent homology is via the persistence landscapes. Originally, it was defined for oneparameter persistent homology , being extended to multiparameter persistent homology 0. In case of oneparameter persistence, it contains the same information as the barcode. The main advantage of oneparameter as well as multiparameter persistence landscapes is that it is a stable vectorization and hence, it allows the calculation of means and variances. Additionally, it is well-suited as input for machine learning tasks. All these advantages led to numerous applications in various fields of data analysis   5  .\nA particular type of input data to persistent homology are time series. In many cases where persistent homology is applied to time series, the pipeline is to first window the time series and subsequently, to build a simplicial complex out of the data in the windows, followed by a comparison of the persistent homology in the distinct windows   5 1 . In a different approach, some authors examine the use of zigzag persistent homology  in order to track the persistence of the topological features throughout the time evolution  . However, varying the time parameter, the authors had to choose fixed values for the spatial parameter. To overcome this issue, we propose a method to compute persistence landscapes for a novel kind of bifiltration, which we call a spatiotemporal bifiltration. We call the corresponding persistence module extended zigzag module. Since this type of bifiltration does not fit into the framework of multiparameter persistent homology, we adapt the notions used in the definition of persistence landscapes to our setting by using the generalized rank invariant 7 and provide an algorithm to compute the landscapes. In recent work, the generalized rank invariant has already been used to compute the generalized rank invariant landscape (GRIL) 1. This landscape differs from our landscape by being defined for biparameter persistence modules as well as by the choice of intervals used to compute the landscape.\nMoreover, we show that spatiotemporal persistence landscapes are stable with respect to the interleaving distance for extended zigzag modules, which we define as an extension of the known interleaving distance for zigzag modules . In addition, spatiotemporal persistence landscapes can be viewed as random variables that take values in a Banach space and as such, obey the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. \nIn this article, we both review known results that are necessary for a comprehensive understanding and introduce a new method. Hence, the article is structured as follows. In Section 2, we give a short overview over the background of persistent homology, its application to time series analysis as well as a brief introduction to the generalized rank invariant. In Section 3, we define spatiotemporal persistence landscapes and discuss their properties. We define an interleaving distance for extended zigzag modules and proof stability of the spatiotemporal persistence landscapes with respect to this interleaving distance in Section 4. The algorithm is described in Section 5, followed by applications to simulated data in Section 6. We finish with a discussion in Section 7.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: and noisy datasets.
