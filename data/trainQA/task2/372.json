Comparison with COVID-19 proximity finding approaches.\nSeveral recent approaches for preventing the spread of coronavirus are based on Bluetooth data-based secure proximity detection. For example, Canetti et al. [ref]23 present a person proximity detection method based on Bluetooth-enabled devices. However, this method requires to store parts of the data at the user device.  [ref]23, also, argued that GPS-based proximity detection inside a building can give false results. Stanford University  is also developing applications based on Bluetooth data. Singapore’s TraceTogether application , also, works based on Bluetooth-based tracking. However,  showed that TraceTogether jeopardizes the user privacy. DP-3T (decentralized privacy-preserving proximity tracing)  proposed a proximity tracing system based on Bluetooth data. Google and Apple  are developing Bluetooth beacon-based contact tracing, while preserving the user privacy and location privacy. Similar work is also proposed in  0 for Bluetooth data-based secure proximity detection, based on the private set intersection. Enigma MPC, Inc. 2 develops SafeTrace that requires users to send their encrypted Google Map timeline to a server equipped with Intel SGX  that executes contact tracing and finds whether the person got in contact with an impacted person or not.\nA survey of recent contact tracing application for COVID-19 may be found in . However, all such methods require either to install an application   at the device, to store some data [ref]23  at the device, to execute computation [ref]23 2  at the device, to explicitly opt-in to enable Bluetooth-based beacon exchange   0, or jeopardize the user privacy . In contrast, Quest does not require any effort by users, since we rely on WiFi data that is generated when a device connects with a WiFi network. Quest discovers the most accurate proximity of a person inside a building, unlike GPS-based approaches. Also, while using the servers, iQuest provides complete security, due to using secret-sharing based technique. Quest not only provides contact tracing, but also provides other applications (Table 4). Comparison with other proximity finding approaches.\nEpic 5 and Enact  are based on WiFi signal strength, where a dynamic user scans the surrounding’s wireless signals, access-points, and records in their phones. The infected user sends this information to a server that notifies other users and requests them to find their chances of contact. However, Epic 5 and Enact  consider trust in reporting by the infected users and requires storing some information at the smartphone, like Bluetooth-based solutions   [ref]23 2 . Another problem with such signal strength-based methods is in developing models to compare WiFi signals and have issues related to spatial, temporal, and infrastructural sensing 2. NearMe 3, ProbeTag 7, , 9, and 4 proposed similar approaches for proximity detection. The seminal work  proposed distance-bounding protocol to estimate an upper-bound on the physical proximity of the device through the round-trip time measurements, by exchanging unique challenge-response pairs between a sender and a receiver.  provided a solution for proximity testing among the users while hiding their locations by encryption and considered user-to-user- and server-based proximity testing. Note that all such methods require active participation from the users. In contrast, Quest does not require active participation from the user, since it relies on WiFi connectivity data, which is, obviously, generated when a device gets connected with a WiFi network. Background on cryptographic techniques.\nWe may broadly classify existing cryptographic techniques into two categories:\n(i) Computationally secure solutions that includes encryption-based techniques such as symmetric-searchable encryption (SSE) [ref]55  5 6, deterministic encryption 8 , and order-preserving encryption (OPE) 3,\n(ii) information-theoretically secure solutions that include secret-sharing-based techniques   and multi-party computation (MPC) techniques 7.\nComputationally secure solutions, such as SSE — PB-tree 5 and IB-tree 6, are efficient in terms of computational time. However, they\n(i) reveal access-patterns (i.e., the identity of the tuple satisfying the query),\n(ii) do not scale to a large-dataset due to dependence of a specific index structure,\n(iii) are not efficient for frequent data insertion, since it requires to rebuild the entire index at the trusted side, and\n(iv) cannot protect data from a computationally-efficient adversary or the government legislation/subpoena that may force to give them the data in cleartext. In contrast, information-theoretically secure solutions hide access-patterns, as well as, secure against a computationally-efficient adversary or the government legislation/subpoena, (if the shares of the data are placed at the public servers under the different jurisdiction). Instead of using any cryptographic solution, one may also use secure hardware-based solutions that include Intel Software Guard eXtension (SGX)  based systems, e.g., Opaque , Bunker and Fort 6, HardIDX , and EncDBDB . However, such solutions suffer from similar issues as computationally secure solutions and suffer from additional side-channel attacks, such as cache-line  and branching attacks  that reveals access-patterns.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: COVID-19 proximity finding approaches.\nSeveral recent approaches for preventing the spread of coronavirus are based on Bluetooth data-based secure proximity detection.
