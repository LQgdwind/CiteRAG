      "content": "Paper Title: Comparison and Benchmarking of AI Models and Frameworks on Mobile Devices\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMLPerf Inference [ref]5 proposes a set of rules and practices to ensure comparability across systems with wildly differing architectures.\nUnlike traditional benchmarks, e.g. SPEC CPU, which runs out of the box, MLPerf Inference is a semantic-level benchmark. It defines several high-level abstractions of AI problems, and specifies the task to be accomplished and the general rules of the road, but leaves implementation details to the submitters 111For mobile devices, there is a preliminary reference implementation of MLPerf Inference based on Tensorflow Lite, but it is not official yet..\nMLPerf Inference aims to more general and flexible benchmarking. For a specific domain, however, this flexibility may bring unfeasibility and unaffordable. The users need make their efforts to optimize the whole stack of the AI solutions, from the languages, libraries, frameworks, to hardwares. For the hardware manufacturer, the implementation and optimization of the AI task may take more proportion to achieve a higher score of the benchmarking. Moreover, the excessive optimization of a particular solution may affect the generality of the system. ETH Zurich AI Benchmark [ref]6 [ref]7 aims to evaluate the AI ability of Android smartphones. It contains several workloads covering the tasks of object recognition, face recognition, playing atari games, image deblurring, image super-resolution, bokeh simulation, semantic segmentation, photo enhancement. Although AI Benchmark covers diverse tasks, we believe that the model diversity should be taken more attentions, since the models are often shared between different tasks by transfer learning. For example, the pre-trained networks for image recognition are often used as the backbone to extract the feature maps for other vision tasks, e.g. object detection and segmentation. Moreover, AI Benchmark is implemented only using TensorFlow Lite. Simone Bianco et al.  analyzes more than 40 state-of-the-art deep architectures in terms of accuracy rate, model complexity, memory usage, computational complexity, and inference time. They experiment the selected architectures on a workstation equipped with a NVIDIA Titan X Pascal and an embedded system based on a NVIDIA Jetson TX1 board. Their workloads are implemented using PyTorch.\nShaohuai Shi et al.  compare the state-of-the-art deep learning software frameworks, including Caffe, CNTK, MXNet, TensorFlow, and Torch. They compare the running performance of these frameworks with three popular types of neural networks on two CPU platforms and three GPU platforms.\nThe paper  discusses a comprehensive design of benchmark on mobile and embeded devices, while we focus on the vision domain in this paper.\nOther AI benchmarks include Fathom , DAWNBench .\nThese benchmarks are not designed for mobile devices. Our benchmark focuses on the evaluation of the inference ablity of mobile and embedded devices. The workloads in our benchmark cover more model architectures and more frameworks. Additionally, comparing to MLPerf Inference, our benchmark is more available and affordable for the users, since it is off the shelf and needs no re-implementation. The details of comparisons of different benchmarks are shown in Table I.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: MLPerf Inference [ref]5 proposes a set of rules and practices to ensure comparability across systems with wildly differing architectures.\nUnlike traditional benchmarks, e.g. SPEC CPU, which runs out of the box,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
