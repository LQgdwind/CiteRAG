      "content": "Paper Title: Reducing Language Biases in Visual Question Answering with Visually-Grounded Question Encoder\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA major role in the success of deep-learning models lies in the availability of large datasets. Most of the existing real-world datasets for various problems will have some form of biases, and it is hard to avoid this at the time of dataset collection, due to the annotation cost. Consequently, the models trained on these datasets often over-fit to the biases between the inputs and ground truth annotations from the train set. Researchers tried different procedures to mitigate this problem in various domains. For instance, some methods focused on the biases in captioning models , gender biases in multi-label object classification , biases in ConvNets and ImageNet , etc. Since our work focuses on reducing the language biases in VQA models, in the following, we discuss the related works lying on the same line. Approaches in the dataset side:\nIn VQA, various datasets have been proposed so far such as [ref]3   . The main source of bias in these datasets are from the language side, i.e., the question.\nThere exist strong correlations between some of the word patterns in the question and the frequent answer words in the dataset. For e.g., in the large and popular VQAv1 dataset [ref]3, there exist strong language priors such as “what color..” to “white,” “is there..” to “yes,” “how many..” to “2”, etc. To reduce the language biases in VQAv1, in , the authors introduced a more balanced VQAv2 dataset, by adding at least two similar images with different answers for each question. However, with this additional refinement also, there still exists a considerable amount of language biases that can be leveraged by the model during training. In [ref]1  , the authors empirically show that a question-only model (without using the image) trained on VQAv2 shows reasonable performance, indicating the strong language priors in the dataset.\nIn [ref]1, the authors show that since the train and test answer distributions of VQAv2 are still similar, and the models that solely memorize language biases in the train set show acceptable performance while testing. In this regard, they introduced a diagnostic dataset, the VQA-CP (VQA under Changing Priors), to measure the language bias learned by the VQA models. This dataset is constructed with vastly different answer distributions\nbetween the train and test splits. Hence the models that rely heavily on the language priors in the train set will show poor performance while testing. [ref]1 empirically shows that most of the existing best performing VQA models on the VQAv2 dataset show a significant drop in the accuracy when tested on the new test split from VQA-CPv2. E.g., a model with ≈66%absentpercent66\\approx 66\\% accuracy in the standard VQAv2 shows only ≈40%absentpercent40\\approx 40\\% accuracy in the bias sensitive VQA-CPv2. Approaches in the architecture side:\nSeveral approaches have been considered in the literature to remove such biases. In [ref]1, the authors propose a specific VQA model built upon , the GVQA model, consists of specially designed architectural restrictions to prevent the model from relying on the question-answer correlations. This model is complicated in design and requires multi-stage training, which makes it challenging to adapt to existing VQA models. In [ref]33 , the authors propose different regularization techniques that can be applied via the question encoder to reduce the bias.\nIn [ref]33, the authors added an adversary question-only branch to the model, and it is supposed to find the amount of bias that exists in the question. Then, a gradient negation of the question-only branch loss is applied to remove answer discriminative features from the question representation of the original model. They also propose a difference of entropy (DoE) loss captured between the output distributions of the VQA model and the additional question-only branch. In , the authors propose a similar approach as in [ref]33, named RUBi, where instead of using the DoE and question-only loss, they mask (using the sigmoid operation) the output from the question-only branch and element-wise multiplying it with the output of the original model, to dynamically adapt the value of the classification loss to reduce the bias. However, both of these regularization approaches show a decrease in the performance on the standard VQAv2 benchmark, while reducing the bias.\nIn , the authors propose a tuning method, called HINT, that is used to improve the visual-grounding of the existing model. Specifically, they tuned the model with manually annotated attention maps from the VQA-HAT dataset . Similar to this, in , the authors propose a tuning approach called SCR, which uses additional manually annotated attention maps (from the VQA-HAT ) or textual explanations (from the VQA-X dataset ) to improve the visual-grounding of the model. However, both of these approaches   require additional manually annotated data, and collecting the same is expensive. Also, these approaches reduce the performance on the standard VQAv2. Recently, in , the authors proposed an approach based on language-attention and is built upon the GVQA model [ref]1. The language attention module splits the question into three language phrases: question type, referring objects, and specific features of the referring object. These phrases further utilized to infer the answers from the image. They claim that splitting the question into different language phrases reduces the learning of the bias. However, this approach also shows a reduction in the performance on VQAv2. The prior works are trying to overcome the bias either by reducing the contribution from the language side as in [ref]33  , or by improving the visual-grounding by tuning with additional manually annotated data as in  . One common drawback of all of these methods is that they show a significant drop in the performance on the standard VQAv2 benchmark while reducing the bias. On the contrary, our approach improves the representation power of the question encoder to make visually-grounded question encodings to reduce the bias. The advantage of such an approach is that it is not only model-agnostic but also does not sacrifice the performance on the standard VQAv2 benchmark.\nAlso, it does not require any additional manually annotated data or tuning. Traditional question encoders and pitfall:\nThe widely adopted question encoding scheme in VQA is passing the word-level features to a recurrent sequence model (LSTM  or GRU ) and taking the final state vector as the encoded question. Some early works use one-hot representations of question words and pass through an LSTM such as in  [ref]3  , or GRU as in . The drawback of using the one-hot vector representations of question words is the manual creation of the word vocabulary. Later, the usage of pre-trained word embedding vectors such as GloVe , BERT , etc., becomes popular, since they do not require any word vocabulary and also rich in linguistic understanding. This question encoding scheme, i.e., pass the pre-trained word embeddings of the question words to some RNNs, is the currently popular approach in VQA  2   8 . However, recently, with the success of Transformer based models in various NLP tasks , usage of Multi-modal Transformers (MMT) are becoming popular, such as ViLBERT 6, LXMERT , etc. These are co-attention models working on top of Transformers 0, where while encoding the question, the words are prioritized with the guidance of the visual information. The above-mentioned question-encoding schemes only use the language modality, i.e., the word-embeddings of the question words. As a result, the encoded question contains only the linguistic information from the question, and it cannot distinguish the questions based on their visual counterpart. This situation forces the model to learn the unwanted correlations between the language patterns in the questions, and the most frequent answers in the train set without considering the image which leads to a language side biased model. On the contrary, our question encoder, the VGQE, considers both visual and language modalities equally and generate visually-grounded question representations. A VQA model with such a question representation can reduce the over-dependency on the language priors in the train set. The VGQE is also related to approaches such as FiLM , in terms of the early usage of the complementary information. The FiLM uses the question context to influence the image encoder, whereas VGQE uses the visual information inside the question encoder.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: the language biases in VQA models, in the following, we discuss the related works lying on the same line.
