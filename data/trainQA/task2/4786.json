Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of ANS-GT, we conduct experiments on the six benchmark datasets including citation graphs Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed [ref]18; Wikipedia graphs Chameleon, Squirrel; the Actor co-occurrence graph [ref]5; and WebKB datasets  including Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin. We set the train-validation-test split as 60%/20%/20%. The statistics of datasets are shown in the Appendix C. Baselines. \nTo evaluate the effectiveness of ANS-GT on graph representation learning, we compare it with 12 baseline methods, including 8 popular GNN methods,\ni.e. GCN¬†[ref]18, GAT¬†[ref]34, GraphSAGE¬†, JKNet¬†, APPNP¬†, Geom-GCN¬†, H2GCN¬†, and GPRGNN¬† along with four state-of-the-art Graph Transformers, i.e. GT¬†, SAN¬†, Graphormer¬†, and Gophormer¬†. We use node classification accuracy as the evaluation metric. Implementation Details. \nWe adopt AdamW as the optimizer and set the hyper-parameter œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon to 1e-8 and (Œ≤‚Äã1,Œ≤‚Äã2ùõΩ1ùõΩ2\\beta 1,\\beta 2) to (0.99,0.999). The peak learning rate is set to 2e-4 with a 100 epochs warm-up stage followed by a linear decay learning rate scheduler. We adopt the Variational Neighborhoods  with a coarsening rate of 0.01 as the default coarsening method. All models were trained on one NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. Parameter Settings.\nIn the default setting, the dropout rate is set to 0.5, the end learning rate is set to 1e-9, the hidden dimension dùëëd is set to 128, the number of training epochs is set to 1,000, update period TùëáT is set to 100, NùëÅN is set to 20, MùëÄM is set to 10, and the number of attention head HùêªH is set as 8. We tune other hyper-parameters on each dataset based on by grid search. The searching space of\nbatch size, number of data augmentation ùíÆùíÆ\\mathcal{S}, the number of layers LùêøL, number of sampled nodes, number of sampled super-nodes, number global nodes are {8,16,32}81632\\{8,16,32\\}, {4,8,16,32}481632\\{4,8,16,32\\}, {2,3,4,5,6}23456\\{2,3,4,5,6\\}, {10,15,20,25}10152025\\{10,15,20,25\\}, {0,3,6,9}0369\\{0,3,6,9\\}, {1,2,3}123\\{1,2,3\\} respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: Datasets.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
