These methods are designed to explore the complementarity of diverse information. Liu et al.  utilized an extra edge dataset for joint training with saliency dataset to improve the local details of salient objects. Zhao et al.  and Zhao et al.  directly built the edge loss with binary cross entropy to learn more detailed information of boundaries. Feng et al. [ref]29, Wei et al.  and Chen et al.  adopted a edge-enhanced loss to address the problem of blur edges. Su et al. , Zhao et al.  and Zhu et al. [ref]14 applied a separate branch to predict salient boundaries, which can better complement the boundary details of salient objects. Wu et al. [ref]32 and Zhou et al.  proposed a bi-directionally feature refinement mechanism to transfer complementary information between the two tasks of saliency and edge. Wei et al.  decomposed the ground truth into body map and detail map, and adopted two branches to concentrate on center areas of objects and edges respectively. Although the information of edge is introduced to framework, they only contain small parts of the complete object, which is difficult to fill the interior of object. To accurately locate the boundaries and the interiors of the objects at the same time, recent methods introduced edge and skeleton information into framework simultaneously. Liu et al.  developed a dynamic feature integration strategy to explore the feature combinations automatically between salient object, edge and skeleton detection. Wu et al.  proposed a cross multi-branch decoder, which iteratively takes advantage of cross-task aggregation to integrate the features between saliency, edge, and skeleton. However, the divergence of different tasks may bring noises and hard to assistant network uniformly highlight entire salient objects. Whether the methods based on aggregating multi-level features or introducing auxiliary information, they are focused on how to supplement the defects of the object, which lead them hard to get complete prediction in complex scenes. Different above methods by enriching information, we propose a framework that utilize the expanded saliency features to guide the network obtain complete saliency maps with low noises.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: to improve the local details of salient objects.
