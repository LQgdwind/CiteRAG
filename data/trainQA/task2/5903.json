      "content": "Paper Title: RegionPLC: Regional Point-Language Contrastive Learning for Open-World 3D Scene Understanding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOpen-world 3D scene understanding aims to equip models with the ability to accurately perceive and identify open-set objects and categories from 3D data, such as point clouds. This ability is crucial for real-world applications where objects from open-set categories are prevalent   .\nHowever, this task poses significant challenges due to the scarcity of dense 3D semantic annotations, which are difficult to gather and scale to a large vocabulary space. Fortunately, the abundance of paired image and text data from the Internet, featuring a vast semantic vocabulary, has enabled 2D vision-language models to exhibit exceptional open-world image comprehension capabilities. These abilities span various tasks, such as image captioning 3 , grounding  5, and dense semantic prediction 0  1. Consequently, recent research has been inspired to leverage these models to generate pseudo supervision such as dense semantic features 4  and language descriptions [ref]7  for training 3D models, thereby enabling open-world inference without relying on image modalities. Despite advancements, existing solutions still exhibit limitations.\nFor instance, feature distillation-based methods 4 – despite harvesting dense supervision– suffer from the constraints of 2D feature qualities and\nrequire resource-intensive feature extraction, fusion, and storage processes, preventing them from being scaled up with more advanced 3D architectures and larger 3D datasets.\nAdditionally, while [ref]7 utilizes pseudo 3D-language pairs to enable direct learning from large-vocabulary language supervision, it suffers from sparse supervision provided by image captioning models. Considering the recent success of 2D foundation models in image- and region-level vision-language learning, we explore combining their strengths to enrich vocabulary and construct high-quality region-level 3D-language associations. By doing so, our method can yield denser 3D-language supervision and circumvent the knowledge limitations of a single foundation model, facilitating resource-efficient and large-vocabulary 3D learning. To this end, we propose a holistic Regional Point Language Contrastive learning framework, named RegionPLC. This framework generates and fuses diverse region-level captions from powerful 2D vision-language models, which are subsequently mapped to 3D for constructing region-level 3D and language pairs. These paired data are then incorporated into a region-aware point-discriminative contrastive learning framework, enabling 3D open-world learning from dense language supervision. Specifically, we begin by conducting a comprehensive examination of various 2D foundation models (e.g., image captioning 3, dense captioning  5, and detection models ) along with visual prompting techniques for their capability to generate region-level 3D-language pairs.\nBased on our examination, we propose a supplementary-oriented fusion strategy that leverages the geometric relationship of regions in 3D space to alleviate ambiguities and conflicts encountered when combining paired 3D-language data from multiple 2D models, ultimately delivering high-quality dense region-level 3D-language pairs.\nFurthermore, with region-level language data, we introduce a region-aware point-discriminative contrastive loss that prevents the optimization of point-wise embeddings from being disturbed by nearby points from unrelated semantic categories, enhancing the discriminativeness of learned point-wise embeddings. The region-aware design further normalizes the contribution of multiple region-level 3D-language pairs, regardless of their region sizes, making feature learning more robust.\nFinally, by harvesting the 3D-language associations, our RegionPLC can be effortlessly integrated with language models to enable open-ended 3D reasoning with grounding abilities without requiring task-specific data for training.\n We conduct extensive experiments on ScanNet , ScanNet200 8, and nuScenes  datasets, covering both 3D indoor and outdoor scenarios. Our method significantly outperforms existing open-world scene understanding methods, achieving an average of 17.2%percent17.217.2\\% gains in terms of unseen category mIoU for semantic segmentation and an average of 9.1%percent9.19.1\\% gains in terms of unseen category mAP50 for instance segmentation.\nRegionPLC demonstrates promising zero-shot segmentation performance, attaining 40.5%percent40.540.5\\% and 1.8%percent1.81.8\\% higher foreground mIoU compared to PLA [ref]7 and OpenScene 4, respectively. Notably, it achieves this performance while consuming only 17%percent1717\\% of OpenScene’s 4 training cost and 5%percent55\\% of its storage requirements.\nFurthermore, RegionPLC can also be combined with OpenScene to deliver 5.8%percent5.85.8\\% and 10.0%percent10.010.0\\% gains in foreground mIoU and mAcc, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: dense semantic prediction 0  1.
