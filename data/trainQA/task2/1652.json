      "content": "Paper Title: Subcubic Certificates for CFL Reachability\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn interprocedural program analysis,\nthe lack of algorithms\nwith running time O​(n3−ε)𝑂superscript𝑛3𝜀O(n^{3-\\varepsilon})\nis referred to as “the cubic bottleneck”.\nHeintze and McAllester  captured this phenomenon\nby the class of “2NPDA-complete” problems.\nHere “2NPDA” stands for two-way nondeterministic pushdown automata,\na model of computation that extends standard PDA\nwith the ability to move back and forth on the (read-only) input tape .\nA problem is 2NPDA-complete (following Neal )\nif it is subcubic equivalent to 2NPDA recognition:\ngiven a word, does it belong to the language of a fixed 2NPDA.\nHeintze and McAllester show a number of 2NPDA-complete problems, including\nground monadic rewriting reachability (see also ), data flow reachability,\ncontrol flow reachability, and certain (non-)typability problems.\nMelski and Reps  show\na reduction from CFL reachability to data flow reachability and set constraints (and thus to 2NPDA recognition)\nand a reverse reduction from data flow reachability to an instance of CFL reachability\nwhere the language is not fixed. The following result appears to be folklore but is not found in the literature,\nstrengthening the reduction of Melski and Reps to show hardness of CFL\nreachability for the fixed Dyck-222 language.\nThe equivalence between problems (1) and (2) is sketched by Chaudhuri .\nWhile we state the result for PDA emptiness, one can equivalently (or additionally) state it for pushdown reachability.\nWe provide full proofs in the appendix. The following problems either all have truly subcubic\nalgorithms, or none of them do:\n(1) 2NPDA language recognition,\n(2) PDA language emptiness, and\n(3) 𝖣𝟤​𝖱𝖾𝖺𝖼𝗁subscript𝖣2𝖱𝖾𝖺𝖼𝗁\\mathsf{D_{2}Reach}. We show three reductions: In 2NPDA recognition to PDA emptiness,\neach control state of the PDA remembers the position of the 2NPDA on the input tape\nand the control state of the 2NPDA. The size of PDA is linear in the length of the\ninput word, because the 2NPDA is fixed. In PDA emptiness to 𝖣𝟤​𝖱𝖾𝖺𝖼𝗁subscript𝖣2𝖱𝖾𝖺𝖼𝗁\\mathsf{D_{2}Reach},\nthe graph mimics the transition diagram of the PDA.\nStack symbols from ΓΓ\\Gamma are encoded by sequences of opening parentheses\nof two kinds of length ⌈log⁡|Γ|⌉Γ\\lceil\\log|\\Gamma|\\rceil.\nPush transitions are modelled by sequences of edges with these labels,\nand pop transitions by sequences with matching closing parentheses.\nThe reduction is linear-time, because the bit size of the PDA accounts\nfor the log⁡|Γ|Γ\\log|\\Gamma| factor. In the last reduction, we give a fixed 2NPDA that solves 𝖣𝟤​𝖱𝖾𝖺𝖼𝗁subscript𝖣2𝖱𝖾𝖺𝖼𝗁\\mathsf{D_{2}Reach}.\nThe 2NPDA guesses a path through the graph, maintaining at the bottom of the stack\na sequence σ∈{(,[}∗𝜎superscript([\\sigma\\in\\{\\text{{{(}}},\\text{{{[}}}\\}^{*}, and the current vertex at the top of the stack.\nThe length of the input word is proportional to the bit size of the graph (adjacency lists).\n∎ As a corollary, all of these problems have subcubic certificate schemes,\nand an analogue of Theorem 14 holds for them too\n(worked out for PDA emptiness in Section 5).\nTheorem 17 on the absence of 𝖲𝖤𝖳𝖧𝖲𝖤𝖳𝖧\\mathsf{SETH}-hardness also\nextends to PDA emptiness and 2NPDA recognition. For upper bounds, note that 2NPDA recognition is solvable in time O​(|w|3/log⁡|w|)𝑂superscript𝑤3𝑤O(|w|^{3}/\\log|w|) ,\nand language emptiness for PDA in time O​(n3/log⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛3𝑛O(n^{3}/\\log n)111The reduction of Proposition 20, combined with Chaudhuri’s algorithm\nfor CFL reachability , implies\na O​(n3/log⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛3𝑛O(n^{3}/\\log n) bound for PDA emptiness where n𝑛n is the bit size of the input.\n(We give a sketch in Appendix F.)\nIn contrast, “textbook” algorithms for PDA emptiness go through equivalent context-free grammars [ref]30, for which\na cubic blow-up is unavoidable in the worst case 6.\n. We observe that the hardness of 2NPDA recognition is witnessed by a single “hardest” 2NPDA language:\nrecognition for an arbitrary 2NPDA can be reduced to a single 2NPDA.\nSuppose some 2NPDA 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} over ΣΣ\\Sigma is given and the input to 2NPDA recognition for 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} is a word w𝑤w.\nApplying our cycle of reductions from Proposition 20 (to PDA emptiness, then to CFL\nreachability, and then back to 2NPDA recognition), we get another word\nu=u​(𝒜,w)𝑢𝑢𝒜𝑤u=u(\\mathcal{A},w) and a 2NPDA ℬ=ℬ​(𝒜,w)ℬℬ𝒜𝑤\\mathcal{B}=\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{A},w) such that ℬℬ\\mathcal{B} accepts u𝑢u iff 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} accepts w𝑤w.\nBut ℬℬ\\mathcal{B} in fact doesn’t depend on 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} or w𝑤w, because it is\na fixed 2NPDA for 𝖣𝟤​𝖱𝖾𝖺𝖼𝗁subscript𝖣2𝖱𝖾𝖺𝖼𝗁\\mathsf{D_{2}Reach}.\nOne refers to such languages as hardest 2NPDA languages,\nbecause the recognition problem for L​(ℬ)𝐿ℬL(\\mathcal{B})\ncannot be easier than the recognition problem for any 2NPDA language L𝐿L.\nThe following theorem states this result in language-theoretic terms.\n(Recall that a homomorphism is a mapping, say h:Σ∗→Σ0∗:ℎ→superscriptΣsuperscriptsubscriptΣ0h\\colon\\Sigma^{*}\\to\\Sigma_{0}^{*},\nsuch that h​(u​v)=h​(u)​h​(v)ℎ𝑢𝑣ℎ𝑢ℎ𝑣h(uv)=h(u)h(v) for all u,v∈Σ∗𝑢𝑣superscriptΣu,v\\in\\Sigma^{*}.) There exists a 2NPDA 𝒜0subscript𝒜0\\mathcal{A}_{0} over an input alphabet Σ0subscriptΣ0\\Sigma_{0}\nwith the following property:\nfor every 2NPDA 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} over every finite ΣΣ\\Sigma there is a homomorphism h:Σ∗→Σ0∗:ℎ→superscriptΣsuperscriptsubscriptΣ0h\\colon\\Sigma^{*}\\to\\Sigma_{0}^{*} such that, for all w∈Σ+𝑤superscriptΣw\\in\\Sigma^{+},\nw∈L​(𝒜)𝑤𝐿𝒜w\\in L(\\mathcal{A}) if and only if h​(w)∈L​(𝒜0)ℎ𝑤𝐿subscript𝒜0h(w)\\in L(\\mathcal{A}_{0}). Essentially, ℬ=𝒜0ℬsubscript𝒜0\\mathcal{B}=\\mathcal{A}_{0}.\nWorking out the details shows that the mapping u​(𝒜,⋅)𝑢𝒜⋅u(\\mathcal{A},\\cdot) can be made a homomorphism\nfor every 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}.\nThis requires an appropriate encoding for inputs to 𝒜0subscript𝒜0\\mathcal{A}_{0}. Rytter  showed there is a fixed hardest 2NPDA language L0subscript𝐿0L_{0},222Actually, Rytter only proves that, for all\nw∈Σ+𝑤superscriptΣw\\in\\Sigma^{+}, one has w∈L𝑤𝐿w\\in L iff h​(w​$)∈L0ℎ𝑤currency-dollarsubscript𝐿0h(w\\$)\\in L_{0}.\n\nbased on the classic hardest context-free\nlanguage by Greibach 8.\nTheorem 21 identifies a different hardest 2NPDA language.\nIn contrast with Rytter’s proof, our construction is self-contained\nand does not depend on Greibach’s hardest CFL.\nInstead, our new hardest 2NPDA language is an encoding of a restricted\nversion of Dyck-2 Reachability. We now describe the hardest language L​(𝒜0)𝐿subscript𝒜0L(\\mathcal{A}_{0}).\nThe alphabet is\nΣ0={(,),[,],#,1,−,∗}subscriptΣ0()[]#1\\Sigma_{0}=\\{\\text{{{(}}},\\text{{{)}}},\\text{{{[}}},\\text{{{]}}},\\#,1,{-},*\\}.\nThe language contains only words of the form and the membership of such words in the language is determined as follows.\nConsider a directed graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) with V={1,…,n}𝑉1…𝑛V=\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}\nwhere n𝑛n is the number of blocks separated by the vertex marker ##\\#.\nAn edge e=(i,j)𝑒𝑖𝑗e=(i,j) belongs to E𝐸E if and only if\nthe i𝑖ith block has a subword ℓp​opsubscriptℓ𝑝subscript𝑜𝑝\\ell_{p}o_{p} with\nℓp∈{(,),[,]}subscriptℓ𝑝()[]\\ell_{p}\\in\\{\\text{{{(}}},\\text{{{)}}},\\text{{{[}}},\\text{{{]}}}\\}, op=1ksubscript𝑜𝑝superscript1𝑘o_{p}=1^{k} or op=−1ksubscript𝑜𝑝superscript1𝑘o_{p}=-1^{k}\nwhere j=i+k𝑗𝑖𝑘j=i+k\nand this subword is preceded and followed by symbols from {#,∗}#\\{\\#,*\\}\nor tape endmarker.\nThe edge label is in this case λ​(e)=ℓi𝜆𝑒subscriptℓ𝑖\\lambda(e)=\\ell_{i}.\n(If for some i𝑖i and k𝑘k the index j𝑗j is “off the tape”,\nthe tape endmarker counts as one virtual vertex and then\nthe counting reverses the direction, “reflecting” off the endmarker.)\nThe word belongs to L​(𝒜0)𝐿subscript𝒜0L(\\mathcal{A}_{0}) if and only if\n(G,λ,1,n)𝐺𝜆1𝑛(G,\\lambda,1,n) is a yes-instance of 𝖣𝟤​𝖱𝖾𝖺𝖼𝗁subscript𝖣2𝖱𝖾𝖺𝖼𝗁\\mathsf{D_{2}Reach},\ni.e., if G𝐺G contains a walk from 111 to n𝑛n labelled by a word from\nthe Dyck-2 language. To sum up,\nthis restricted version of 2NPDA recognition is the “hard core”\nof the problem:\nby Theorems 21 and 20,\nin order to find subcubic algorithms for\n𝖣𝟤​𝖱𝖾𝖺𝖼𝗁subscript𝖣2𝖱𝖾𝖺𝖼𝗁\\mathsf{D_{2}Reach}, it suffices to handle instances obtained from it\n(exploiting any structural\nproperties).\nPDA emptiness and 𝖣𝟤​𝖱𝖾𝖺𝖼𝗁subscript𝖣2𝖱𝖾𝖺𝖼𝗁\\mathsf{D_{2}Reach} are already hard for sparse graphs:\na truly subcubic algorithm for either problem restricted\nto graphs with a linear number of edges\nwould already result in a breakthrough algorithm for 2NPDA recognition.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: n) bound for PDA emptiness where n𝑛n is the bit size of the input.\n(We give a sketch in Appendix F.)\nIn contrast, “textbook” algorithms for PDA emptiness go through equivalent context-free grammars [ref]30, for which\na cubic blow-up is unavoidable in the worst case 6.\n.
