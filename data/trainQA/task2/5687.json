Their appearance has piqued the interest of researchers from various disciplines, e.g. finance , technology , economics  and management  to participate in the research and study. And, DLT is the underlying underpinning of the explosion and rapid development of these technologies. A distributed ledger is an immutable, transparent, and decentralized data storage and transfer protocol that is maintained by a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of participants. Besides, the network participants use a consensus protocol to determine which participant has the right to update the ledger and in which order. The ledger is updated using transactions that contain a set of attributes like sender and receiver addresses, the amount of cryptocurrency to transfer, a smart contract function to invoke and its input parameters, and a digital signature. A distributed ledger can be structured as a blockchain (i.e., a linked chain of blocks), directed acyclic graph (DAG) , HashGraph, HoloChain, or Tempo . In the first type of DLT, blockchain organizes transactions into blocks, which are linked together by consensus mechanisms [ref]68. Differently, DAG technology does not require miners to confirm and validate transactions like Proof of Work consensus (PoW) does [ref]69. The DAG transactions are confirmed in the sequential flow by nodes, which validated at least two of the previous transactions on the ledger. Furthermore, a node’s transactions on the distributed ledger database become more valid when this node validated more preceding transactions. DAG is considered as an alternative approach to the blockchain with greater improvements in terms of scalability and fee-less nano-transactions. Next, for the hashgraph structure, transactions are stored in a parallel structure on the same timestamp. With the support of gossip and virtual voting protocols, the transaction is verified by nodes in the network before being recorded in the ledger . This structure stands out for its small storage unit requirement and the fact that each node will be aware when a consensus has been reached that the blockchain’s nodes are uncertain. Especially, a much more decentralized-driven architecture, named Holochain, intends to avoid using any global consensus protocol. Therefore, it provides every node with its own chain and becomes an agent-centric structure . The last one, called Tempo, uses a technique known as sharding to divide the ledger, which properly orders all of the network events that occurred. In essence, transactions are recorded in the ledger according to the sequence of events rather than the time stamp . Until now, since BC is the distributed ledger technology that is most commonly used, we mainly focus on BC technology in this work. Blockchain. Satoshi Nakamoto introduced the first blockchain, Bitcoin, in 2008 [ref]68, and it was released in 2009 as the sparking platform for more than 10000 cryptocurrencies that have evolved since then . blockchain is made up of records of transactions or blocks that are chained together to form a tamper-resistant ledger, and it allows for secure decentralized data storage in distributed networks. As an element of the blockchain, each block consists of a header and a body containing a batch of validated transactions. The header of a block, in particular (except for the first, known as the genesis block), contains an inverse reference pointing to a previous block. The hashed value of the previous block is used as the inverse reference. This prevents fraudulent actions because a change in any block in historical records invalidates all blocks because all subsequent hashes change, and nodes in the blockchain detect it. A block header also contains other fields such as Version, Timestamp, MerkleRoot, or Nonce, counting on specific purposes. Besides, different blockchains have different block size limits. For instance, while the block size of Bitcoin is limited to 1 MB and is able to store around 2000 transactions, each Ethereum block has a target size of 15 million gas, expandable to 30 million based on demand [ref]68  . To form a distributed consensus between nodes, blocks and their transactions are transmitted and verified across the network. When a transaction is created, it is signed by the owner of the source assets, who possesses a pair of public and private keys. Then, the transaction is broadcast to the entire blockchain network, where each network node validates and propagates it based on a list of criteria. Every node, known as a miner or validator, that receives transactions from various sources, only forwards transactions to its peers when it has already verified these transactions. This ensures invalid transactions are immediately dropped. They will have a memory pool of verified transactions for building blocks at the time. In addition, if a miner wants to create a block, the distributed consensus problem must be solved. Therefore, only miners who solve the consensus problem can broadcast their new blocks across the network. Now, other nodes will participate in the block validation process  . When a block is proved to be eligible by any node who saw it, it is appended to miners’ local chains where the miners have not solved the consensus problem yet, via the inverse reference pointing to the parent block. A block’s generator may claim a certain number of new coins as well as fees collected from all enclosed transactions. For example, in the case of Bitcoin, Alice and Bob create their own public and private keys. They are able to share public keys with each other in the entire network, while private keys are kept secretly. Alice wants to send two bitcoins to Bob. To accomplish this, Alice must sign a transaction with her private key containing the main information, such as transaction inputs and outputs. This transaction is now broadcast to the Bitcoin network to wait for verification. Then, miners in the network try to verify Alice’s transaction by validating a list of criteria such as the signature in this one. If all requirements are valid, the transaction is grouped into blocks with other verified transactions by miners. Each node or miner works on solving a difficult puzzle for its block in the PoW consensus algorithm. The first miner who successfully completes PoW is permitted to propagate its newly-created block to neighbors. After that, other miners will double checks this block under shared rules. For instance, miners ensure that all transactions in the proposed block are valid (e.g., the block size is within acceptable limits and the first (and only) transaction is a coinbase generation transaction). Next, they also check whether the new block points to its predecessor in the longest chain. If it does, this block would be assembled into miners’ local chains. Different miners will build upon it by referring to it as the prior block. Eventually, as blocks are added to the longest chain, the transaction is completed, and Bob receives Alice’s coins. The miner who creates the accepted block receives a number of coins and transaction fees for their effort. The entire process of a transaction working is illustrated in Figure 4.\n\nReference markers found: [61]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]61: Distributed Ledger Technologies.\nIn recent years, we have heard various buzzwords appearing in every media hype like Metaverse , cryptocurrencies [ref]61, or non-fungible tokens.
