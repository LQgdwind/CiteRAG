      "content": "Paper Title: An Unsupervised Normalization Algorithm for Noisy Text: A Case Study for Information Retrieval and Stance Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTextual content can contain different types of noise , and\nsignificant amount of research has been done on noisy text.\nSome prior works attempted to understand the effect of noise present in text data on applications such as classification .\nAlso some works have explored the use of artificially generated noise for cleansing noisy text. For instance, Gadde et al. 0 proposed methods for artificially injecting noise in text, through random character deletion, replacement, phonetic substitution, simulating typing errors, and so on. Several methods have been developed for the normalization of noisy text, especially microblogs 1 2 3.\nBased on the approach taken, text normalization methods can be broadly classified into two categories: Supervised text normalization methods: Such approaches rely on a training dataset, which is usually a parallel corpus of canonical (correct) and noisy strings.\nFor example, in 4, a noisy channel model was employed to perform text normalization.\nIncorporation of phonetic information has been shown to help text normalization,\ne.g., Toutanova et. al 5 included word pronunciation information in a noisy channel framework.\nGNU Aspell (http://aspell.net/), a popular spelling correction tool, also uses phonetic and lexical information to find normalized words. More recently, neural models such as RNN 6 and Encoder-Decoder models 7 have also been used for text normalization.\nSome prior works have also modeled the text normalization problem as machine translation from the noisy text to the clean version 8. Supervised methods require huge amounts of training data in the form of a parallel corpus, i.e., pairs of noisy and clean text.\nSuch a parallel corpus is often difficult to get, especially for low-resource languages. Even for resource-rich languages, creating a training dataset involves a lot of human intervention, thus making it a costly process. Unsupervised methods try to mitigate some of these problems. Unsupervised text normalization methods: These methods make use of the contextual and lexical information available from the corpora to perform normalization, without the need for any training data.\nFor instance, Kolak et al. 9 applied a noisy channel based pattern recognition approach to perform OCR text correction.\nGhosh et al.  used a combination of contextual and syntactic information to find the morphological variants of a word.\nWord embeddings (e.g., Word2vec ) have shown great potential in capturing the contextual information of a word, and hence\nword embedding based contextual information has been used in many of the recent works [ref]8 .\nFor instance, Sridhar [ref]8 used contextual information to find a set of candidate variants, which is refined based on a lexical similarity score. In this work, we propose an unsupervised text normalization algorithm, and show that it performs competitively with some of the methods mentioned above [ref]8 . Task-independent vs. Task-specific text normalization methods:\nText normalization methods can also be categorized into two broad categories based on whether a method is meant for a specific task.\nMost of the methods stated above, including spelling correction tools, are task-independent – they aim to correct the misspelled words in a corpus.\nOn the other hand, some task-specific text normalization methods have also been proposed.\nFor instance, Satapathy et al.  proposed a method for normalizing tweets specifically for sentiment analysis.\nVinciarelli et al.  attempted normalization of noisy text specifically for categorization.\nAgain, Ghosh et al.  used co-occurrence counts and edit-distance measures to find morphological variants of query words for the task of information retrieval from OCR-ed documents. The proposed method is a task-independent one, and the experiments in the paper show that the data cleansing performed by the proposed method can be helpful for various tasks such as retrieval and stance detection.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: (e.g., Word2vec ) have shown great potential in capturing the contextual information of a word, and hence\nword embedding based contextual information has been used in many of the recent works [ref]8 .\nFor instance, Sridhar [ref]8 used contextual information to find a set of candidate variants, which is refined based on a lexical similarity score. In this work, we propose an unsupervised\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
