      "content": "Paper Title: Rank-n-Contrast: Learning Continuous Representations for Regression\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRegression problems are pervasive and fundamental in the real world, spanning various tasks and domains including estimating age from human appearance , predicting health scores via human physiological signals [ref]11, and detecting gaze directions using webcam images . Due to the continuity in regression targets, the most widely adopted approach for training regression models is to directly predict the target value and employ a distance-based loss function, such as L1subscriptùêø1L_{1} or L2subscriptùêø2L_{2} distance, between the prediction and the ground-truth target [ref]51  .\nMethods that tackle regression tasks using classification models trained with cross-entropy loss have also been studied   . However, previous methods focus on imposing constraints on the final predictions in an end-to-end fashion, but do not explicitly emphasize the representations learned by the model.\nUnfortunately, these representations are often fragmented and incapable of capturing the continuous relationships that underlie regression tasks.\nFig.¬†1(a) highlights the representations learned by the L1subscriptùêø1L_{1} loss on SkyFinder¬†[ref]7, a regression dataset for predicting weather temperature from webcam outdoor images captured at different locations (details in Sec. 5).\nRather than exhibiting the continuous ground-truth temperatures, the learned representations are grouped by different webcams in a fragmented manner. Such unordered and fragmented representation is suboptimal for the regression task and can even hamper performance by including irrelevant information, such as the capturing webcam. Furthermore, despite the great success of representation learning schemes on solving discrete classification or segmentation tasks (e.g., contrastive learning   and supervised contrastive learning (SupCon) ), less attention has been paid to designing algorithms that capture the intrinsic continuity in data for regression.\nInterestingly, we highlight that existing representation learning methods inevitably overlook the continuous nature in data: Fig.¬†1(b) shows the representation learned by SupCon on the SkyFinder¬†dataset, where it again fails to capture the underlying continuous order between the samples, resulting in a suboptimal representation for regression tasks. To fill the gap, we present Rank-n-Contrast (RnC), a novel framework for generic regression learning.\nRnC¬†first learns a regression-aware representation that orders the distances in the embedding space based on the target values, and then leverages it to predict the continuous targets.\nTo achieve this, we propose the Rank-n-Contrast loss (‚ÑíRnCsubscript‚ÑíRnC\\mathcal{L_{\\text{{RnC}}}}), which ranks the samples in a batch according to their labels and then contrasts them against each other based on their relative rankings.\nTheoretically, we prove that optimizing ‚ÑíRnCsubscript‚ÑíRnC\\mathcal{L_{\\text{{RnC}}}} results in features that are ordered according to the continuous labels, leading to improved performance in downstream regression tasks. As confirmed in Fig.¬†1(c), RnC¬†learns continuous representations that capture the intrinsic ordered relationships between samples.\nNotably, our framework is orthogonal to existing regression methods, allowing for the use of any regression method to map the learned representation to the final prediction values. To support practical evaluations, we benchmark RnC¬†against state-of-the-art (SOTA) regression and representation learning schemes on five real-world regression datasets that span computer vision, human-computer interaction, and healthcare. Rigorous experiments verify the superior performance, robustness, and efficiency of RnC¬†on learning continuous targets. Our contributions are as follows: We identify the limitation of current regression and representation learning methods for continuous targets, and uncover intrinsic properties of learning regression-aware representations. We design RnC, a simple & effective method that learns continuous representations for regression. We conduct extensive experiments on five diverse regression datasets in vision, human-computer interaction, and healthcare, verifying the superior performance of RnC¬†against SOTA schemes. Further analyses reveal intriguing properties of RnC¬†on its data efficiency, robustness to spurious targets & data corruptions, and better generalization to unseen targets.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: problems are pervasive and fundamental in the real world, spanning various tasks and domains including estimating age from human appearance , predicting health scores via human physiological signals [ref]11, and detecting gaze directions using webcam images .
