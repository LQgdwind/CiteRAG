For humans to trust the decision of DNNs, not only the model must perform well on the specified task, it also must generate explanations that are easy to interpret. A series of explanation methods (e.g., gradient-based saliency/attribution map approaches       [ref]38  as well as many that are not based on gradients              ) have been developed to connect a DNN’s prediction to its input. Among them, Integrated Gradients (IG) , a well-known gradient-based explanation method, and its variants   have attracted significant interest due to their state-of-the-art explanation performance and desirable theoretical properties. However, we observe that explanation noise exists in the attribution generated by these IG methods (please see Fig. 1).\nIn this research, we investigate IG-based methods, study the explanation noise introduced by these methods, propose a framework to remove the explanation noise, and empirically validate the effectiveness of our approach. A few recent IG-based methods (e.g., [ref]38 ,\n,\n1)\nhave been proposed to address the noise issue. Kapishnikov et al. provide the following main reasons111 mentions the accuracy of integration is also a reason to generate the noise, but this is not the focus of existing IG methods and this paper. that could generate the noise: 1) DNN model’s shape often has a high curvature; and 2) The choice of the reference point impacts explanation. They propose Guided Integrated\nGradients (GIG) , which tackles point #1 by iteratively finding the integration path that tries to avoid the high curvature points in the space. Blur Integral Gradients , on the other hand, shows that the noise could be reduced by finding the integration path through the frequency domain instead of the original image domain.\nFormally, it finds the path by successively blurring the input via a Gaussian blur filter. Sturmfels et al.1 tackle point #2 by performing the integration from multiple reference points, while Smilkov et al.[ref]38 aggregate the attribution with respect to multiple Gaussian noisy inputs to reduce the noise.\nNevertheless, all IG-based methods share a common point in that they\ncompute the integration of gradients via the Riemann integral.\nWe highlight that, the integration calculation by the existing methods fundamentally\nintroduces the explanation noise. To this end, we offer a general solution that eliminates the noise by examining the integration directions from the explanation perspective. Specifically, we investigate each computation step in the Riemann Integration and then theorize about the noises’ origin. Each Riemann integration calculation integrates the gradient in the original direction—it first computes the gradient with respect to the starting point of the current path segment and then multiplies the gradient by the path segment. We show that the original direction can be divided into an important direction and a noise direction. We theoretically demonstrate that the true gradient is orthogonal to the noise direction, resulting in the gradient’s multiplication along the noise direction having no effect on the attribution. Based on this observation, we design a framework, termed Important Direction Gradient Integration (IDGI), that can eliminate the explanation noise in each step of the computation in any existing IG method.\nExtensive investigations reveal that IDGI reduces noise significantly when evaluated using state-of-the-art IG-based methods. In summary, our main contributions are as follows: We propose the Important Direction Gradient Integration (IDGI), a general framework to eliminate the explanation noise in IG-based methods, and investigate its theoretical properties. We propose a novel measurement for assessing the attribution techniques’ quality, i.e., AIC and SIC using MS-SSIM. We show that this metric offers a more precise measurement than the original AIC and SIC. Our extensive evaluations on 11 image classifiers with 3 existing and 1 proposed attribution assessment techniques indicate that IDGI significantly improves the attribution quality over the existing IG-based methods.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: With the deployment of deep neural network (DNN) models for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving [ref]7   and medical diagnostics  , explaining the decisions of DNNs has become a critical concern.
