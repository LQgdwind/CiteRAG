Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

These include prompt-to-prompt editing [ref]19 [ref]29, composing scenes through composable prompts , and methods for personalization of subjects in a generative model [ref]41. Composable Diffusion  takes a structured approach to generate images where separate diffusion models generate distinct components of an image. As a result, they can generate more complex imagery than seen during the training. Composed GLIDE  is a composable diffusion implementation that builds upon the GLIDE model  and utilizes compositional operators to combine textual operations. Dreambooth [ref]41 allows the personalization of subjects in a text-to-image diffusion model through fine-tuning. The learned subjects can be put in totally new contexts such as scenes, poses, and lighting conditions. Prompt-to-prompt editing techniques  [ref]19 [ref]29 exploit the information in cross-attention layers of a diffusion model by pinpointing areas that spatially correspond to particular words in a prompt. These areas can then be modified according to the change of the words in the prompt.\nOur method is complementary to these advances. We concentrate specifically on composing the spatial segments specified via a spatial layout. So, in principle, our methods can be supplemented with these capabilities (and vice versa).\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: Some works look at the composition or editing of images through a different lens.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
