      "content": "Paper Title: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes in Robotics: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPOMDPs have succeeded in many robot tasks that require reasoning about uncertain future outcomes using incomplete or noisy data.\nThis section outlines some of the outstanding challenges that we believe crucial for further progress in the field.\nAccurate models are required for planning, but difficult to acquire.\nRobotics tasks are often inherently continuous, while the classic POMDP framework has mainly focused on the discrete case.\nFinally, in safety-critical robotic tasks, more robust probabilistic guarantees are needed to guarantee safety. Model uncertainty.\nIn many realistic robotic tasks that could be modeled as a POMDP, there is considerable uncertainty about the model parameters.\nMost approaches reviewed in this survey assume that\ndynamics, observation, and reward models are given. However,\nobtaining such models either by learning or expert design can be\nchallenging in robotics. Kinematic modeling of rigid robots is well\nunderstood but efficient modeling of heavy hydraulic\nmachines , soft robots , or,\ncomplex physics in man-made and natural\nenvironments  are unsolved active\nresearch topics.\nPOMDP approaches often require model simplifications for tractability, and handling problems with intricacies such as\nnon-stationary or switching-mode dynamics may also be challenging. Recent works have proposed several learning methods for robotic tasks that can help tackle model uncertainty, for example combination of planning methods with imitation learning for grasping [ref]49, representation learning for beliefs , and multi-robot reinforcement learning for navigation [ref]161 or temporal abstraction .\nTechniques such as Bayesian reinforcement learning (BRL)  could be applied when the model has been identified up to a handful of unknown parameters.\nBRL treats the unknown parameters as additional state variables.\nAfter defining a prior on the unknown parameters, a policy that optimally gathers information on the parameters is solved for   .\nWhen considerably less prior information about the model parameters is available, e.g., when identifying a model for image observations, models could be learned directly from data and then used for planning.\nA promising recent trend is task-driven end-to-end learning, which integrates planning with model learning.\nFor example, we could learn latent space models for planning with image data  and for long-horizon tasks . We could also train a neural network to produce plans, thus making the planning algorithm differentiable. The Differentiable Algorithm Network (DAN) leverages the latest advances in deep learning to learn a model most useful for planning, even though it may deviate from the ground truth .\nTranslating these advances to robotic tasks is an important future direction. Continuous state, action, observation, and time.\nThe classic POMDP model consists of discrete states, actions, observations, and time, while robots operate in the physical world and often require continuous models for control.\nDiscretizing continuous values can\nresult in inaccurate solutions especially in high dimensional\ntasks. One approach is to assume specific probability distributions,\npolicies, or, state, action, observation representations. For example,\nlinear quadratic Gaussian control assumes Gaussian distributions and a\nlinear feedback control policy .\nModern online POMDP algorithms, specifically, POMCP  and DESPOT , relax these restrictive assumptions. They directly handle continuous states and observations through Monte Carlo sampling. However, the actions remain discrete.\nOne future direction\nis to transfer recent advances in\ncontinuous POMDP methods 7 to novel robotic\ntasks.\nPractical real world control often assumes\ndiscrete time steps, even under full observability. However, some\nsystems can benefit from continuous time control, in robotics especially\nnon-linear systems that require fast responses. Continuous time MDPs have been\ninvestigated as semi-MDPs 8 which\nconsist of a sequence of continuous time fragments.\nWhile existing work on continuous time POMDPs is scarce ,\nnovel continuous time contributions\ncould enable solutions to new robotic tasks. Safe POMDPs in robotics. Safety is an inherent requirement in\nseveral robotic applications such as human-robot interaction or autonomous\ndriving where partial observability plays an important role. However, typically safety requires constrained POMDP\nsolutions  [ref]90 that can guarantee how\noften unsafe events may happen on\naverage    [ref]90.\nThere is an opportunity for scaling and extending constrained POMDP methods\nsuch that they become a standard tool in robotics.\nAt\nthe moment these methods are however limited to only a few robotic\napplications.\nOn the one hand, these limitations are due to computational complexity, such as the “curse of dimensionality” due to state space discretization , that limit the scale of problems that can be addressed.\nOn the other hand, safety-constrained methods are safe with respect to the POMDP model of the task, whereas there may still be a gap between the model and the real task. Robots are systems where knowing which sensors and actuators are fully operational is crucial for safety and robustness.\nSuch questions are tackled by system health monitoring, which is becoming increasingly unified with decision-making, see  and references therein.\nThis implies further possibilities for leveraging POMDP planning for objectives such as greater fault resiliency in robotics.\n\nReference markers found: [49]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]49: Recent works have proposed several learning methods for robotic tasks that can help tackle model uncertainty, for example combination of planning methods with imitation learning for grasping [ref]49, representation learning for beliefs , and multi-robot reinforcement learning for navigation [ref]161 or temporal abstraction .\nTechniques such as Bayesian reinforcement learning (BRL)  could\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
