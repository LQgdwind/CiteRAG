Top-k𝑘k , skyline   and regret minimization queries   [ref]16   are three important tools which were fully explored in the last two decades. Given a utility (preference or score are another two concepts interchangeably used in the literature) function, top-k𝑘k queries need users to specify their utility functions and return the best k𝑘k points with the highest utilities. Skyline queries output the points which are not dominated by any other points in the database. Here, domination means two points are comparable. A point p𝑝p is said to dominate another point q𝑞q if p𝑝p is not worse than q𝑞q in each dimension and p𝑝p is better than q𝑞q in at least one dimension. However, both queries suffer from their inherent drawbacks. For skyline queries, the results cannot be foreseen before the whole database is accessed. In addition, the output size of skyline queries will increase rapidly with the dimensionality. Top-k𝑘k queries ask users to specify their utility functions, but the user may not be able to clearly know what weight each attribute should be, which brings a big challenge to top-k𝑘k queries. Regret minimization queries return a subset of data points from the database under a required size k𝑘k that minimizes the maximum regret ratio across all possible utility functions. Here regret ratio of a subset is defined as the relative difference in utilities between the top-1 point in the subset and the top-1 point in the entire database. The regret minimization query has the merits of both top-k𝑘k and skyline queries, i.e., the output size (k𝑘k) can be controlled while it does not need users to specify the utility functions. Moreover, it has been verified that small regret ratio can be achieved by presenting only a few tuples . For example, when there are 2 criteria (dimensions/attributes), 10 points are presented to guarantee a maximum regret ratio of 10% in the worst case, and the same number of points still make the maximum regret ratio below 35% for 10 criteria. But the regret ratios shown above cannot make users satisfied. If we want to achieve 1% maximum regret ratio with 10 criteria, we have to show about 1,000 points to the user . Fortunately, it has shown that interaction is much helpful to reduce the user’s regret ratio  . In  , the interaction worked as follows which requires little user effort. When presenting a screen of points, the user chooses his/her favorite point. Based on the user’s choice, the system modifies the simulated user’s utility function and shows another screen of points for next round of interaction until the user has no regret in front of the displayed points or the regret ratio of the user is below a small threshold ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon. The aim of each interaction round is to approach the user’s true utility function which he/she cannot specify. However, the main drawback of existing methods   is that they need too many rounds of interaction to achieve a low regret ratio. For example, for a 4-dimensional anti-correlated dataset with 10,000 points generated by the data generator , the method proposed in  needs 21 rounds of interaction when displaying 5 points a time to achieve 0.1% regret ratio. For the algorithms proposed in , 9 rounds of interaction are needed when displaying 4 points a time to find the user’s favorite point. Too many interaction rounds of the existing methods take too much effort of the user. In this paper, we propose sorting-based interaction mechanism to reduce the rounds of users’ interaction. Instead of pointing out the favorite point among the displayed points at each interaction, the user sorts the displayed points according to his/her utility function. As we know that for s𝑠s data points, the time complexity of choosing the best point is O​(s)𝑂𝑠O(s) while the time complexity of sorting s𝑠s data points is O​(s​log2⁡s)𝑂𝑠subscript2𝑠O(s\\log_{2}s) on average and O​(s)𝑂𝑠O(s) in the best case. If s𝑠s is small, that is, only displaying several points, the time complexities of finding the maximum utility point and sorting have little difference. Thus sorting the displayed points does not increase user’s effort. Also, when a user points out the best point, at the same time he/she has browsed all the points which makes him/her easy sort these points, especially in front of only several points. By sorting, our proposed method will need few rounds of interaction because our sorting mechanism can help to shrink the utility function space rapidly. Following is an example to show the pruning power of our sorting-based interactive regret minimization method. Suppose there are 3 points p1​(10,1)subscript𝑝1101p_{1}(10,1), p2​(9,2)subscript𝑝292p_{2}(9,2) and p3​(8,5)subscript𝑝385p_{3}(8,5) displayed to the user and the utility space is composed by three utility functions {f1,f2,f3}subscript𝑓1subscript𝑓2subscript𝑓3\\{f_{1},f_{2},f_{3}\\} as shown in Table 1. The utility is the inner product of point p𝑝p and utility function f𝑓f, e.g., f1​(p1)=10×0.8+1×0.2=8.2subscript𝑓1subscript𝑝1100.810.28.2f_{1}(p_{1})=10\\times 0.8+1\\times 0.2=8.2. Without sorting, when the user points out p1subscript𝑝1p_{1} is his/her favorite point, utility function f3subscript𝑓3f_{3} will not be considered because f3​(p3)>f3​(p1)>f3​(p2)subscript𝑓3subscript𝑝3subscript𝑓3subscript𝑝1subscript𝑓3subscript𝑝2f_{3}(p_{3})>f_{3}(p_{1})>f_{3}(p_{2}) and f1subscript𝑓1f_{1}, f2subscript𝑓2f_{2} are both possible user’s utility functions. If the user sorts the 3 points with p1>p2>p3subscript𝑝1subscript𝑝2subscript𝑝3p_{1}>p_{2}>p_{3}, utility functions f2subscript𝑓2f_{2}, f3subscript𝑓3f_{3} are pruned (f2subscript𝑓2f_{2} is pruned because f2​(p1)>f2​(p3)>f2​(p2)subscript𝑓2subscript𝑝1subscript𝑓2subscript𝑝3subscript𝑓2subscript𝑝2f_{2}(p_{1})>f_{2}(p_{3})>f_{2}(p_{2})). We can see that our sorting based method can faster approach user’s actual utility function with fewer rounds of interaction. In summary, the main contributions of this paper are listed as follows. We propose a sorting-based pruning strategy, which can shrink user’s utility space more quickly than existing interactive regret minimization algorithms. Based on the utility space after pruning, we prune the candidate set by utility hyperplanes to ensure that the displayed points in the next round of interaction are more reasonable and close to the user’s favorite point. Two sorting-based interactive regret minimization algorithms, namely Sorting-Random and Sorting-Simplex are proposed based on random and Simplex strategies respectively for displayed points selection. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets are conducted to verify efficiency and effectiveness of our sorting-based algorithms which outperform the existing interactive regret minimization algorithms. Roadmap Related work is described in Section 2. We provide some basic concepts of the regret minimization query as well as some geometric concepts and our interactive framework in Section 3. Our sorting-based technique is introduced in Section 4. In Section 4, the utility function space pruning strategies via sorting as well as the candidate points selection are detailed. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets are reported in Section 5. Section 6 concludes this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: To select a small subset to represent the whole dataset is an important functionality for multi-criteria decision making in database systems.
