      "content": "Paper Title: Logical Characterizations of Recurrent Graph Neural Networks with Reals and Floats\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA graph neural network (GNN) is a neural network architecture for graph-structured data. It may be\nviewed as a distributed system where the nodes of the (directed, node-labeled) input graph calculate with real numbers and communicate synchronously in discrete rounds. More formally, given d∈ℤ+𝑑subscriptℤd\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{+} and Π⊆PROPΠPROP\\Pi\\subseteq\\mathrm{PROP}, a recurrent graph neural network GNN​[ℝ]GNNdelimited-[]ℝ\\mathrm{GNN}[\\mathbb{R}] for (Π,d)Π𝑑(\\Pi,d) is a tuple 𝒢=(ℝd,π,δ,F)𝒢superscriptℝ𝑑𝜋𝛿𝐹\\mathcal{G}=(\\mathbb{R}^{d},\\pi,\\delta,F).\nA recurrent graph neural network computes in a (node-labeled) directed graph (represented as a Kripke model) as follows.\nIn any ΠΠ\\Pi-model (W,R,V)𝑊𝑅𝑉(W,R,V), the initialization function π:𝒫​(Π)→ℝd:𝜋→𝒫Πsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\pi\\colon\\mathcal{P}(\\Pi)\\to\\mathbb{R}^{d} assigns to each node v𝑣v an initial feature vector or state xv0=π​(V​(v))superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑣0𝜋𝑉𝑣x_{v}^{0}=\\pi(V(v)).\nIn each round t=1,2,…𝑡12…t=1,2,\\dots, every node computes a new feature vector xvtsuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑣𝑡x_{v}^{t} using a transition function δ:ℝd×ℳ​(ℝd)→ℝd,δ​(x,y)=COM​(x,AGG​(y)):𝛿formulae-sequence→superscriptℝ𝑑ℳsuperscriptℝ𝑑superscriptℝ𝑑𝛿𝑥𝑦COM𝑥AGG𝑦\\delta\\colon\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\times\\mathcal{M}(\\mathbb{R}^{d})\\to\\mathbb{R}^{d},\\delta(x,y)=\\mathrm{COM}(x,\\mathrm{AGG}(y)), which is a composition of an aggregation function AGG:ℳ​(ℝd)→ℝd:AGG→ℳsuperscriptℝ𝑑superscriptℝ𝑑\\mathrm{AGG}\\colon\\mathcal{M}(\\mathbb{R}^{d})\\to\\mathbb{R}^{d} (typically sum, min, max or average) and a combination function COM:ℝd×ℝd→ℝd:COM→superscriptℝ𝑑superscriptℝ𝑑superscriptℝ𝑑\\mathrm{COM}\\colon\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{d} such that where double curly brackets {{…}}…\\{\\{...\\}\\} denote multisets.\nThe recurrent GNNGNN\\mathrm{GNN} 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} accepts a pointed ΠΠ\\Pi-model (M,w)𝑀𝑤(M,w) if w𝑤w visits (at least once) a state in the set of accepting feature vectors F⊆ℝd𝐹superscriptℝ𝑑F\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^{d}, i.e., xwt∈Fsuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑤𝑡𝐹x_{w}^{t}\\in F for some t∈ℕ𝑡ℕt\\in\\mathbb{N}.\nA constant-iteration GNN​[ℝ]GNNdelimited-[]ℝ\\mathrm{GNN}[\\mathbb{R}] is a pair (𝒢,L)𝒢𝐿(\\mathcal{G},L) where 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is a GNN​[ℝ]GNNdelimited-[]ℝ\\mathrm{GNN}[\\mathbb{R}] and L∈ℕ𝐿ℕL\\in\\mathbb{N}. It accepts a pointed model (M,w)𝑀𝑤(M,w) if xwL∈Fsubscriptsuperscript𝑥𝐿𝑤𝐹x^{L}_{w}\\in F. Informally, we simply run a GNN​[ℝ]GNNdelimited-[]ℝ\\mathrm{GNN}[\\mathbb{R}] for L𝐿L iterations and accept/reject based on the last iteration.\nWe say that 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} (resp., (𝒢,L)𝒢𝐿(\\mathcal{G},L)) defines (or expresses) a node property 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} over ΠΠ\\Pi if 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} (resp., (𝒢,L)𝒢𝐿(\\mathcal{G},L)) accepts exactly the pointed ΠΠ\\Pi-models in 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P}. A node property 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} is definable by (or expressible as) a GNN​[ℝ]GNNdelimited-[]ℝ\\mathrm{GNN}[\\mathbb{R}] (resp. a constant-iteration GNN​[ℝ]GNNdelimited-[]ℝ\\mathrm{GNN}[\\mathbb{R}]) if there exists a GNN​[ℝ]GNNdelimited-[]ℝ\\mathrm{GNN}[\\mathbb{R}] (resp. a constant-iteration GNN​[ℝ]GNNdelimited-[]ℝ\\mathrm{GNN}[\\mathbb{R}]) that defines 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P}.\nNote that in GNNs, messages flow in the direction opposite to the edges of Kripke models, i.e.,\nan edge (v,u)∈R𝑣𝑢𝑅(v,u)\\in R\nmeans that v𝑣v receives messages sent by u𝑢u.\nThis is only a convention that could be reversed via using a modal logic that scans the inverse relation of R𝑅R instead of R𝑅R; we could also admit both directions, as in . One common, useful and simple possibility for the aggregation and combination functions, also used by Barceló et al. (see [ref]5, and also the papers  ) is defined by where f:ℝd→ℝd:𝑓→superscriptℝ𝑑superscriptℝ𝑑f\\colon\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{d} is a non-linearity function (such as the truncated ReLUReLU\\mathrm{ReLU} also used by Barceló et al. in [ref]5, defined by ReLU∗​(x)=min⁡(max⁡(0,x),1)superscriptReLU𝑥0𝑥1\\mathrm{ReLU}^{*}(x)=\\min(\\max(0,x),1)), and C,A∈ℝd×d𝐶𝐴superscriptℝ𝑑𝑑C,A\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times d} are matrices and 𝐛∈ℝd𝐛superscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbf{b}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}.\nWe refer to GNNGNN\\mathrm{GNN}s that use aggregation and combination functions of this form and ReLU∗superscriptReLU\\mathrm{ReLU}^{*} as the non-linearity function as R-simple aggregate-combine GNNGNN\\mathrm{GNN}s (here ‘R’ stands\nfor ReLU∗superscriptReLU\\mathrm{ReLU}^{*}). Reachability of a proposition symbol p𝑝p is a node property 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} containing pointed models (M,w)𝑀𝑤(M,w) s.t. there is a path from w𝑤w to some v𝑣v with p∈V​(v)𝑝𝑉𝑣p\\in V(v).\nAn R-simple aggregate-combine GNN can define 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P}: In round 00, the feature of v𝑣v is set to 111 if p∈V​(v)𝑝𝑉𝑣p\\in V(v) and else to 00. In later rounds, the feature of v𝑣v\nis 111 if v𝑣v’s feature was 111 or it gets 111 from its neighbours; else the feature is set to 00. Notice that unrestricted GNN​[ℝ]GNNdelimited-[]ℝ\\mathrm{GNN}[\\mathbb{R}]s can define, even in a single iteration, node properties such as that the number of immediate out-neighbours\nof a node is a prime number. In fact, for any U⊆ℕ𝑈ℕU\\subseteq\\mathbb{N}, including any undecidable set U𝑈U, a GNN​[ℝ]GNNdelimited-[]ℝ\\mathrm{GNN}[\\mathbb{R}] can define the property that the number l𝑙l of immediate out-neighbours is\nin the set U𝑈U. See  for related undecidability\nresults. Informally, a floating-point system contains a finite set of rational numbers and arithmetic operations ++ and ⋅⋅\\cdot.\nFormally, if p∈ℤ+𝑝subscriptℤp\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{+}, n∈ℕ𝑛ℕn\\in\\mathbb{N} and β∈ℤ+∖{1}𝛽subscriptℤ1\\beta\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{+}\\setminus\\{1\\}, then a floating-point system is a tuple S=((p,n,β),+,⋅)𝑆𝑝𝑛𝛽⋅S=((p,n,\\beta),+,\\cdot) that consists of the set DSsubscript𝐷𝑆D_{S} of all rationals accurately representable in the form 0.d1​⋯​dp×βeformulae-sequence0subscript𝑑1⋯subscript𝑑𝑝superscript𝛽𝑒0.d_{1}\\cdots d_{p}\\times\\beta^{e} or −0.d1​⋯​dp×βeformulae-sequence0subscript𝑑1⋯subscript𝑑𝑝superscript𝛽𝑒-0.d_{1}\\cdots d_{p}\\times\\beta^{e} where di∈[0;β−1]subscript𝑑𝑖0𝛽1d_{i}\\in[0;\\beta-1] and e∈{−n,…,n}𝑒𝑛…𝑛e\\in\\{-n,\\dots,n\\}. It also consists of arithmetic operations ++ and ⋅⋅\\cdot of type DS×DS→DS→subscript𝐷𝑆subscript𝐷𝑆subscript𝐷𝑆D_{S}\\times D_{S}\\to D_{S}. We adopt the common convention where ++ and ⋅⋅\\cdot are defined by first taking a precise sum/product w.r.t. reals and then rounding to the closest float in DSsubscript𝐷𝑆D_{S}, with ties rounding to the float with an even rightmost non-zero digit,\ne.g., 0.312+0.7430.3120.7430.312+0.743 evaluates to 1.061.061.06 if the real sum 1.0551.0551.055 is not in the float system. We typically just write S𝑆S for DSsubscript𝐷𝑆D_{S}. In GNNGNN\\mathrm{GNN}s, sum is a common aggregation function\n(also used in R-simple GNNGNN\\mathrm{GNN}s).\nAs the sum of floats is not associative, counting the sum of a multiset of floats in different orders can give different results.\nIn real-life implementations, the set of nodes W𝑊W of the graph studied can typically be easily associated with an implicit linear order relation <Wsuperscript𝑊<^{W} (which is not part of the actual graph). It is then natural to count features of out-neighbours in the order <Wsuperscript𝑊<^{W}. However, this allows GNNs to distinguish between isomorphic nodes, which violates the desire that GNNs should be invariant under isomorphism.\nFor example, summing 111, −11-1 and 0.010.010.01 in two orders in a system where the numbers must be representable in the form 0.d1​d2×10eformulae-sequence0subscript𝑑1subscript𝑑2superscript10𝑒0.d_{1}d_{2}\\times 10^{e} or −0.d1​d2×10eformulae-sequence0subscript𝑑1subscript𝑑2superscript10𝑒-0.d_{1}d_{2}\\times 10^{e}: first (1+(−1))+0.01=0+0.01=0.01110.0100.010.01(1+(-1))+0.01=0+0.01=0.01 while (1+0.01)+(−1)=1+(−1)=010.011110(1+0.01)+(-1)=1+(-1)=0, since 1.011.011.01 is not representable in the system. A float GNN could distinguish two isomorphic nodes with such ordering of neighbours. To ensure isomorphism invariance for GNNs with floats that use sum,\nit is natural to order the floats instead of the nodes. For example, adding floats in increasing order (of the floats) is a natural and simple choice.\nSumming in this increasing order is also used widely in applications, being a reasonable choice w.r.t. accuracy (see, e.g., [ref]29,, ). Generally, floating point sums in applications have been studied widely, see for example .\nSumming multisets of floats in increasing order leads to a bound in the multiplicities of the elements of the sum; see Proposition 2.3 for the formal statement.\nBefore discussing its proof, we define the k𝑘k-projection of a multiset M𝑀M as M|kM_{|k} where M|k​(x)=min⁡{M​(x),k}M_{|k}(x)=\\min\\{M(x),k\\}.\nGiven a multiset N𝑁N of floats in S𝑆S, we let SUMS​(N)subscriptSUMS𝑁\\mathrm{SUM_{S}}(N) denote the output of the sum f1+⋯+fℓsubscript𝑓1⋯subscript𝑓ℓf_{1}+\\dots+f_{\\ell} where (1) fisubscript𝑓𝑖f_{i} appears N​(fi)𝑁subscript𝑓𝑖N(f_{i}) times (i.e., its multiplicity) in the sum, (2) the floats appear and are summed in increasing order and (3) ++ is according to S𝑆S. For all floating-point systems S𝑆S, there exists a k∈ℕ𝑘ℕk\\in\\mathbb{N} such that for all multisets M𝑀M over floats in S𝑆S, we have SUMS​(M)=SUMS​(M|k)\\mathrm{SUM}_{S}(M)=\\mathrm{SUM}_{S}(M_{|k}). (Sketch) See also in Appendix A.1.\nLet a=0.0​⋯​01×βe𝑎0.0⋯01superscript𝛽𝑒a=0.0\\cdots 01\\times\\beta^{e} and b=0.10​⋯​0×βe+1𝑏0.10⋯0superscript𝛽𝑒1b=0.10\\cdots 0\\times\\beta^{e+1}. Now, notice that given a large enough n>2𝑛2n>2, summing a𝑎a to itself m>n𝑚𝑛m>n times will always give b𝑏b.\n∎ Due to Proposition 2.3, GNNs using the sum in increasing order are bounded in their ability to fully count their out-neighbours.\nThus, it is natural to assume that floating-point GNNs are bounded GNNs, i.e.,\nthe aggregation function can be written in the form ℳk​(Ud)→Ud→subscriptℳ𝑘superscript𝑈𝑑superscript𝑈𝑑\\mathcal{M}_{k}(U^{d})\\to U^{d} for some bound k∈ℕ𝑘ℕk\\in\\mathbb{N}, i.e., for every multiset M∈ℳ​(Ud)𝑀ℳsuperscript𝑈𝑑M\\in\\mathcal{M}(U^{d}), we have AGG​(M)=AGG​(M|k)\\mathrm{AGG}(M)=\\mathrm{AGG}(M_{|k}), where M|kM_{|k} is the k𝑘k-projection of M𝑀M (and Udsuperscript𝑈𝑑U^{d} is the set of states of the GNNGNN\\mathrm{GNN}).\nWe finally give a formal definition for floating-point GNNs: a floating-point graph neural network (GNN​[F]GNNdelimited-[]F\\mathrm{GNN[F]}) is simply a bounded GNN where the set of states and the domains and co-domains of the functions are restricted to some floating-point system S𝑆S (note that S𝑆S can be any floating-point system). A GNN​[F]GNNdelimited-[]F\\mathrm{GNN[F]} obtained by removing the condition on boundedness is called an unrestricted GNN​[F]GNNdelimited-[]F\\mathrm{GNN[F]}. Notice that by default and unless otherwise stated, a GNN​[ℝ]GNNdelimited-[]ℝ\\mathrm{GNN}[\\mathbb{R}]\nis unbounded, whereas a GNN​[F]GNNdelimited-[]F\\mathrm{GNN[F]} is bounded.\nNow, it is immediately clear that unrestricted GNN​[F]GNNdelimited-[]F\\mathrm{GNN[F]}s (with an unrestricted aggregation and combination function) are more expressive than GNN​[F]GNNdelimited-[]F\\mathrm{GNN[F]}s: defining the property that a node has an even number of out-neighbours is easy with unrestricted GNN​[F]GNNdelimited-[]F\\mathrm{GNN[F]}s,\nbut the centers of two star graphs with k𝑘k and k+1𝑘1k+1 neighbours cannot be distinguished by any bounded GNN​[F]GNNdelimited-[]F\\mathrm{GNN[F]} with bound k𝑘k.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: relation of R𝑅R instead of R𝑅R; we could also admit both directions, as in .
