      "content": "Paper Title: \\spacedallcapsPretext Training Algorithms for Event Sequence Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe goal of pre-training is to learn generalizable and transferable representations that can be adapted to diverse downstream tasks, for example by fine-tuning.\nIn language modeling, BERT  revolutionized the research landscape by presenting two pre-training tasks: masked language model and next sentence prediction. These led to powerful models that can excel across various tasks, including question answering, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition.\nSimilarly, GPTs [ref]4 [ref]29 found that simply using next-token prediction as the pre-training objective over a larger scale of data and model capacity can yield significant improvements.\nIn computer vision, supervised ImageNet [ref]33 pre-training had a wide-ranging impact on object detection , segmentation  and cross-modal retrieval . More recently, unsupervised pre-training has been used to learn robust and useful representations from image data without labels .\nIn time series analysis, recent works following approaches similar to the above have made great progress in regular time series     and irregular time series  on diverse tasks, including classification, interpolation, and forecasting. However, pre-training methods are not prevalent for event sequence data.\nCommon across these approaches is the establishment of simple and effective pretext tasks for model pre-training.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: model and next sentence prediction. These led to powerful models that can excel across various tasks, including question answering, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition.\nSimilarly, GPTs [ref]4 [ref]29 found that simply using next-token prediction as the pre-training objective over a larger scale of data and model capacity can yield significant improvements.\nIn computer vision,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
