The emergence of Intelligent Connected Vehicles (ICVs) has led researchers to focus more on CAN. Therein, interconnectivity requires CAN to open additional interfaces to achieve intelligent services, such as autonomous vehicles (AVs), vehicular network communication, and cloud computing  [ref]3 . However, these intelligent services also make the otherwise closed communication in-vehicle networks (IVNs) confront attacks from the inter-extra . Unfortunately, the CAN bus was not designed with any security mechanisms in mind (e.g., authentication and encryption) [ref]6. When communicating via the bus or with external devices via Bluetooth or hardware ports  [ref]8 , the bus or ECUs may be hijacked, which will pose serious repercussions to the lives of drivers and pedestrians 0 1 2. Therefore, vehicular network security is a crucial research area. Although taking purpose-direction to security problems is the most straightforward (e.g., encryption or authentication) 3, more work has proven that such approaches consume a lot of memory and computation 4 5 6. Moreover, such approaches require consideration of backward compatibility concerns 7. In contrast, the in-vehicle intrusion detection systems (IV-IDS) are an efficient protection mechanism used to detect cyber-attacks on automobiles 8, which has two main categories, signature-based and anomaly-based 9 0. Signature-based IDS use supervised learning to capture fixed types of attacks from existing databases. However, the method requires a large amount of marker data, while real-life CAN attack data is not readily available. As anomaly-based IDS can detect unknown malicious network activities, especially zero-day attacks, it is more suitable for the open and complex vehicular network environment 1. Some ADS research has begun to model the inherent correlation of the normal CAN messages, so as to identify a deviation in detecting malicious messages. For instance, Song et al. 2 presented an anomaly method that identifies attack messages through noisy pseudo-normal data. However, this method is supervised and thus requires abnormal datasets in the learning process. In contrast, Talyor et al 3 and Qin et al. are both used for long and short-term memory (LSTM) to learn the temporal correlation of CAN transition bits, in order to search for a deviation between abnormal and normal messages. But they made the model at all bits (usually 64 bits) without considering the actual meaning, resulting in the predicted performance being relatively worse. Meanwhile, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and attention mechanism have been introduced as a state-of-the-art paradigm aimed at capturing comprehensive features 4 5. However, they fail to capture long time-series historical dependencies. Recently, Alkhatib et al. 6 designed a CAN-BERT model that learns the context semantic features of CAN ID sequences. Nam et al. 7 regarded the CAN ID sequence as a sentence with several words and adopted the Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) model to learn the normal pattern of each sequence. Although contextual features are important for ADS, these advanced transformer-based models cannot satisfy IVNs with limited resources due to the large number of parameters. To address the above challenges, we propose a Multi-Knowledge Fusion based self-supervised Anomaly Detection System, called MKF-ADS. The method is self-supervised to detect malicious attacks from deviations learned from normal messages, which follows the paradigm of multivariate time series prediction. The deviation is built on the actual signals and prediction signals. In order to construct a more realistic and meaningful model, the CAN payload is preprocessed using the ”READ” method, thereby determining the signal boundaries and extracting the continuous physical signal. The decision reference of MKF-ADS is from multi-knowledge, consisting of spatial-temporal correlation and contextual information. The fusion mechanism is a guidance and imitation mode from high to low due to the resource limit of IVN. Extensive experiments have shown that the proposed model can reduce the error rate and FAR to 2.62% and 2.41%, respectively. Compared with the baseline as the same paradigm, our method achieves a competitive F1-score of 97.3%. The main contributions of this paper are as follows. We propose MKF-ADS, a self-supervised anomaly prediction model by fusing multi-knowledge for CAN. The framework consists of the STcAM and PatchST modules, used for extracting spatial-temporal correlation knowledge and long time-series historical dependency knowledge. We design a lightweight STcAM module, where the Conv1D component first extracts spatial features, BiLSTM subsequently captures temporal features, and the soft attention mechanism focuses on the important times step. Moreover, the PatchST is introduced to separate multivariate time series and captures context features on all-time steps. We construct a multi-knowledge fusion framework, which regards the StcAM as a student model and the PatchST as a teacher model. STcAM not only learns inherent knowledge but also cross-mimicks valuable features from PathchST, which avoids conflict on different knowledge and improves the training stability. We evaluate the prediction and detection performance of six intrusion scenarios and then generalization performance is verified on different CAN IDs, multi-time steps, and real-attack tasks in ROAD tasks. Also, The feasibility of the model’s complexity and overall efficiency is discussed when applied in the vehicular network. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section  II reviews the research progress and discusses these with our work in depth. In Section  III, the preparatory knowledge about IVNs, attack models, and design intuition is introduced. In Section  IV, we present the MKF-ADS details. In Section  V, we present the experimental results along with a discussion of the performance and efficiency advantages. Section  VI concludes our work.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: CAN.
