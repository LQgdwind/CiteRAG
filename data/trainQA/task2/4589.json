      "content": "Paper Title: ProtoPFormer: Concentrating on Prototypical Parts in Vision Transformers for Interpretable Image Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this subsection, our experimental setups are depicted in detail. When training, we basically follow the training strategies used in official codes¬†‚Ä†‚Ä†https://github.com/facebookresearch/deit of DeiT¬† in PyTorch¬† on four Nvidia Tesla A100 GPUs. All input images are resized to 224√ó224224224224\\times 224 pixels before feeding into used ViT backbones that are initialized with the official pre-trained weights on ImageNet-1k¬†[ref]13. The dimension dùëëd of prototypes is set to 192192192 for all methods, which include global and local prototypes in our ProtoPFormer and prototypes in prototype-based baselines.\nWe use the AdamW¬†8 optimizer with different learning rates using a cosine annealing scheduler¬†7.\nAll the models are trained for 200200200 epochs¬†(555 warm-up epochs with a learning rate 1‚Äãe‚àí41superscriptùëí41e^{-4}) with a batch size of 128128128. After warming up, the learning rates of the add-on layer and prototypes are turned to 3‚Äãe‚àí33superscriptùëí33e^{-3} and 3‚Äãe‚àí33superscriptùëí33e^{-3}, respectively. For the ViT backbones, different learn rates are employed on different datasets, i.e., 1‚Äãe‚àí41superscriptùëí41e^{-4} for CUB, 5‚Äãe‚àí55superscriptùëí55e^{-5} for Dogs and 4‚Äãe‚àí44superscriptùëí44e^{-4} for Cars, respectively. Many data augmentation techniques are adopted in our experiments following the settings in official codes of DeiT, including label smoothing¬†, stochastic depth¬†, Mixup, Cutmix repeated augmentation¬† , Random Erasing¬† and RandAugment¬†. Since the DeiT-style settings have been widely employed in many ViT-backed methods, our proposed ProtoPFormer can benefit and boost the applications of prototype-based methods in ViT-related areas and approaches. For a fair comparison, we retrain all the baselines with adopted three ViTs under the same training settings with ProtoPFormer except for the learning rates. We find that different baselines achieve optimal performance with different learning rates. The grid search strategy is adopted to find the optimal learning rates of each baseline. Please see the following section for specific learning rates.\nThen we report each method‚Äôs performance averaged on six runs with six seeds¬†(1028, 2678, 3566, 4686, 5328, and 6186, separately), given in Table¬†1 in the main paper.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: Tesla A100 GPUs.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
