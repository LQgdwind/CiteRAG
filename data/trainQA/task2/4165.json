      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Network Normal Estimation and Bathymetry Reconstruction from Sidescan Sonar\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA sidescan waterfall image corresponding to one survey line in our dataset usually contains around 2000 pings and 6000 bins per ping for each head (port and starboard), meaning that the raw waterfall image is too large to fit into the GPU memory in a practical manner. We divide each side of the waterfall image into smaller windows containing 64 pings (height H=64𝐻64H=64) and width W=512𝑊512W=512 downsampled from around 6000 bins. The selection of H𝐻H and W𝑊W is chosen to fit the CNN and at the same time ensure the sidescan’s across-track resolution high enough (∼0.1​msimilar-toabsent0.1𝑚\\sim 0.1m) to utilize this sidescan’s advantage. Similar to many monocular depth/normal estimation methods with CNNs, we formulate the task of normal prediction from sidescan intensity as a problem of learning a mapping F:ℐ→𝒩:𝐹→ℐ𝒩F:\\mathcal{I}\\to\\mathcal{N} from the intensity space ℐℐ\\mathcal{I} to the output normal space 𝒩𝒩\\mathcal{N}. Since the 2D normal 𝐍^s,2​d​(𝐩k,i)subscript^𝐍𝑠2𝑑superscript𝐩𝑘𝑖\\mathbf{\\hat{N}}_{s,2d}(\\mathbf{p}^{k,i}) is a unit vector, we only need to estimate one of the two components, in our case the y𝑦y component n^s,y=ns,yns,y2+ns,z2subscript^𝑛𝑠𝑦subscript𝑛𝑠𝑦superscriptsubscript𝑛𝑠𝑦2superscriptsubscript𝑛𝑠𝑧2\\hat{n}_{s,y}=\\frac{n_{s,y}}{\\sqrt{n_{s,y}^{2}+n_{s,z}^{2}}}. Hence\nthe CNN model (Fig. 4) for learning the mapping F𝐹F takes the sidescan intensity window as input and outputs the corresponding n^s,ysubscript^𝑛𝑠𝑦\\hat{n}_{s,y} for every valid pixel (excluding the nadir area and shadows). Shadows are masked out as invalid data since the CNN lacks the ability to model the shadows in the sidescan images. The CNN architecture is based on our prior work [ref]4[ref]5, consisting of two down-sampling layers, followed by seven residual blocks, followed by two up-sampling layers and one convolution in the end. For the normalization layer, we use Instance Normalization (IN), and for the activation functions, we use Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). We observed that there exists an extremely long-tailed distribution in our dataset (see Fig. 5), which is a property of the nature that most of the seabed are relatively flat or only slightly sloping. Note that n^s,ysubscript^𝑛𝑠𝑦\\hat{n}_{s,y}, i.e., the x-axis in Fig. 5, majorly concentrates on values between −0.20.2-0.2 and 0.20.20.2, corresponding to ∼±10∘similar-toabsentplus-or-minussuperscript10\\sim\\pm 10^{\\circ} sloping along the lateral direction in the sonar frame. Regular ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} or ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2} loss functions, which are commonly used in such pixel-wise regression tasks, treat all pixels equally, thus allowing easy samples with smaller absolute values to dominate the training. This will lead the network to tend to perform well only on regions with normal n^s,ysubscript^𝑛𝑠𝑦\\hat{n}_{s,y} with smaller absolute values. However, features such as rocks, boulders, ridges and hills on the seabed with large absolute normal values are of great interest. So this imbalanced problem needs to be addressed properly. Inspired by , we use a normal-aware loss function to guide the network to pay more attention to the regions with normal of large absolute values to reduce the distribution bias during the training process. The normal-aware loss is formulated as: where 𝒩k,isuperscript𝒩𝑘𝑖\\mathcal{N}^{k,i} is the set of normal of all valid points excluding the nadir area, shadows and missing data. n^s,ysubscript^𝑛𝑠𝑦\\hat{n}_{s,y} and n^s,yG​Tsuperscriptsubscript^𝑛𝑠𝑦𝐺𝑇\\hat{n}_{s,y}^{GT} are the predicted normal value and ground truth value respectively. ℓ​(⋅)ℓ⋅\\ell(\\cdot) is a distance metric, ℓ1,ℓ2subscriptℓ1subscriptℓ2\\ell_{1},\\ell_{2}, and so on. In our case we choose to use smooth ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} loss  similar in . αNsubscript𝛼𝑁\\alpha_{N} is the normal-aware attention term that guides the networks to pay more attention to the hard samples, which is positively correlated to the absolute value of the normals. We set αN=|n^s,yG​T|subscript𝛼𝑁superscriptsubscript^𝑛𝑠𝑦𝐺𝑇\\alpha_{N}=\\left|\\hat{n}_{s,y}^{GT}\\right| during the training. λNsubscript𝜆𝑁\\lambda_{N} is a regularization term formulated similar to : which approaches 0 when the network’s prediction is close to the ground truth and approaches 1 when the network’s prediction is not very accurate. Therefore, even for regions with small normal absolute values, when they are not accurately predicted, the gradients can still be back-propagated. As a result, the normal-aware loss can focus more on hard samples while preserving the attention on easy samples.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: the nadir area and shadows).
