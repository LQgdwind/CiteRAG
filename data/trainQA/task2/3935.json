      "content": "Paper Title: A unified framework for dataset shift diagnostics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOnce we have statistics that can quantify the magnitude of different types of dataset shifts, we can use them to formally test the hypotheses described in Section 3.1. In this section, Y𝑌Y can be discrete or continuous, except when obtaining the p𝑝p-values for the hypothesis P𝐗|Y(1)=P𝐗|Y(2)subscriptsuperscript𝑃1conditional𝐗𝑌subscriptsuperscript𝑃2conditional𝐗𝑌P^{(1)}_{\\mathbf{X}|Y}=P^{(2)}_{\\mathbf{X}|Y}, in which we assume it is discrete. This is needed since Algorithm 1, in the appendix, relies on this assumption. If Y𝑌Y is continuous or has few repeated values, the conditional shift of type 1 can be tested by discretizing/binning the label for computing the statistic and applying the algorithm666Binning is not needed when training the classifiers though. – we give more details and references at the end of this section. Consider the datasets 𝒟t​esuperscript𝒟𝑡𝑒\\mathcal{D}^{te} and 𝒟2t​esubscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑡𝑒2\\mathcal{D}^{te}_{2} as defined in Section 3.1, and let T​(𝒟2t​e)𝑇subscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑡𝑒2T(\\mathcal{D}^{te}_{2}) be a test statistic of interest computed using 𝒟2t​esubscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑡𝑒2\\mathcal{D}^{te}_{2}. Namely, T​(𝒟2t​e)𝑇subscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑡𝑒2T(\\mathcal{D}^{te}_{2}) can represent any of the following random quantities, depending on which type of shift we are testing for: KL^Ysubscript^KL𝑌\\widehat{\\textup{KL}}_{Y}, KL^Xsubscript^KL𝑋\\widehat{\\textup{KL}}_{X}, KL^Y|Xsubscript^KLconditional𝑌𝑋\\widehat{\\textup{KL}}_{Y|X}, KL^X|Ysubscript^KLconditional𝑋𝑌\\widehat{\\textup{KL}}_{X|Y}, KL^X,Ysubscript^KL𝑋𝑌\\widehat{\\textup{KL}}_{X,Y}. We test each of the hypotheses of interest by computing a p𝑝p-value of the form where each 𝒟~2t​e(j)subscriptsuperscript~𝒟𝑡superscript𝑒𝑗2\\widetilde{\\mathcal{D}}^{{te}^{(j)}}_{2} is a modified version of\n𝒟2t​esubscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑡𝑒2\\mathcal{D}^{te}_{2}, which can depend on the whole test set 𝒟t​esuperscript𝒟𝑡𝑒\\mathcal{D}^{te}. The modification that is done depends on the hypothesis we are testing: To test the hypotheses related to unconditional distributions (H0,D,H0,Fsubscript𝐻0Dsubscript𝐻0FH_{0,\\text{D}},H_{0,\\text{F}} and H0,Rsubscript𝐻0RH_{0,\\text{R}}), 𝒟~2t​e(j)subscriptsuperscript~𝒟𝑡superscript𝑒𝑗2\\widetilde{\\mathcal{D}}^{{te}^{(j)}}_{2} is obtained randomly permuting Zksubscript𝑍𝑘Z_{k}’s on 𝒟t​esuperscript𝒟𝑡𝑒\\mathcal{D}^{te} and then selecting the samples with Zk=2subscript𝑍𝑘2Z_{k}=2 to form the modified version of 𝒟2t​esubscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑡𝑒2\\mathcal{D}^{te}_{2}. In this case, p𝑝p is the p𝑝p-value associated with a permutation test, a method commonly used to perform two-sample tests . To test H0,C1subscript𝐻0C1H_{0,\\text{C1}}, 𝒟~2t​e(j)subscriptsuperscript~𝒟𝑡superscript𝑒𝑗2\\widetilde{\\mathcal{D}}^{{te}^{(j)}}_{2} is obtained randomly permuting the values of Zksubscript𝑍𝑘Z_{k}’s within each level of Y𝑌Y on 𝒟t​esuperscript𝒟𝑡𝑒\\mathcal{D}^{te} and then selecting the samples with Zk=2subscript𝑍𝑘2Z_{k}=2 to form the modified version of 𝒟2t​esubscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑡𝑒2\\mathcal{D}^{te}_{2}. Thus, we require Y𝑌Y to be discrete to apply this test. In this case, p𝑝p is the p𝑝p-value associated with a conditional independence local permutation test . To test H0,C2subscript𝐻0C2H_{0,\\text{C2}}, we first estimate the conditional distribution of Y|𝐗conditional𝑌𝐗Y|\\mathbf{X} using the whole training set 𝒟t​rsuperscript𝒟𝑡𝑟\\mathcal{D}^{tr} of labeled samples. Let QY|𝐗subscript𝑄conditional𝑌𝐗Q_{Y|\\mathbf{X}} denote such an estimate, which can be obtained using any probabilistic classifier, such as logistic regression, neural networks, CatBoost classifier 3, or conditional density estimators  and GANs  if Y𝑌Y is continuous. We then obtain 𝒟~2t​e(j)subscriptsuperscript~𝒟𝑡superscript𝑒𝑗2\\widetilde{\\mathcal{D}}^{{te}^{(j)}}_{2} by replacing each Yksubscript𝑌𝑘Y_{k} in 𝒟2t​esubscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑡𝑒2\\mathcal{D}^{te}_{2} by a random draw from QY|𝐗=𝐗ksubscript𝑄conditional𝑌𝐗subscript𝐗𝑘Q_{Y|\\mathbf{X}=\\mathbf{X}_{k}}. This test is known as the conditional randomization test (CRT) [ref]5 . Algorithm 1, in the appendix, details the steps to obtain the p𝑝p-values for each case. For all the cases, we assume the procedure involving the training of probabilistic classifiers, described in Section 3.1, has already been executed. That is, we have a test statistic T𝑇T for every test we want to perform. Also, for the case we are testing for conditional shift type 2, we assume the estimated conditional distribution QY|𝐗subscript𝑄conditional𝑌𝐗Q_{Y|\\mathbf{X}} has been computed. We fix a significance level α∈(0,1)𝛼01\\alpha\\in(0,1), and after calculating the p𝑝p-value p𝑝p for a specific null hypothesis of interest, reject that hypothesis if p≤α𝑝𝛼p\\leq\\alpha. Figure 1 summarizes how our framework, DetectShift, works. The following proposition shows that such tests are valid (that is, they control Type I error rate). In other words, false alarms are controlled. The only exception is the test for H0,C2subscript𝐻0C2H_{0,\\text{C2}}, which approximately controls Type I error probabilities as long as QY|𝐗subscript𝑄conditional𝑌𝐗Q_{Y|\\mathbf{X}} is a good approximation of PY|𝐗(2)subscriptsuperscript𝑃2conditional𝑌𝐗P^{(2)}_{Y|\\mathbf{X}}. For the following result, we consider that T𝑇T and QY|𝐗subscript𝑄conditional𝑌𝐗Q_{Y|\\mathbf{X}} are given and fixed, as both are obtained from the training set. Also, we make sure that (T​(𝒟2t​e),T​(𝒟~2t​e(1)),⋯,T​(𝒟~2t​e(B)))𝑇subscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑡𝑒2𝑇subscriptsuperscript~𝒟𝑡superscript𝑒12⋯𝑇subscriptsuperscript~𝒟𝑡superscript𝑒𝐵2(T(\\mathcal{D}^{te}_{2}),T(\\widetilde{\\mathcal{D}}^{{te}^{(1)}}_{2}),\\cdots,T(\\widetilde{\\mathcal{D}}^{{te}^{(B)}}_{2})) has no repeated values by adding small centered Gaussian noises777This step is performed to break ties among data modifications, making it easy to show Type-I error is controlled. to T​(𝒟2t​e)𝑇subscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑡𝑒2T(\\mathcal{D}^{te}_{2}) and T​(𝒟~2t​e(j))𝑇subscriptsuperscript~𝒟𝑡superscript𝑒𝑗2T(\\widetilde{\\mathcal{D}}^{{te}^{(j)}}_{2}), for every j𝑗j. Let p​(𝒟t​e)𝑝superscript𝒟𝑡𝑒p(\\mathcal{D}^{te}) be a p𝑝p-value obtained from Algorithm 1 (appendix) with fixed T𝑇T and QY|𝐗subscript𝑄conditional𝑌𝐗Q_{Y|\\mathbf{X}}. Then, for every α∈(0,1)𝛼01\\alpha\\in(0,1), Under\nH0,D,H0,Fsubscript𝐻0Dsubscript𝐻0FH_{0,\\text{D}},H_{0,\\text{F}},H0,Rsubscript𝐻0RH_{0,\\text{R}}, and H0,C1subscript𝐻0C1H_{0,\\text{C1}} (if Y𝑌Y is discrete), Under\nH0,C2subscript𝐻0C2H_{0,\\text{C2}} where dTVsubscript𝑑TVd_{\\text{TV}} is the total variation distance, P¯𝐗(2):=∏(𝐗k,Yk,Zk)∈𝒟2t​eP𝐗k(2)assignsubscriptsuperscript¯𝑃2𝐗subscriptproductsubscript𝐗𝑘subscript𝑌𝑘subscript𝑍𝑘superscriptsubscript𝒟2𝑡𝑒subscriptsuperscript𝑃2subscript𝐗𝑘\\bar{P}^{(2)}_{\\mathbf{X}}:=\\prod_{(\\mathbf{X}_{k},Y_{k},Z_{k})\\in\\mathcal{D}_{2}^{te}}P^{(2)}_{\\mathbf{X}_{k}}, Q¯Y|𝐗:=∏(𝐗k,Yk,Zk)∈𝒟2t​eQY|𝐗=𝐗kassignsubscript¯𝑄conditional𝑌𝐗subscriptproductsubscript𝐗𝑘subscript𝑌𝑘subscript𝑍𝑘superscriptsubscript𝒟2𝑡𝑒subscript𝑄conditional𝑌𝐗subscript𝐗𝑘\\bar{Q}_{Y|\\mathbf{X}}:=\\prod_{(\\mathbf{X}_{k},Y_{k},Z_{k})\\in\\mathcal{D}_{2}^{te}}Q_{Y|\\mathbf{X}=\\mathbf{X}_{k}}, and P¯Y|𝐗=∏(𝐗k,Yk,Zk)∈𝒟2t​ePY|𝐗=𝐗k(2)subscript¯𝑃conditional𝑌𝐗subscriptproductsubscript𝐗𝑘subscript𝑌𝑘subscript𝑍𝑘superscriptsubscript𝒟2𝑡𝑒subscriptsuperscript𝑃2conditional𝑌𝐗subscript𝐗𝑘\\bar{P}_{Y|\\mathbf{X}}=\\prod_{(\\mathbf{X}_{k},Y_{k},Z_{k})\\in\\mathcal{D}_{2}^{te}}P^{(2)}_{Y|\\mathbf{X}=\\mathbf{X}_{k}}. Here, ∏product\\prod denotes products of probability distributions. Proposition 3 borrows well-studied results from the Statistics literature. The results for H0,Dsubscript𝐻0DH_{0,\\text{D}}, H0,Fsubscript𝐻0FH_{0,\\text{F}}, and H0,Rsubscript𝐻0RH_{0,\\text{R}} are directly obtained by the fact that we use a permutation test , while the result for H0,C1subscript𝐻0C1H_{0,\\text{C1}} is obtained because of properties of local permutation  and the result for H0,C2subscript𝐻0C2H_{0,\\text{C2}} is obtained by adapting the results of Berrett et al.  (Theorem 4) to our context. Suppose Y𝑌Y is continuous or has few repeated values. In that case, if we discretize/bin it to test the conditional shift of type 1, our approach leads to an approximate test for H0,C1subscript𝐻0C1H_{0,\\text{C1}} in the sense it approximately controls the Type I error. See Kim et al.  (Theorems 2 and 3) for more details. To make this work self-contained, we include a proof for Proposition 3 in the appendix.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: by a random draw from QY|𝐗=𝐗ksubscript𝑄conditional𝑌𝐗subscript𝐗𝑘Q_{Y|\\mathbf{X}=\\mathbf{X}_{k}}.
