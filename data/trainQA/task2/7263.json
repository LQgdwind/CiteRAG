      "content": "Paper Title: Tiny Multi-Agent DRL for Twins Migration in UAV Metaverses: A Multi-Leader Multi-Follower Stackelberg Game Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have garnered significant prominence in contemporary times owing to their multifaceted utility in expanding the scope of mobile communications, enhancing surveillance capabilities, and contributing to the development of intelligent urban environments . The expeditious advancement of state-of-the-art technologies, encompassing blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and eXtended Reality (XR), coupled with the ubiquity of mobile devices, portends the emergence of metaverses as a transformative paradigm for the forthcoming generation [ref]2. This evolution is anticipated to facilitate interpersonal engagements and interactions with virtual entities within virtual environments .\nUAV metaverses are considered hybrid immersive realms that combine XR technologies with real-time sensing data collected by UAVs. The metaverses offer customized and intelligent services, such as smart farming and UAV-virtual games, to the users who engage with them, known as UAV Metaverse Users (UMUs).\nUAV Twin (UT) plays a crucial role in UAV metaverses, serving as an essential component that encompasses precise and comprehensive digital replicas of UAVs [ref]4. The UTs are instrumental in ensuring synchronization and real-time updates for UMUs, bridging the gap between physical and virtual spaces . Consequently, users can seamlessly access up-to-date information and immerse themselves in captivating experiences within UAV metaverses. Executing high-fidelity and low-latency rendering tasks for diverse UTs necessitates substantial allocations of communication, computing, and storage resources  [ref]6. UAVs may not efficiently build high-fidelity virtual models, the computationally intensive tasks need to be offloaded to ground base stations, e.g., RoadSide Units (RSUs) equipped with edge servers, that have adequate computing and bandwidth resources . Each RSU can maintain multiple UTs to provide UMUs with multiple metaverse services. Owing to the flexibility and dynamic mobility of UAVs, the distance between the UAVs and the RSUs in which their UTs are currently deployed is likely to become more and more remote.\nMoreover, the constrained communication coverages of RSUs pose a challenge in ensuring the uninterrupted provision of metaverse services by UAVs to UMUs through various UTs . Therefore, it is crucial to achieve the seamless migration of UTs from current RSUs to other RSUs to ensure uninterrupted and immersive service experiences for UMUs.\nHowever, to obtain a reliable and efficient UT migration, it is challenging to select suitable RSUs and optimize the required bandwidth. Specifically, the RSUs are responsible for providing bandwidth resources for UT migration and autonomously determining their bandwidth prices. Subsequently, UAVs select the target RSUs for UT migration and determine the bandwidth demand by considering the pricing strategies established by the RSUs. \n Tiny Machine Learning (TML) is dedicated to crafting and advancing machine learning techniques tailored for execution on embedded systems and Internet of Things (IoT) devices 0. The methods harness approximation and pruning strategies to efficiently diminish the computational load and memory demands inherent in machine learning algorithms 0. To address the above challenges, we propose a tiny learning-based game approach framework based on the pruning techniques for efficient UT migration in UAV metaverses. We formulate a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game model to ensure efficient resource allocation between RSUs and UAVs within UT migration.\nIn Stage I, RSUs acting as the leaders establish the bandwidth selling prices. The prices are determined by considering the expected budgets of UAVs and the pricing strategies of other RSUs.\nDuring Stage II, the follower UAVs assess the required bandwidth and make purchasing decisions from various RSUs based on the pricing strategies established in Stage I. To summarize, this paper introduces the following key contributions:\n We formulate a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game model to capture the interaction between RSUs and UAVs.\nTo better measure the perception of metaverse services from UMUs, we innovatively incorporate a new immersion metric of UMUs into the utility function of UAVs. The immersion metric introduces a psychological factor into the formulation of utility functions, creating a more comprehensive and effective way to quantify the utility of UAVs. By integrating the immersion metric into the utilities of UAVs, our goal is to gain a more detailed understanding of the experience of UMUs in UAV metaverses. It can ultimately improve the adaptability of the utility function of UAV. We propose a Tiny Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (Tiny MADRL) algorithm based on pruning techniques, which is designed to approximate the Stackelberg equilibrium in a more computationally efficient and scalable manner. The tiny MADRL algorithm can efficiently derive the optimal game strategy in practical scenarios for achieving reliable UT migration.\nBy combining DRL with pruning techniques, our proposed algorithm can effectively handle intricate and dynamic environments, thus enhancing the overall performance in resolving the Stackelberg game for UT migration. We employ the Tiny MADRL algorithm to achieve optimal strategies of RSUs that converge faster and closer to the Stackelberg equilibrium than traditional DRL algorithms such as the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm.\nThis highlights the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed scheme. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section II provides a review of the related work. In Section III, we present the proposed framework for UT migration in UAV metaverses, which utilizes a tiny learning-based game approach and incorporates pruning techniques. This section also introduces the multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg model. Section IV outlines the proposed Tiny MADRL algorithm, which aims to achieve the Stackelberg equilibrium and obtain an optimal game solution. The numerical results are presented in Section V. Finally, Section VI concludes this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Artificial Intelligence (AI), and eXtended Reality (XR), coupled with the ubiquity of mobile devices, portends the emergence of metaverses as a transformative paradigm for the forthcoming generation [ref]2.
