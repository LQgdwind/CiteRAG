      "content": "Paper Title: A Fully Adaptive Radau Method for the Efficient Solution of Stiff Ordinary Differential Equations at Low Tolerances\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe test our adaptive Radau method against several methods belonging to the classes listed above and plot work-precision diagrams. The test problems, from Julia’s SciML benchmarks, are listed below: Oregonator, 3 ODEs  . Robertson, 3 ODEs . Hires, 8 ODEs . Pollution, 20 ODEs . In each of the diagrams, the algorithm we implemented is labeled ”AdaptiveRadau”. We run the tests with the possible orders for the method as 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, or 25. The comparison between only our AdaptiveRadau algorithm and the existing implementation of radau in Fortran is shown in the appendix, where results are consistently better by an average of 2-times across all test problems. Furthermore, across all algorithms as a whole, we find that the AdaptiveRadau algorithm we implement achieves state-of-the-art performance on Hires, Oregonator, and Robertson problems. Even when the algorithm does not perform as well, like on the Pollution problem, we still far outperform the existing implementation of Radau. We also consider benchmarks of our algorithm beyond the Float64 domain. In the following, we compare our AdaptiveRadau algorithm against one of the best stiff numerical integrators in Julia, Rodas5P, a newer high-order Rosenbrock method [ref]17. Both solutions are compared with a reference solution computed to tolerances of 10−24superscript102410^{-24}. The problem and solutions are computed with BigFloat precision.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: beyond the Float64 domain. In the following, we compare our AdaptiveRadau algorithm against one of the best stiff numerical integrators in Julia, Rodas5P, a newer high-order Rosenbrock method [ref]17.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
