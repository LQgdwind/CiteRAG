      "content": "Paper Title: Unifying Asynchronous Logics for Hyperproperties\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we recall the classes of automata exploited in  for solving satisfiability of full QPTL with past.\nIn the standard automata-theoretic approach for QPTL formulas φ𝜑\\varphi in prenex form , first, one converts the quantifier-free part ψ𝜓\\psi of φ𝜑\\varphi into an equivalent nondeterministic Büchi automaton (NBA) accepting the set ℒ​(ψ)ℒ𝜓\\mathcal{L}(\\psi) of traces satisfying ψ𝜓\\psi. Then, by using\nthe closure of NBA definable languages under projection and complementation, one obtains an NBA accepting ℒ​(φ)ℒ𝜑\\mathcal{L}(\\varphi).\nThis approach would not work for arbitrary QPTL formulas φ𝜑\\varphi, where quantifiers can occur in the scope of both past and future temporal modalities. In this case, for a subformula φ′superscript𝜑′\\varphi^{\\prime} of φ𝜑\\varphi, we need to keep track of the full set ℒ℘​(φ′)subscriptℒWeierstrass-psuperscript𝜑′\\mathcal{L}_{\\wp}(\\varphi^{\\prime}) of pointed traces satisfying φ𝜑\\varphi, and not simply ℒ​(φ′)ℒsuperscript𝜑′\\mathcal{L}(\\varphi^{\\prime}). Thus, the automata-theoretic approach proposed in \nis based on\na compositional translation of QPTL formulas into a simple two-way extension of NBA, called\nsimple two-way NBA (SNBA, for short) accepting languages of pointed traces.\nMoreover, each step of the translation into SNBA is based on an intermediate formalism consisting in a two-way extension of the class of (one-way) hesitant alternating automata (HAA, for short) over infinite words introduced in [ref]27.\nWe now recall these two classes of automata. Moreover, for the class of two-way HAA, we consider additional requirements which may be fulfilled by some states of the automaton. These extra requirements allow to obtain\na more fine-grained complexity analysis in the translation of two-way HAA into equivalent SNBA, and they are important for obtaining an asymptotically optimal automata-theoretic approach for QPTL in terms of the strong alternation depth of a QPTL formula. SNBA . An SNBA over traces on AP\nis a tuple 𝒜=⟨Q,Q0,δ,F−,F+⟩𝒜𝑄subscript𝑄0𝛿subscript𝐹subscript𝐹\\mathcal{A}=\\langle Q,Q_{0},\\delta,F_{-},F_{+}\\rangle, where Q𝑄Q is a finite set of states, Q0⊆Qsubscript𝑄0𝑄Q_{0}\\subseteq Q is a set of initial states, δ:Q×{→,←}×2AP→2Q:𝛿→𝑄→←superscript2APsuperscript2𝑄\\delta:Q\\times\\{\\rightarrow,\\leftarrow\\}\\times 2^{\\textsf{AP}}\\rightarrow 2^{Q} is a transition function, and F−subscript𝐹F_{-} and F+subscript𝐹F_{+} are sets of accepting states.\nIntuitively, the symbols →→\\rightarrow\nand ←←\\leftarrow are used to denote forward and backward moves.\nA run of 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}\nover a pointed trace (σ,i)𝜎𝑖(\\sigma,i) is a pair r=(r←,r→)𝑟subscript𝑟←subscript𝑟→r=(r_{\\leftarrow},r_{\\rightarrow}) such that r→=qi,qi+1​…subscript𝑟→subscript𝑞𝑖subscript𝑞𝑖1…r_{\\rightarrow}=q_{i},q_{i+1}\\ldots is an infinite sequence of states, r←=qi′,qi−1′​…​q0′​q−1′subscript𝑟←subscriptsuperscript𝑞′𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝑞′𝑖1…subscriptsuperscript𝑞′0subscriptsuperscript𝑞′1r_{\\leftarrow}=q^{\\prime}_{i},q^{\\prime}_{i-1}\\ldots q^{\\prime}_{0}q^{\\prime}_{-1} is a finite sequence of states, and: (i) qi=qi′∈Q0subscript𝑞𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝑞′𝑖subscript𝑄0q_{i}=q^{\\prime}_{i}\\in Q_{0};\n(ii) for each h≥iℎ𝑖h\\geq i, qh+1∈δ​(qh,→,σ​(h))subscript𝑞ℎ1𝛿subscript𝑞ℎ→𝜎ℎq_{h+1}\\in\\delta(q_{h},\\rightarrow,\\sigma(h)); and (iii)\nfor each h∈[0,i]ℎ0𝑖h\\in[0,i], qh−1′∈δ​(qh′,←,σ​(h))subscriptsuperscript𝑞′ℎ1𝛿subscriptsuperscript𝑞′ℎ←𝜎ℎq^{\\prime}_{h-1}\\in\\delta(q^{\\prime}_{h},\\leftarrow,\\sigma(h)). Thus, starting from the initial position i𝑖i in the input pointed trace (σ,i)𝜎𝑖(\\sigma,i), the automaton splits in two copies: the first one moves forwardly along the suffix of σ𝜎\\sigma starting from position i𝑖i and the second one moves backwardly along the prefix σ​(0)​…​σ​(i)𝜎0…𝜎𝑖\\sigma(0)\\ldots\\sigma(i).\nThe run r=(r←,r→)𝑟subscript𝑟←subscript𝑟→r=(r_{\\leftarrow},r_{\\rightarrow}) is accepting if q−1′∈F−subscriptsuperscript𝑞′1subscript𝐹q^{\\prime}_{-1}\\in F_{-} and r→subscript𝑟→r_{\\rightarrow} visits infinitely often some state in F+subscript𝐹F_{+}. A pointed trace (σ,i)𝜎𝑖(\\sigma,i) is accepted by 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} if there is an accepting run of 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} over (σ,i)𝜎𝑖(\\sigma,i). We denote by ℒ℘​(𝒜)subscriptℒWeierstrass-p𝒜\\mathcal{L}_{\\wp}(\\mathcal{A}) the set of pointed traces accepted by 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} and by ℒ​(𝒜)ℒ𝒜\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{A}) the set of traces σ𝜎\\sigma such that (σ,0)∈ℒ℘​(𝒜)𝜎0subscriptℒWeierstrass-p𝒜(\\sigma,0)\\in\\mathcal{L}_{\\wp}(\\mathcal{A}). Two-way HAA .\nNow, we recall the class of two-way HAA.\nFor a set X𝑋X, ℬ+​(X)superscriptℬ𝑋\\mathcal{B}^{+}(X) denotes the set of positive Boolean\nformulas over X𝑋X built from elements in X𝑋X using ∨\\vee and ∧\\wedge (we also allow the formulas true and false).\nFor a formula\nθ∈ℬ+​(X)𝜃superscriptℬ𝑋\\theta\\in\\mathcal{B}^{+}(X), a model Y𝑌Y of θ𝜃\\theta is a subset Y𝑌Y\nof X𝑋X which satisfies θ𝜃\\theta. The model Y𝑌Y of θ𝜃\\theta is minimal\nif no strict subset of Y𝑌Y satisfies θ𝜃\\theta. A two-way HAA 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} over traces on AP\nis a tuple 𝒜=⟨Q,q0,δ,F−,𝖥⟩𝒜𝑄subscript𝑞0𝛿subscript𝐹𝖥\\mathcal{A}=\\langle Q,q_{0},\\delta,F_{-},\\mathsf{F}\\rangle, where Q𝑄Q is a\nfinite set of states, q0∈Qsubscript𝑞0𝑄q_{0}\\in Q is the initial state, δ:Q×2AP→ℬ+​({→,←}×Q):𝛿→𝑄superscript2APsuperscriptℬ→←𝑄\\delta:Q\\times 2^{\\textsf{AP}}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{B}^{+}(\\{\\rightarrow,\\leftarrow\\}\\times Q) is a transition\nfunction, F−⊆Qsubscript𝐹𝑄F_{-}\\subseteq Q is the backward acceptance condition, and 𝖥𝖥\\mathsf{F} is a strata family encoding a particular kind of parity acceptance condition and imposing some syntactical constraints on the transition function δ𝛿\\delta.\nBefore defining 𝖥𝖥\\mathsf{F},\nwe give the notion of run which is independent of 𝖥𝖥\\mathsf{F} and F−subscript𝐹F_{-}. We restrict ourselves to\nmemoryless runs, in which the behavior of the automaton\ndepends only on the current input position and current state. Since\nlater we will deal only with parity acceptance conditions,\nmemoryless runs are sufficient (see e.g. ).\nFormally, given a pointed trace (σ,i)𝜎𝑖(\\sigma,i)\nand a state q′∈Qsuperscript𝑞′𝑄q^{\\prime}\\in Q, an (i,q′)𝑖superscript𝑞′(i,q^{\\prime})-run of 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} over σ𝜎\\sigma is a\ndirected graph ⟨V,E,v0⟩𝑉𝐸subscript𝑣0\\langle V,E,v_{0}\\rangle with set of vertices V⊆(Nature∪{−1})×Q𝑉Nature1𝑄V\\subseteq({\\rm Nature}\\cup\\{-1\\})\\times Q and initial vertex v0=(i,q′)subscript𝑣0𝑖superscript𝑞′v_{0}=(i,q^{\\prime}). Intuitively, a vertex (j,q)𝑗𝑞(j,q) with j≥0𝑗0j\\geq 0 describes a copy of the automaton which is in state q𝑞q and reads the jt​hsuperscript𝑗𝑡ℎj^{th} input position. Additionally, we require that the set of edges E𝐸E is consistent with the transition function δ𝛿\\delta. Formally,\nfor every vertex v=(j,q)∈V𝑣𝑗𝑞𝑉v=(j,q)\\in V such that j≥0𝑗0j\\geq 0, there is a minimal model\n{(dir1,q1),…,(dirn,qn)}subscriptdir1subscript𝑞1…subscriptdir𝑛subscript𝑞𝑛\\{(\\textit{dir}_{1},q_{1}),\\ldots,(\\textit{dir}_{n},q_{n})\\} of δ​(q,σ​(j))𝛿𝑞𝜎𝑗\\delta(q,\\sigma(j)) such that the set of successors of v=(j,q)𝑣𝑗𝑞v=(j,q) is {(j1,q1),…,(jn,qn)}subscript𝑗1subscript𝑞1…subscript𝑗𝑛subscript𝑞𝑛\\{(j_{1},q_{1}),\\ldots,(j_{n},q_{n})\\}, where for all k∈[1,n]𝑘1𝑛k\\in[1,n], jk=j+1subscript𝑗𝑘𝑗1j_{k}=j+1 if dirk=→subscriptdir𝑘→\\textit{dir}_{k}=\\rightarrow, and jk=j−1subscript𝑗𝑘𝑗1j_{k}=j-1 otherwise. An infinite path π𝜋\\pi of a run is eventually strictly-forward whenever π𝜋\\pi has\na suffix of the form (i,q1),(i+1,q2),…𝑖subscript𝑞1𝑖1subscript𝑞2…(i,q_{1}),(i+1,q_{2}),\\ldots for some i≥0𝑖0i\\geq 0. Now, we formally define 𝖥𝖥\\mathsf{F} and give the semantic notion of acceptance.\n𝖥𝖥\\mathsf{F} is a strata family of the\nform\n𝖥={⟨ρ1,Q1,F1⟩,…,⟨ρk,Qk,Fk⟩}𝖥subscript𝜌1subscript𝑄1subscript𝐹1…subscript𝜌𝑘subscript𝑄𝑘subscript𝐹𝑘\\mathsf{F}=\\{\\langle\\rho_{1},Q_{1},F_{1}\\rangle,\\ldots,\\langle\\rho_{k},Q_{k},F_{k}\\rangle\\},\nwhere Q1,…,Qksubscript𝑄1…subscript𝑄𝑘Q_{1},\\ldots,Q_{k} is a partition of the set of states Q𝑄Q of 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}, and for all i∈[1,k]𝑖1𝑘i\\in[1,k],\nρi∈{−,t,B,C}subscript𝜌𝑖tBC\\rho_{i}\\in\\{-,\\texttt{t},\\textsf{B},\\textsf{C}\\} and Fi⊆Qisubscript𝐹𝑖subscript𝑄𝑖F_{i}\\subseteq Q_{i}, such that\nFi=∅subscript𝐹𝑖F_{i}=\\emptyset whenever ρi∈{t,−}subscript𝜌𝑖t\\rho_{i}\\in\\{\\texttt{t},-\\}. A stratum\n⟨ρi,Qi,Fi⟩subscript𝜌𝑖subscript𝑄𝑖subscript𝐹𝑖\\langle\\rho_{i},Q_{i},F_{i}\\rangle is called a negative stratum if ρi=−subscript𝜌𝑖\\rho_{i}=-, a\ntransient stratum if ρi=tsubscript𝜌𝑖t\\rho_{i}=\\texttt{t}, a Büchi stratum\n(with Büchi acceptance condition Fisubscript𝐹𝑖F_{i}) if ρi=Bsubscript𝜌𝑖B\\rho_{i}=\\textsf{B}, and a\ncoBüchi stratum (with coBüchi acceptance condition\nFisubscript𝐹𝑖F_{i}) if ρi=Csubscript𝜌𝑖C\\rho_{i}=\\textsf{C}. Additionally, there is a\npartial order ≤\\leq on the sets Q1,…,Qksubscript𝑄1…subscript𝑄𝑘Q_{1},\\ldots,Q_{k} such that the\nfollowing holds: Partial order requirement. Moves from states in Qisubscript𝑄𝑖Q_{i} lead to states in\ncomponents Qjsubscript𝑄𝑗Q_{j} such that\nQj≤Qisubscript𝑄𝑗subscript𝑄𝑖Q_{j}\\leq Q_{i}; additionally, if Qisubscript𝑄𝑖Q_{i} belongs to a transient stratum, there are no\nmoves from Qisubscript𝑄𝑖Q_{i} leading to Qisubscript𝑄𝑖Q_{i}. Eventually syntactical requirement For all moves (dir,q′)dirsuperscript𝑞′(\\textit{dir},q^{\\prime}) from states q∈Qi𝑞subscript𝑄𝑖q\\in Q_{i} such that q′∈Qisuperscript𝑞′subscript𝑄𝑖q^{\\prime}\\in Q_{i} as well, the following holds:\ndir is ←←\\leftarrow if the\nstratum of Qisubscript𝑄𝑖Q_{i} is negative, and dir is\n→→\\rightarrow otherwise. Each component Qisubscript𝑄𝑖Q_{i} satisfies one of the following two requirements: Existential requirement: for all states qi∈Qisubscript𝑞𝑖subscript𝑄𝑖q_{i}\\in Q_{i} and input symbols a𝑎a, if δ​(q,a)𝛿𝑞𝑎\\delta(q,a) is rewritten in disjunctive normal form, then each conjunction contains at most one occurrence of a state in Qisubscript𝑄𝑖Q_{i}. Universal requirement: for all states qi∈Qisubscript𝑞𝑖subscript𝑄𝑖q_{i}\\in Q_{i} and input symbols a𝑎a, if δ​(q,a)𝛿𝑞𝑎\\delta(q,a) is rewritten in conjunctive normal form, then each disjunction contains at most one occurrence of a state in Qisubscript𝑄𝑖Q_{i}. Components of Büchi strata satisfy the existential requirement, while components of coBüchi strata satisfy the universal requirement. The partial order requirement ensures\nthat every infinite path π𝜋\\pi of a run gets trapped in the component\nQisubscript𝑄𝑖Q_{i} of some stratum. The\neventually syntactical requirement ensures that Qisubscript𝑄𝑖Q_{i}\nbelongs to a Büchi or coBüchi stratum and that π𝜋\\pi is\neventually strictly-forward. Moreover, the existential requirement for a component Qisubscript𝑄𝑖Q_{i} establishes that\nfrom each state q∈Qi𝑞subscript𝑄𝑖q\\in Q_{i}, at most one copy of the automaton is sent to the next input\nsymbol in component Qisubscript𝑄𝑖Q_{i} (all the other copies move to states in strata with order lower than Qisubscript𝑄𝑖Q_{i}). Finally, the\nuniversal requirement corresponds to the dual of the existential requirement.\nNote that transient components trivially satisfy both the existential and the universal requirement.111Is is worth noting that the existential and universal requirements are not considered in . On the other hand, they are crucial in the automata-theoretic approach for QPTL. Now we define when a run is accepting. Let π𝜋\\pi be an infinite path\nof a run, ⟨ρi,Qi,Fi⟩subscript𝜌𝑖subscript𝑄𝑖subscript𝐹𝑖\\langle\\rho_{i},Q_{i},F_{i}\\rangle be\nthe Büchi or coBüchi stratum in which π𝜋\\pi gets trapped, and\nInf​(π)Inf𝜋\\textit{Inf}(\\pi) be the states from Q𝑄Q that occur infinitely many\ntimes in π𝜋\\pi. The path π𝜋\\pi is accepting whenever\nInf​(π)∩Fi≠∅Inf𝜋subscript𝐹𝑖\\textit{Inf}(\\pi)\\cap F_{i}\\neq\\emptyset if ρi=Bsubscript𝜌𝑖B\\rho_{i}=\\textsf{B} and Inf​(π)∩Fi=∅Inf𝜋subscript𝐹𝑖\\textit{Inf}(\\pi)\\cap F_{i}=\\emptyset otherwise (i.e. π𝜋\\pi satisfies the corresponding\nBüchi or coBüchi requirement).\nA run is\naccepting if: (i) all its infinite paths are accepting and (ii) for each\nvertex (−1,q)1𝑞(-1,q) reachable from the initial vertex, it holds that q∈F−𝑞subscript𝐹q\\in F_{-} (recall that F−subscript𝐹F_{-} is the backward acceptance condition of 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}).\nThe\nω𝜔\\omega-pointed language ℒp​(𝒜)subscriptℒ𝑝𝒜\\mathcal{L}_{p}(\\mathcal{A}) of 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} is the set\nof pointed traces (σ,i)𝜎𝑖(\\sigma,i) such that there is an\naccepting (i,q0)𝑖subscript𝑞0(i,q_{0})-run of 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} on σ𝜎\\sigma. The dual automaton 𝒜~~𝒜\\widetilde{\\mathcal{A}} of a two-way HAA 𝒜=⟨Q,q0,δ,F−,𝖥⟩𝒜𝑄subscript𝑞0𝛿subscript𝐹𝖥\\mathcal{A}=\\langle Q,q_{0},\\delta,F_{-},\\mathsf{F}\\rangle is defined\nas 𝒜~=⟨Q,q0,δ~,Q∖F−,𝖥~⟩~𝒜𝑄subscript𝑞0~𝛿𝑄subscript𝐹~𝖥\\widetilde{\\mathcal{A}}=\\langle Q,q_{0},\\widetilde{\\delta},Q\\setminus F_{-},\\widetilde{\\mathsf{F}}\\rangle, where\nδ~​(q,a)~𝛿𝑞𝑎\\widetilde{\\delta}(q,a) is the dual formula of δ​(q,a)𝛿𝑞𝑎\\delta(q,a) (obtained from δ​(q,a)𝛿𝑞𝑎\\delta(q,a) by\nswitching ∨\\vee and ∧\\wedge, and switching true and false),\nand 𝖥~~𝖥\\widetilde{\\mathsf{F}} is obtained from 𝖥𝖥\\mathsf{F} by converting\na Büchi stratum ⟨B,Qi,Fi⟩Bsubscript𝑄𝑖subscript𝐹𝑖\\langle\\textsf{B},Q_{i},F_{i}\\rangle into the coBüchi stratum\n⟨C,Qi,Fi⟩Csubscript𝑄𝑖subscript𝐹𝑖\\langle\\textsf{C},Q_{i},F_{i}\\rangle and a coBüchi stratum ⟨C,Qi,Fi⟩Csubscript𝑄𝑖subscript𝐹𝑖\\langle\\textsf{C},Q_{i},F_{i}\\rangle into\nthe Büchi stratum ⟨B,Qi,Fi⟩Bsubscript𝑄𝑖subscript𝐹𝑖\\langle\\textsf{B},Q_{i},F_{i}\\rangle. By construction the dual automaton 𝒜~~𝒜\\widetilde{\\mathcal{A}} of 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} is\nstill a two-way HAA. Following standard arguments (see\ne.g. ), the following holds. The dual automaton 𝒜~~𝒜\\widetilde{\\mathcal{A}} of a two-way HAA 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} is a two-way HAA accepting the complement of\nℒ℘​(𝒜)subscriptℒWeierstrass-p𝒜\\mathcal{L}_{\\wp}(\\mathcal{A}). Note that SNBA correspond to a subclass of two-way HAA. An SNBA 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} can be converted “on the fly” in linear time into a two-way HAA accepting ℒ℘​(𝒜)subscriptℒWeierstrass-p𝒜\\mathcal{L}_{\\wp}(\\mathcal{A}). Additional requirements on components of two-way HAA. Let 𝒜=⟨Q,q0,δ,F−,𝖥⟩𝒜𝑄subscript𝑞0𝛿subscript𝐹𝖥\\mathcal{A}=\\langle Q,q_{0},\\delta,F_{-},\\mathsf{F}\\rangle be a two-way HAA.\nA component Qisubscript𝑄𝑖Q_{i} of 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} is globally nondeterministic if the following inductively holds: Qisubscript𝑄𝑖Q_{i} satisfies the existential requirement and Qisubscript𝑄𝑖Q_{i} is not a coBüchi component; for each component Qksubscript𝑄𝑘Q_{k} distinct from Qisubscript𝑄𝑖Q_{i} such that there are moves from Qksubscript𝑄𝑘Q_{k} leading to Qisubscript𝑄𝑖Q_{i} (hence, Qk>Qisubscript𝑄𝑘subscript𝑄𝑖Q_{k}>Q_{i}), (i) Qksubscript𝑄𝑘Q_{k} is globally nondeterministic, and (ii) for each q∈Qk𝑞subscript𝑄𝑘q\\in Q_{k} and input symbol a𝑎a, if\nδ​(q,a)𝛿𝑞𝑎\\delta(q,a) is rewritten in disjunctive normal form, then each conjunction contains at most one occurrence of a state in Qisubscript𝑄𝑖Q_{i}. The previous requirement ensures that in each run r𝑟r and for each input position ℓℓ\\ell, there is at most one copy of the automaton that is in some state\nof Qisubscript𝑄𝑖Q_{i} reading position ℓℓ\\ell. A state of 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} is globally nondeterministic if it belongs to some globally nondeterministic component of 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}. From two-way HAA to SNBA . Two-way HAA can be translated in singly exponential time\ninto equivalent SNBA . The translation in  is a generalization of the Miyano-Hayashi\nconstruction  (for converting by an exponential blowup a Büchi alternating automaton into an equivalent\nNBA) and exploits the so called ranking construction  for converting in quadratic time\na coBüchi alternating automaton into an equivalent Büchi alternating automaton. The translation can be easily adapted for handling\nglobally nondeterministic components in two-way HAA. Thus, we obtain the following result. Given a two-way HAA 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}, one can construct “on the fly” and in singly\nexponential time a Büchi SNBA accepting ℒ℘​(𝒜)subscriptℒWeierstrass-p𝒜\\mathcal{L}_{\\wp}(\\mathcal{A}) with\n2O​(n⋅log⁡(n+k))superscript2𝑂⋅𝑛𝑛𝑘2^{O(n\\cdot\\log(n+k))} states, where k𝑘k is the number of states\nin the globally nondeterministic components of 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}, and n𝑛n is the number of remaining states of 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: into SNBA is based on an intermediate formalism consisting in a two-way extension of the class of (one-way) hesitant alternating automata (HAA, for short) over infinite words introduced in [ref]27.\nWe now recall these two classes of automata.
