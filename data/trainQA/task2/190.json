      "content": "Paper Title: Ternary Compression for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe number of Internet of Things (IoTs) and deployed smart mobile devices in factories has dramatically grown over the past decades, generating massive amounts of data stored distributively every moment. Meanwhile, recent achievements in deep learning [ref]1 , such as AlphaGo , rely heavily on the knowledge stored in big data. Naturally, the utilization of the vast amounts of data stored in decentralized client devices will significantly benefit human life and industrial production. However, training deep learning models using distributed data is challenging, and uploading private data to the cloud is controversial, due to limited network bandwidths, limited computational resources and regulations on security and privacy preservation, e.g., the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) . Many research efforts have been devoted to distributed machine learning    , which focuses on model training on multiple machines to alleviate the computational burden caused by large data volumes. These methods have achieved promising performance by splitting big data into smaller sets, partitioning models or sharing updates of the model to accelerate the training process with the help of data parallelism , model parallelism   and parameter server    , among others. Correspondingly, weights optimization strategies for multiple machines have also been proposed. For example, Zhang et al.  introduce asynchronous mini-batch stochastic gradient descent algorithm (ASGD) on multi-GPU devices for deep neural networks (DNNs) training and achieved more than three times speedup on four GPUs than on a single one without loss of precision. Distributed machine learning algorithms for multiple data centers located in different regions have been studied in . However, little attention has been paid to the data security and the impact of data distribution on the performance. To protect data security and privacy while training models on distributed devices, an interesting framework for training a global model while storing the private data locally, known as federated learning   , has been proposed. This approach makes it possible to extract knowledge from data distributed on local devices without uploading private data to a server. Fig. 1 illustrates a simplified workflow and an application scenario in the process industry. Several extensions have been introduced to the standard federated learning system. Zhao et al.  have observed weight divergence caused by extreme data distributions and proposed a method of sharing a small amount of data with other clients to enhance the performance of federated learning algorithms. Wang et al. 0 have proposed an adaptive federated learning system under a given computational budget based on a control algorithm that balances the client update and global aggregation, and analyzed the convergence bound of the distributed gradient descent. Recent comprehensive overviews of federated learning can be found in 1 2, and design ideas, challenges and future research directions of federated learning on massively mobile devices are presented in 0 3 4. Since the importance of privacy protection and data security is gradually increasing, federated learning has received increasing attention in deep learning, although many challenges remain with respect to data distribution and communication costs. Data Distribution: Data generated by different clients, e.g., factories, may be unbalanced and not subject to the independent and identical distribution hypothesis, which is known as unbalanced and non-IID datasets, respectively. Communication Costs: Federated learning is influenced by the rapidly growing depth of model and the amount of multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) 5. This is due to the needed massive communication costs for uploading and downloading, and the average upload and download speeds are asymmetric, e.g., the mean mobile download speed is 26.36 Mbps while the upload speed is 11.05 Mbps in Q3-Q4 2017 in the UK 6. Clearly, high communication costs is one of the main reasons hindering distributed and federated training. Although the research on model compression was originally not meant to reduce the communication costs, it has become a source of inspiration for communication-efficient distributed learning. Neural network pruning is an early method for model compression proposed in 7. Parameter pruning and sharing in 7 8, low-rank factorization 9, transferred/compact convolutional filters 0 and knowledge distillation in 1 2 3 are some main ideas reported in the literature. A multi-objective evolutionary federated learning framework is presented in 4, which aims to simultaneously maximize the learning performance and minimize the model complexity to reduce communication costs. Lu et al. 5 significantly enhance the communication efficiency by uploading significant updates of the local models only. Recently, an layer-wise asynchronous model update approach has been proposed in 6 to reduce the number of the parameters to be transmitted. Gradient quantization has been proposed to accelerate data parallelism distributed learning 7; gradient sparsification 8 and gradient quantization 9 0 1 2 have been developed to reduce the model size; an efficient federated learning algorithm using sparse ternary compression (STC) has been proposed 3, which is robust to non-IID data and communication-efficient on both upstream and downstream communications. However, since STC is a model compression method after local training is completed, the quantization process is not optimized during the training. To the best of our knowledge, most existing federated learning methods emphasize on the application of full-precision models or streamline the models after the training procedure on the clients is completed, rather than simplifying the model during the training. Therefore, deploying federated learning in real-world systems such as the widely used IoT devices in the process industry is somehow difficult. To address this issue, we focus on model compression on clients during the training to reduce the required computational resources at the inference stage and the communication costs of federated learning. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: A ternary quantization approach is introduced into the training and inference of the local models in the clients. The quantized local models are well suited for making inferences in network edge devices. A ternary federated learning protocol is presented to reduce the communication costs between the clients and the server, which reduces both upstream and downstream communication costs. The quantization of the weights of the local models can further enhance privacy preservation since it makes the reverse engineering of the model parameters more difficult. Theoretical analyses of the proposed algorithm regarding the convergence and unbiasedness of the quantization, as well as a reduction in weight divergence are provided. The performance of the algorithm is empirically verified using a deep feedforward network (MLP) and a deep residual network (ResNet) on two widely used datasets, namely MNIST 4 and CIFAR10 5. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we briefly review the standard federated learning protocol and several widely used network quantization approaches. Section III proposes a method to quantize the local models on the clients in federated learning systems, called federated trained ternary quantization (FTTQ). On the basis of FTTQ, a ternary federated learning protocol that reduces both upstream and downstream communication costs is presented. In Section IV, theoretical analyses of the proposed algorithm are given. Experimental settings and results are presented in Section V to compare the proposed algorithms with centralized learning, the vanilla federated learning algorithm, and a communication-efficient variant of federated learning. Finally, conclusions are drawn and future directions are suggested in Section VI.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: smart mobile devices in factories has dramatically grown over the past decades, generating massive amounts of data stored distributively every moment.
