      "content": "Paper Title: Combining Classical and Probabilistic Independence Reasoning to Verify the Security of Oblivious Algorithms (Extended Version)\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur program logic naturally extends PSL¬†[ref]4 non-trivially, including support\nfor classical reasoning, dynamic\nrandom choice, improved support for random\nconditionals, random loops, and random assignments. Our mechanisation of PSL\nidentified and fixed a number of soundness issues (see Section¬†4.4). Its unique synergy of classical and probabilistic\nindependence reasoning means our program logic is more\nexpressive not only than PSL but also prior probabilistic Hoare\nlogics, such as¬†, VPHL¬† and Easycrypt‚Äôs\npRHL¬†[ref]3. Probabilistic coupling (supported by pRHL and Easycrypt¬†[ref]3) is another popular way for proving the security of probabilistic algorithms. It does so by proving the output distribution is equal between any pair of different secret inputs, witnessed by a bijection probabilistic coupling for each probabilistic choice. However, for dynamic random choice, the bijection probabilistic coupling may not exist or may even be undefined (e.g. Fig.¬†1 and ). Sometimes, finding the correct coupling can be far more challenging than\nproving the conclusion directly via probabilistic independence. Indeed, the original\ninformal security\nproofs of our case studies     all use probabilistic independence to argue their obliviousness, instead of coupling. Other program logics or type systems for verifying obliviousness also exist.\nFor example, ObliCheck  and ŒªOADTsubscriptùúÜOADT\\lambda_{\\text{OADT}}  can be used to check or prove obliviousness but only for deterministic algorithms.\nŒªùëúùëèùëôùëñùë£subscriptùúÜùëúùëèùëôùëñùë£\\lambda_{\\mathit{obliv}}¬† is a type system\nfor a functional language for\nproving obliviousness\nof probabilistic algorithms but it\nforbids branching on secrets, which is prevalent in many\noblivious algorithms including those we consider in Section¬†5.\nIt also forbids outputting a probabilistic value (and all other values influenced by it) more than once.Our approach\nsuffers no such restriction. Path ORAM has received some verification attention¬† .  reason about this algorithm but in a non-probabilistic model, instead representing it as a nondeterministic transition system, and apply model counting to prove a security property about it. Their property says that for any observable output, there is a sufficient number of inputs to hide which particular input would have produced that output. This specification seems about the best that can be achieved for a nondeterministic model of the algorithm, but would also hold for an implementation that used biased choices (which would necessarily reveal too much of the input). Ours instead says that for each input the output is identically distributed, and would not be satisfied for such a hypothetical implementation. Nonetheless, it would be interesting to compare the strengths and weaknesses of their\ncomplementary approach to ours.  recently proposed to verify this algorithm in Coq, but as far as we are aware ours is the first verification of Path ORAM via a probabilistic program logic. Other recent work extends PSL in different ways. One [ref]18 extended PSL to computational security, but it cannot deal with loops (neither deterministic nor probabilistic) so their target algorithms are very different to ours. Lilac also uses separating conjunction to model probabilistic independence. Crucially, it supports reasoning about conditional probability and conditional independence;  validated the design decisions of Lilac. However, Lilac‚Äôs programming language is functional whereas ours is imperative; Lilac does not support random loops or dynamic random choice, which are essential for our aim. IVL  reasons about probabilistic programs with nondeterminism. In doing so it supports classical reasoning (e.g. for the nondeterministic parts) and probabilistic reasoning for the probabilistic parts. Our logic reasons only about probabilistic programs (with no nondeterminism) but allows using classical reasoning to reason about parts of the probabilistic program, and for the classical and probabilistic reasoning styles to interact and enhance each other.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Our program logic naturally extends PSL¬†[ref]4 non-trivially, including support\nfor classical reasoning, dynamic\nrandom choice, improved support for random\nconditionals, random loops, and random assignments.
