      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamic Adaptive Threshold based Learning for Noisy Annotations Robust Facial Expression Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLearning with noisy labels is an important research problem in DL. Recently, it has been observed that DNNs first fit clean data (data with correct labels), and then, towards later part of the training, memorize examples with noisy annotations  [ref]14. This makes it challenging to train models efficiently on real world datasets in which poor quality annotations are obtained using online queries or crowd sourcing. Based on above, many methods have been proposed which can be categorized as sample selection using small loss [ref]26  [ref]28, label cleansing , weighting , robust loss functions   etc. Please refer to survey  for detail on these methods. This paper adopts the strategy of sample selection, so we briefly review these here. These methods rely on selecting small loss samples with or without co-training  [ref]28    due to the fact that small loss samples are associated with clean labels. Inspired from semi-supervised learning consisting of labelled and unlabelled data, Co-training  principle has been followed in these works. Co-training assumes that each data has two different views and each view is sufficient for learning an effective model. These views can either correspond to different data sources or different representations, and provide complementary information about each sample. Co-training assumes that models trained on two different views have consistent predictions on unlabelled data. Co-training based methods follow the principle of joint training with consensus in JoCoR 9 or mutual training with consensus in NCT  or peer training with cross supervision in Co-teaching  and Co-teaching+ [ref]28. Co-teaching and JoCoR follow the principle of agreement whereas Decoupling and Co-teachng+ depend upon the “Disagreement” strategy to keep the two networks diverged to achieve better ensemble effects. To summarize, recent methods co-train two networks using small loss samples based on agreement or disagreement combined with some kind of regularization. These methods need to know noise rate to drop high loss samples in each mini-batch which may be difficult to estimate in real world setting. Further, threshold chosen based on noise rate to select clean samples is same for all the classes and fixed throughout training which may not be true. Recent works like CCT  and Co-curing  have applied these methods in FER scenario but these use multiple networks for training which leads to computational burden. Further, they use a fixed threshold for all expression classes but inherently FER datasets are imbalanced in sample size as well as intra-class samples have serious imbalance in the difficulty level. This imbalance factor has not been considered for selecting samples of small loss during learning.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: problem in DL.
