      "content": "Paper Title: Torch-Points3D: A Modular Multi-Task Framework for Reproducible Deep Learning on 3D Point Clouds\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs one of the first and easiest to use datasets, S3DIS  has been used as a standard measure of the performance of state-of-the-art methods. However, there is a large discrepancy in how methods are evaluated, which makes it hard to compare their performance.We propose a common evaluation protocol, largely inspired by the one proposed by . Pre-processing: S3DIS is comprised of 666 folds, each containing a collection of point clouds corresponding to single rooms. We aggregate these clouds to obtain one cloud per fold, each corresponding to one entire level of an office building. We sample this cloud with respect to a 444cm grid. Training: In each epoch, we sample 3 00030003\\,000 spheres of radius 222m, centered around random points picked with a probability inversely proportional to the square root of their class frequency. Optimizers: The parameters of the optimizers are given in the configuration file presented in Listing 4. In our experiments, Stochastic gradient Descent (SGD) had slower convergence but higher generalization than momentum-based optimizers such as [ref]21. Inference: 222m-radius spheres are sampled along a 2×2×22222\\times 2\\times 2m grid once. The class probability associated to points present in several spheres are averaged. To compute the final metrics on the original clouds, we perform nearest neighbor interpolation. Metrics: We report the Overall Accuracy (OA) and Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) over classes obtained by cross-validating over the 666-folds. We add an early stopping scheme in which the model is evaluated on the epoch whose model has the highest mIoU on a validation set, obtained by withholding selected rooms from the training set. We also devise a similar protocol for ScanNet 0. The differing steps are as follows: Pre-processing: We subsample with a 555cm grid. Training: Batches are collections of rooms subsampled to 50 0005000050\\,000 points. Metrics: We report the OA and mIoU on the validation set using the model of the last epoch. epochs: 300 # Number of epochs\nbatch_size: 8\noptim:\nbase_lr: 0.01 # Learning rate\ngrad_clip: 100 #gradient clipping\noptimizer:\nclass: SGD # Optimizer\nparams: # SGD parameters\nmomentum: 0.02\nlr: $training.optim.base_lr\nweight_decay: 1e-3\nlr_scheduler:\nclass: ExponentialLR\nparams:\ngamma: 0.9885 # /10 every 200 ep.\nbn_scheduler: # Batch Normalization Scheduler\nbn_policy: \"step_decay\"\nparams:\nbn_momentum: 0.02 In Table 2, we report the performance of four networks (PointNet++ , RS-CNN [ref]29, Minkowski Engine , and KPConv ) on both S3DIS and ScanNet. Each of these algorithms share the exact same learning and inference procedure. This allows us to appreciate their performances all other things being equal. Ze Liu et al.  interestingly demonstrate in their recent investigation that the choice of convolution type (pointnet-like, pointCNN , KPConv, and their own PoolPos) have little impact when evaluated with a shared architecture. We can hence attribute the performance in Table 2 to the difference in architectures, namely the depth and subsampling/upsampling operations. We also remark that Ze Liu et al.’s experiments are particularly easy to replicate with Torch-Points3D on any of the proposed dataset, as most convolution schemes are already implemented.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: given in the configuration file presented in Listing 4.
