      "content": "Paper Title: An Exposition of Pathfinding Strategies Within Lightning Network Clients\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe discussed in the last subsection how, through considering path success probabilities and a suitable independence assumption, weight terms based on Pesubscript𝑃𝑒P_{e}, the probability that the channel e𝑒e is able to successfully route a payment, are suitable design elements within total path costs (1). There are different approaches to estimate this channel-wise success probability Pesubscript𝑃𝑒P_{e}, underlying different assumptions. As a simple, first approach, every untried channel can be assumed to have a constant default success probability . For channels used in routing payments historically, the success probability estimation can be based on the outcomes of historical payment attempts . If historical payment data is collected across many payment attempts, in the event of a failed payment attempt, the channel success probability estimate Pesubscript𝑃𝑒P_{e} can be decreased to 00. The channel success probability estimate Pesubscript𝑃𝑒P_{e} gradually returns to its default value over time. In LND, there are two ways to calculate the channel’s success probability: A​p​r​i​o​r​i𝐴𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑟𝑖Apriori and B​i​m​o​d​a​l𝐵𝑖𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑎𝑙Bimodal. This approach is followed in LND’s A​p​r​i​o​r​i𝐴𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑟𝑖Apriori mode. Another popular model to estimate Pesubscript𝑃𝑒P_{e} is based on modeling the relationship between the intended payment amount and the channel capacity [ref]13. Capacity is the sum of balances across the nodes in the channel. While channel’s capacity is publicly known, the individual balances remain private. A large channel capacity relative to the payment amount intuitively leads to greater probability of success, which is why it can be used within a success probability estimate. Specifically, assuming a uniform distribution for channel liquidity, the failure probability can be expressed as the ratio of payment amount amtesubscriptamt𝑒\\mathrm{amt}_{e} to the channel capacity capesubscriptcap𝑒\\mathrm{cap}_{e}, such that the success probability Pesubscript𝑃𝑒P_{e} can be written as In this modeling, the success probability Pesubscript𝑃𝑒P_{e} decreases as the payment amount approaches the channel’s capacity. This model is used in Eclair. Based on the same assumption, a finer model for Pesubscript𝑃𝑒P_{e} can be obtained if upper and lower bounds UBesubscriptUB𝑒\\mathrm{UB}_{e} and LBesubscriptLB𝑒\\mathrm{LB}_{e} for the available balance (or liquidity) in a channel e𝑒e are available, as mentioned in . This approach to model the channel success probability is inspired by [ref]14. If it is known that the (unknown) liquidity balance x𝑥x satisfies LBe≤x<UBesubscriptLB𝑒𝑥subscriptUB𝑒\\mathrm{LB}_{e}\\leq x<\\mathrm{UB}_{e}, under a uniform probability assumption, it holds that P​(x=b)=1UBe−LBe𝑃𝑥𝑏1subscriptUB𝑒subscriptLB𝑒P(x=b)=\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{UB}_{e}-\\mathrm{LB}_{e}} for any b𝑏b with LBe≤b<UBesubscriptLB𝑒𝑏subscriptUB𝑒\\mathrm{LB}_{e}\\leq b<\\mathrm{UB}_{e}, which implies that we can model the probability that a payment of size amtesubscriptamt𝑒\\mathrm{amt}_{e} through channel e𝑒e fails as P​(x<amte)=∑b=LBeamte−1P​(x=b)=amte−LBeUBe−LBe𝑃𝑥subscriptamt𝑒superscriptsubscript𝑏subscriptLB𝑒subscriptamt𝑒1𝑃𝑥𝑏subscriptamt𝑒subscriptLB𝑒subscriptUB𝑒subscriptLB𝑒P(x<\\mathrm{amt}_{e})=\\sum_{b=\\mathrm{LB}_{e}}^{\\mathrm{amt}_{e}-1}P(x=b)=\\frac{\\mathrm{amt}_{e}-\\mathrm{LB}_{e}}{\\mathrm{UB}_{e}-\\mathrm{LB}_{e}}. Therefore, the success probability can be expressed as CLN and LDK use this approach by assigning default values to the upper and lower bounds of liquidity in a channel based on its capacity. Additionally, in LDK, these bounds are adjusted based on the outcomes of many payment attempts. However, the adjusted bounds gradually revert to their default values over time. While the previous approaches are based on the assumption of uniform liquidity distribution, assuming a bimodal liquidity distribution is more practical, as the channel liquidity is often unbalanced due to unidirectional flows from the strong sources to strong recipients. This results in liquidity being concentrated either on the local or the remote side . Therefore, the success probability estimation can be based on the assumption of a bimodal distribution  for the available channel balance (or channel liquidity) with density function Here, ss\\mathrm{s} is a liquidity broadening scale that describes how quickly the bimodal distribution drops off from the extreme balance states of x=0𝑥0x=0 and x=cape𝑥subscriptcap𝑒x=\\mathrm{cap}_{e}, respectively. A small value of ss\\mathrm{s}, relative to channel capacities, represents a strongly bimodal channel balance distribution. In contrast, a large value of ss\\mathrm{s} indicates that the channel balances are more uniformly distributed. Following this assumption, an unconditional probability estimate for Pesubscript𝑃𝑒P_{e} can be derived without requiring prior knowledge, based solely on the overall channel liquidity distribution. A conditional probability estimate, on the other hand, can be obtained based on historical payment attempts, considering the previous successes and failures for a specific channel across multiple attempts. LND’s B​i​m​o​d​a​l𝐵𝑖𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑎𝑙Bimodal mode follows this approach to calculate the channel success probability, where the knowledge of previous payment attempts’ successes and failures decays over time. We explain the implementation in Section VI-A.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: in LND’s A​p​r​i​o​r​i𝐴𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑟𝑖Apriori mode.
