However, the growing memory complexity and computation cost of GANs conflict with the demands of mobile deployments. It is hard to apply existing compression techniques, owing to the minimax training of GANs is notoriously unstable and prone to collapse. Several methods exploited knowledge distillation for compressing the image translation models. Aguinaldo et al.  first introduced knowledge distillation for unconditional GANs compression. Chen et al. [ref]7 proposed to train an efficient generator by knowledge distillation over the architectures of both the generator and the discriminator. A few works have also attempted to incorporate neural architecture search (NAS)  with GANs. Gong et al. 3 utilized reinforcement learning to search for an efficient generator with a fixed discriminator, limiting the algorithm to discover an optimal generator since the balance between these two players needs to be considered. Shu et al.  later replaced the reinforcement learning by co-evolutionary pruning to accelerate CycleGAN, which relied on the cycle consistency loss. Chu et al. [ref]8 leveraged an elastic search tactic at both micro and macro space to solve a multi-objective problem for SR. Combining multiple different compression techniques, such as weight sharing, channel pruning, knowledge distillation, and quantization, has been significantly outperformed approaches using single compression techniques. Li et al. [ref]26 presented a compression framework for conditional GANs via intermediate feature distillation and automated channel reduction in a “once-for-all” manner. Fu et al. 2 performed computational resources constrained differential neural architecture search via the guidance of knowledge distillation. Wang et al.  combined three compression techniques: model distillation, channel pruning, and quantization, together with the minimax objective, into one unified optimization to form an end-to-end optimization framework. However, most of the above methods are not customized for GAN-based SR. Besides, they have not yet addressed the memory intensive problem. The memory budget should still be met for efficient network structure design. Moreover, the mutual balance of the compressed generator and discriminator needs to be considered, which is crucial for stabilizing the GANs training process. Our work is to solve the above problems.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: methods exploited knowledge distillation for compressing the image translation models.
