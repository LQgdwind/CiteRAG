      "content": "Paper Title: MSGNN: A Spectral Graph Neural Network Based on a Novel Magnetic Signed Laplacian\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we define Hermitian matrices 𝐋U(q)superscriptsubscript𝐋𝑈𝑞\\mathbf{L}_{U}^{(q)} and 𝐋N(q)superscriptsubscript𝐋𝑁𝑞\\mathbf{L}_{N}^{(q)} which we refer to as the unnormalized and normalized magnetic signed Laplacian matrices, respectively.\nWe first define a symmetrized adjacency matrix and an absolute degree matrix by with 𝐃~i,j=0subscript~𝐃𝑖𝑗0\\tilde{\\mathbf{D}}_{i,j}=0 for i≠j𝑖𝑗i\\neq j. Importantly, the use of absolute values ensures that the entries of 𝐃~~𝐃\\tilde{\\mathbf{D}} are non-negative. Furthermore, it ensures that all 𝐃~i,isubscript~𝐃𝑖𝑖\\tilde{\\mathbf{D}}_{i,i} will be strictly positive if the graph is connected. This is in contrast to the construction in  which will give a node degree zero if it has an equal number of positive and negative neighbors (for unweighted networks). To capture directional information, we next define a phase matrix 𝚯(q)superscript𝚯𝑞\\mathbf{\\Theta}^{(q)} by\n𝚯i,j(q)≔2​π​q​(𝐀i,j−𝐀j,i),≔subscriptsuperscript𝚯𝑞𝑖𝑗2𝜋𝑞subscript𝐀𝑖𝑗subscript𝐀𝑗𝑖\\mathbf{\\Theta}^{(q)}_{i,j}\\coloneqq 2\\pi q(\\mathbf{A}_{i,j}-\\mathbf{A}_{j,i}), where q∈ℝ𝑞ℝq\\in\\mathbb{R} is the so-called “charge parameter.\"\nIn our experiments, for simplicity, we set q=0𝑞0q=0 when the task at hand is unrelated to directionality, or when the underlying graph is undirected, and we set q=q0≔1/[2​maxi,j⁡(𝐀i,j−𝐀j,i)]𝑞subscript𝑞0≔1delimited-[]2subscript𝑖𝑗subscript𝐀𝑖𝑗subscript𝐀𝑗𝑖q=q_{0}\\coloneqq 1/[2\\max_{i,j}(\\mathbf{A}_{i,j}-\\mathbf{A}_{j,i})] (so that Θ(q)superscriptΘ𝑞\\Theta^{(q)} has entries ∈[0,π]absent0𝜋\\in[0,\\pi]) for all the other tasks (except in an ablation study on the role of q𝑞q).\nWith ⊙direct-product\\odot denoting elementwise multiplication, and 𝕚𝕚\\mathbbm{i} denoting the imaginary unit, we now construct a complex Hermitian matrix 𝐇(q)superscript𝐇𝑞\\mathbf{H}^{(q)} by where exp⁡(𝕚​𝚯(q))𝕚superscript𝚯𝑞\\exp(\\mathbbm{i}\\mathbf{\\Theta}^{(q)}) is defined elementwise by\nexp(𝕚𝚯(q))i,j≔exp(𝕚𝚯i,j(q))\\exp(\\mathbbm{i}\\mathbf{\\Theta}^{(q)})_{i,j}\\coloneqq\\exp(\\mathbbm{i}\\mathbf{\\Theta}^{(q)}_{i,j}). Note that 𝐇(q)superscript𝐇𝑞\\mathbf{H}^{(q)} is Hermitian, as 𝐀~~𝐀\\tilde{\\mathbf{A}} is symmetric and 𝚯(q)superscript𝚯𝑞\\mathbf{\\Theta}^{(q)} is skew-symmetric.\nIn particular, when q=0𝑞0q=0, we have 𝐇(0)=𝐀~superscript𝐇0~𝐀\\mathbf{H}^{(0)}=\\tilde{\\mathbf{A}}. Therefore, setting q=0𝑞0q=0 is equivalent to making the input graph symmetric and discarding directional information. In general, however, 𝐇(q)superscript𝐇𝑞\\mathbf{H}^{(q)} captures information about a link’s sign, through 𝐀~~𝐀\\tilde{\\mathbf{A}}, and about its direction, through 𝚯(q)superscript𝚯𝑞\\bm{\\Theta}^{(q)}. We observe that flipping the direction of an edge, i.e., replacing a positive or negative link from visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} to vjsubscript𝑣𝑗v_{j} with a link of the same sign from vjsubscript𝑣𝑗v_{j} to visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} corresponds to complex conjugation of 𝐇i,j(q)subscriptsuperscript𝐇𝑞𝑖𝑗\\mathbf{H}^{(q)}_{i,j} (assuming either that there is not already a link from vjsubscript𝑣𝑗v_{j} to visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} or that we also flip the direction of that link if there is one).\nWe also note that if q=0.25,𝑞0.25q=0.25, 𝐀i,j=±1subscript𝐀𝑖𝑗plus-or-minus1\\mathbf{A}_{i,j}=\\pm 1, and 𝐀j,i=0subscript𝐀𝑗𝑖0\\mathbf{A}_{j,i}=0, we have Thus, a unit-weight edge from visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} to vjsubscript𝑣𝑗v_{j} is treated as the opposite of a unit-weight edge from vjsubscript𝑣𝑗v_{j} to visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i}. Given 𝐇(q)superscript𝐇𝑞\\mathbf{H}^{(q)}, we next define the unnormalized magnetic signed Laplacian by and also define the normalized magnetic signed Laplacian by When the graph 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is directed, but not signed, 𝐋U(q)superscriptsubscript𝐋𝑈𝑞\\mathbf{L}_{U}^{(q)} and 𝐋N(q)superscriptsubscript𝐋𝑁𝑞\\mathbf{L}_{N}^{(q)} reduce to the magnetic Laplacians utilized in works such as  [ref]31  and . Similarly, when 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is signed, but not directed, 𝐋U(q)superscriptsubscript𝐋𝑈𝑞\\mathbf{L}_{U}^{(q)} and 𝐋N(q)superscriptsubscript𝐋𝑁𝑞\\mathbf{L}_{N}^{(q)} reduce to the signed Laplacian matrices considered in e.g.,  [ref]18 and . Additionally, when the graph is neither signed nor directed, they reduce to the standard normalized and unnormalized graph Laplacians [ref]35. The following theorems show that 𝐋U(q)superscriptsubscript𝐋𝑈𝑞\\mathbf{L}_{U}^{(q)} and 𝐋N(q)superscriptsubscript𝐋𝑁𝑞\\mathbf{L}_{N}^{(q)} satisfy properties analogous to the traditional graph Laplacians. The proofs are in Appendix A. For any signed directed graph 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} defined in Sec. 3.1, ∀q∈ℝ,for-all𝑞ℝ\\forall q\\in\\mathbb{R}, both the unnormalized magnetic signed Laplacian 𝐋U(q)superscriptsubscript𝐋𝑈𝑞\\mathbf{L}_{U}^{(q)} and its normalized counterpart\n𝐋N(q)superscriptsubscript𝐋𝑁𝑞\\mathbf{L}_{N}^{(q)} are positive semidefinite. For any signed directed graph 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} defined in Sec. 3.1, ∀q∈ℝ,for-all𝑞ℝ\\forall q\\in\\mathbb{R}, the eigenvalues of the normalized magnetic signed Laplacian 𝐋N(q)superscriptsubscript𝐋𝑁𝑞\\mathbf{L}_{N}^{(q)} are contained in the interval   . By construction, 𝐋U(q)superscriptsubscript𝐋𝑈𝑞\\mathbf{L}_{U}^{(q)} and 𝐋N(q)superscriptsubscript𝐋𝑁𝑞\\mathbf{L}_{N}^{(q)} are Hermitian, and Theorem 1 shows they are positive semidefinite.\nIn particular, they are diagonalizable by an orthonormal basis of complex eigenvectors 𝐮1,…,𝐮nsubscript𝐮1…subscript𝐮𝑛\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{n} associated to real, nonnegative eigenvalues λ1≤…≤λn=λmaxsubscript𝜆1…subscript𝜆𝑛subscript𝜆\\lambda_{1}\\leq\\ldots\\leq\\lambda_{n}=\\lambda_{\\max}. Thus,\nsimilar to the traditional normalized Laplacian, we may factor\n𝐋N(q)=𝐔​𝚲​𝐔†superscriptsubscript𝐋𝑁𝑞𝐔𝚲superscript𝐔†\\mathbf{L}_{N}^{(q)}=\\mathbf{U}\\bm{\\Lambda}\\mathbf{U}^{\\dagger},\nwhere 𝐔𝐔\\mathbf{U} is an n×n𝑛𝑛n\\times n matrix whose k𝑘k-th column is 𝐮ksubscript𝐮𝑘\\mathbf{u}_{k}, for 1≤k≤n1𝑘𝑛1\\leq k\\leq n, 𝚲𝚲\\bm{\\Lambda} is a diagonal matrix with 𝚲k,k=λksubscript𝚲𝑘𝑘subscript𝜆𝑘\\bm{\\Lambda}_{k,k}=\\lambda_{k}, and 𝐔†superscript𝐔†\\mathbf{U}^{\\dagger} is the conjugate transpose of 𝐔𝐔\\mathbf{U}. A similar formula holds for 𝐋U(q)subscriptsuperscript𝐋𝑞𝑈\\mathbf{L}^{(q)}_{U}. We conclude this subsection with a comparison to SigMaNet, proposed in the\nconcurrent preprint . SigMaNet also constructs a GNN based on a signed magnetic Laplacian, which is different from the magnetic signed Laplacian proposed here. The claimed advantage of SigMaNet is that it does not require the tuning of a charge parameter q𝑞q and is invariant to, e.g., doubling the weight of every edge. In our work, for the sake of simplicity, we usually set q=0.25𝑞0.25q=0.25, except for when the graph is undirected (in which case we set q=0𝑞0q=0). However, a user may choose to also tune q𝑞q through a standard cross-validation procedure as in . Moreover, one can readily address the latter issue by normalizing the adjacency matrix via a preprocessing step (e.g., ).\nIn contrast to our magnetic signed Laplacian, in the case where the graph is not signed but is weighted and directed, the matrix proposed in  does not reduce to the magnetic Laplacian considered in . For example, denoting the graph adjacency matrix by 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}, consider the case where 0<𝐀j,i<𝐀i,j0subscript𝐀𝑗𝑖subscript𝐀𝑖𝑗0<\\mathbf{A}_{j,i}<\\mathbf{A}_{i,j}. Let m=12​(𝐀i,j+𝐀j,i)𝑚12subscript𝐀𝑖𝑗subscript𝐀𝑗𝑖m=\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{A}_{i,j}+\\mathbf{A}_{j,i}), δ=𝐀i,j−𝐀j,i𝛿subscript𝐀𝑖𝑗subscript𝐀𝑗𝑖\\delta=\\mathbf{A}_{i,j}-\\mathbf{A}_{j,i}, and let 𝕚𝕚\\mathbbm{i} denote the imaginary unit. Then the (i,j)𝑖𝑗(i,j)-th entry of the matrix 𝐋σsuperscript𝐋𝜎\\mathbf{L}^{\\sigma} proposed in  is given by\n𝐋i,jσ=m​𝕚subscriptsuperscript𝐋𝜎𝑖𝑗𝑚𝕚\\mathbf{L}^{\\sigma}_{i,j}=m\\mathbbm{i}, whereas the corresponding entry of the unnormalized magnetic Laplacian is given by\n(𝐋U(q))i,j=m​exp⁡(2​π​𝕚​q​δ).subscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝐋𝑞𝑈𝑖𝑗𝑚2𝜋𝕚𝑞𝛿(\\mathbf{L}^{(q)}_{U})_{i,j}=m\\exp(2\\pi\\mathbbm{i}q\\delta).\nMoreover, while SigMaNet is in principle well-defined on signed and directed graphs, the experiments in  are restricted to tasks where only signed or directional information is important (but not both).\nIn our experiments, we find that our proposed method outperforms SigMaNet on a variety of tasks on signed and/or directed networks. Moreover, we observe that the signed magnetic Laplacian 𝐋σsuperscript𝐋𝜎\\mathbf{L}^{\\sigma} proposed in  has an undesirable property when the graph is unweighted — a node is assigned to have degree zero if it has an equal number of positive and negative connections. Our proposed Laplacian does not suffer from this issue.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: is directed, but not signed, 𝐋U(q)superscriptsubscript𝐋𝑈𝑞\\mathbf{L}_{U}^{(q)} and 𝐋N(q)superscriptsubscript𝐋𝑁𝑞\\mathbf{L}_{N}^{(q)} reduce to the magnetic Laplacians utilized in works such as  [ref]31  and . Similarly, when 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is signed, but not directed, 𝐋U(q)superscriptsubscript𝐋𝑈𝑞\\mathbf{L}_{U}^{(q)} and 𝐋N(q)superscriptsubscript𝐋𝑁𝑞\\mathbf{L}_{N}^{(q)} reduce to the signed\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
