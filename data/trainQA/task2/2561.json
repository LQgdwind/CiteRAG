      "content": "Paper Title: Few-Sample Named Entity Recognition for Security Vulnerability Reports by Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSecurity vulnerabilities pose great challenges to software and network systems.\nFor example, there are numerous reported data breaches of Uber, Equifax, Marriott, and Facebook that jeopardize hundreds of millions of customers’ information security [ref]15;\nvulnerable in-flight automation software used in Boeing 737-MAX are found to be guilty for a series of crashes in 2018 .\nTo allow the tracking and management of security vulnerabilities, people have created public security vulnerability reports and store them in vulnerability databases for reference.\nFor example, the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database is created and maintained by MITRE 111https://www.mitre.org/; the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is another database maintained by the U.S. government.\nThese databases have largely facilitated security companies and vendors to manage and prioritize deployment of patches. To scale up the management of vulnerability entries, existing works have leveraged natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract information from unstructured vulnerability reports.\nFor example, software name, software version, and vulnerability type.\nThe extraction of such information can help accelerate security administration in the following scenarios: First, after converting the unstructured reports into structured entries such as software name and software version, such information can be directly used for detecting the inconsistencies between different records of vulnerability reports.\nFor example, significant inconsistency was detected between reports from the CVE and NVD databases , which may cause system administrators to retrieve outdated or incorrect security alerts, exposing systems under their watch to hazard; inconsistency was also detected between two entries created by the same vendor Samsung in ; Second, the extracted entries can be used in other downstream applications.\nFor example, we can leverage different categories of entries (e.g., vendor name, vulnerability types, attacker name) to construct a knowledge ontology for modeling the interplay between security entries  [ref]2.\nThe extracted entries have also been used for automatically generating a natural language summarization of the original report by leveraging a template . The scalable processing of vulnerability reports into structured forms relies on the support from an effective information extraction (IE) system.\nWith the massive amount of reports, manual extraction of information is intractable and most of the existing systems rely on machine learning approaches.\nFor example, Mulwad et al.  built an SVM-based system which extracted security concepts from web texts.\nIn the recent years, with the rise of deep neural networks, systems based on deep learning were proposed, e.g., by using LSTM   and bi-directional GRU .\nDeep learning has been shown to be effective in this task, e.g., with an F1 score of 98% . Nevertheless, a major challenge of applying existing systems (e.g., recurrent neural network like GRU   and LSTM   ) is that they often require a large number of labeled training samples to perform well;\nthis number could range from a few thousand  to tens of thousand .\nLabeling a NER dataset specific to computer security domain at this scale is both costly and time-consuming.\nThis problem of annotation is further exacerbated by the fact that new security reports are routinely generated.\nTherefore, it is vital to investigate the possibility to alleviate the burden of labeling huge corpus, i.e., few-sample learning. In this paper, for the first time, we investigate the problem of information extraction for public vulnerability reports under the setting where only a small number of labeled training samples are available.\nOur goal is to minimize the number of labeled samples without suffering from a significant performance degradation. In recent years, significant progress has been made for few-shot learning, e.g., image classification [ref]12, text classification , text generation , etc.\nIn these tasks, the training set and validation set often only contain ten or fewer examples, and it has been shown that the available small number of examples are all what the model needs to achieve a good performance .\nTo generalize to unseen examples, few-shot learning approaches often leverage meta-learning [ref]12, metric learning 6  and model pre-training.\nFor example, the GPT-3 model  contains 175 billion parameters and was pre-trained on 45TB of unlabeled text data.\nIt is able to accomplish a variety of generative tasks (e.g., question answering, conversation generation, text to command) when the user only provides a few examples for demonstration.\nFor information extraction, more specifically, named entity recognition (NER), several existing works study its few-shot setting, where only tens of labeled samples are provided during training   .\nHowever, NER systems to date can only achieve a 62% F1 score (evaluated on the CoNLL 2003 dataset 9).\nWhen applied to the security vulnerability reports domain, it is thus unclear whether the performance can be satisfactory enough to security administrators and vendors, as a lower error rate is often required .\nAs a result, in this paper, we investigate the following research questions: Is it possible to match the state-of-the-art performance in NER for security vulnerability reports by using only a small number of labeled examples? What is the minimum number of labeled examples required for this problem? To answer these research questions, we conduct an experimental study on few-sample named entity recognition for vulnerability reports222Here we frame our problem under the term ”few-sample” learning instead of ”few-shot” learning because our approach generally requires tens to a few hundred labeled training samples, which is more than ”few-shot”. We adopt the name ”few-sample” from . , which to the best of our knowledge has not been explored by previous works.\nAs an initial study, we focus on the VIEM dataset , a dataset of vulnerability reports containing 3 types of entities (i.e., software name, software version, outside) and 13 sub-datasets based on the category of vulnerabilities.\nFor the largest sub-dataset, we find that through fine-tuning pre-trained language models, it is possible to match the state-of-the-art performance (i.e., 0.92 to 0.93 F1 score for different entity types ) using only 576 labeled sentences for the training dataset, or 10% of the original training data.\nFor the other 12 categories, the same approach matches the SOTA performance with only 11.2% of the labeled samples.\nOur experiments also show that the simple fine-tuning approach works better than state-of-the-art systems for few-shot NER . The main contributions of this paper are: We propose, for the first time, to study the problem of named entity recognition (NER) for security vulnerability reports; We perform an experimental study by fine-tuning three state-of-the-art language models and evaluating one metric learning-based method for few-sample NER in vulnerability reports, which shows that the fine-tuning approach can achieve the similar performance using only 10% or 11.2% of the original training dataset; We discuss multiple future research opportunities of information extraction for security vulnerability reports; The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 defines the problem and discusses the domain and data-specific challenges;\nSection 3 introduces the methods examined; Section 4 describes the experimental steps, datasets, and experimental results;\nSection 5 analyzes the related work; finally, Section 6 draws the conclusion, analyzes the limitation of this work and discusses several future directions of research for few-sample learning for security vulnerability reports.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: software and network systems.\nFor example, there are numerous reported data breaches of Uber, Equifax, Marriott, and Facebook that jeopardize hundreds of millions of customers’ information security [ref]15;\nvulnerable in-flight automation software used in Boeing 737-MAX are found to be guilty for a series of crashes in 2018 .\nTo allow the tracking and management of security vulnerabilities,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
