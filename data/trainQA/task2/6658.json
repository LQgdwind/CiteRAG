      "content": "Paper Title: Simulation of Turing machines with analytic discrete ODEs: 𝐅𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐌𝐄 and 𝐅𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄 over the reals characterised with discrete ordinary differential equations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecursion schemes constitute a major approach to classical computability theory and, to some extent, to complexity theory. The foundational characterisation of 𝐅𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐌𝐄𝐅𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐌𝐄\\mathbf{FPTIME}, based on bounded primitive recursion on notations, due to Cobham  gave birth to the field of implicit complexity at the interplay of logic and theory of programming. Alternative characterisations, based on safe recursion  or on\nramification ( ) or for other classes 4 followed: see\n4 5 for monographs. Initially motivated to help understand how analogue models of computations compare to classical digital ones, in an orthogonal way, various computability and complexity classes have been recently characterised using Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE).\nAn unexpected side effect of these proofs is the possibility of programming with classical ODEs, over the continuum. It recently led to solving various open problems.\nThis includes the proof of the existence of a universal ODE 0, the proof of the Turing-completeness of chemical reactions 7, or hardness of problems related to dynamical systems 9.\n\nWhile the above results are easy to state, their proofs are mixing considerations about approximations, control of errors, and various constructions to emulate continuously some discrete processes, despite some recent attempts for a kind of programming languages to help intuition . Discrete ODEs, that we consider in this article, are an approach in-between born from the attempt of  [ref]9 to explain some of the constructions for continuous ODEs in an easier way. The basic principle is, for a function 𝐟​(x)𝐟𝑥\\mathbf{f}(x), to consider its discrete derivative defined as Δ​𝐟​(x)=𝐟​(x+1)−𝐟​(x)Δ𝐟𝑥𝐟𝑥1𝐟𝑥\\Delta\\mathbf{f}(x)=\\mathbf{f}(x+1)-\\mathbf{f}(x) (also denoted 𝐟′​(x)superscript𝐟′𝑥\\mathbf{f}^{\\prime}(x) in what follows to help analogy with classical continuous counterparts).\nA consequence of this attempt is the characterisation obtained in  [ref]9.\nThey provided a characterisation of 𝐅𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐌𝐄𝐅𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐌𝐄\\mathbf{FPTIME} for functions over the integers that does not require the specification of an\nexplicit bound in the recursion, in contrast to Cobham’s work , nor the assignment of a specific role or type to variables, in contrast to safe recursion or ramification  . Instead, they only assume involved ODEs to be linear, a very classical natural concept for differential equations.\nA characterisation, like ours, happens to be rather simple\nusing only common notions from the world of ODEs. In particular, considering linear ordinary differential equations is very natural for ODEs. Unfortunately, even if it was the original motivation, both approaches for characterising complexity classes for continuous and discrete ODEs are currently not directly connected. A key difference is that there is no simple expression (no analogue of the Leibniz rule) for the derivative of the composition of functions in discrete settings. The Leibniz rule is a very basic tool for establishing results over the continuum, using various stability properties, but similar statements cannot be established easily over discrete settings. In the context of algebraic classes of functions, the following notation is classical: call operation an operator that takes finitely many functions and returns some new function defined from them. Then [f1,f2,…,fk;op1,op2,…,opℓ]subscript𝑓1subscript𝑓2…subscript𝑓𝑘subscriptop1subscriptop2…subscriptopℓ[f_{1},f_{2},\\dots,f_{k};\\textit{op}_{1},\\textit{op}_{2},\\dots,\\textit{op}_{\\ell}] denotes the smallest set of functions containing f1,f2,…,fksubscript𝑓1subscript𝑓2…subscript𝑓𝑘f_{1},f_{2},\\dots,f_{k} that is closed under the operations op1subscriptop1\\textit{op}_{1}, op2subscriptop2\\textit{op}_{2}, …opℓsubscriptopℓ\\textit{op}_{\\ell}.\nCall discrete function a function of type f:S1×⋯×Sd→S1′×…​Sd′′:𝑓→subscript𝑆1⋯subscript𝑆𝑑subscriptsuperscript𝑆′1…subscriptsuperscript𝑆′superscript𝑑′f:S_{1}\\times\\dots\\times S_{d}\\to S^{\\prime}_{1}\\times\\dots S^{\\prime}_{d^{\\prime}}, where each Si,Si′subscript𝑆𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝑆′𝑖S_{i},S^{\\prime}_{i} is either ℕℕ\\mathbb{N} or \\Z\\Z\\Z.\nWrite 𝐅𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐌𝐄𝐅𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐌𝐄\\mathbf{FPTIME} for the class of functions computable in polynomial time,\nand 𝐅𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐅𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄\\mathbf{FPSPACE} for the class of functions computable in polynomial space. The literature considers two possible definitions for 𝐅𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐅𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄\\mathbf{FPSPACE}, according to whether functions with non-polynomial size values are allowed or not. In our case, we should add “whose outputs remain of polynomial size”, to resolve the ambiguity. The point is that, otherwise, the class is not closed by composition. This may be considered as a basic requirement when talking about the complexity of functions.\nThe issue is about the usage of not counting the output\nas part of the total space used. In this model, given f𝑓f computable in polynomial space, and g𝑔g in logarithmic space, f∘g𝑓𝑔f\\circ g (and g∘f𝑔𝑓g\\circ f) is computable in polynomial space. But this is not true if we assume only f𝑓f and g𝑔g to be computable in polynomial space, since the first might give an output of exponential size. A main result of  [ref]9 is the following (𝕃​𝔻​𝕃𝕃𝔻𝕃\\mathbb{LDL} stands for linear derivation on length): For functions over the reals, we have\n𝕃​𝔻​𝕃=𝐅𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐌𝐄𝕃𝔻𝕃𝐅𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐌𝐄\\mathbb{LDL}=\\mathbf{FPTIME}\nwhere In particular, writing as usual BAsuperscript𝐵𝐴B^{A} for functions from A𝐴A to B𝐵B, we deduce: 𝕃​𝔻​𝕃∩ℕℕ=𝐅𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐌𝐄∩ℕℕ.𝕃𝔻𝕃superscriptℕℕ𝐅𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐌𝐄superscriptℕℕ\\mathbb{LDL}\\cap\\mathbb{N}^{\\mathbb{N}}=\\mathbf{FPTIME}\\cap\\mathbb{N}^{\\mathbb{N}}. That is to say, 𝕃​𝔻​𝕃𝕃𝔻𝕃\\mathbb{LDL} (and hence 𝐅𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐌𝐄𝐅𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐌𝐄\\mathbf{FPTIME} for functions over the integers) is the smallest class of functions\nthat contains the constant functions 𝟎0\\mathbf{0} and 𝟏1\\mathbf{1}, the projections\nπiksuperscriptsubscript𝜋𝑖𝑘\\mathbf{\\pi}_{i}^{k} of the iesuperscript𝑖𝑒i^{e} coordinate of a vector of size k𝑘k, the length function ℓ​(x)ℓ𝑥\\mathrm{\\ell}(x), mapping an integer to the length of its binary representation,\nthe addition x+y𝑥𝑦x\\mathbf{+}y, the subtraction x−y𝑥𝑦x\\mathbf{-}y, the multiplication x×y𝑥𝑦x\\times y,\nthe sign function sg​(x)sg𝑥\\textrm{sg}(x) and that is closed under composition (when defined) and linear length-ODE\nscheme: the linear length-ODE scheme, formally given by Definition 2.4, corresponds to defining a function from a linear ODE with respect to derivation along the length of the argument,\nso of the form Here, we use the notation ∂𝐟​(x,𝐲)∂ℓ𝐟𝑥𝐲ℓ\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{f}(x,\\mathbf{y})}{\\partial\\ell} which corresponds to the derivation of 𝐟𝐟\\mathbf{f} along the length function: given some function ℒ:ℕp+1→\\Z:ℒ→superscriptℕ𝑝1\\Z\\mathcal{L}:\\mathbb{N}^{p+1}\\rightarrow\\Z and in particular for the case where ℒ​(x,𝐲)=ℓ​(x)ℒ𝑥𝐲ℓ𝑥\\mathcal{L}(x,\\mathbf{y})=\\ell(x), is a formal synonym for This concept introduced in  [ref]9, is motivated by the fact that the latter expression is similar to the\nclassical formula for continuous ODEs: and hence is similar to a change of variable. Consequently, a linear length-ODE is a linear ODE over a variable t𝑡t once the change of variable t=ℓ​(x)𝑡ℓ𝑥t=\\ell(x) is done. However, in the context of (classical) ODEs, considering functions over the reals is more natural than only functions over the integers.\nCall real function a function f:S1×⋯×Sd→S1′×…​Sd′′:𝑓→subscript𝑆1⋯subscript𝑆𝑑subscriptsuperscript𝑆′1…subscriptsuperscript𝑆′superscript𝑑′f:S_{1}\\times\\dots\\times S_{d}\\to S^{\\prime}_{1}\\times\\dots S^{\\prime}_{d^{\\prime}}, where each Si,Si′subscript𝑆𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝑆′𝑖S_{i},S^{\\prime}_{i} is either \\R\\R\\R, ℕℕ\\mathbb{N} or \\Z\\Z\\Z.\nA natural question about the characterisation of 𝐅𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐌𝐄𝐅𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐌𝐄\\mathbf{FPTIME} for real functions arises, and not only discrete functions: we consider here computability over the reals in its most classical approach, namely computable analysis . As a first step, the class has been considered in   where the authors get some characterisation of 𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐌𝐄𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐌𝐄\\mathbf{PTIME}, but only for functions from the integers to the reals (i.e. sequences) while it would be more natural to characterise functions from the reals to the reals. More importantly, this was obtained by assuming that some non-analytic exact function is among the basic available functions to simulate a Turing machine: cond¯¯cond\\overline{\\textrm{cond}} valuing 111 for x>34𝑥34x>\\frac{3}{4} and 00 for x<14𝑥14x<\\frac{1}{4}. We prove first this is not needed, and mainly, we extend all previous results to real functions, furthermore covering not only time complexity but also space complexity. Consider where ℓ:ℕ→ℕ:ℓ→ℕℕ\\ell:\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{N} is the length function, mapping some integer to the length of its binary representation, x2:\\R→\\R:𝑥2→\\R\\R\\frac{x}{2}:\\R\\to\\R is the function dividing by 222 (similarly for x3𝑥3\\frac{x}{3}) and all other basic functions defined exactly as for 𝕃​𝔻​𝕃𝕃𝔻𝕃\\mathbb{LDL}, but are considered here as functions from the reals to reals. This class is 𝕃​𝔻​𝕃𝕃𝔻𝕃\\mathbb{LDL} but without the sg​(x)sg𝑥\\textrm{sg}(x) function, nor the multiplication function, or 𝕃​𝔻​𝕃∙𝕃𝔻superscript𝕃∙\\mathbb{LDL}^{\\bullet} but without the cond¯¯cond\\overline{\\textrm{cond}} function, nor the multiplication. This is done by adding the analytic tanh\\tanh functions as a substitute (and adding x/3𝑥3x/3). We can consider ℕ⊂\\Z⊂\\Rℕ\\Z\\R\\mathbb{N}\\subset\\Z\\subset\\R but as functions may have different types of outputs, the composition is an issue. We consider, as this is done in  , that\ncomposition may not be defined in some cases: it is a partial operator. For example, given f:ℕ→\\R:𝑓→ℕ\\Rf:\\mathbb{N}\\to\\R and g:\\R→\\R:𝑔→\\R\\Rg:\\R\\to\\R, the composition of g𝑔g and f𝑓f is defined as expected, but f𝑓f cannot be composed with a function such as h:ℕ→ℕ:ℎ→ℕℕh:\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{N}. First, we improve Theorem 1.1 by stating 𝐅𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐌𝐄𝐅𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐌𝐄\\mathbf{FPTIME} over the integers can be characterised algebraically using linear length ODEs and only analytic functions (i.e. no need for sign function).\nSince 𝕃​𝔻​𝕃∘𝕃𝔻superscript𝕃\\mathbb{LDL}^{\\circ} is about functions over the reals, and Theorem 1.1 is about functions over the integers, we need a way to compare these classes. Given a function 𝐟:\\Rd→\\Rd′:𝐟→superscript\\R𝑑superscript\\Rsuperscript𝑑′\\mathbf{f}:\\R^{d}\\to\\R^{d^{\\prime}} sending every integer 𝐧∈ℕd𝐧superscriptℕ𝑑{\\mathbf{n}}\\in\\mathbb{N}^{d} to the vicinity of some integer of ℕdsuperscriptℕ𝑑\\mathbb{N}^{d}, say at a distance less than 1/4141/4, we write DP⁡(f)DP𝑓\\operatorname{DP}(f) for its discrete part: this is the function from ℕd→ℕd′→superscriptℕ𝑑superscriptℕsuperscript𝑑′\\mathbb{N}^{d}\\to\\mathbb{N}^{d^{\\prime}} mapping 𝐧∈ℕd𝐧superscriptℕ𝑑{\\mathbf{n}}\\in\\mathbb{N}^{d} to the integer rounding of 𝐟​(n)𝐟𝑛\\mathbf{f}(n). Given a class 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} of such functions, we write DP⁡(𝒞)DP𝒞\\operatorname{DP}(\\mathcal{C}) for the class of the discrete parts of the functions of 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}. DP⁡(𝕃​𝔻​𝕃∘)=𝐅𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐌𝐄∩ℕℕ.DP𝕃𝔻superscript𝕃𝐅𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐌𝐄superscriptℕℕ\\operatorname{DP}(\\mathbb{LDL}^{\\circ})=\\mathbf{FPTIME}\\cap\\mathbb{N}^{\\mathbb{N}}. Second, we improve :\nWrite 𝕃​𝔻​𝕃∘¯¯𝕃𝔻superscript𝕃\\overline{\\mathbb{LDL}^{\\circ}} for the class obtained by adding some effective limit operation similar to the one considered in  to get 𝕃​𝔻​𝕃∙¯¯𝕃𝔻superscript𝕃∙\\overline{\\mathbb{LDL}^{\\bullet}}. We get a characterisation of functions over the reals (and not only sequences as in ) computable in polynomial time.

We also prove that, by adding a robust linear ODE scheme (Definition 2.7), we get a class ℝ​𝕃​𝔻∘ℝ𝕃superscript𝔻\\mathbb{RLD}^{\\circ} (this stands for robust linear derivation) with similar statements but for 𝐅𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐅𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄\\mathbf{FPSPACE}.

As far as we know, this is the first time a characterisation of 𝐅𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐅𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄\\mathbf{FPSPACE} with discrete ODEs is provided.\nIf we forget the context of discrete ODEs, 𝐅𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐅𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄\\mathbf{FPSPACE} has been characterised in 9 but using a bounded recursion scheme, i.e. requiring some explicit bound in the spirit of Cobham’s statement . We avoid this issue by considering numerically stable schemes, which are very natural in the context of ODEs. At a technical level, all our results are obtained by proving Turing machines can be suitably simulated with analytic discrete ODEs.\nWe believe our constructions could be applied to many other situations, where programming with ODEs is needed.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: processes, despite some recent attempts for a kind of programming languages to help intuition .
