      "content": "Paper Title: DynamicEmbedding: Extending TensorFlow for Colossal-Scale Applications\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn an attempt to search for a framework that better accommodates model growth, we start from a recent work [ref]47 that treats input/output of a neural network layer as sufficient statistics (embeddings) of certain distribution, and further connect it to the free energy principle  by proposing a new neuron model called DynamicCell.\nIntuitively, it allows a neural network layer to minimize its free energy by both regulating internal state and taking actions.\nIn addition, when the input contains non-digestive energy, it also discharges it through reaction, in order to maintain a stable internal state.\nWe show that this slight modification to the free-energy principle allows us to connect it to traditional gradient descent based approaches. As a result, an input signal to a layer can be processed either continuously, or combinatorially. For example, when a novel input feature (e.g., a new word) is seen from the input, a layer could dynamically allocate an embedding for it and send it to upstream layers for further processing. To implement the above ideas, some major changes to TensorFlow  are needed.\nSpecifically, a new set of operations are added to TensorFlow’s Python API to directly take symbolic strings as input, as well as to “intercept” the forward (upstream) and backward (downstream) signals when running a model.\nThese operations then talk to a new server called DynamicEmbedding Service (DES) to process the content part of a model.\nDuring a forward execution of a model, these operations retrieve the underlying floating point values (embeddings) for their layer input from DES, and pass them to the layer output.\nSimilarly during backward execution, the computed gradients or any other information, are passed into DES for updating internal states based on algorithms customizable by our users. In fact, DES plays a key role in expanding the capacity of TensorFlow, reflected in the following aspects: Virtually unlimited capacity for embedding data: by collaborating with external storage systems such as Bigtable 0 or Spanner 1, it pushes a model’s capacity to the limit of storage 111Among our internal communications with multiple teams inside Google, what most engineers are excited about our system is its flexibility in training a model directly on Bigtable, or any other external storage.. In fact, our system is designed to be modular to work with any storage system that supports key/value data lookup/update. Flexible gradient descent update: DES can keep global information about a layer, such as word frequencies or average gradient changes, to help it decide when to update an embedding. Gradient descent update is no longer a homogeneous process for every variable, and each layer can maintain their own “homeostasis”  by taking proper actions222According to the free-energy principle , homeostasis is a biological system’s resistance to disorder, carried out by an active inference process to minimize surprises. Our systems allows each layer (neuron) to take its own actions to maintain its “homeostasis”..\nMeanwhile it is also guaranteed that our new system is backward compatible with any gradient descent optimizers (e.g., SGD 3, AdaGrad 4, Momentum ). Efficiency: Computational/memory load on DES is automatically distributed into its worker machines in the cloud. Training speed is proportional to the number of Tensorflow workers, and model capacity is decided by the number of DynamicEmbedding workers. Reliability: With DES, a TensorFlow model becomes very small as most data are saved to external storage like Bigtable. Therefore training a large model becomes resilient to machine failures that are due to exceeded resources (memory or CPU). Inherent support for transfer or multitask learning: By taking the embedding data out of TensorFlow, multiple models can share the same layer, simply by using the same operation name and DES configuration. Therefore, model sharing becomes a norm rather than an option333Note that TensorFlow’s TF Hub component can also achieve similar goal.. Our DynamicEmbedding system has been proven to be particularly important in large-scale deep learning systems, and has been robustly running in multiple applications for more than one year.\nIts implementation guarantees that a TensorFlow model with DynamicEmbedding runs at least as fast as without it (assuming sufficient reliability in the remote storage system), with additional benefits like much bigger capacity, less code to write, and much less data pre-processing work.\nThe major overhead for our engineers to switch to DynamicEmbedding is the new APIs to learn and configuration details for external storages like Bigtable or Spanner, which we are trying to simplify as much as possible. In the past two years since our system was launched, we have migrated many popular models, especially those involving sparse features before training, to enjoy the benefit of continual growth from input.\nFor example, with upgraded Google Inception model for image annotation 9, it can learn from labels obtained from the enormous search queries;\nwith upgraded Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) model for translation , it has been applied for translating sentences into ad descriptions, in multiple languages;\nour upgraded Word2Vec model now keeps mapping an ever growing repository of search queries into their embedding space, allowing us to quickly find semantically similar queries to any root query, in any language. By adopting DynamicEmbedding, we find training a single model without much data pre-processing is sufficient to achieve satisfactory performance.\nIn particular, one of our sparse feature models for suggesting keywords from website content (in any languages) achieved highly accurate results compared to other rule-based systems – an evidence that by allowing a system to self-evolve driven by data, it is possible to quickly outperform those that are evolved by human tunings. Fig. 1 illustrates an overview of our extended components added to TensorFlow.\nThe overall goal is to let existing TensorFlow APIs only handle the static (form) part of a model: defining nodes, their connections and passing data between them, and hand the task of trainable variable lookup/update/sample to our DynamicEmbedding Service (DES) to allow them be constructed and grow dynamically.\nBesides, we also need to define a new set of Python APIs that directly take string Tensors as input and output their embeddings, or vice versa 444Previously this needs to be done by first defining floating variables for these string input/output..\nThese TensorFlow APIs directly talk to a component called DynamicEmbedding Master (DEM), which in turn distributes the actual job into DynamicEmbedding Workers (DEWs).\nDEWs are responsible for embedding lookup/update/sample, communicating to external cloud storage such as Bigtable or Spanner, updating embedding values based on various gradient descent algorithms to be backward compatible, etc. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: we first introduce our new neural network model in Sec. 2;\nThe design and implementation details of DynamicEmbedding are discussed next, including its TensorFlow APIs (Sec. 3.1) and various components of DynamicEmbedding Service (Sec. 3.2);\nResults from real-world applications are demonstrated in Sec. 4;\nFinally, we conclude our work in Sec. 5.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: In an attempt to search for a framework that better accommodates model growth, we start from a recent work [ref]47 that treats input/output of a neural network layer as sufficient statistics (embeddings) of certain distribution, and further connect it to the free energy principle  by proposing a new\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
