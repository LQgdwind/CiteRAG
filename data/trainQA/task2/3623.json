Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Delving into the Estimation Shift of Batch Normalization in a Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe validate the effectiveness of XBNBlock on ResNet-101 [ref]9, ResNeXt-50 and ResNeXt-101 [ref]53.\nThe baselines are the original networks trained with BN, and we also train the models with GN.\nThe results are shown in Table 2. We can see that our method consistently improves the baseline (BN) by a significant margin over all architectures. Our method obtains comparable performance to IBN-Net . Note that IBN-Net carefully designs the position of IN in a network and its channel number, while the design of our XBNBlock is simplified. We argue our observation, that a BFN (e.g., IN) can block the accumulation of estimation shift of BN, also provides a reasonable explanation to the success of IBN-Net in its good performance, especially in the scenarios with distribution shift (e.g., domain adaptation and transfer learning tasks. ). Besides the standard training strategy described in Section 5.2.1, we also conduct experiments using more advanced training strategies: 1) cosine learning rate decay with 100 epochs trained [ref]26; 2) label smoothing  with a smoothing factor of 0.1; 3) mixup  training with a mix factor of 0.2. XBNBlock also consistently outperforms the baseline by a significant margin. Table 3 shows the results on ResNet-50 and please see Appendix B for results on ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-50. Note that our method can also use the recently proposed group whitening (GW)  as a BFN. By applying GW in our design, our XBNBlock outperforms the state-of-the-art normalization (whitening) methods. E.g., our method obtains validation accuracy of 79.18%percent79.1879.18\\% on ResNet-101, compared to the baseline (BN) of 77.65%percent77.6577.65\\%, with a gain of 1.53%percent1.531.53\\%. Please see the Appendix B for details.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: We validate the effectiveness of XBNBlock on ResNet-101 [ref]9, ResNeXt-50 and ResNeXt-101 [ref]53.\nThe baselines are the original networks trained with BN, and we also train the models with GN.\nThe results are shown in Table 2.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
