      "content": "Paper Title: Depth-Aware Multi-Grid Deep Homography Estimation with Contextual Correlation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPixel-based solutions iteratively estimate an optimal homography to minimize the alignment error, such as L1 norm, L2 norm, and negative of normalized correlation . But it is challenging to handle scenarios with low overlap rates. Different from pixel-based solutions, feature-based approaches estimate a homography by minimizing the reprojection error based on the sparse feature correspondences. The first step of these approaches is to detect sparse feature points using feature point extractors, such as SIFT, ORB, BRISK, and SOSNet[ref]12. After feature matching, a robust estimation algorithm with outliers rejection will be adopted to solve for the homography from feature correspondences, such as RANSAC, MAGSAC[ref]14, and MAGSAC++[ref]15.\nFeature-based solutions work well in scenes with low overlap rates. Still, their performance heavily depends on the quality of feature correspondences, often failing in low-texture, low-light, or low-resolution scenes. Compared with feature-based approaches, learning-based solutions address the challenge of low-texture scenes for their robust feature extraction capability. DeTone e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et\\ al.  apply deep learning to homography estimation for the first time, developing a VGG-style homography regression network. In their seminal work, the network predicts the 8 motions of the 4 vertices instead of solving the homography directly. By applying Spatial Transformer Network (STN)  to the homography network, Nguyen e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et\\ al.  propose to train the regression network using a pixel-level photometric loss in an unsupervised manner. Zhang e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et\\ al.  and Le e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et\\ al.  propose to reject the foreground and dynamic objects by learning a content-aware attention mask. Chang et al. design a cascaded Lucas-Kanade network to progressively refine the estimated homography in multi-scale deep features. To solve the problem of inefficient feature matching by convolution, Nie e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et\\ al.  connect the feature pyramid and the cost volume to regress the residual homography. Although the cost volume has significantly improved the network’s receptive field, the memory and time consumption have increased significantly. In this paper, the proposed CCL can serve as a better alternative to the cost volume in the deep homography estimation with improved accuracy and reduced computational complexity.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: error based on the sparse feature correspondences.
