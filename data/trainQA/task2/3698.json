      "content": "Paper Title: Q-PPG: Energy-Efficient PPG-based Heart Rate Monitoring on Wearable Devices\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStarting from the architectures generated by the two cascaded NAS tools, we further expand the space of solutions exploring the per-layer arithmetic precision of our TCNs.\nThe quantization technique we use is the same presented in , which was shown to maintain high accuracy even with sub-byte precision, while also being hardware friendly. In fact, differently from other techniques such as weight clustering [ref]45, this method allows to replace all floating point multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations required for inference with integer MACs, resulting in a more efficient execution and enabling the deployment of the resulting models on hardware without a Floating Point Unit (FPU).\nThe method implements a linear quantizer, which transforms\neach floating point tensor 𝐭𝐭\\mathbf{t} (of either weights or activations), with values in the range\n[α𝐭,β𝐭)subscript𝛼𝐭subscript𝛽𝐭[\\alpha_{\\mathbf{t}},\\beta_{\\mathbf{t}}) into a N𝑁N-bit integer tensor 𝐭^^𝐭\\widehat{\\mathbf{t}} as: where ε𝐭=(β𝐭−α𝐭)/(2N−1)subscript𝜀𝐭subscript𝛽𝐭subscript𝛼𝐭superscript2𝑁1\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{t}}=(\\beta_{\\mathbf{t}}-\\alpha_{\\mathbf{t}})/(2^{N}-1) is the smallest value that can be represented in the quantized tensor.\nThe entire inference is then performed using only integer data. Specifically, the accumulation in (1) is performed with int32 data, so that no overflows occur, and the final result is then re-quantized as described in [ref]46.\nBatch normalization layers are also stored and processed with int32 format. Quantization can be applied to a NN either post-training  or by means of quantization-aware training (QAT)  .\nThe first approach works acceptably well for int8 data. For instance, in  we showed that the MAE degradation for HR monitoring when moving from a single-precision floating point format (fp32) to int8 was in the 1.26-1.44 BPM range. However, using QAT leads to the recovery of most of the performance loss for int8 precision, and to a limited error increase also for sub-byte precision. This comes at an acceptable cost in terms of training time, since QAT can be applied to an already trained floating point model, reaching convergence in a few epochs. The basic principle of QAT is that of simulating the effect of quantization (so-called fake quantization) during the forward pass of each training iteration, while maintaining floating point updates during back-propagation. The details of this technique are out of our scope, and readers can refer to  . In Q-PPG, we use EdMIPS ,\na tool that allows to simultaneously i) perform QAT and ii) search for the optimal trade-off among the data format of each layer and the final error of the network.\nFigure 4 illustrates the functionality of EdMIPS, which relies on a gradient-based optimization method very similar to the one used by the two NASes described in Section IV-B. All convolutional and FC layers in the network are replaced by meta-layers, identical in terms of the executed operation, but whose weights are obtained as combinations of fake-quantized tensors with different precision. For instance, (1) is changed to: where: and P𝑃P is the number of different precision formats considered. 𝐖𝐪psubscript𝐖𝐪𝑝\\mathbf{Wq}_{p} is the tensor of fake-quantized weights using the p𝑝p-th precision, and γpsubscript𝛾𝑝\\gamma_{p} is a trainable coefficient associated to it.\nFor instance, if we consider int2, int4, and int8 formats, then 𝐖^=𝐖𝐪int2⋅γint2+𝐖𝐪int4⋅γint4+𝐖𝐪int8⋅γint8^𝐖⋅subscript𝐖𝐪int2subscript𝛾int2⋅subscript𝐖𝐪int4subscript𝛾int4⋅subscript𝐖𝐪int8subscript𝛾int8\\mathbf{\\widehat{W}}=\\mathbf{Wq}_{\\texttt{int2}}\\cdot\\gamma_{\\texttt{int2}}+\\mathbf{Wq}_{\\texttt{int4}}\\cdot\\gamma_{\\texttt{int4}}+\\mathbf{Wq}_{\\texttt{int8}}\\cdot\\gamma_{\\texttt{int8}}. All fake-quantized tensors are obtained from the a single, shared, set of floating point weights 𝐖fp2subscript𝐖fp2\\mathbf{W}_{\\texttt{fp2}}.\nA similar transformation is also applied to the outputs of the layer, in order to search for the optimal quantization format for activations too. Specifically, the output of the meta-layer is obtained combining fake-quantized activations as follows: As in the previous NAS approaches, γ𝛾\\gamma and δ𝛿\\delta coefficients are then trained together with the network weights, adding a secondary loss ℒcostsubscriptℒcost\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{cost}} that takes into account the cost of each data format, e.g., the total number of bits required to store the tensor111The coefficients are passed through a softmax operation, so that they sum to 1, in order not to alter the floating point weights distribution..\nThe training algorithm then assigns a larger coefficient to the fake-quantized tensor that offers the best trade-off between cost and performance. Accordingly, after training, each layer’s weights and activations are assigned the data format corresponding to the largest coefficient.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: same presented in , which was shown to maintain high accuracy even with sub-byte precision, while also being hardware friendly.
