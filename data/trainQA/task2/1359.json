      "content": "Paper Title: Measuring Disentanglement: A Review of Metrics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, learning disentangled representations has attracted considerable attention from the machine learning community [ref]1     [ref]6          [ref]16    0 1 2 3 4 5. A disentangled representation independently captures true underlying factors that explain the data. Such representations offer many advantages: when used on downstream tasks, they improve predictive performance [ref]16 , reduce sample complexity 6 7  [ref]6, offer interpretability 6 [ref]1, improve fairness  and have been identified as a way to overcome shortcut learning 8. Originally, disentanglement was evaluated by visual inspection, but recent research efforts have been devoted to propose metrics for more rigorous evaluations [ref]1     [ref]6       . Frequently, a new metric is proposed alongside a new representation learning method to highlight benefits not captured by existing metrics. Unfortunately, it is often unclear what these metrics quantify, and under which conditions they are appropriate   [ref]16 9 . Fair quantitative evaluation is important to assess research progress by comparing new representation learning methods with the state-of-the-art, but also equally important for practitioners when performing model selection and hyper-parameter tuning . While most metrics correlate on simple data sets, they do not on more complex and realistic data[ref]16. Moreover, this correlation does not mean that they lead to the selection of the same model, as observed in  [ref]16 9. We highlight this problem in our experiments in Section 5.1. Having metrics that lead to different conclusions means that before choosing a model or a hyper-parameter setting, one must chose an appropriate metric for the application. This is not a trivial task because existing metrics measure different properties of disentanglement and make different, often implicit, assumptions of these properties. Moreover, these metrics are sometimes complex procedures themselves subject to hyper-parameter configuration. The goal of this paper is to provide some guidance to practitioners for selecting a metric given an application. Very few papers discuss how to measure disentanglement. In [ref]16, the authors conduct a large-scale study on disentanglement in the unsupervised setting. Their main conclusion is that disentangling predefined factors is impossible without inductive bias, and that random seeds and hyper-parameters have a greater impact on performance than the architecture of the studied models. They also conducted experiments to measure the degree of agreement of the six metrics used in the paper. They found that five of the six metrics correlate on the simple dSprites data set [ref]1, but only mildly on other more realistic data sets. Unfortunately, no interpretations is given onto why one of the metrics sometimes inversely correlates with the others, or why metrics measuring different properties strongly correlate. In , the authors propose a framework for the evaluation of disentangled representations. They identify three desirable properties of a disentangled representation: explicitness, compactness and modularity. They introduce the idea that these properties should be quantified separately, and propose a new metric decomposed in three parts. The key idea of measuring different properties separately is also advocated in [ref]6. The authors point out that one of the three properties, compactness, is of lesser interest in practical scenarios. We will discuss these properties in detail in Section 2. To our knowledge,  is the only study focusing on comparing metrics. The authors organize metrics based on the basic disentanglement properties they measure. Then, they verify that metrics assign a high score to all perfect representations and a low score to all representations that do not satisfy the measured property. Through demonstrations, they expose failure cases for several metrics. This constitutes a significant step towards the theoretical analysis of metrics in extreme cases. In this paper, we propose an in-depth analysis of supervised disentanglement metrics with real-world applications in mind. We establish a clear taxonomy of metric families and underline their strengths and shortcomings. We compare the metrics with respect to many practical considerations such as robustness to noise and hidden factors, nonlinear relationships, accuracy, calibration and computational efficiency. We conduct experiments that abstract the representation learning model and data, which allows us to generate representations for which we can accurately control and isolate the properties under study. Moreover, it also alleviates difficulties related to the identification of ground truth generative factors in data sets. We focus our analysis on supervised metrics (i.e. metrics that require ground truth factors) since there exist very few unsupervised metrics  . To our knowledge, this is the first time that such extensive and fully controlled experiments are conducted, and that metrics are compared in depth. Contributions: We carry out an extensive review of disentanglement metrics, where we expose underlying assumptions, implementation complexity and other practical considerations. We establish a clear taxonomy of metric families and underline their strengths and short-comings. We conduct experiments that eliminate ambiguities introduced by learning algorithms and data sets to directly measure a metric’s performance. We release our code to allow for the use of our metric implementations and the reproduction of our experiments111https://github.com/ubisoft/ubisoft-laforge-DisentanglementMetrics. We provide recommendations for meaningful comparison between representations, as well as guidance for selecting appropriate metrics depending on the application context. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: We start by identifying desirable representation properties that we wish to quantify. In Section 3, we define desirable characteristic for a metric. In Section 4, we survey existing metrics and present our taxonomy. In section 5, we present our experiments and their results. In Section 6, we discuss the implications of our findings and provide insight on how to measure disentanglement. We identify possible extensions to the paper in the conclusion.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: In recent years, learning disentangled representations has attracted considerable attention from the machine learning community [ref]1     [ref]6          [ref]16    0 1 2 3 4 5.
