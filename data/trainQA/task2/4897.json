      "content": "Paper Title: Improving GANs with a Feature Cycling Generator\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDataset In order to show the superiority of the proposed method, we performed extensive experiments with several datasets: CIFAR-10 , CIFAR-100 , FFHQ 3, AFHQ , and subsets of LSUN . More specifically, the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets consist of 60k images with 32×32323232\\times 32 resolution, whereas the FFHQ dataset has 70k images with 1024×1024102410241024\\times 1024 resolution. The AFHQ is a dataset of animal faces consisting of 15,000 high-quality images at 512×512512512512\\times 512 resolution. In our experiments, to train the network on the FFHQ and AFHQ datasets with a single GPU, we resized the resolution of those datasets to 256×256256256256\\times 256. On the other hand, among the various classes in the LSUN dataset, we employed the car and horse images to train the network. Since the LSUN dataset contains numerous images in each class, e.g. the car has 5.5M images, we sub-sampled 200k images in each class. We also resized the LSUN images to 256×256256256256\\times 256 resolution. \n Training Details As aforementioned in Sec. 2.1, by minimizing the Eqs. 1 and 2, G𝐺G could synthesize Pd​a​t​a​(x)subscript𝑃𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎𝑥P_{data}(x) successfully. However, due to various issues such as the gradient vanishing problem, the training procedure with Eqs. 1 and 2 is often failed. To alleviate this problem, many studies have been carried out. Mao et al.  introduced an objective function based on the least square error (LSGAN) and Arjovsky et al.  used Wasserstein distance to build the loss function (WGAN). The current widely-used objective functions are hinge loss    [ref]22  2 5   [ref]25 and non-saturating logistic loss with R1subscript𝑅1R_{1} regularization  4 3 2. In detail, the hinge loss is defined as whereas the non-saturating logistic loss with R1subscript𝑅1R_{1} regularization is formulated as where γ𝛾\\gamma is a hyper-parameter that constrains the gradient magnitude of the discriminator. With reference to the existing papers  [ref]25 3 4, we took the different training strategies according to the image resolution. When training the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, we used hinge loss as an objective function. In addition, we employed the Adam optimizer 5 and set the user parameters of Adam optimizer, i.e. β1subscript𝛽1\\beta_{1} and β2subscript𝛽2\\beta_{2}, to 0 and 0.9, respectively. The learning rate was set to 2e-4, and the discriminator was updated 5 times using different mini-batches when the generator was updated once. We set the batch size of the discriminator as 64 and trained the generator for 50k iterations. In our experiments, the generator was trained with a batch size twice as large as when training the discriminator. That means the generator and discriminator were trained with 128 and 64 batch sizes, respectively. On the other hand, when training the FFHQ, AFHQ, and LSUN datasets, we set StyleGAN2 4 as our baseline model and followed its training strategy since it is the most popular generative model generating a high-resolution image with plausible quality. Specifically, we employed the non-saturating logistic loss in Eqs. 7 and 8 where γ𝛾\\gamma was set to one. In addition, we set the β1subscript𝛽1\\beta_{1} and β2subscript𝛽2\\beta_{2} in the Adam optimizer to 0 and 0.99, respectively. Both batch sizes of the discriminator and generator were set to 32. The networks were trained while the generator tried to generate 10,000k images on the FFHQ and LSUN datasets, and 50,000k images on the AFHQ dataset. We also employed the lazy regularization technique 4 where R1subscript𝑅1R_{1} regularization was performed only once every 16 mini-batches. The more detailed implementation and training skills can be found in 4. \n Network Architecture The goal of this paper is to show the ability of the proposed FCB. Thus, for a fair comparison, we compared the performance between the existing methods and the proposed one in the same environment except for the block module in the generator. Toward this end, we set the baseline model and only replaced the residual block in the baseline model with the FCB. In detail, on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, we decided the model in [ref]22 as our baseline model, whereas StyleGAN2 4 was set to our baseline model for training the FFHQ, AFHQ, and LSUN datasets. The detailed network architectures of each baseline model are described in Tables. 1 and 2. We implemented the SNGAN baseline model using Tensorflow and employed the official Pytorch code when implementing the StyleGAN2 baseline model. All models were trained on a single RTX 3090 GPU.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: function based on the least square error (LSGAN) and Arjovsky et al.  used Wasserstein distance to build the loss function (WGAN).
