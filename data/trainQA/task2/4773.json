      "content": "Paper Title: On the Robustness of Deep Clustering Models: Adversarial Attacks and Defenses\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nClustering models are utilized in many data-driven applications to group similar samples together, and dissimilar samples separately. They constitute a powerful class of unsupervised Machine Learning (ML) models which can be employed in many cases where labels for data samples are either hard (or impossible) to obtain. Note that there are a multitude of different approaches to accomplishing the aforementioned clustering task, and an important differentiation can be made between traditional and deep clustering approaches. Traditional clustering generally aims to minimize a clustering objective function defined using a given distance metric . These include approaches such as k-means , DBSCAN , spectral methods , among others. Such models generally fail to perform satisfactorily on high-dimensional data (i.e., image datasets), or incur huge computational costs that make the problem intractable [ref]5. To improve upon these approaches, initial deep clustering models sought to decompose the high-dimensional data to a cluster-friendly low-dimensional representation using deep neural networks. Clustering was then undertaken on this latent space representation  . Since then, deep clustering models have become considerably advanced, with state-of-the-art models outperforming traditional clustering models by significant margins on a number of real-world datasets [ref]8 [ref]9. Despite these successes, deep clustering models have not been sufficiently analyzed from a robustness perspective. Recently, traditional clustering models have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can reduce clustering performance significantly 0 1111These attacks cannot be used for deep clustering because: 1) they employ computationally intensive optimizers that use exhaustive search and hence, make the attack too expensive for high-dimensional data, 2) they are designed for traditional clustering and are training-time attacks, but, deep clustering models are deployed frozen for inference, requiring a test-time attack.. However, no such adversarial attacks exist for deep clustering methods. Furthermore, no work investigates generalized blackbox attacks, where the adversary has zero knowledge of the deep clustering model being used. This is the most realistic setting under which a malicious adversary could aim to disrupt the working of these models. While there is a multitude of work in this domain for supervised learning models, deep clustering approaches have not received the same attention from the community. The closest work to ours proposes robust deep clustering [ref]9 2, by retraining models with adversarially perturbed inputs to improve clustering performance. However, this line of work has many shortcomings: 1) it lacks fundamental analysis on attacks specific to deep clustering models (for e.g., the state-of-the-art robust deep clustering model RUC [ref]9 only considers images perturbed via FGSM/BIM 3 4 attacks, which are common attack approaches for supervised learning), 2) no clearly defined threat models for the adversary are proposed222For example, for RUC [ref]9, it is implicitly assumed that the adversary has knowledge of the dataset as well as ground truth labels, and will attack using supervised whitebox attacks., and 3) there is no transferability 5 analysis. Thus in this work we seek to bridge this gap by proposing generalized blackbox attacks that operate at the input space under a well-defined adversarial threat model. We also conduct empirical analysis to observe how effectively adversarial samples transfer between different clustering models. We utilize Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) 6 for our attack, inspired by previous approaches (AdvGAN 7, AdvGAN++ 8, etc) for supervised learning. We also utilize a number of defense approaches (essentially deep learning based anomaly detection 9 and state-of-the-art \"robust\" deep clustering models [ref]9) to determine if our adversarial samples can be mitigated by an informed defender. One of the major findings of our work is that these approaches are unable to prevent our adversarial attacks. Through our work, we seek to promote the development of better defenses for adversarial attacks against deep clustering. Finally, to truly showcase how powerful our attacks can be, we attack a production-level ML-as-a-Service (MLaaS) API that performs a clustering task (and possibly utilizes deep clustering models in the backend). We find that our attack can also significantly reduce the functioning of such MLaaS clustering API services. To summarize, we make the following contributions: We propose the first blackbox adversarial attack against deep clustering models. We show that our attacks can significantly reduce the performance of these models while requiring a minimal number of queries. We also undertake a transferability analysis to demonstrate the magnitude of our attack. We undertake a thorough experimental analysis of most state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep clustering models, on a number of real-world datasets, such as CIFAR-10 0, CIFAR-100 1, and STL-10 2 which shows that our attack is applicable across a number of models and datasets. We show that existing (unsupervised) defense approaches (such as anomaly detection and robustness via adversarial retraining) cannot thwart our attack samples, thus prompting the need for better defense approaches for adversarial attacks against deep clustering models. We also attack a production-level MLaaS clustering API to showcase the extent of our attack. We find that our attack is highly successful for this real-world task, underscoring the need for making deep clustering models truly robust. Figure 1 shows some of the adversarial samples generated by our attack for the SPICE [ref]8 and RUC [ref]9 deep clustering models on the STL-10 dataset, and their corresponding pre-attack and post-attack predicted cluster/class labels333Class labels are inferred by taking the majority from the ground truth labels for samples in that cluster.. To the human eye, these samples appear indistinguishable from each other, but the model clusters them incorrectly after the attack. As we will show in later sections, our attack on SPICE for STL-10 results in a 83.9% (67.9% for RUC) decrease in clustering utility measured according to the NMI 3 metric444Similar results for SPICE hold for CIFAR-100 with 78.9% (58.2% for RUC) decrease in NMI, and for CIFAR-10 with 72.9% (68.7% for RUC) decrease in NMI..\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: methods , among others.
