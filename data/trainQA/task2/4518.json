      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Entity Linking Features for Emerging Entities\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we introduce three widely used EL features: prior probability, relatedness score, and entity embedding. The estimation methods and incremental update rules for the corresponding feature parameters are stated as follows. (1) Prior Probability Prior popularity is the probability of the appearance of a candidate entity given an entity mention without considering the context where the mention appears. It has been adopted by most EL methods [ref]2  [ref]13 [ref]7   since it is a simple but strong signal in EL. In many real-world datasets, the accuracy of using prior probability alone can reach more than 80% [ref]7. Specifically, its parameters θ1∈ℝ|E|×|M|subscript𝜃1superscriptℝ𝐸𝑀\\theta_{1}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{|E|\\times|M|} are estimated on Wikipedia article corpus (denoted by Sw​i​k​isubscript𝑆𝑤𝑖𝑘𝑖S_{wiki}) as follows: where count​(e,m;Sw​i​k​i)count𝑒𝑚subscript𝑆𝑤𝑖𝑘𝑖\\mbox{count}(e,m;S_{wiki}) denotes the total times of entity e𝑒e referred by mention m𝑚m in the Wikipedia corpus Sw​i​k​isubscript𝑆𝑤𝑖𝑘𝑖S_{wiki}, eisuperscript𝑒𝑖e^{i} and mjsuperscript𝑚𝑗m^{j} denote the i𝑖i-th entity in E𝐸E and j𝑗j-th mention in M𝑀M (the set of all mentions) respectively, and θ1i,jsubscriptsuperscript𝜃𝑖𝑗1\\theta^{i,j}_{1} denotes the element of θ1subscript𝜃1\\theta_{1} with index (i,j)𝑖𝑗(i,j). For EE e∗superscript𝑒e^{*}, without loss of generality, we assume it is the last entity in E𝐸E (i.e., e∗=e|E|superscript𝑒superscript𝑒𝐸e^{*}=e^{|E|}). Given some labeled candidate documents (they could be either the real labeled data or the mix of the real labeled and pseudo labeled data) for e|E|superscript𝑒𝐸e^{|E|} collected from the Web, we denote them by Sw​e​bsubscript𝑆𝑤𝑒𝑏S_{web} and the parameters associated with e|E|superscript𝑒𝐸e^{|E|} are incrementally updated as follows: Finally, the corresponding feature function is defined as f1​(e,m)=𝐱e⊺​θ1​𝐱msubscript𝑓1𝑒𝑚subscriptsuperscript𝐱⊺𝑒subscript𝜃1subscript𝐱𝑚f_{1}(e,m)=\\mathbf{x}^{\\intercal}_{e}\\theta_{1}\\mathbf{x}_{m}, where 𝐱e∈ℝ|E|subscript𝐱𝑒superscriptℝ𝐸\\mathbf{x}_{e}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{|E|} is one-hot encoding of entity e𝑒e, and 𝐱m∈ℝ|M|subscript𝐱𝑚superscriptℝ𝑀\\mathbf{x}_{m}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{|M|} is one-hot encoding of mention m𝑚m. (2) Relatedness Score Relatedness score is usually used to calculate the topical coherence between candidate entities in EL. Wikipedia Link-based Measure (WLM)  is the most widely utilized relatedness score in existing EL systems [ref]13    . It is defined under the assumption that two entities tend to be related if there are many documents that link to both. Here, we choose WLM as the relatedness score between entities and define it as follows: where D𝐷D denotes the set of all documents in the corpus S𝑆S and D​(e)𝐷𝑒D(e) denotes the set of documents where entity e𝑒e is referred. Therefore, its parameters θ2∈ℝ|E|×|E|subscript𝜃2superscriptℝ𝐸𝐸\\theta_{2}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{|E|\\times|E|} are estimated on Wikipedia as θ2i,j=W​L​M​(ei,ej;Sw​i​k​i)superscriptsubscript𝜃2𝑖𝑗𝑊𝐿𝑀superscript𝑒𝑖superscript𝑒𝑗subscript𝑆𝑤𝑖𝑘𝑖\\theta_{2}^{i,j}=WLM(e^{i},e^{j};S_{wiki}). For the EE e∗=e|E|superscript𝑒superscript𝑒𝐸e^{*}=e^{|E|}, we incrementally update the parameters in the |E|𝐸|E|-th row as θ2|E|,j=W​L​M​(e|E|,ej;Sw​e​b)superscriptsubscript𝜃2𝐸𝑗𝑊𝐿𝑀superscript𝑒𝐸superscript𝑒𝑗subscript𝑆𝑤𝑒𝑏\\theta_{2}^{|E|,j}=WLM(e^{|E|},e^{j};S_{web}) and the parameters in the |E|𝐸|E|-th column as θ2j,|E|=W​L​M​(ej,e|E|;Sw​e​b)superscriptsubscript𝜃2𝑗𝐸𝑊𝐿𝑀superscript𝑒𝑗superscript𝑒𝐸subscript𝑆𝑤𝑒𝑏\\theta_{2}^{j,|E|}=WLM(e^{j},e^{|E|};S_{web}). The feature function is defined as f2​(e,e′)=𝐱e⊺​θ2​𝐱e′subscript𝑓2𝑒superscript𝑒′superscriptsubscript𝐱𝑒⊺subscript𝜃2subscript𝐱superscript𝑒′f_{2}(e,e^{\\prime})=\\mathbf{x}_{e}^{\\intercal}\\theta_{2}\\mathbf{x}_{e^{\\prime}}. (3) Entity Embedding Entity embedding that represents entities in a continuous vector space has been developed rapidly in recent years and leveraged by many deep learning based EL models [ref]2 [ref]7       to calculate the context similarity and the topical coherence between candidate entities. For this feature, the i𝑖i-th column of its parameters θ3∈ℝQ×|E|subscript𝜃3superscriptℝ𝑄𝐸\\theta_{3}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{Q\\times|E|} is set to the entity embedding of eisuperscript𝑒𝑖e^{i}, and the feature function is defined as f3​(e)=θ3​𝐱esubscript𝑓3𝑒subscript𝜃3subscript𝐱𝑒f_{3}(e)=\\theta_{3}\\mathbf{x}_{e}. We estimate entity embeddings according to the method proposed in DeepED [ref]7. Specifically, for an entity, we first collect its co-occurrence words from the Wikipedia corpus Sw​i​k​isubscript𝑆𝑤𝑖𝑘𝑖S_{wiki} and regard them as positive words of that entity. In addition, we randomly sample negative words unrelated to that entity in Sw​i​k​isubscript𝑆𝑤𝑖𝑘𝑖S_{wiki}. Finally, we use a max-margin loss to infer the optimal embedding of the entity with a goal that embeddings of positive words are closer to the embedding of that entity compared with embeddings of negative words. For the EE e∗=e|E|superscript𝑒superscript𝑒𝐸e^{*}=e^{|E|}, we incrementally estimate its embedding based on Sw​e​bsubscript𝑆𝑤𝑒𝑏S_{web}.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Prior popularity is the probability of the appearance of a candidate entity given an entity mention without considering the context where the mention appears.
