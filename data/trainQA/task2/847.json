      "content": "Paper Title: Deep intrinsic decomposition trained on surreal scenes yet with realistic light effects\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe main problems regarding datasets for intrinsic image estimation swings between the realism of the physical lighting properties of the scene, and the number of images they provide to be enough to train deep architectures. The performance of trained architectures usually rely on a large number of training samples and a high variable appearance between them. MIT Intrinsic was the first dataset in this domain, and it is a non synthetic dataset, it was captured under very controlled conditions. It has 202020 objects, captured in 111111 different lighting conditions, although only one shading (white object acquisition) and one reflectance pair is provided the final dataset ground-truth. Different intrinsic image versions can be generated by introducing a scalar α𝛼\\alpha that minimizes the difference, I​(x,y)−(α​R​e​(x,y)⋅S​h​(x,y))𝐼𝑥𝑦⋅𝛼𝑅𝑒𝑥𝑦𝑆ℎ𝑥𝑦I(x,y)-(\\alpha Re(x,y)\\cdot Sh(x,y)), since even in such controlled environment the product model does not hold for all pixels in objects. The ground-truth is just provided for the pixels in the object mask. MPI Sintel is a synthetic dataset based on an animated movie. It has 181818 scenes with 505050 frames each, except one that has 404040, totaling 890890890 images. Sintel has been the first large dataset giving the opportunity to train deep architectures in the last years. However, it presents unnatural shading, and some color bias mostly on blue and brown colors. Thus, the generalization of networks trained on Sintel are affected by these color biases. And, like in all synthetic datasets, some erroneous pixels are found around boundary of objects. IIW: Intrinsic Images in the Wild is a large and realistic dataset of 5230 images. It only provides sparse reflectance pairwise judgments as training data. These judgments does not present a spatial coherent map for reflectance. Consequently, networks trained using this dataset present too smooth reflectance estimation with lack of texture variation. MIII dataset proposed by Beighpour et al. 9 is the extension of the MIT Intinsic to a multi illuminant intrinsic dataset. This work is a mixture of a realistic and synthetic framework. First they do a 3​D3𝐷3D reconstruction of the objects and make a scene of multiple objects in a synthetic world. Objects are colored in a synthetic world and captured in different lighting conditions. Dataset has 555 scenes and each scene is captured in 151515 different illumination conditions giving the total of 757575 images. Only one reflectance, specular and depth image is provided for each scene. Although their approach is very original and the dataset can be easily scaled by increasing light colors, objects and viewpoints, the 3​D3𝐷3D reconstruction based on computer vision algorithms of the objects is not perfect. Small differences between real and reconstructed object edges, can ultimately result in erroneous shading and reflectance in some parts of the image. ShapeNet[ref]5 is the first large dataset in this field with 330,000330000330,000 images based on the Shapenet 3​D3𝐷3D objects dataset . They used environmental maps in render software to create shading, reflectance and specular component of objects. The final ground-truth is only based on masked regions of objects without cast shadows information. Baslamisli et al. in [ref]6, follow a similar approach to the previous one. They created an intrinsic dataset of 20,0002000020,000 images called Shapenet-Intrinsic. Instead of using original shapenet object textures, they used homogeneous color reflectances for each object part to have more reflectance variation and to disassociate the shape from texture. The final dataset is again only based on masked object region enlightened by environmental maps. Baslamisli et al. in  present a new synthetic dataset of 35​K35𝐾35K images with new synthetic natural objects to form more complex natural scenes. The ground-truth not only provides intrinsic components but also annotations for semantic segmentation purpose. Images are created using sky HDR environmental maps with parallel lighting in the background . These maps introduce different daylight conditions such as clear sky, cloudy, night etc. The whole foreground area has been considerably increased with respect to the previous two mentioned datasets, sky portion areas are masked out in the ground-truth images. CGIntrinsics[ref]8 is another recent synthetic ground-truth of 20,0002000020,000 images. They use the 3​D3𝐷3D indoor objects of SUNCG dataset 0 with 3D textures. It contains images representing complex indoor scenes of objects, combining a mixture of indoor and outdoor illumination. Outdoor illumination sources are also based on HDR environmental maps. Both indoor and outdoor lighting sources are masked out in ground-truth. InteriorNet is a very large scale dataset recently presented in 1. It is formed by 202020 milions of images with an extense ground-truth for a variety of applications such as segmentation, object boundary detection, depth map estimation or motion blur removal. They also provide an interactive simulator ViSIM and the rendering software to randomly select objects or change lighting configuration beyond more tools. Although this dataset is not just made for intrinsic decomposition, it provides a good starting point to create a large photo-realistic and physically consistent dataset. In its current state the dataset does not provide intrinsic ground-truth data and the product model is not held. Before to sum up on current datasets it is worth mentioning an additional way to solve the lack of data for training, it is using specific data-augmentation for intrinsic estimation, as suggested by Sial et al.. in 2. They propose chromaticity rotation to add new reflectance images while keeping the same shading. It is a flexible augmentation strategy that can considerably increase the size of the dataset while reducing the problem of color bias in some datasets. To conclude the review of the different available datasets we provide a complete comparison in Table 1 where we analyse the different datasets according to several properties we have organized in columns referring to: (a) the size or the number of available images with the corresponding ground-truth data; (b) if the dataset fulfills the product model given by Equation1; (c) if the full image can be used in the training, with no mask that reduces the number of samples and meaningful spatial coherence in the training stages; (d) if the ground-truth captures the influence of a diversified background that provoke a large diversity of lighting effects on the object surfaces; (e) if the ground-truth images present cast shadows that add realism to the full scene; (f) if the global lighting is physically consistent with real interaction between all the scene objects, environmental maps usually alter this coherence. Size (#​I​m​a​g​e​s)#𝐼𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠(\\#Images) Model Fulfillment Training on full Image Diversified Background Cast Shadows Consistent Lighting From Table1 we can conclude that the majority of available datasets are synthetic, only the first two rows correspond to realistic ones. MIT is the only realistic dataset that provides full reflectance and shading images, since IIW only give reflectance judgement data for specific pairs. MII is a synthetic dataset carefully created for intrinsic decomposition, whereas Sintel was not created for this problem but has been one of the most used, since it was the first presenting an enough number of images to train deep architectures, its main problem is the high level of correlation between all the images. The three subsequent rows in Table 1 correspond to Shapenet-based datasets, including our proposal. ShapeNet [ref]5 emerged as a tool to create new larger datasets where synthetic objects are located in multiple different environmental maps. Following this idea, Baslamisli et al. [ref]6 used the same approach but using homogeneous reflectance for each object mesh. In both cases the ground-truth is just given by the object area. However, our proposal, also based on Shapenet, uses a single reflectance per mesh like in [ref]6, but substituting environmental maps by multiple elements in the scene surrounding the object that inserts a diversified background, extends the training area to the full image, and adds realism to light effects thanks to shadows and to the physical consistency on rendered light effects. This dataset is presented here as a tunable baseline to easily generate a high diversity of ligthing conditions, that can be adapted depending on the task at hand. We explain all the details on how this dataset is built in the next section. At the bottom of table 1 we have grouped 3 recent datasets that increase the complexity of the scenes, extend the ground-truth to larger areas that can contain cast shadows, but keeping environmental maps in some other parts, which can not be included in the ground-truth and provoke some lack of coherence in the global lighting of the scene. These datasets can be used for more generic applications where a high accuracy in the estimation of light conditions is not required.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: of the objects is not perfect.
