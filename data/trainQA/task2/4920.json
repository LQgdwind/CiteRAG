      "content": "Paper Title: MixMask: Revisiting Masking Strategy for Siamese ConvNets\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMasked Image Modeling.\nMasked Image Modeling aims at learning informative representations by reconstructing a masked image to its original view.\nHe et al.¬†[ref]20 proposed a simple transformer-based Masked Autoencoder (MAE) architecture that employs Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss to reconstruct the original image. BEiT¬†[ref]3 introduced self-supervised pretraining by tokenizing the input image into visual tokens and applying masking. Spatiotemporal representation learning using MAE was proposed in  by Feichtenhofer et al. Several works¬† [ref]2  have explored ways to adapt MAEs to handle multimodal data. Masked Siamese Networks.\nRecent developments in masked image modeling and siamese self-supervised learning have prompted research efforts to combine these two techniques. One such approach, Masked Siamese Networks (MSN), was proposed in . MSN generates an anchor view and a target view and applies masking operations exclusively to the anchor branch. To assign masked anchor representations to the same cluster as the unmasked target, the method employs prototype cluster assignment.\nBy contrast, CNNs are less compatible with masked images as they operate at the pixel level, which can cause image continuity to be disrupted by masking operations. To address this issue, Masked Siamese ConvNets (MSCN) were introduced in . This study investigates and provides guidelines for adapting CNN-based siamese self-supervised learning frameworks to be compatible with masking operations. Mixture-based Data Augmentations.\nSeveral mixture-based techniques have been demonstrated to be effective data augmentation methods in the computer vision domain. Typically, these methods combine two images to generate a new image, referred to as their mixture, and modify the loss function to reflect the semantic distance changes in the resulting mixture image. Initially, Mixup¬† and Manifold Mixup¬† were introduced for supervised learning, whereby pairs of images in the same batch are mixed at a global pixel level using a soft coefficient ŒªùúÜ\\lambda. Subsequently, local region-based techniques such as CutMix  and an attentive scheme¬† were proposed using the same loss design as Mixup. Finally, Un-Mix¬† demonstrates how to integrate Mixup and CutMix for self-supervised learning. Self-supervised Learning.\nSelf-supervised learning (SSL) is a prevalent technique for representation learning that leverages vast amounts of unlabeled data. Early SSL approaches in the field of computer vision were based on pre-text tasks  7  . A pivotal advancement in SSL was the introduction of a simple contrastive learning framework by 0 , which utilized a siamese architecture in conjunction with an InfoNCE  contrastive loss. MoCo  implemented a memory bank to store negative samples, but several studies have shown that negative pairs are not always necessary. BYOL  employed an asymmetric architecture with EMA, where the online network attempts to predict the representations of the target network. SimSiam  provided a straightforward siamese framework that incorporated a stop-gradient operation on one branch and an additional predictor step on the other. More recently, SSL has begun to adopt the use of vision transformers 3. DINO  combined a distillation loss with vision transformers in a siamese framework.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: Masked Image Modeling.\nMasked Image Modeling aims at learning informative representations by reconstructing a masked image to its original view.\nHe et al.¬†[ref]20 proposed a simple transformer-based Masked Autoencoder (MAE) architecture that employs Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss to reconstruct the original image.
