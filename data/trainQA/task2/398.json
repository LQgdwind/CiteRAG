This provides motivation    to develop tools which can support content generation, which is the aim of procedural content generation (PCG) algorithms [ref]7. It is also important to look beyond this commercial motivation and ask how PCG algorithms can support designers in their creative process for the sake of creativity . PCG algorithms have been developed to create a wide variety of content . In addition to supporting designers, PCG algorithms can also benefit the players, resulting in an increased diversity of content    and creating a source of curiosity and unpredictability 0. Perhaps the most notable example of this in recent years is Hello Game’s title No Man’s Sky111https://www.nomanssky.com/, a space exploration game in which almost everything is procedurally generated 1. There are even examples of using PCG as a game mechanic itself, such as in the game Petalz 2 where players breed and share flowers, becoming part of the PCG algorithm itself. Despite the clear benefits of PCG algorithms, there are still a number of open challenges in the field. For example, the vast majority of PCG algorithms are highly problem specific, often designed for a single genre of game  or limited to specific geometries 3. A frequently-cited limitation is the lack of control human designers have when generating content using PCG  3. PCG algorithms are often non-intuitive, requiring designers to tweak and adjust tuning parameters which are difficult to relate to their goals. This ultimately limits the control designers have over the generation process [ref]7 and builds a knowledge barrier . Despite significant investment into researching new methods for PCG, there is little research on how designers interact with these tools 4. In an attempt to address this gap, Craveirinha and Roque 4 undertook a participatory design process involving game designers and researchers to design an interface for a PCG algorithm. In doing so they explored the attitudes of game designers toward PCG tools. They found that many PCG algorithms work by optimising certain metrics which the algorithm designers have identified as being important for player experience. These metrics, and target values for them, are determined a priori. Designers do not operate in this way, but instead explore the design space to determine metrics which can then be used to optimise player experience. The findings were summarised with two key observations which will inform our work: (1) the tool needs an understandable metaphor, and (2) exploration is needed before optimisation.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: to add new fresh content post launch   .
