      "content": "Paper Title: Zero-Shot Temporal Action Detection via Vision-Language Prompting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSetting\nIn this section, we evaluate on the open-set scenario where Dt‚Äãr‚Äãa‚Äãi‚Äãn‚à©Dv‚Äãa‚Äãl=œïsubscriptùê∑ùë°ùëüùëéùëñùëõsubscriptùê∑ùë£ùëéùëôitalic-œïD_{train}\\cap D_{val}=\\phi, i.e., action categories for training and testing are disjoint.\nWe follow the setting and dataset splits proposed by . More specifically, we initiate two evaluation settings on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3:\n(1) Training with 75% action categories and testing on the left 25% action categories;\n(2) Training with 50% categories and testing on the left 50%\ncategories. To ensure statistical significance, we conduct 10\nrandom samplings to split categories for each setting, following . Competitors\nAs there is no open-source implementation for , we use their same reported baselines.\nMore specifically,\n(1) One baseline using BMN [ref]20 as proposal generator and CLIP  with hand crafted prompt. This is the same baseline as reported in . This serves as a 2-stage TAD baseline using CLIP. We term it B-I.\n(2) One comparative CLIP based TAD EffPrompt .\n(3) One CLIP + TAD model for one-stage baseline: As ZS-TAD is a relatively new problem, we need to implement the competitors by extending existing TAD methods using CLIP by ourselves.\nWe select a variant of CLIP for dense prediction task [ref]36 using the existing CLIP pre-trained weights. We term this baseline, DenseCLIP (w/ CLIP Pretrained Image Encoder) + TAD, as B-II.\nThe text-encoders however are identical for both the baselines using CLIP pre-training weights. However, we could not compare with the earlier zero-shot TAD method ZS-TAD [ref]49 due to unavailability of code and no common data-split between [ref]49 and . Performance The ZS-TAD results are reported in Table¬†1. With 50% labeled data, our STALE surpasses both 1-stage and 2-stage baselines, as well as the CLIP based TAD method  by a good margin on ActivityNet. This suggests that our representation masking is able to perform the zero-shot transfer better than conventional 2-stage designs. This also indicates that the localization-error propagation hurts in low training data regime. Also noted that the one-stage baseline (B-II) performs worst among all other baselines. This suggests that a class-agnostic masking is necessary to achieve strong performance in ZS-TAD. The performance of our model however drops on THUMOS14 on stricter metrics, possibly due to\nthe mask decoder suffering from foreground imbalance.\nWe observe similar trend with 75%percent7575\\% labeled data, our approach is again superior than all other competitors on both datasets. It is also interesting to note that the one-stage baseline (B-II) has a larger performance gap with the two-stage baseline (B-I), around 3.1%percent3.13.1\\% avg mAP on ActivityNet. This however reduces to 0.6%percent0.60.6\\% when the number of labeled data increase, suggesting that the one-stage baseline has potential to improve with more data.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: to split categories for each setting, following .
