      "content": "Paper Title: Byzantines can also Learn from History: Fall of Centered Clipping in Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFederated learning (FL) is a novel learning paradigm whose is to enable large-scale collaborative learning in a distributed manner, possibly among edge devices and without sharing local datasets, addressing, to some extent, the privacy concerns of the end-users . Due the these privacy concerns, it allows many IoT and edge devices to participate in collaborative learning  . In FL, the learning process is often orchestrated by a central entity called the parameter server (PS). Participating clients first update their local models using their local private datasets, and then communicate these local models with the PS to seek a consensus with other participating clients. The PS utilizes an aggregation rule to obtain the consensus/global model, which is then sent back to the clients to repeat the process again until the global model achieves a certain generalization capability. Since FL allows on-device training and can be scaled to a large number of clients, it has become the de facto solution for several practical and commercial implementations, e.g., learning keyboard prediction mechanisms on edge devices  , or digital healthcare /remote diagnosis   . However, its widespread popularity also accompanies certain concerns regarding privacy, security, and robustness, particularly for those applications involving highly sensitive financial,  or medical   datasets . Hence, ultimately, the target is to make FL secure, privacy-preserving  , and robust against data heterogeneity  . With the scaling of FL, the PS has less control over the participating clients: that is, malicious clients can also participate with the goal of impairing the final model. Thus, the key challenge for FL is to ensure that the consensus model is trustable despite the potential presence of adversaries. In the machine learning literature, adversaries have been studied in many different contexts and scenarios. They can be analyzed from the perspective of robustness and security. Adverserial robustness in FL refers to mitigating adversaries that attack a trained model at test time by hand-crafted test samples to make the learned model fail the task    , whereas the security is considered against adversaries that can attack the training process with the aim of manipulating the model so that it fails the task at test time. In this work, we focus on the latter. A brief taxonomy of security threat models.\nThe threat models that target the training/learning process are often described as poisoning attacks. We classify them based on three aspects: activation, location, and target.\nWe use the term activation to describe attacks that are embedded into the model during training as a trojan and activated at test time using a specific triggering signal, which is often referred to as a backdoor attack     , or the attack does not require a triggering mechanism, which is often called a Byzantine attack [ref]3 6 [ref]18 6  7   . The second aspect is the location of the interaction of the attack with the learning process. When a poisoning attack targets the training data, we describe it as a data poisoning attack, whereas if the attack directly targets the model, e.g., through the local updates in FL, we describe it as a model poisoning attack. The last aspect we consider is whether the attack is targeted; that is, failure of the learning task is desired for a particular type of test data (for instance, in classification tasks, certain classes might be the target), or untargeted; that is, the failure of the task is desired for any possible test data. Attacks can also be classified based on their knowledge of the learning process (white box / black box), or on their capability and control over the system. For further discussion on the taxonomy of poisoning attacks, we refer the reader to   . Scope and Contributions.\nIn this work, we focus on untargeted model poisoning attacks as they are the most effective against FL to disrupt the collaborative learning process 6 . Various Byzantine attack strategies against FL have been introduced in the literature [ref]3 6 [ref]18  , as well as a number of robust aggregation frameworks that replace federated averaging (FedAVG)  for defence against these 6  7   . One common observation regarding untargeted model poisoning attacks, often valid for other attacks as well, is that when the variance among the honest updates is low, that is, the client updates are more correlated, and an attack can be easily detected as an outlier. On the other hand, it is harder to detect an attack as an outlier when the variance of the honest updates is large. As a direct consequence of the observation above, variance reduction techniques for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can provide protection against Byzantine attacks, in addition to their primary task of accelerating the convergence. Indeed, in , the authors have shown that it is possible to improve the robustness of the existing defence mechanisms by using local momentum. They also argue that the use of global momentum does not serve the same purpose. In 6, the authors further extend the use of local momentum, and show that its advantage against Byzantine attacks is two-fold: First, it helps reduce the variance, and thus, leaves less space for an attack to be embedded without being detected, and second, the aggregated local momentum from the previous iteration can be utilized as a reference point for the centered clipping (CC) mechanism to achieve a robust aggregation rule. Indeed, it has been shown that such a combined mechanism of local momentum and CC demonstrates impressive results against many state-of-the-art (SotA) Byzantine attacks, such as a little is enough (ALIE) [ref]3 and inner product multiplication (IPM) 6 attacks. This design has been further extended to the decentralized framework and combined with other variance reduction techniques 3 7. In this work, we show that the CC mechanism gives a false sense of security, and its performance against ALIE and IMP might be misleading. We show that the existing ALIE and IMP attacks can be redesigned to circumvent the CC defence. We first identify the main vulnerabilities of the CC method, and then, by taking into account certain design aspects of ALIE and IPM, we propose a new Byzantine attack that targets the CC defence. We show numerically that our proposed strategy successfully circumvents the CC defence, as well as other well-known defense mechanisms (i.e., Robust FedAVG (RFA)  and Trimmed-Mean (TM) ). We then propose an improved defence against the proposed attack and show its effectiveness. The contributions of this work can be summarized as follows: We first analyze the CC framework and identify its key vulnerabilities. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate these vulnerabilities, while other succeeding works  also mention the weaknesses in Decentralized FL settings. We revisit the known time-coupled attacks ALIE and IPM, and by taking into account the vulnerabilities of CC that we identified, we introduce a new Byzantine attack called relocated orthogonal perturbation (ROP) that utilizes the broadcasted momentum term to circumvent the CC defence. By conducting extensive simulations on various datasets, both with independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data distributions across the clients, and with different neural network architectures, we show that the proposed ROP attack is effective against the CC defence, as well as other robust aggregators such as RFA and TM. Finally, we introduce a new defence mechanism against the proposed Byzantine attack as well as others, with the same asymptotic complexity as the CC aggregator. We show the robustness of the proposed defence mechanism for both IID and non-IID data distributions.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: at test time using a specific triggering signal, which is often referred to as a backdoor attack     , or the attack does not require a triggering mechanism, which is often called a Byzantine attack [ref]3 6 [ref]18 6  7   .
