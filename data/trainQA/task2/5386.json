      "content": "Paper Title: Deep learning-based method for segmenting epithelial layer of tubules in histopathological images of testicular tissue\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSuggested method is based on U-Net . U-Net is a U shape method that has two main parts; encoder and decoder. In encoder part feature maps are extracted from the image and in decoder part feature maps will be upsampled to the original size of the image for dense prediction. The proposed method is different from U-Net in both encoder and decoder. Different convolutional blocks are used in order to help in better feature extraction and generalization. All of the blocks of the network are illustrated in Fig. 3 and the following details of the network and loss function is explained. Encoder. As for encoder ResNet-34  is used. ResNet is a well-known backbone network that can extract features effectively. In computer vision usually networks with deeper layers are used. However, most of the deep architectures suffer from vanishing gradient in the first layers. Residual blocks in ResNet resolve this problem by adding activation from previous layers to the activation of deeper layers. ResNet-34 has two main blocks: residual block and bottleneck block. Details of these blocks are shown in Fig. 3. The encoder part consists of five downsampling layers which are layers of ResNet-34. Decoder. The decoder part upsamples the features extracted by the encoder. As shown in Fig. 4 the suggested decoder module consists of attention block, Conv3√ó3333\\times 3, batchnorm [ref]37, ReLU activation, and upsampling layer. Instead of upconvolution in U-Net, we suggest nearest neighbor interpolation, which is less computationally expensive. In the attention Spatial and Channel Squeeze & Excitation Block(scSE) [ref]5 is used. The scSE is a combination of Spatial Squeeze & Channel Excitation Block (cSE) and Channel Squeeze & Spatial Excitation Block (sSE). The cSE block squeezes spatial information and the channels are recalibrated. The cSE contains global pooling, Conv1√ó1111\\times 1, ReLU, Conv1√ó1111\\times 1, and sigmoid to squeeze spatial information in channels. This squeezed information magnifies the best channels. The input of the block is refined by channel-wise multiplication of it with squeezed spatial information. The sSE block, squeezes channels and the receptive field is unchanged, applying Conv1√ó1111\\times 1 and sigmoid to squeeze channels information. The input of the block is multiplied by squeezed channels information. The sSE block determines the most important regions of the image. The output of the attention block is obtained by element-wise adding of cSE and sSE. The attention block can demonstrate important sections of images and promotes essential features for better segmentation and generalization [ref]5. The attention block and decoder block are illustrated in Fig. 3 parts c and d. At the end of the decoder, the following layers are used for producing the segmentation map: Conv333, batchnorm, ReLU activation, attention block, and Conv3√ó3333\\times 3. Batch normalization is used to improve the training process. The segmentation map could have two or three channels (classes). Network architecture is illustrated in Fig. 4. Loss Functions. Cross Entropy loss is generally the default loss for a segmentation model. Another common loss function in segmentation tasks is Dice loss [ref]38 which tries to optimize the Dice score. Combination of these two losses can have advantages of both losses . We used the combination of Cross Entropy and Dice loss function as below: Where y^n,csubscript^ùë¶ùëõùëê\\widehat{y}_{n,c} is the softmax output of the network and yn,csubscriptùë¶ùëõùëêy_{n,c} is a one hot encoding of the groundtruth segmentation map. N and C are total number of samples and classes respectively. The related weight of every class wcsubscriptùë§ùëêw_{c} is defined as wc=‚àëcxcC‚Äãxcsubscriptùë§ùëêsubscriptùëêsubscriptùë•ùëêùê∂subscriptùë•ùëêw_{c}=\\frac{\\sum_{c}x_{c}}{C\\ x_{c}} that xcsubscriptùë•ùëêx_{c} is the total number of class cùëêc pixels. One of the main challenges in medical images tasks is imbalanced datasets. Salehi et al. 0 suggested Tversky loss function for imbalanced medical datasets. This loss function penalizes false prediction by using alpha and beta parameters. Alpha and beta parameters control the magnitude of false positives and false negatives respectively. Tversky loss function is defined as below: where Œ±=0.3ùõº0.3\\alpha=0.3 and Œ≤=0.7ùõΩ0.7\\beta=0.7 based on the best performance metrics 0. Both of these loss functions were tested.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: of ResNet-34. Decoder.
