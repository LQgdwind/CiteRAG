      "content": "Paper Title: Accelerating hyperbolic t-SNE\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEmbeddings into hyperbolic space have been studied widely in the context of graph embeddings.\nHere, it was shown to be possible to embed trees into two-dimensional hyperbolic space with arbitrarily low distortion¬†.\nAdditionally, many real-world graphs and networks have properties that can be modeled using hyperbolic geometry.\nRandom graphs created in the hyperbolic plane¬† [ref]16 exemplify some of these properties, such as the power-law degree distribution, small diameter, and high clustering, similar to those observed in real-world networks.\nExamples of such graphs are the internet¬†[ref]6 and social network connections¬†.\nRecent works introduced embedding techniques that scale well to large networks¬†   and show the relevance of hyperbolic space for biological data¬†. Subsequently, research started to investigate the potential of hyperbolic spaces for embedding high-dimensional data sets without graph structures.\nIn this area, several works study extensions of multidimensional scaling (MDS)¬† to hyperbolic space (h-MDS)¬†3 [ref]12 as well as extensions of self-organizing maps¬† to the hyperbolic setting¬†.\nBy comparing MDS embeddings of high-dimensional data into Euclidean and hyperbolic space, it was found that the latter resulted in less metric distortion¬†.\nThis suggests that hierarchical, high-dimensional data, similar to large networks as discussed above, follow an intrinsic hyperbolic metric structure¬†[33, Thm.¬†1].\nOn the flip side, many high-dimensional data sets, like networks and graphs, but also single-cell RNA sequencing measurements are of a hierarchical nature¬†6, which spurred the interest for dimensionality reduction¬†. Several extensions of t-SNE to hyperbolic space have been proposed.\nThe Cauchy Origin-SNE (CO-SNE)¬† starts by interpreting the high-dimensional data as hyperbolic by computing the probability distribution¬†PùëÉP via the Riemannian normal distribution.\nFurthermore, the low-dimensional probabilities¬†QùëÑQ are derived using the Cauchy distribution.\nAdditionally, to preserve hierarchical structures, the cost function (Eq.¬†3) has an additional term to help preserve the distances between the high-dimensional points and the origin. An alternative extension of t-SNE to hyperbolic space is given by the Poincar√© maps¬†.\nHere, the starting point is a nearest-neighbor graph on the high-dimensional data to which additional edges are added until the entire data set is represented by one connected component.\nThe weights on the edges are modeled by a Gaussian kernel.\nThe high-dimensional probabilities¬†PùëÉP are given by the Relative Forest Accessibility matrix on the graph, while the low-dimensional probabilities¬†QùëÑQ are provided by Gaussian kernels.\nAs a cost function, a symmetric version of the Kullback-Leibler divergence is used. A third and final extension of t-SNE to hyperbolic space is hyperbolic SNE (h-SNE)¬†.\nThe cost function is enhanced with a term to increase the sensitivity to large distance values, as proposed in g-SNE¬†.\nA hyperbolic embedding is obtained by replacing the Euclidean distance terms in the gradient with hyperbolic distances.\nAs a limitation, the authors identify the lack of any acceleration scheme and thereby the limitation on the size of the data set that can be embedded.\nTheir embedding scheme performs well until a data set size of about¬†6,000 points¬†[60, p.¬†11]. In conclusion, several extensions of t-SNE to hyperbolic space have been proposed.\nThese alter the algorithm to accommodate different aspects of the embedding.\nYet, all suffer from the lack of acceleration structures and thus turn to sampling the data before the embedding or performing stochastic approximations of the gradient descent.\nIn this paper, we present an acceleration data structure suitable to speed up the computation of hyperbolic t-SNE embeddings.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: with arbitrarily low distortion¬†.\nAdditionally, many real-world graphs and networks have properties that can be modeled using hyperbolic geometry.\nRandom graphs created in the hyperbolic plane¬† [ref]16 exemplify some of these properties, such as the power-law degree distribution, small diameter, and high clustering, similar to those observed in real-world networks.\nExamples of such graphs\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
