Clique-width, introduced 1993 in , is a parameter defined by a construction process where only a limited number of vertex labels are available.\nVertices with the same label at some point must be treated uniformly in subsequent steps (see below).\nThe clique-width cw​(G)cw𝐺\\textrm{cw}(G) of a graph G𝐺G is the minimum number of labels that suffice to construct G𝐺G in this way.\nNP-completeness and inapproximability of the clique-width of a graph were shown in .\nFor graphs of bounded clique-width many hard optimization problems admit polynomial-time algorithms, see, e.g.,    . Relations between treewidth and clique-width were elaborated in\n.\nIn particular, bounded treewidth tw​(G)tw𝐺\\textrm{tw}(G) of a graph G𝐺G implies bounded clique-width since\ncw​(G)≤3⋅2tw​(G)−1cw𝐺⋅3superscript2tw𝐺1\\textrm{cw}(G)\\leq 3\\cdot 2^{\\textrm{tw}(G)}-1 as shown by .\nHowever, the opposite implication is not true as can be seen from the family of complete graphs which have clique-width 222 but treewidth |V|−1𝑉1|V|-1. Another parameter of a graph G𝐺G related to treewidth is rank-width rw​(G)rw𝐺\\textrm{rw}(G) introduced in .\nRank-width is also derived from a hierarchical decomposition of the graph.\nInformally speaking, treewidth measures the width of a separation into two sides, whereas rank-width measures the rank of the adjacency matrix of the edges between the two sides of the separation.\nWithout going into more details, let us just mention that it was shown in  that rw​(G)≤cw​(G)≤2rw​(G)+1−1rw𝐺cw𝐺superscript2rw𝐺11\\textrm{rw}(G)\\leq\\textrm{cw}(G)\\leq 2^{\\textrm{rw}(G)+1}-1.\nTherefore, bounded clique-width is equivalent to bounded rank-width. In the following we will describe the labelling process of the graph decomposition associated to clique-width in more detail. A labeled graph is a graph in which every vertex is assigned some label from ℕℕ\\mathbb{N}. If all vertex labels belong to the set [k]delimited-[]𝑘[k], then we say that the graph is k𝑘k-labeled. The clique-width of a graph G𝐺G is defined as the smallest positive integer k𝑘k such that a k𝑘k-labeled graph isomorphic to G𝐺G\ncan be constructed with the following operations: i​(v)𝑖𝑣i(v): creating a new one-vertex graph with vertex v𝑣v labeled i𝑖i, G⊕Hdirect-sum𝐺𝐻G\\oplus H: disjoint union of two already constructed labeled graphs G𝐺G and H𝐻H, ηi,jsubscript𝜂𝑖𝑗\\eta_{i,j}, for i≠j𝑖𝑗i\\neq j: adding to G𝐺G all edges between vertices labeled i𝑖i and vertices labeled j𝑗j, ρi→jsubscript𝜌→𝑖𝑗\\rho_{i\\to j}, for i≠j𝑖𝑗i\\neq j: relabeling every vertex labeled i𝑖i with label j𝑗j. A construction of a graph G𝐺G with the above four operations can be represented by an algebraic expression, which is called a k𝑘k-expression if it\nuses at most k𝑘k labels.\nGiven a k𝑘k-expression σ𝜎\\sigma, we denote by |σ|𝜎|\\sigma| its encoding length.\nA graph class 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is said to be of bounded clique-width if there exists a nonnegative integer k𝑘k such that each graph in 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} has clique-width at most k𝑘k. Polynomial-time algorithms for graphs with bounded clique-width are typically developed using dynamic programming based on a k𝑘k-expression building the input graph.\nIf a k𝑘k-expression is not available, then one can use any of the available algorithms in the literature for computing an expression with at most f​(k)𝑓𝑘f(k) labels for some exponential function f𝑓f (see    ).\nThe currently fastest such algorithm is due to Fomin and Korhonen ; for an integer k𝑘k and an n𝑛n-vertex graph G𝐺G, it runs in time 22O​(k)​n2superscript2superscript2𝑂𝑘superscript𝑛22^{2^{O(k)}}n^{2} and either computes a (22​k+1−1)superscript22𝑘11(2^{2k+1}-1)-expression of G𝐺G or correctly determines that the clique-width of G𝐺G is more than k𝑘k. We can now proceed to prove the following theorem. For every two positive integers k𝑘k and ℓℓ\\ell, Fair k𝑘k-Division Under Conflicts is solvable in time 𝒪​(4k​ℓ​|σ|​(Q+1)2​k)𝒪superscript4𝑘ℓ𝜎superscript𝑄12𝑘{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(4^{k\\ell}|\\sigma|(Q+1)^{2k}\\right), if the conflict graph G𝐺G has clique-width at most ℓℓ\\ell and is given by an ℓℓ\\ell-expression σ𝜎\\sigma, where Q=max1≤j≤k⁡pj​(V​(G))𝑄subscript1𝑗𝑘subscript𝑝𝑗𝑉𝐺Q=\\max_{1\\leq j\\leq k}p_{j}(V(G)). We extend the standard dynamic programming algorithm for graphs of bounded clique-width for the case k=1𝑘1k=1, that is, the maximum weight independent set problem (see, e.g., [ref]35).\nGiven a partial k𝑘k-coloring c=(X1,…,Xk)𝑐subscript𝑋1…subscript𝑋𝑘c=(X_{1},\\ldots,X_{k}) of an ℓℓ\\ell-labeled graph H𝐻H, the label profile of c𝑐c (with respect to H𝐻H) is the k𝑘k-tuple (L1,…,Lk)subscript𝐿1…subscript𝐿𝑘(L_{1},\\ldots,L_{k}) where Ljsubscript𝐿𝑗L_{j} is the set of labels in [ℓ]delimited-[]ℓ[\\ell] appearing on some vertex of Xjsubscript𝑋𝑗X_{j}, for all j∈[k]𝑗delimited-[]𝑘j\\in[k].\nFor each labeled subgraph H𝐻H of G𝐺G that appears in the process of constructing G𝐺G using σ𝜎\\sigma and each k𝑘k label sets L1,…,Lk⊆[ℓ]subscript𝐿1…subscript𝐿𝑘delimited-[]ℓL_{1},\\ldots,L_{k}\\subseteq[\\ell], we compute the set P​(H,L1,…,Lk)𝑃𝐻subscript𝐿1…subscript𝐿𝑘P(H,L_{1},\\ldots,L_{k}) of all profit profiles (q1,…,qk)subscript𝑞1…subscript𝑞𝑘(q_{1},\\ldots,q_{k}) of partial k𝑘k-colorings c𝑐c of H𝐻H such that the label profile of c𝑐c equals (L1,…,Lk)subscript𝐿1…subscript𝐿𝑘(L_{1},\\ldots,L_{k}).\nWe then have four cases depending on the type of H𝐻H.\nIn each case, we derive a formula of how to compute the set P​(H,L1,…,Lk)𝑃𝐻subscript𝐿1…subscript𝐿𝑘P(H,L_{1},\\ldots,L_{k}) from the previously computed sets of this type. H𝐻H is a one-vertex graph consisting of a vertex v𝑣v labeled i𝑖i. There are only k+1𝑘1k+1 partial k𝑘k-colorings of H𝐻H: the trivial partial k𝑘k-coloring ∅ksuperscript𝑘\\emptyset^{k} consisting of k𝑘k empty sets, and, for each j∈[k]𝑗delimited-[]𝑘j\\in[k], the partial k𝑘k-coloring cj=(X1,…,Xk)subscript𝑐𝑗subscript𝑋1…subscript𝑋𝑘c_{j}=(X_{1},\\ldots,X_{k}) where Xj={v}subscript𝑋𝑗𝑣X_{j}=\\{v\\} and Xj′=∅subscript𝑋superscript𝑗′X_{j^{\\prime}}=\\emptyset for all j′∈[k]∖{j}superscript𝑗′delimited-[]𝑘𝑗j^{\\prime}\\in[k]\\setminus\\{j\\}.\nThe label profile of ∅ksuperscript𝑘\\emptyset^{k} is ∅ksuperscript𝑘\\emptyset^{k}.\nFor each j∈[k]𝑗delimited-[]𝑘j\\in[k], the label profile of cjsubscript𝑐𝑗c_{j} is the k𝑘k-tuple (L1,…,Lk)subscript𝐿1…subscript𝐿𝑘(L_{1},\\ldots,L_{k}) where Lj={i}subscript𝐿𝑗𝑖L_{j}=\\{i\\} and Lj′=∅subscript𝐿superscript𝑗′L_{j^{\\prime}}=\\emptyset for all j′≠jsuperscript𝑗′𝑗j^{\\prime}\\neq j.\nThus, denoting by ej​(pj​(v))subscripte𝑗subscript𝑝𝑗𝑣\\textbf{e}_{j}(p_{j}(v)) the k𝑘k-tuple in ℤ+ksuperscriptsubscriptℤ𝑘\\mathbb{Z}_{+}^{k} with j𝑗j-th coordinate equal to pj​(v)subscript𝑝𝑗𝑣p_{j}(v) and all the other coordinates equal to 00, we have the following formula: While in the remaining three cases, the assumptions on H𝐻H are different, we always describe how to compute the set P​(H,L1,…,Lk)𝑃𝐻subscript𝐿1…subscript𝐿𝑘P(H,L_{1},\\ldots,L_{k}) for an arbitrary but fixed collection of k𝑘k label sets L1,…,Lk⊆[ℓ]subscript𝐿1…subscript𝐿𝑘delimited-[]ℓL_{1},\\ldots,L_{k}\\subseteq[\\ell]. H𝐻H is the disjoint union of two labeled graphs H1subscript𝐻1H_{1} and H2subscript𝐻2H_{2}. Let c=(X1,…,Xk)𝑐subscript𝑋1…subscript𝑋𝑘c=(X_{1},\\ldots,X_{k}) be a partial k𝑘k-coloring of H𝐻H with label profile (L1,…,Lk)subscript𝐿1…subscript𝐿𝑘(L_{1},\\ldots,L_{k}). Then for i∈{1,2}𝑖12i\\in\\{1,2\\} we have that ci=(X1∩V​(Hi),…,Xk∩V​(Hi))subscript𝑐𝑖subscript𝑋1𝑉subscript𝐻𝑖…subscript𝑋𝑘𝑉subscript𝐻𝑖c_{i}=(X_{1}\\cap V(H_{i}),\\ldots,X_{k}\\cap V(H_{i})) is a partial k𝑘k-coloring of Hisubscript𝐻𝑖H_{i}. Let us denote by (L1′,…,Lk′)superscriptsubscript𝐿1′…superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑘′(L_{1}^{\\prime},\\dots,L_{k}^{\\prime}) and (L1′′,…,Lk′′)superscriptsubscript𝐿1′′…superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑘′′(L_{1}^{\\prime\\prime},\\dots,L_{k}^{\\prime\\prime}) the label profiles of c1subscript𝑐1c_{1} and c2subscript𝑐2c_{2}, respectively. Then Lj=Lj′∪Lj′′subscript𝐿𝑗superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑗′superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑗′′L_{j}=L_{j}^{\\prime}\\cup L_{j}^{\\prime\\prime} for all j∈[k]𝑗delimited-[]𝑘j\\in[k]. Furthermore, the converse direction holds as well: for any two partial k𝑘k-colorings c1=(X1′,…,Xk′)subscript𝑐1superscriptsubscript𝑋1′…superscriptsubscript𝑋𝑘′c_{1}=(X_{1}^{\\prime},\\ldots,X_{k}^{\\prime}) and c2=(X1′′,…,Xk′′)subscript𝑐2superscriptsubscript𝑋1′′…superscriptsubscript𝑋𝑘′′c_{2}=(X_{1}^{\\prime\\prime},\\ldots,X_{k}^{\\prime\\prime}) of H1subscript𝐻1H_{1} and H2subscript𝐻2H_{2}, respectively,\nthe k𝑘k-tuple c=(X1′∪X1′′,…,Xk′∪Xk′′)𝑐superscriptsubscript𝑋1′superscriptsubscript𝑋1′′…superscriptsubscript𝑋𝑘′superscriptsubscript𝑋𝑘′′c=(X_{1}^{\\prime}\\cup X_{1}^{\\prime\\prime},\\dots,X_{k}^{\\prime}\\cup X_{k}^{\\prime\\prime}) is a partial k𝑘k-coloring of H𝐻H with label profile (L1′∪L1′′,…,Lk′∪Lk′′)superscriptsubscript𝐿1′superscriptsubscript𝐿1′′…superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑘′superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑘′′(L_{1}^{\\prime}\\cup L_{1}^{\\prime\\prime},\\dots,L_{k}^{\\prime}\\cup L_{k}^{\\prime\\prime}), where (L1′,…,Lk′)superscriptsubscript𝐿1′…superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑘′(L_{1}^{\\prime},\\dots,L_{k}^{\\prime}) and (L1′′,…,Lk′′)superscriptsubscript𝐿1′′…superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑘′′(L_{1}^{\\prime\\prime},\\dots,L_{k}^{\\prime\\prime}) are the label profiles of c1subscript𝑐1c_{1} and c2subscript𝑐2c_{2}, respectively.\nThis bijective correspondence yields the following formula: where the union is taken over all collections (L1′,…,Lk′)superscriptsubscript𝐿1′…superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑘′(L_{1}^{\\prime},\\dots,L_{k}^{\\prime}) and (L1′′,…,Lk′′)superscriptsubscript𝐿1′′…superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑘′′(L_{1}^{\\prime\\prime},\\dots,L_{k}^{\\prime\\prime}) of label sets such that Lj′∪Lj′′=Ljsuperscriptsubscript𝐿𝑗′superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑗′′subscript𝐿𝑗L_{j}^{\\prime}\\cup L_{j}^{\\prime\\prime}=L_{j} for all j∈[k]𝑗delimited-[]𝑘j\\in[k]. H𝐻H is obtained from a labeled graph H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime} by adding all edges between vertices labeled i𝑖i and vertices labeled j𝑗j where i≠j𝑖𝑗i\\neq j. Assume first that there exists some s∈[k]𝑠delimited-[]𝑘s\\in[k] such that {i,j}⊆Ls𝑖𝑗subscript𝐿𝑠\\{i,j\\}\\subseteq L_{s} and let c=(X1,…,Xk)𝑐subscript𝑋1…subscript𝑋𝑘c=(X_{1},\\dots,X_{k}) be a partial k𝑘k-coloring of H𝐻H with label profile (L1,…,Lk)subscript𝐿1…subscript𝐿𝑘(L_{1},\\dots,L_{k}). Since {i,j}⊆Ls𝑖𝑗subscript𝐿𝑠\\{i,j\\}\\subseteq L_{s}, there are vertices v1subscript𝑣1v_{1} and v2subscript𝑣2v_{2} of H𝐻H labeled i𝑖i and j𝑗j, respectively, such that {v1,v2}⊆Xssubscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2subscript𝑋𝑠\\{v_{1},v_{2}\\}\\subseteq X_{s}.\nBy the assumption on H𝐻H all vertices labeled i𝑖i are adjacent in H𝐻H to all vertices labeled j𝑗j, so it is not possible that {v1,v2}⊆Xssubscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2subscript𝑋𝑠\\{v_{1},v_{2}\\}\\subseteq X_{s}, since Xssubscript𝑋𝑠X_{s} is an independent set in H𝐻H; a contradiction.\nIt follows that there is no partial k𝑘k-coloring of H𝐻H with label profile (L1,…,Lk)subscript𝐿1…subscript𝐿𝑘(L_{1},\\dots,L_{k}), so in this case P​(H,L1,…,Lk)=∅.𝑃𝐻subscript𝐿1…subscript𝐿𝑘P(H,L_{1},\\ldots,L_{k})=\\emptyset. Assume now that for every s∈[k]𝑠delimited-[]𝑘s\\in[k] we have that |Ls∩{i,j}|≤1subscript𝐿𝑠𝑖𝑗1|L_{s}\\cap\\{i,j\\}|\\leq 1.\nIn this case, every partial k𝑘k-coloring of H𝐻H with label profile (L1,…,Lk)subscript𝐿1…subscript𝐿𝑘(L_{1},\\dots,L_{k}) is also a partial k𝑘k-coloring of H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime} with the same label profile (with respect to H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime}), and vice versa.\nIt follows that P​(H,L1,…,Lk)=P​(H′,L1,…,Lk)𝑃𝐻subscript𝐿1…subscript𝐿𝑘𝑃superscript𝐻′subscript𝐿1…subscript𝐿𝑘P(H,L_{1},\\ldots,L_{k})=P(H^{\\prime},L_{1},\\dots,L_{k}). Altogether, we have the following equality: H𝐻H is obtained from a labeled graph H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime} by relabeling all vertices labeled i𝑖i to vertices labeled j𝑗j. Let c=(X1,…,Xk)𝑐subscript𝑋1…subscript𝑋𝑘c=(X_{1},\\dots,X_{k}) be a partial k𝑘k-coloring of H𝐻H with label profile (L1,…,Lk)subscript𝐿1…subscript𝐿𝑘(L_{1},\\dots,L_{k}).\nObserve that it follows from the assumption on H𝐻H that no vertex in H𝐻H has label i𝑖i. If there exists some s∈[k]𝑠delimited-[]𝑘s\\in[k] such that i∈Ls𝑖subscript𝐿𝑠i\\in L_{s}, then there is a vertex v∈Xs𝑣subscript𝑋𝑠v\\in X_{s} labelled i𝑖i; a contradiction. It follows that there is no partial k𝑘k-coloring of H𝐻H with label profile (L1,…,Lk)subscript𝐿1…subscript𝐿𝑘(L_{1},\\dots,L_{k}), and we have that P​(H,L1,…,Lk)=∅𝑃𝐻subscript𝐿1…subscript𝐿𝑘P(H,L_{1},\\dots,L_{k})=\\emptyset in this case. Assume now that for all s∈[k]𝑠delimited-[]𝑘s\\in[k] we have that i∉Ls𝑖subscript𝐿𝑠i\\notin L_{s}.\nLet I={s∈[k]∣j∈Ls}𝐼conditional-set𝑠delimited-[]𝑘𝑗subscript𝐿𝑠I=\\{s\\in[k]\\mid j\\in L_{s}\\} and consider an arbitrary s∈I𝑠𝐼s\\in I.\nThe vertices in Xssubscript𝑋𝑠X_{s} form an independent set in H𝐻H and thus also in H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime}.\nSince j∈I𝑗𝐼j\\in I, the set Lssubscript𝐿𝑠L_{s} contains j𝑗j and therefore there exists a vertex v∈Xs𝑣subscript𝑋𝑠v\\in X_{s} such that the label of v𝑣v in H𝐻H is j𝑗j.\nThus, the set Xs​jsubscript𝑋𝑠𝑗X_{sj} of all vertices in Xssubscript𝑋𝑠X_{s} labeled j𝑗j in H𝐻H is nonempty.\nFurthermore, since the label in H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime} of any vertex in Xs​jsubscript𝑋𝑠𝑗X_{sj} is either i𝑖i or j𝑗j, the label set of Xssubscript𝑋𝑠X_{s} in H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime} depends on whether there exists a vertex in Xs​jsubscript𝑋𝑠𝑗X_{sj} labeled i𝑖i in H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime} and whether there exists a vertex in Xs​jsubscript𝑋𝑠𝑗X_{sj} labeled j𝑗j in H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime}.\nMore precisely, the dependency is as follows. If there exists a vertex in Xs​jsubscript𝑋𝑠𝑗X_{sj} labeled i𝑖i in H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime} as well as one labeled j𝑗j in H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime}, then the label set of Xssubscript𝑋𝑠X_{s} in H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime} is Ls∪{i}subscript𝐿𝑠𝑖L_{s}\\cup\\{i\\} (recall that j∈Ls𝑗subscript𝐿𝑠j\\in L_{s}). If all vertices in Xs​jsubscript𝑋𝑠𝑗X_{sj} are labeled i𝑖i in H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime}, then the label set of Xssubscript𝑋𝑠X_{s} in H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime} is (Ls∖{j})∪{i}subscript𝐿𝑠𝑗𝑖(L_{s}\\setminus\\{j\\})\\cup\\{i\\}. If all vertices in Xs​jsubscript𝑋𝑠𝑗X_{sj} are labeled j𝑗j in H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime}, then the label set of Xssubscript𝑋𝑠X_{s} in H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime} is Lssubscript𝐿𝑠L_{s}. We conclude that the vertices of Xssubscript𝑋𝑠X_{s} form in H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime} an independent set with label set being equal either to Lssubscript𝐿𝑠L_{s}, to (Ls∖{j})∪{i}subscript𝐿𝑠𝑗𝑖(L_{s}\\setminus\\{j\\})\\cup\\{i\\}, or to Ls∪{i}subscript𝐿𝑠𝑖L_{s}\\cup\\{i\\}.\nTherefore, c𝑐c is a partial coloring of H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime} with label profile (L1′,…,Lk′)superscriptsubscript𝐿1′…superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑘′(L_{1}^{\\prime},\\dots,L_{k}^{\\prime}) such that for all s∈I𝑠𝐼s\\in I we have Ls′∈{Ls,(Ls∖{j})∪{i},Ls∪{i}}superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑠′subscript𝐿𝑠subscript𝐿𝑠𝑗𝑖subscript𝐿𝑠𝑖L_{s}^{\\prime}\\in\\{L_{s},(L_{s}\\setminus\\{j\\})\\cup\\{i\\},L_{s}\\cup\\{i\\}\\}, and for all s∈[k]∖I𝑠delimited-[]𝑘𝐼s\\in[k]\\setminus I we have Ls′=Lssuperscriptsubscript𝐿𝑠′subscript𝐿𝑠L_{s}^{\\prime}=L_{s}.\nConversely, for any k𝑘k label sets L1′,…,Lk′⊆[ℓ]superscriptsubscript𝐿1′…superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑘′delimited-[]ℓL_{1}^{\\prime},\\dots,L_{k}^{\\prime}\\subseteq[\\ell] such that Ls′∈{Ls,(Ls∖{j})∪{i},Ls∪{i}}superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑠′subscript𝐿𝑠subscript𝐿𝑠𝑗𝑖subscript𝐿𝑠𝑖L_{s}^{\\prime}\\in\\{L_{s},(L_{s}\\setminus\\{j\\})\\cup\\{i\\},L_{s}\\cup\\{i\\}\\} for all s∈I𝑠𝐼s\\in I and Ls′=Lssuperscriptsubscript𝐿𝑠′subscript𝐿𝑠L_{s}^{\\prime}=L_{s} for all s∈[k]∖I𝑠delimited-[]𝑘𝐼s\\in[k]\\setminus I, any partial coloring of H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime} with label profile (L1′,…,Lk′)superscriptsubscript𝐿1′…superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑘′(L_{1}^{\\prime},\\dots,L_{k}^{\\prime}) is a partial coloring of H𝐻H with label profile (L1,…,Lk)subscript𝐿1…subscript𝐿𝑘(L_{1},\\ldots,L_{k}). Altogether, we thus obtain the following equality: where the union in the second case is taken over all k𝑘k-tuples of label sets L1′,…,Lk′⊆[ℓ]superscriptsubscript𝐿1′…superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑘′delimited-[]ℓL_{1}^{\\prime},\\dots,L_{k}^{\\prime}\\subseteq[\\ell] such that for all s∈I𝑠𝐼s\\in I we have Ls′∈{Ls,(Ls∖{j})∪{i},Ls∪{i}}superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑠′subscript𝐿𝑠subscript𝐿𝑠𝑗𝑖subscript𝐿𝑠𝑖L_{s}^{\\prime}\\in\\{L_{s},(L_{s}\\setminus\\{j\\})\\cup\\{i\\},L_{s}\\cup\\{i\\}\\}, and for all s∈[k]∖I𝑠delimited-[]𝑘𝐼s\\in[k]\\setminus I we have Ls′=Lssuperscriptsubscript𝐿𝑠′subscript𝐿𝑠L_{s}^{\\prime}=L_{s}. From the ℓℓ\\ell-expression σ𝜎\\sigma we compute in time |σ|𝜎|\\sigma| a rooted tree T𝑇T describing the construction of G𝐺G. Each node of T𝑇T corresponds to a labeled subgraph H𝐻H of G𝐺G.\nFor each such subgraph H𝐻H we consider all the 2ℓ​ksuperscript2ℓ𝑘2^{\\ell k} different collections of k𝑘k label sets (L1,…,Lk)subscript𝐿1…subscript𝐿𝑘(L_{1},\\dots,L_{k}), obtained by choosing a subset of [ℓ]delimited-[]ℓ[\\ell] for each coordinate.\nWe explain the time complexity separately for Case 222.\nFor Case 222, we can initialize all the sets P​(H,L1,…,Lk)𝑃𝐻subscript𝐿1…subscript𝐿𝑘P(H,L_{1},\\dots,L_{k}) to be empty and iterate\nover all 4k​ℓsuperscript4𝑘ℓ4^{k\\ell} pairs of collections (L1′,…,Lk′)superscriptsubscript𝐿1′…superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑘′(L_{1}^{\\prime},\\dots,L_{k}^{\\prime}) and (L1′′,…,Lk′′)superscriptsubscript𝐿1′′…superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑘′′(L_{1}^{\\prime\\prime},\\dots,L_{k}^{\\prime\\prime}) of label sets of H1subscript𝐻1H_{1} and H2subscript𝐻2H_{2}.\nFor each such iteration we add to P​(H,L1,…,Lk)𝑃𝐻subscript𝐿1…subscript𝐿𝑘P(H,L_{1},\\dots,L_{k}), where Lj=Lj′∪Lj′′subscript𝐿𝑗superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑗′superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑗′′L_{j}=L_{j}^{\\prime}\\cup L_{j}^{\\prime\\prime} for all j∈[k]𝑗delimited-[]𝑘j\\in[k], the elements of the set {𝐪𝟏+𝐪𝟐∣𝐪𝟏∈P​(H1,L1′,…,Lk′),𝐪𝟐∈P​(H2,L1′′,…,Lk′′)}conditional-setsubscript𝐪1subscript𝐪2formulae-sequencesubscript𝐪1𝑃subscript𝐻1superscriptsubscript𝐿1′…superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑘′subscript𝐪2𝑃subscript𝐻2superscriptsubscript𝐿1′′…superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑘′′\\{\\mathbf{q_{1}}+\\mathbf{q_{2}}\\mid\\mathbf{q_{1}}\\in P(H_{1},L_{1}^{\\prime},\\dots,L_{k}^{\\prime}),\\mathbf{q_{2}}\\in P(H_{2},L_{1}^{\\prime\\prime},\\dots,L_{k}^{\\prime\\prime})\\} in time (Q+1)2​ksuperscript𝑄12𝑘(Q+1)^{2k}.\nHence, the overall time complexity for a graph H𝐻H in Case 222 is 𝒪​(4k​ℓ​(Q+1)2​k)𝒪superscript4𝑘ℓsuperscript𝑄12𝑘{\\mathcal{O}}(4^{k\\ell}(Q+1)^{2k}).\nFor the remaining three cases, we estimate the running time separately for each set P​(H,L1,…,Lk)𝑃𝐻subscript𝐿1…subscript𝐿𝑘P(H,L_{1},\\ldots,L_{k}).\nThe expressions in the formulas for computing P​(H,L1,…,Lk)𝑃𝐻subscript𝐿1…subscript𝐿𝑘P(H,L_{1},\\ldots,L_{k}) can be evaluated in time 𝒪​(k​ℓ)𝒪𝑘ℓ\\mathcal{O}(k\\ell) in Case 111, in time 𝒪​(k​ℓ+(Q+1)k)𝒪𝑘ℓsuperscript𝑄1𝑘{\\mathcal{O}}(k\\ell+(Q+1)^{k}) in Case 333, and in time 𝒪​(k​ℓ⋅3k⋅(Q+1)k)𝒪⋅𝑘ℓsuperscript3𝑘superscript𝑄1𝑘{\\mathcal{O}}(k\\ell\\cdot 3^{k}\\cdot(Q+1)^{k}) in Case 444.\nSince Case 444 dominates the other two cases, the overall time complexity for a graph H𝐻H resulting from Cases 111, 333, and 444 is given by 𝒪​(2k​ℓ⋅k​ℓ⋅3k​(Q+1)k)𝒪⋅⋅superscript2𝑘ℓ𝑘ℓsuperscript3𝑘superscript𝑄1𝑘{\\mathcal{O}}(2^{k\\ell}\\cdot k\\ell\\cdot 3^{k}(Q+1)^{k}).\nSince k​ℓ≤2k​ℓ𝑘ℓsuperscript2𝑘ℓk\\ell\\leq 2^{k\\ell} and 3k≤(Q+1)ksuperscript3𝑘superscript𝑄1𝑘3^{k}\\leq(Q+1)^{k} for all Q≥2𝑄2Q\\geq 2, the overall time complexity of Cases 111, 333, and 444 is dominated by the effort for Case 222, which yields the claimed running time bound.\n(The special case Q=1𝑄1Q=1 would imply that for each agent, only one item has a non-zero profit.\nThis could be solved trivially in time 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k).)\n∎ We conclude this section with some remarks about another, more general solution approach to Fair k𝑘k-Division Under Conflicts for graphs of bounded clique-width.\nThe unweighted version of Fair k𝑘k-Division Under Conflicts (in its decision version) takes a graph G𝐺G and an integer q𝑞q as input and asks about the existence of a partial k𝑘k-coloring in G𝐺G in which all the color classes have cardinality at least q𝑞q.\nThe existence of a pseudopolynomial-time algorithm for this problem on graphs with bounded clique-width follows from a metatheorem of Courcelle and Durand [14, Theorem 27], and it is plausible that with a suitable adaptation of their approach, a solution for the general Fair k𝑘k-Division Under Conflicts problem might also be developed.\nHowever, as the algorithms constructed in  are very general, their running times are not specified precisely.\nIn contrast, our algorithm given in the proof of Theorem 4 is directly tailored for Fair k𝑘k-Division Under Conflicts and it is not difficult to analyze its running time.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: j\\leq k}p_{j}(V(G)). We extend the standard dynamic programming algorithm for graphs of bounded clique-width for the case k=1𝑘1k=1, that is, the maximum weight independent set problem (see, e.g., [ref]35).\nGiven a partial k𝑘k-coloring c=(X1,…,Xk)𝑐subscript𝑋1…subscript𝑋𝑘c=(X_{1},\\ldots,X_{k}) of an ℓℓ\\ell-labeled graph H𝐻H, the label profile of c𝑐c (with respect to H𝐻H) is the k𝑘k-tuple\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
