      "content": "Paper Title: Mitigating Hallucination in Large Multi-Modal Models via Robust Instruction Tuning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEarly explorations [39; 17; 18; 35] of vision and language pre-trained models tend to use Bert-based [28; 13] models as the language decoder. Inspired by the recent success of large language models [37; 10; 43; 20; 22] and datasets [21; 6; 14; 24; 33; 34; 23], many studies [1; 16; 15] have been focused on improving vision-language pre-trained models by integrating powerful LLMs with in-context or few-shot learning capability. More recently, some visual instruction-tuned LMMs [44; 26; 11; 8] have emerged, showing excellent generalization performance in unseen VL tasks. Specifically, LLaVA 6 projects the output of a visual encoder as input to LLaMA [ref]37 and trains both the alignment network and the LLM on synthetic data. MiniGPT4  is built on BLIP-2 but uses Vicuna [ref]7 as the language decoder. It only finetunes the cross-modal alignment network on longer image captions from ChatGPT. The research approaches [11; 8] are instruction-tuned on a collection of VL datasets, but InstructBLIP  uses BLIP2  as the backbone while  is initialized from Flamingo . mPLUG-owl  finetunes LLaMA [ref]37 model using both text instruction data and vision-language instruction data from LLaVA 6. In comparison, we propose a large and diverse visual instruction dataset with 16 vision and language tasks and negative instructions in different semantic levels and styles. This can help improve the robustness of current LMMs. Although LMMs are powerful in solving VL tasks, they also suffer from the hallucination inherited from LLM. Popular image captioning metrics like CIDEr  SPICE  do not appropriately penalize hallucination. CHAIR, , is unstable and needs complex human-crafted parsing rules for exact matching. Alternatively, 9 converts the hallucination into a binary classification problem. However, it requires the input questions to follow specific templates, such as \"Is there a/an <object> in the image?\". In comparison, our proposed GAVIE can evaluate model hallucination in an open-ended manner without needing human-annotated groundtruth answers.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: instruction-tuned LMMs [44; 26; 11; 8] have emerged, showing excellent generalization performance in unseen VL tasks.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
