      "content": "Paper Title: Quantum computational complexity of matrix functions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn , Montanaro and Shao study the query complexity (i.e., number of queries to an oracle for Aùê¥A) for the matrix element problem for both classical and quantum algorithms for matrices of bounded operator norm ‚ÄñA‚Äñ‚â§1normùê¥1\\|A\\|\\leq 1.\nFor classical algorithms, they give query complexity lower bounds that grow exponentially in the degree of the target polynomial, assuming the input matrix has bounded operator norm and the estimation error satisfies 1/Œµ=ùí™‚Äã(poly‚Å°log‚Å°(N))1ùúÄùí™polyùëÅ1/\\varepsilon=\\mathcal{O}(\\operatorname{poly}\\log\\!\\left(N\\right)).111This also extends to functions approximated by a polynomial of said degree. This contrasts with (essentially matching) upper and lower bounds for quantum algorithms, which are linear in the polynomial degree. Our work can be seen as a complementary investigation where, instead of query complexity, we tackle computational complexity.\nA central difference between these two notions is that, with\ncomputational complexity, the access model must also be computationally efficient. In contrast, with query complexity, computational hardness can (in theory) be hidden inside the oracle to Aùê¥A.\nAnother distinction from  is that there the central parameter probed is the degree of the target polynomial, whereas here we toggle various additional problem parameters including properties of the matrix. Another related line is the significant body of literature on so-called quantum-inspired or dequantization algorithms [ref]19 [ref]30     . Here, classical algorithms are emboldened with a particular kind of\naccess to vectors and matrices which mimics quantum query access, usually called ‚Äúsample and query access models‚Äù. Whilst such work is hugely informative about the feasibility of generic superpolynomial speedup for matrix problems given oracular query access, we stress again, our setting differs in that we work with access models that are efficiently instantiable. In turn, we highlight a recent work by Gharibian and Le Gall , which provides a quantum-inspired algorithm for the Guided Local Hamiltonian problem222This problem consists of finding the ground state energy of a local Hamiltonian given a ‚Äúguiding‚Äù\nvector with Œ©‚Äã(1/poly‚Å°(N))Œ©1polyùëÅ\\Omega\\left(1/\\operatorname{poly}\\!\\left(N\\right)\\right) overlap with the corresponding eigenspace. for constant precision. This is relevant to our discussions for two reasons. First, the authors establish a core classical subroutine\nfor sparse matrix monomials which has exponential-in-degree runtime in general but is efficient for 111-sparse matrices or for monomials of logarithmic degree (see ).\nWe complement these findings by discovering other restricted settings that result in a classically efficiently solvable problem (see Table 1).\nSecond, their result provides an example of a matrix problem that is classically efficient when the precision is\nfixed (in the different setting of sample and query access to the guiding vector). Efficient classical constant-precision algorithms for ground state problems have also been found in other contexts .\nYet, to our knowledge, the realm of constant precision remains mostly unexplored for more general matrix algebra tasks. Finally, let us summarize a few additional previous results on the hardness of matrix functions that directly fall within our setting. These are contextualized in Table 1 among our results. In the sparse access model, Janzing and Wocjan showed that estimating matrix elements of matrix monomials is BQP-complete for inverse error and monomial power scaling polylogarithmically with NùëÅN, for Aùê¥A normalized by its operator norm [ref]26. However, the same problem was shown to be classically easy by Apers et al.¬†when the matrix normalization is\nstrengthened to the induced 1-norm, i.e. when the norm is decreased from ‚ÄñA‚Äñ‚â§1normùê¥1\\|A\\|\\leq 1 to ‚à•A‚à•1‚â§1subscriptdelimited-‚à•‚à•ùê¥11\\left\\lVert A\\right\\rVert_{1}\\leq 1  .\nWe observe that the proof from [ref]26 shows that relaxing the normalization condition from ‚à•A‚à•1‚â§1subscriptdelimited-‚à•‚à•ùê¥11\\left\\lVert A\\right\\rVert_{1}\\leq 1 to ‚à•A‚à•1‚â§2subscriptdelimited-‚à•‚à•ùê¥12\\left\\lVert A\\right\\rVert_{1}\\leq 2 brings back the BQP-completeness of the problem.\nThis reflects a sharp transition in hardness and evidences, thereby, a form of tightness of the algorithm from , since relaxing its hypothesis to ‚à•A‚à•1=ùí™‚Äã(1)subscriptdelimited-‚à•‚à•ùê¥1ùí™1\\left\\lVert A\\right\\rVert_{1}=\\mathcal{O}(1) breaks it without any possibility of fixing it (assuming BPP‚â†BQPBPPBQP\\textsc{BPP}{}\\neq\\textsc{BQP}{}).\nAn efficient classical algorithm analogous to that of Apers et al.\nfor the Pauli access models (both\nfor deterministic and random sampling access) was presented by Wang et al.¬†, when Aùê¥A is normalized by its l1subscriptùëô1l_{1}-norm of the Pauli coefficients. BQP-completeness of the normalized-state version of our local measurement problem was shown for f‚Äã(A)=A‚àí1ùëìùê¥superscriptùê¥1f(A)=A^{-1} by Harrow, Hassadim, and Lloyd (HHL) in their seminal paper , for the sparse access model, operator-norm matrix normalization, and constant precision 1/Œµ=ùí™‚Äã(1)1ùúÄùí™11/\\varepsilon=\\mathcal{O}(1).\nEmploying their construction, we can prove BQP-completeness also for the non-normalized case under the same assumption of 1/Œµ=ùí™‚Äã(1)1ùúÄùí™11/\\varepsilon=\\mathcal{O}(1).\nIn addition, we characterize the complexity of matrix inversion over the different settings we probe, i.e., including also the matrix element estimation problem (using a similar construction to that for monomials from [ref]26), sparse access versus Pauli access models, and different norms and sparsity regimes. The universality of time evolution, meaning the capability of encoding any quantum circuit in a local Hamiltonian time evolution, is known from the original work by Feynman . In particular, the circuit associated with any BQP problem can be mapped into a Hamiltonian and probabilistically implemented. Building upon Feynman‚Äôs construction, Nagaj showed that a polynomial-sized circuit can be implemented using time evolution for a 333-local (sparse) Hamiltonian with t=poly‚Å°(n)ùë°polyùëõt=\\operatorname{poly}\\!\\left(n\\right) . This result naturally translates to the BQP-completeness of the local measurement problem with ft‚Äã(A)=e‚àíi‚ÄãA‚Äãtsubscriptùëìùë°ùê¥superscriptùëíùëñùê¥ùë°f_{t}(A)=e^{-iAt}. Here, we include a BQP-completeness proof using a slightly different Hamiltonian and extend the result to the matrix entry problem.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: toggle various additional problem parameters including properties of the matrix.
