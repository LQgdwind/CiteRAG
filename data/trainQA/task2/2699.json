One way to address this\nissue is pruning which aims to reduce the depth and complexity of a neural\nnetwork. Howard et al.  propose the usage of\ndepth-wise and point-wise convolutions instead of full convolution to reduce the\nnumber of parameters by 32 times and the number of operation by 27 times in\ncomparison with the original VGG-16 while achieving nearly the same accuracy.\nAnother approach is knowledge distillation  where a\nsmaller network is trained with a larger network in a teacher-student style.\nThis method achieves better accuracy than the case where the small network is\ntrained alone. A third approach is quantization  which\nreplaces floating-point arithmetic with other numeric representations, such as\nfixed-point, to reduce the number of bits and the cost of operations in terms of\nlatency. The quantization approach uses different types of numerical representations,\nsuch as binary, ternary, integer, fixed-point, small-size floating-point, and\nposit . Depending on its usage, quantization can be\nclassified into storage or computing. The storage quantization tackles the\nproblem of memory usage by adopting a lower bit representation in memory for\nintegers, fixed-point [ref]36, floating-point and posit\nnumbers [ref]29. But before performing the operations, these\nlower bit representations are converted to full-size floating-point.\nThis method degrades accuracy and increases latency.\nTo address this issue, Langroudi et al. [ref]29 proposed using\ndifferent bit sizes per ML network layer. This method decreases memory\nutilization by as much as 94% while degrading the accuracy by only 1%. This is\na good solution for saving storage but it may increase design complexity. Carmichael et al.  analyze fixed-point,\nfloating-point and posit representations on DNN showing that posit offers the\nbest accuracy while exhibiting a smaller latency compared to floats. In this\npaper, we aim to explore deeper the suitability of using posit for ML inference.\nSpecifically, we evaluate three different posit sizes to determine which one\noffers the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: quantization can be\nclassified into storage or computing. The storage quantization tackles the\nproblem of memory usage by adopting a lower bit representation in memory for\nintegers, fixed-point [ref]36, floating-point and posit\nnumbers [ref]29. But before performing the operations, these\nlower bit representations are converted to full-size floating-point.\nThis method degrades accuracy and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
