      "content": "Paper Title: ChatAgri: Exploring Potentials of ChatGPT on Cross-linguistic Agricultural Text Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the rapid development of sustainable smart agriculture ecosystem, the quantity of various news contents related to agricultural themes on the Internet has undergone an explosive increase. Such a vast quality of unstructured data contains already latent historical knowledge, helping us precisely study natural hazards and mitigate potential agricultural risks. Artificial intelligence-based agricultural text classification enables managing these massive Internet agricultural news automatically and makes these massive unstructured data easily indexable, which is a crucial step for agricultural digitization and agricultural Internet of Things. In recent years, these mainstream agricultural document processing techniques including text classification generally rely on various deep representation learning-based methods, especially on approaches based on pre-trained language models (PLMs), including BERT, BART, and T5 [1; 2; 3]. Xu et al.  proposed a novel model, namely time series-long short-term memory (AETS-LSTM), for predicting the rise and fall of agricultural exports. agricultural document processing. Cao et al.  utilized the BERT with symmetrical structure to analyze the sentiment tendency of the Internet consumers reviews towards the agricultural products. Leong et al.  employed a text-level character region awareness model (CRAFT) for recognizing and extracting the essential information from agricultural regulatory document and certificates. Jiang et al. [ref]7 proposed a BERT-based text classification network for automatically classifying the French bulletin to make these data easily indexable. In additional to the aforementioned research efforts, these deep representation learning-based approaches have held great promise for almost all agricultural informatization applications. Unfortunately, these PLMs-based fine-tuning solutions, inevitably encounter several challenging issues in the practical processes of model development, and application deployment. On the one hand, insufficient and poor quality supervised training data can greatly decrease the model performance whereas acquiring enough high-quality annotated data remains time-consuming and labour-intensive; on the other hand, even if trained properly on sufficient data, the inherent characteristics of supervised learning models limit their generalization capabilities to specific contexts related to the supervised corpus. In other words, when transplanted to new domains or new tasks, their limitations become evident, lacking a certain degree of scenario transferability, particularly of the cross-linguistic capacity.\nMoreover, due to the extremely large parameter volumes of PLMs, the corresponding deployment is complex and power-intensive, which requires high-performance equipments (such as massively parallel computing hardware, such as GPUs and TPUs). For example, the largest T5 model has over 11 billion parameters, which is 100 times the number of parameters of the BERT-base model. These prove that mainstream PLMs-based agricultural text classification methods fall far short of the standards for achieving General Purpose Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) in the future. These introduced limitations and deficiencies have made existing agricultural document processing techniques can not handle well in almost application scenarios, especially for agricultural text classification.\nRecently, the artificial intelligence ChatGPT-family chatbots, proposed by the OpenAI foundation, has caused a groundbreaking revolution in the academic community, especially for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. ChatGPT is essentially a powerful very large pre-trained language model for dialogue based on the Transformer architecture [ref]8, utilizing a larger corpus, higher computational power, and an unprecedented amount of network parameters777You can access ChatGPT by visiting the following URL: \nhttps://chat.openai.com/chat [Accessed on 2023.05].. What is inspiring is that unlike previous intelligent chat robots, ChatGPT can provides smooth and comprehensive responses to various complex and professional human questions. For instance, ChatGPT can perform tasks such as multilingual translation, poetry generation, and code generation based on specific requirements [9; 10]. Thus, ChatGPT have rapidly exhibited their remarkable language comprehension and generation abilities, which produces popularity and attracts ever-increasing attention in various cross-disciplinary researches that NLP community intersects with, such as radical radiology diagnosis  and sentiment analysis of surgery disease [12; 13]. After experiencing ChatGPT’s universal and powerful capabilities, it is natural for us to wonder about how much potentials ChatGPT can bring to the agricultural products’ production management process for optimizing sustainable agricultural applications. As shown in Fig. 1, when asked about the potential applications of GPT-3.5 (a standard model in ChatGPT-family) in agriculture, The model replied that it is capable of performing tasks such as weather forecasting, pest and disease identification, and market analysis (among others). Inspired by the potential applications of ChatGPT in the field of smart agriculture, it is our belief that the community is much in need for principled explorations to determine how much ChatGPT can contribute to the optimization of sustainable agricultural practices. With that concern in mind, we have decided to delve into the potentials of ChatGPT by focusing on the concise classification of agricultural text in this work. By doing so, our experiments mainly investigate the potential power of ChatGPT (i.e. GPT-3.5 by default)  and its extension (i.e. GPT-4)  for classifying the agricultural-related documents. Notably, along with the proposed ChatAgri, this paper also provides a brand-new paradigm which is distinguished from existing methods. Through a series comparative experiments of ChatAgri with a range of mainstream text classification models, including classic fine-tuned PLMs [15; 16] and prompt-learning based on auto-regressive generative PLMs [17; 18; 19], we systematically evaluated and investigated the superiority of ChatGPT in agricultural text classification tasks, which distinguished it significantly from other methods. Furthermore, we have investigated extensive literature related to ChatGPT-based question answering (QA) [20; 21; 22; 23] and the prompt learning scheme [17; 24; 25], and arrived at the following conclusions: Most language understanding tasks based on ChatGPT can be categorized as a new form of Prompt Learning based on PLMs.\nSpecifically, regarding the adopted ChatGPT interface as a parameters-frozen large-scale PLM, the overall procedure are extremely similar to the prompt-tuning paradigm described in the survey of Liu et al. [ref]17. Fig. 2 gives a clear illustration of the major similarities and distinguishes between ChatGPT-based NLP paradigm, (a) and MLM prompt-tuning paradigm, (b), through a typical example of the agricultural food comment sentiment analysis task. As depicted in part. (c) of Fig. 2, the MLM prompt-tuning paradigm can be divided into three primary procedures: template engineering, pre-trained language models reasoning, and answer mapping engineering [ref]17. As shown in part. (b) of Fig. 2, the general NLP research related to ChatGPT can be organized into the following several phases in our experiments [11; 26]: 1) prompting question construction engineering; 2) ChatGPT Q&A inference; 3) answer normalization engineering (alias. answer alignment). Thus, several core factors were considered to be optimized: 1). Due to that interacting with ChatGPT involves providing instructions through human response, based on previous ChatGPT prompting works [27; 22; 21], we have designed several appropriate task-specific inquiries to intuitively trigger the understanding capability of ChatGPT; 2). As the textual generations of ChatGPT are essentially human-like natural language, they differ greatly when it comes to specific tasks. So, a accurate label mapping strategy from ChatGPT outputs to the final classified categories are needed to be developed. In our experiments, we devised two novel answer mapping strategies for this critical step for the answer alignment engineering. To evaluate extensive data in various agricultural sub-fields, sourced mainly comes from Internet news covering topics ranging from insect pests, and natural hazards to agricultural market comments.\nFurther, even in cases multi-language corpora are tested, experiments validate that the proposed ChatAgri still features a significant transferring effectiveness in cross-linguistic scenarios. In summary, our experiments provide a preliminary study of ChatGPT on agricultural text classification to gain a better understanding of it, and reported a systematic analysis according to the corresponding empirical results. We believe that by exploring how ChatGPT can contribute to agricultural production and management through text classification tasks such as pest and disease identification, agricultural news categorization, and market comment analysis, we can demonstrate the feasibility of ChatGPT in advancing agricultural practices, thereby paving the way for a more efficient and sustainable smart agriculture. The novel ingredients of this work can be summarized as follows: Motivated by the various application progresses of very large pre-trained language models represented by ChatGPT, we conduct a preliminary study towards exploring the potentials of ChatGPT in agricultural text classification task and thus propose ChatGPT-based solution for agricultural text classification, namely ChatAgri; Evaluated on several multi-linguistic datasets, ChatAgri achieves competitive performance compared to existing PLM-based fine-tuning approaches, showing a superior ability in terms of the impressive semantic understanding. Through several specific case analysis, it even surprisingly produces a intelligent reasoning chain; The zero-shot learning experiments demonstrate the great potential of ChatAgri in agricultural text classification, compared to existing PLM-based fine-tuning approaches, which require high-quality supervised data, along with a time-consuming, labor-intensive annotations and expensive knowledge from agricultural domain experts; Multi-linguistic experiments discussed in this work expose the excellent domain transferability of ChatAgri, by which the model can adapt to different agricultural applications quickly, and is a fundamental step accelerating the future General Purpose AI (GPAI); ChatAgri, only relying on network interface and minimum hardware requirements, subverts the mainstream complex and power-intensive PLM-based methods, which holds great promise of the general and low-costing artificial intelligence techniques for the future smart agricultural applications; To encourage further research of smart agricultural applications by leveraging ChatGPT, we released the codes of ChatAgri on Github888Code has been released on Github: https://github.com/albert-jin/agricultural_textual_classification_ChatGPT [Accessed on 2023.05].. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the recent literature in related fields, with a focus on recent research for the agricultural text classification task, ChatGPT, and pre-trained language model-based NLP techniques.\nSection 3 presents a detailed description of the whole ChatAgri framework, including a detailed algorithmic description. In Section  4 and 5, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the comparison experiments between ChatAgri and several mainstream PLM-based methods, along with various ablated studies.
