For fully developed flow, the xùë•x dependence drops out. The unidirectional velocity field is thus ùíñ=ux‚Äã(y)‚ÄãùíÜxùíñsubscriptùë¢ùë•ùë¶subscriptùíÜùë•\\bm{u}=u_{x}(y)\\bm{e}_{x}. We introduce the dimensionless variables where UmaxsubscriptùëàmaxU_{\\mathrm{max}} is the centerline (maximum) velocity of the solvent fluid at the same volumetric flow rate, Œ≥Àô0=Umax/HsubscriptÀôùõæ0subscriptùëàmaxùêª\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}=U_{\\mathrm{max}}/H is the mean shear rate, and LùêøL is a typical axial length scale for the channel. Now, the dimensionless particle transport equation¬†(3) for the suspension takes the form In Eq.¬†(21), P‚ÄãeùëÉùëíPe is the shear P√©clet number, which quantifies the relative importance of shear migration to Brownian migration of particles [ref]49, defined as where kBsubscriptùëòùêµk_{B} is Boltzmann‚Äôs constant, and TùëáT is temperature.\nObserve that unlike the case of Eq.¬†(12), Eq.¬†(21) for finite P‚ÄãeùëÉùëíPe cannot be divided by KcsubscriptùêæùëêK_{c} (to only consider the ratio KŒ∑/KcsubscriptùêæùúÇsubscriptùêæùëêK_{\\eta}/K_{c}). Again, the particle distribution is constrained such that For a dense non-Brownian suspension (P‚Äãe‚â´1much-greater-thanùëÉùëí1Pe\\gg 1), the velocity is not parabolic  . Its shape is found by solving the momentum equation¬†(4) for the pressure-driven Poiseuille flow of the suspension: where G‚àósuperscriptùê∫G^{*} (resp.¬†Gùê∫G) is the dimensionless (resp.¬†dimensional) axial pressure gradient, which is constant in unidirectional flow . Integrating Eq.¬†(24) once and imposing a centerline symmetry condition, we have Similarly to the approach of Reyes et¬†al. , Eq.¬†(25) will be enforced via the PINN‚Äôs loss function to account for the blunted (non-parabolic) velocity profiles of dense suspensions. However, we will not enforce no-slip boundary conditions with Eq.¬†(25) because experiments    suggest that dense suspensions can slip along the channel walls (see Fig.¬†3). The proposed machine learning methodology naturally handles slip without further effort. To calculate G‚àósuperscriptùê∫G^{*} from the experimental data, Eq.¬†(25) is integrated from y‚àó=0superscriptùë¶0y^{*}=0 to y‚àó=1superscriptùë¶1y^{*}=1 and rearranged, yielding which is evaluated using the experimental u‚àósuperscriptùë¢u^{*} and œïitalic-œï\\phi profiles and the trapezoidal rule for the integral. For a strongly Brownian suspension (P‚Äãe=ùí™‚Äã(1)ùëÉùëíùí™1Pe=\\mathcal{O}(1)), as we will discuss in Sec.¬†4.3, the velocity profile in experiments  is indistinguishable from a parabolic one, so instead of Eq.¬†(25), we can simply enforce Put differently: now Œ∑r‚Äã(œï)‚âà1subscriptùúÇùëüitalic-œï1\\eta_{r}(\\phi)\\approx 1, u‚àó‚Äã(1)=0superscriptùë¢10u^{*}(1)=0 (the dilute suspension does not slip), and the scale UmaxsubscriptùëàmaxU_{\\mathrm{max}} is chosen to make G‚àó=‚àí2superscriptùê∫2G^{*}=-2 in this case, consistent with Eq.¬†(26).\n\nReference markers found: [49]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]49: equation¬†(3) for the suspension takes the form In Eq.¬†(21), P‚ÄãeùëÉùëíPe is the shear P√©clet number, which quantifies the relative importance of shear migration to Brownian migration of particles [ref]49, defined as where kBsubscriptùëòùêµk_{B} is Boltzmann‚Äôs constant, and TùëáT is temperature.\nObserve that unlike the case of Eq.¬†(12), Eq.¬†(21) for finite P‚ÄãeùëÉùëíPe cannot be divided by\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
