      "content": "Paper Title: A Novel Modeling and Simulation Approach for the Hindered Mobility of Charged Particles in Biological Hydrogels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs outlined above, the initial, stress-free configuration of the fiber network is the result of a 3D Voronoi tessellation of the cubic simulation box (size 10×10×10​ µ​m101010timesabsentmicrometer10\\times 10\\times 10\\,$\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}$) generated via the open source library voro++ .\nFigure 1 shows an example of the resulting network architecture. The main input of this preprocessing step are the randomly chosen locations of a number nVPsubscript𝑛VPn_{\\text{VP}} of so-called Voronoi points111Note that the original term Voronoi particles from  is not used here to avoid confusion with the diffusing particle(s).\n.\nThe output are the vertices and edges of a random, irregular, polygonal network that are used to define the position and orientation of the initially straight beam segments as well as their interconnections.\nFor Voronoi-based tessellation, the connectivity number, i.e., the number of fibers branching off at each junction point, is 4, which agrees well with values of 3 to 4 reported for ECM gels .\nIn the future, this parameter could also be adapted by randomly removing or adding fibers to match other hydrogel architectures.\nAt each junction, the beam endpoint positions and rotations are coupled, which corresponds to a model assumption based on the expected mechanical behavior of the chemical binding between the fibers, and could be once again adapted e.g., to hinged connections in a straightforward manner.\nAlso, the binding and unbinding of such connections at given rates could be included by following the approach described e.g., in .\nTo be able to use the simulation box as a representative volume element (RVE) with periodic boundary conditions (see Section 2.6 for details), the Voronoi tessellation and thus the resulting network geometry is chosen to be periodic in space.\nAltogether, a simple visual comparison with electron microscopy images of real biological hydrogels in Figure 1 reveals a high similarity both in terms of the random, irregular, polygonal structure as well as its characteristic properties, such as the distribution of pore sizes, fiber segment length and connectivity. The individual fibers are modeled by (geometrically exact) 3D beam theory, assuming undeformable cross-sections of circular shape and a hyperelastic material law.\nSpecifically, we apply the Simo-Reissner beam theory   , which accounts for 6 deformation modes of axial tension, (2x) shear, torsion and (2x) bending.\nFurther specifications such as the dimensional and constitutive parameters are chosen to mimic collagen I as the key constituent of the targeted class of ECM hydrogels, however, all these parameters can be easily adapted to study their influences or to model other fiber species.\nIn the present study, the cross-section diameter is set to Df=75 nmsubscript𝐷ftimes75nanometerD_{\\text{f}}=$75\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{nm}$, Poisson’s ratio is set to ν=0.3𝜈0.3\\nu=0.3, and Young’s modulus is varied from as low as E=0.1 MPa𝐸times0.1megapascalE=$0.1\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{MPa}$ up to the theoretical limit of rigid fibers to study the influence of the fiber stiffness.\nNote that experimental measurements for collagen I suggest values in the wide range of E=1 MPa−1 GPa𝐸times1megapascaltimes1gigapascalE=$1\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{MPa}$-$1\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{GPa}$  , which are covered in this work as well.\nBased on the results in Section 3.3, it will turn out that the influence of the fiber stiffness on the particle mobility in the problem setup considered here is negligible for the realistic range of values for Young’s modulus E𝐸E, and a noticeable difference in results can only be observed below a threshold value of E∗=1 MPasuperscript𝐸∗times1megapascalE^{\\ast}=$1\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{MPa}$.\nIt can therefore be assumed that the specific values for the fiber material are of minor importance and that the deformation of fibers will only become important if the dynamics of the network reorganization will be included as outlined above, or if much thinner and softer, i.e., much more compliant fibers are considered e.g., in the context of a different kind of hydrogel (e.g., mucin or F-actin) or a dysregulation of fiber stiffness. In order to characterize the generated fiber networks, Figure 2 shows the resulting values of the mean and standard deviation of the fiber volume fraction V¯fsubscript¯𝑉f\\bar{V}_{\\text{f}} and the minimum/average/maximum cell diameters222Here, the cell diameter for each of the nVPsubscript𝑛VPn_{\\text{VP}} cells in the network has been computed as an approximated inscribed sphere of the irregular polyhedron based on the shortest distance of the Voronoi point to each of the cell edges.\n\nas a function of the number of Voronoi points nVPsubscript𝑛VPn_{\\text{VP}}. For this statistical analysis of the random network geometries, a box size of 10×10×10​ µ​m101010timesabsentmicrometer10\\times 10\\times 10\\,$\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}$ and a fiber diameter Df=75 nmsubscript𝐷ftimes75nanometerD_{\\text{f}}=$75\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{nm}$ as stated above is assumed.\nA number of nVP=60subscript𝑛VP60n_{\\text{VP}}=60 Voronoi points result in a fiber volume fraction V¯f≈0.4%subscript¯𝑉fpercent0.4\\bar{V}_{\\text{f}}\\approx 0.4\\% and a range of cell diameters of approx. 2.7−5.2 µ​m2.7times5.2micrometer2.7-$5.2\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}$.\nThis turns out to match the typical mesh size of 2−3 µ​m2times3micrometer2-$3\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}$ reported in  quite well and is thus chosen as the default value for most of the simulations conducted in this work (once again refer to Figure 1 for a visual comparison of model and real hydrogels).\nThe densest network to be considered in this work is given as nVP=600subscript𝑛VP600n_{\\text{VP}}=600 and thus results in a high fiber volume fraction of V¯f≈1.8%subscript¯𝑉fpercent1.8\\bar{V}_{\\text{f}}\\approx 1.8\\% and cell diameters in the range of approx. 1.0−2.5 µ​m1.0times2.5micrometer1.0-$2.5\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}$.\nThis second value of the network parameter nVP=600subscript𝑛VP600n_{\\text{VP}}=600 is motivated by the example of the human amniotic basal membrane , which appears to be much denser than the one considered above.\nOne example of the resulting model network is shown in Figure 3. In order to investigate and average out the influence of the specific network geometry, 5 different realizations of the random network generation process will be considered as input for the simulations for each – otherwise identical – set of input parameters in Sections 3.2 and 3.3, respectively.\nIn contrast to the spherical particle, which will be discussed next, the fibers are assumed to be athermal because the lengths of the individual fiber segments are generally much smaller than their persistence length ℓp≈39 µ​msubscriptℓptimes39micrometer\\ell_{\\text{p}}\\approx$39\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}$ (resulting from the parameters for the bending stiffness given above and the thermal energy at room temperature kB​T≈4×10−3 aJsubscript𝑘B𝑇times4E-3attojoulek_{\\text{B}}T\\approx$4\\text{\\times}{10}^{-3}\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{aJ}$) and thermal undulations will therefore be negligible.\nHowever, for another network architecture with longer fiber segments or a different species of thinner and thus more flexible fibers such as mucin or F-actin, this effect might become important and may be included in the novel computational model by means of the formulation proposed in . Finally, the spatial discretization of the fibers makes use of the geometrically exact Hermitian Simo-Reissner beam elements proposed in [ref]37, which are mainly based on the well-established element formulation proposed by Crisfield and Jelenić  [ref]51.\nThe applied centerline interpolation using cubic Hermite polynomials ensures both high accuracy in terms of spatial approximation and a C1superscript𝐶1C^{1}-continuous geometry representation.\nThis is particularly important for smooth contact kinematics and smooth interaction force distributions as has been shown in the context of beam-beam interactions in  .\nWhen creating the finite element discretization for each of the random network configurations, a default element length lele=1 µ​msubscript𝑙eletimes1micrometerl_{\\text{ele}}=$1\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}$ is used for each straight fiber segment and one additional shorter beam element is created for the remainder of the random segment length if needed.\nBased on the previous experience (from challenging scenarios with large deformations such as presented in ) with this kind of beam finite element featuring fourth order spatial convergence, this is considered to be a sufficiently fine spatial resolution for the magnitude of deformations observed throughout this computational study, such that the influence of the spatial approximation error on the results is expected to be negligible.\nTo conclude, this strategy typically leads to a number of fiber segments nf≈800subscript𝑛f800n_{\\text{f}}\\approx 800, a number of beam elements nele≈1600subscript𝑛ele1600n_{\\text{ele}}\\approx 1600, and a number of nodes nnode≈4000subscript𝑛node4000n_{\\text{node}}\\approx 4000 for nVP=60subscript𝑛VP60n_{\\text{VP}}=60.\nLikewise, for the densest network with nVP=600subscript𝑛VP600n_{\\text{VP}}=600, we obtain nf≈6200subscript𝑛f6200n_{\\text{f}}\\approx 6200, nele≈6200subscript𝑛ele6200n_{\\text{ele}}\\approx 6200, and nnode≈18700subscript𝑛node18700n_{\\text{node}}\\approx 18700.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: computational model by means of the formulation proposed in .
