We randomly assign each device to examples of two classes (highly unbalanced). We consider two settings during testing: 1) Local Test, where we know which device the data belongs to (i.e. new predictions on an existing device) and choose that particular trained local model. For this setting, we split each device’s data into train, validation, and test data, similar to . 2) New Test, in which we do not know which device the data belongs to (i.e. new predictions on new devices) [ref]38, so we use an ensemble approach by averaging all trained local model logits before choosing the most likely class [ref]6. For ensembling, all local model weights are sent to the server only once and averaged. We include this parameter exchange step and still show substantial communication improvement. We find that averaging model weights performs similarly (0.5%percent0.50.5\\% for CIFAR) to averaging model outputs since deep ReLU nets are mostly linear). We choose LeNet-5 [ref]28 as our base model and we compare 4 methods: 1) FedAvg [ref]38 which is the traditional federated learning approach, 2) Local only  as an extreme setting with only local models, 3) MTL  which trains local models with parameter sharing in a multi-task fashion, and 4) LG-FedAvg which is our proposed method with local and global models. The results in Table 1 show that LG-FedAvg gives strong performance with low communication cost. For CIFAR local test, LG-FedAvg significantly outperforms FedAvg since local models allow us to better model the local device data distribution. For new test, LG-FedAvg achieves similar performance to FedAvg while using around 50%percent5050\\% of the total parameters, and better performance with the same number of parameters. LG-FedAvg also outperforms using local models only and local models trained with multitask learning (MTL). This shows that our end-to-end training strategy for local and global models is particularly suitable for large neural networks. We show MNIST results and sensitivity analysis wrt data and model splits in Appendix C.2 and find similar observations. Visual Question Answering (VQA): VQA is a large-scale multimodal benchmark with 0.250.250.25M images, 0.760.760.76M questions, and 101010M answers . We split the dataset in a non-i.i.d. manner and evaluate the accuracy under the local test setting. We use LSTM  and ResNet-18  unimodal encoders as our local models and a global model which performs early fusion  of text and image features for answer prediction. In Table 2, we observe that LG-FedAvg reaches a goal accuracy of 40%percent4040\\% while requiring lower communication costs (more VQA results and details in Appendix C.2.3).\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: setting, we split each device’s data into train, validation, and test data, similar to . 2) New Test, in which we do not know which device the data belongs to (i.e. new predictions on new devices) [ref]38, so we use an ensemble approach by averaging all trained local model logits before choosing the most likely class [ref]6.
