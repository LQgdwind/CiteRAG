      "content": "Paper Title: Robust Proxy: Improving Adversarial Robustness by Robust Proxy Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs adversarial vulnerability has attracted significant attention, many works are devoted to getting to the bottom of the vulnerability  [ref]27 [ref]28. An early study tended to view adversarial examples as a result of the excessive linearity nature of DNNs in high-dimensional spaces . In another study, it has been regarded as statistical fluctuations in the data manifold  . Recently, a new perspective on the phenomenon of adversarial vulnerability is proposed [ref]28 [ref]30  [ref]27. In contrast to previous studies, these works figure out the vulnerability as a view of feature representations. Tsipras et al. [ref]30 showed that the goals of learning features for standard accuracy and adversarial robustness might be at odds. Specifically, they argue that the features for adversarial robustness and for standard accuracy are fundamentally different. Then, the features learned by robust models tend to align better with salient data characteristics and human perception. Ilyas et al.  demonstrated that adversarial vulnerability is a consequence of non-robust components of features. These non-robust components are useful and highly predictive for standard performance, yet easily broken by adversarial perturbations. In contrast, robust components still can provide robust prediction results even with adversarial perturbation. Kim et al. [ref]27 explicitly distilled features into robust channels and non-robust channels. Then, they showed that non-robust channels are directly related to adversarial predictions. Also, in [ref]27, they addressed that the robust channels are robust on the noise variation and invariant to the existence of the adversarial perturbation. In contrast, the non-robust channels are brittle and easily change the model prediction by noise variation. In the rest of the paper, we use the definition of robust/non-robust features defined in [ref]27. The aforementioned studies commonly argued that features for a standard performance and for adversarial robustness are different. Also, the vulnerability stems from the non-robust feature components that are brittle and incomprehensible to humans. Therefore, it is necessary to learn robust feature representations. In this context, recently some works try to improve the robustness by exploiting the robust feature representations. Yang et al.  proposed the Deep Robust Representation Disentanglement Network (DRRDN) model to disentangle the class-specific representation and class-irrelevant representation. To this end, they employed a disentangler to extract and align the robust representations from both adversarial and natural examples. With the disentangler, they eliminate the effect of adversarial perturbations and improve the robustness. Kim et al.  proposed a way to extract robust and non-robust features based on causality. They demystified causal features on adversarial examples in order to uncover inexplicable adversarial origins through a causal perspective. To this end, they proposed adversarial instrumental variable (IV) regression as a means to identify the causal features pertaining to the causal relationship of adversarial prediction on adversarial examples. Then, they improve the robustness by exploiting the causal features. In this work, we propose a new approach that explicitly learns robust feature representations rather than heuristically employing existing learning algorithms.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: As adversarial vulnerability has attracted significant attention, many works are devoted to getting to the bottom of the vulnerability  [ref]27 [ref]28.
