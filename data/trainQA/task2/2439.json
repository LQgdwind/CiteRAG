In the following, we explain it in details. Input representations.\nThe input to the transformer encoder is the concatenation of projected video and query text features.\nFor video, we use SlowFast [ref]5 and the video encoder (ViT-B/32) of CLIP  to extract features every 2 seconds.\nWe then normalize the two features and concatenate them at hidden dimension.\nThe resulting video feature v𝑣v is denoted as Ev∈ℝLv×2816subscript𝐸𝑣superscriptℝsubscript𝐿𝑣2816E_{v}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{L_{v}\\times 2816}.\nFor query text, we use the CLIP text encoder to extract token level features, Eq∈ℝLq×512subscript𝐸𝑞superscriptℝsubscript𝐿𝑞512E_{q}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{L_{q}\\times 512}.\nNext, we use separate 2-layer perceptrons with layernorm 4 and dropout 4 to project the video and query features into a shared embedding space of size d𝑑d.\nThe projected features are concatenated  at length dimension as the input to the transformer encoder, denoted as Ei​n​p​u​t∈ℝL×dsubscript𝐸𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡superscriptℝ𝐿𝑑E_{input}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{L\\times d}, L=Lv+Lq𝐿subscript𝐿𝑣subscript𝐿𝑞L{=}L_{v}+L_{q}. Transformer encoder-decoder.\nThe video and query input sequence is encoded using a stack of T𝑇T transformer encoder layers.\nEach encoder layer has the same architecture as in previous work [ref]40 , with a multi-head self-attention layer and a feed forward network (FFN).\nSince the transformer architecture is permutation-invariant, fixed positional encodings   are added to the input of each attention layer, following .\nThe output of the encoder is Ee​n​c∈ℝL×dsubscript𝐸𝑒𝑛𝑐superscriptℝ𝐿𝑑E_{enc}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{L\\times d}.\nThe transformer decoder is the same as in [ref]40 , with a stack of T𝑇T transformer decoder layers.\nEach decoder layer consists of a multi-head self-attention layer, a cross-attention layer (that allows interaction between the encoder outputs and the decoder inputs), and an FFN.\nThe decoder input is a set of N𝑁N trainable positional embeddings of size d𝑑d, referred to as moment queries.222Following , we use moment queries to refer to decoder positional embeddings, not the text queries.\nThese embeddings are added to the input to each attention layer as in the encoder layers.\nThe output of the decoder is Ed​e​c∈ℝN×dsubscript𝐸𝑑𝑒𝑐superscriptℝ𝑁𝑑E_{dec}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times d}. Prediction heads.\nGiven the encoder output Ee​n​csubscript𝐸𝑒𝑛𝑐E_{enc}, we use a linear layer to predict saliency scores S∈ℝLv𝑆superscriptℝsubscript𝐿𝑣S\\in\\mathbb{R}^{L_{v}} for the input video.\nGiven the decoder output Ed​e​csubscript𝐸𝑑𝑒𝑐E_{dec}, we use a 3-layer FFN with ReLU 1 to predict the normalized moment center coordinate and width w.r.t. the input video.\nWe also follow DETR  to use a linear layer with softmax to predict class labels.\nIn DETR, this layer is trained with object class labels.\nIn our task, since class labels are not available, for a predicted moment, we assign it a foreground label if it matches with a ground truth, and background otherwise.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: In the following, we explain it in details.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
