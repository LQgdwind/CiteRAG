      "content": "Paper Title: UFA-FUSE: A novel deep supervised and hybrid model for multi-focus image fusion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFirst of all, we introduce the training details which are important for the training of fusion models. The proposed fusion model is trained by using the generated dataset, which consists of 84424 images. In each training batch, we randomly extract 8 images with the sizes of 256×\\times256. We implement our proposed fusion model with Pytorch framework and update it with Adam optimizer . The learning rate is initialized to 1e-4 for all layers and divided into ten for every 200 epochs. The proposed fusion framework is trained for a total of 300 epochs, and the total training time is 60h. The proposed model is trained and tested on an eight-core PC with an Intel 9700KF 3.5 GHz CPU (with 16 GB RAM) and a GTX 2070Super GPU (with 8GB memory). To objectively verify the superiority of our proposed fusion method over other fusion methods, we have compared it with nineteen representative fusion algorithms. What’s more, the comparison algorithms we chose are diverse and not limited to those deep learning-based methods. Specifically, the comparison algorithms contain such as sparse representation (SR) , curvelet transform (CVT) , discrete wavelet transform (DWT), dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT), non-subsampled contourlet transform (NSCT)  these transform domain-based fusion algorithms; dense SIFT (DSIFT) , guiding filter fusion (GFF) , matting fusion (IMF), multi-scale weighted gradient fusion (MWGF)  and spatial frequency (SF)  these spatial domain-based algorithms; convolutional neural network (CNN) , DeepFuse [ref]23, SESF, DenseFuse  (including elementwise-add and L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} fusion strategy), DRPL, MFF and IFCNN  (including elementwise-maximum fusion strategy) these deep learning-based algorithms. Compared with these traditional comparison algorithms (including transform domain-based and spatial domain-based algorithms), the proposed algorithm has stronger feature representation capability and can effectively extract more informative image features. Moreover, compared with these deep learning-based comparison algorithms, the proposed algorithm is an end-to-end network structure and does not require the generation of an intermediate decision map to achieve image fusion. In addition, the proposed algorithm designs the novel attention mechanism-based fusion strategies, which can provide additional flexibility for fusing different types of image features.\n What’s more, we have discriminated against the performance of different fusion models through qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods. From the perspective of qualitative evaluation methods, whether the visual effects of the fusion image differ from the source images is the main discriminating method. Specifically, the fused image should contain as many distinct and sharp features from source images in multi-focus image fusion, and does not exist additional artifacts. Since only evaluating the performance of fusion methods from the qualitative perspective is not comprehensive. Consequently, we further use seven metrics to evaluate the performance of the fusion algorithms on the multi-focus image fusion. The seven metrics are respectively the visual information fidelity (VIFF) , standard deviation (STD) , average gradient (AVG) , gradient-based fusion performance (Qa​b​fsuperscript𝑄𝑎𝑏𝑓Q^{abf}) , shannon entropy (SEN) , Qcsuperscript𝑄𝑐Q^{c}  and Qmsuperscript𝑄𝑚Q^{m} . \nVIFF, which is an evaluation metric based on human visual perception, measures the visual information fidelity between the fusion image and source images. STD and AVG, which are two image features-based evaluation metrics, measure the textural information of the fusion image from a statistical point of view. Qa​b​fsuperscript𝑄𝑎𝑏𝑓Q^{abf} is an evaluation metric based on source images and the fusion image, and Qa​b​fsuperscript𝑄𝑎𝑏𝑓Q^{abf} evaluates the performance of fusion methods based on gradient. SEN is an evaluation metric based on information theory. Qmsuperscript𝑄𝑚Q^{m} retrieves the edge information from the high and band-pass components of the decomposition by using the two-level Haar wavelet. Qcsuperscript𝑄𝑐Q^{c} employs the major features in human visual system model to evaluate the perceptual quality of image fusion. There is no doubt that these seven metrics cover different types of fusion evaluation metrics. So, it is enough to evaluate the fusion results of different fusion models through these seven metrics. These seven metrics can objectively reflect the abilities of fusion methods on merging the clear image features and on integrating the texture information. It is certainly appropriate to choose these seven metrics to evaluate the performance of different fusion algorithms. In addition, it should be noted that qualitative evaluation and quantitative evaluation perform on the ‘Lytro’ multi-focus image dataset , as shown in Fig. 5, the dataset contains 20 pairs of multi-focus images.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: fusion (GFF) , matting fusion (IMF), multi-scale weighted gradient fusion (MWGF)  and spatial frequency (SF)  these spatial domain-based algorithms; convolutional neural network (CNN) , DeepFuse [ref]23, SESF, DenseFuse  (including elementwise-add and L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} fusion strategy), DRPL, MFF and IFCNN  (including elementwise-maximum fusion strategy) these deep learning-based\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
