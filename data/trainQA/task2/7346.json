Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Apart\nfrom these frameworks, various memory and compute optimization techniques are invented for efficient decoding [ref]21[ref]23, which significantly improve LLMs’ inference performance in deployments. Also, efficient scheduling in LLM inference is crucial for optimizing the service. ORCA  introduces iteration-level scheduling, i.e., continuous batching, that dynamically adjusts batch size during iterations, allowing immediate replacement of completed sequences within a batch, thus improving GPU utilization and reducing idle time. Many LLM serving frameworks have adopted this method.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: To reduce the deployment and operational expenses of LLM serving, several specialized frameworks have been developed, including TensorRT-LLM [ref]17, vLLM , DeepSpeed , and lightLLM .
