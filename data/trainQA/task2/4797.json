      "content": "Paper Title: Hypergraph-based Multi-Robot Task and Motion Planning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn multi-robot systems, a task space element consists of the same types of constraints (object poses and grasp constraints in manipulation problems) as in single robot systems.\nHowever, in this domain, there is a combinatorial expansion in the number of task space elements available to the system as both the number of robots and objects grow . The three classes of multi-robot motion planning (coupled, decoupled, and hybrid) apply here as well.\nMost task and motion planning problems require too much coordination for decoupled methods to be useful.\nAlthough some of our prior work has explored hybrid search techniques in the multi-robot task and motion planning domain, the approach does not extend to manipulation problems .\nThe rest of this section discusses coupled approaches. Previous work in the area has had two main focuses to handle the space complexity: developing representations and developing heuristics.\nThe authors in  use a shared manipulator workspace to build a shared space graph to reason over multi-robot cooperation and adapt a path planning heuristic for multi-manipulator planning.\nAssumptions about reachability and the number of robots required to securely grasp an object is used in  to build a condensed graph representation.\nThis representation is integrated in later work with a multi-robot motion planning method  to create a full multi-robot multi-modal planner [ref]9.\nThis planner introduces a high-level object mode graph to represent valid transitions between pick, place, and handoff configurations.\nThis graph is used as a heuristic to guide the multi-modal motion planning through sequences of modes that form a valid solution.\nAll three of these methods   [ref]9 only plan for a single object. In [ref]10, the work in [ref]9 is expanded to account for multiple objects.\nThe single object mode graph in [ref]9 is replaced with an object centric mode graph where vertices correspond to manipulators and stable surfaces.\nInstead of searching over object (or task state) switches for a single object, a multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) technique is proposed to find non-conflicting individual object mode sequences over the available manipulators and stable surfaces.\nThe transfer of multiple objects at once complicates the reasoning over both the sequence of modes and the motion planning.\nThe authors simplify the problem by considering synchronized actions for the set of manipulators in the problem.\nThis allows a single step in the MAPF solution over the object centric mode graph to both indicate a set of actions for the robots to perform and define a more constrained multi-robot motion planning problem. Using MAPF over the object centric mode graph as a heuristic, the Synchronized Multi-Arm Rearrangement (SMART) is able to efficiently plan for up to 9 robots [ref]10.\nThe heuristic is formulated as a MAPF problem over the object centric mode graph.\nThe method is biased to greedily move the object centric mode state forward along the corresponding MAPF solution.\nWhen the MAPF solution is simple and the paths for individual objects are not likely to use the same robots at the same time, this greedy heuristic performs exceptionally well.\nHowever, when the paths for objects are likely to conflict, or the number of objects increases relative to the number of robots (increasing the density of the MAPF problem), this heuristic becomes limiting.\nThis is reflected in [ref]10 as no result is shown for more than 4 objects.\nWe directly compare our method against SMART [ref]10 in later sections. Recent work such as  [ref]25 have addressed more complicated manipulation tasks such as tower stacking and obstructing obstacles though they still struggle to scale the number of objects relative to the number of robots with the highest ratio coming with 6 objects for 2 robots.\nThe evaluation of the method’s ability to handle increasing numbers of robots only considers very simple task problems where each robot has a very clear correct role [ref]25.\nWe show the ability to solve similar problems in Section VIII and obtain higher ratios of objects to robots in our more general experiments.\n All of these methods focus on a single short term task involving a small set of obstacles.\nIn contrast,  presents a long-horizon multi-robot task and motion planning construction method which decomposes problems with up to 113 objects into subproblems each focused around a single object.\nMethods such as the one presented here and [ref]25 can be integrated into the long-horizon framework of  to address more complicated subtasks within long-horizon problems.\nWe do not address this integration in this work.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: is used in  to build a condensed graph representation.\nThis representation is integrated in later work with a multi-robot motion planning method  to create a full multi-robot multi-modal planner [ref]9.\nThis planner introduces a high-level object mode graph to represent valid transitions between pick, place, and handoff configurations.\nThis graph is used as a heuristic to guide the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
