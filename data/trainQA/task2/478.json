      "content": "Paper Title: Test and Yield Loss Reduction of AI and Deep Learning Accelerators\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe error-tolerance nature of AI algorithms has been exploited in hardware to design energy-efficient AI accelerator architectures with approximate MACs -. In , using benchmark-driven analysis each neuron was ranked according to its sensitivity and error contribution to the output, and neurons that contributed the least to the error were then approximated and the network was retrained to recover accuracy loss. In hardware, neurons that were approximated were assigned to approximate PEs, while others were assigned to exact PEs . However, the challenges with these approximate approaches are, (i) sensitivity-based sorting, approximation, and retraining of neurons are always dependent on the workload . (ii) Assigning less sensitive neurons to approximate PEs will require runtime hardware reconfiguration for different tasks. (iii) In - pruning was not considered, but in modern NN/CNN pruning is applied as a well-established method to reduce network size where less important/sensitive connections are already pruned/removed during training 4-. Hence, the techniques of - will be much less effective when applied on an already pruned NN/CNN. (iv) Most importantly, since these approximate CNN/NN assume that the only source of error is the deterministic approximate multiplier and adders, any additional faults in the PE/MAC from process variation induced defects will cause a significant amount of inaccuracy in the prediction during inference. With the widespread use application AI accelerators, the testing of these hardware has become an emerging research problem . In , a comprehensive structural test flow was proposed that first identified critical faults by comparing the accuracies of the exact fault-free gate-level circuit of the neural network, and that of a faulty version. Next, the entire circuit was converted into an Boolean satisfiability (SAT) instance and solved with SAT solver with test patterns for the critical faults only. Since this approach is expensive and not scalable, a functional test method was proposed , where real workloads - the test images from MNIST and CIFAR10 benchmarks - are applied as test input to the gate-level netlist of the implemented neural network. To find if a fault was critical or ignorable, the fault was first injected into a neuron module and the test image set was applied. If the prediction accuracy of the test image set was within a certain threshold, the fault was considered unimportant, otherwise, it was a critical fault. However, the proposed simple approach of creating RTL of the full neural network, followed by gate-level synthesis and fault injection may not be scalable for mainstream CNNs [ref]44 such as AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, MobileNet, etc. that are used for real-world computer vision tasks of image recognition with many classes [ref]1. In  the authors first identified the location of faulty MACs (i.e., M‚ÄãA‚ÄãCi,jùëÄùê¥subscriptùê∂ùëñùëóMAC_{i,j}), in the TPU systolic array and then all weights that were mapped to those faulty MACs were pruned (i.e., ‚àÄwi,j=0for-allsubscriptùë§ùëñùëó0\\forall w_{i,j}=0,where i,jùëñùëói,j=location of faulty MAC), followed by retraining. Extra bypass MUX was required for each MAC to bypass it in case it was faulty. However, the major challenges of this approach are, (i) the pruning with retraining technique can preserve the model accuracy when only the small magnitude weights are pruned 4-. If a large magnitude weight is mapped to a faulty MAC, this method will result in accuracy degradation. (ii) Moreover, in modern AI/deep learning the models are already pruned 4- to reduce energy consumption and storage requirements, as a result further pruning of weights - corresponding to the faulty MACs - of an already pruned model will significantly reduce its accuracy. (iii) Another drawback of  is that weight pruning and retraining needs to be performed for each TPU chip based on its unique fault map and each individual workload. In contrast to permanent stuck-at faults, for low-energy operations where voltage is scaled down, possible timing  and memory errors  can also occur. However, by using appropriate PV guard-band, using circuits with shorter critical-paths and memory ECC these faults can be avoided.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: was a critical fault.
