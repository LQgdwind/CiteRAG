      "content": "Paper Title: Spatial-Aware Latent Initialization for Controllable Image Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCreating Spatial-Aware Initialization Noises. To cater to diverse textual prompts and position requirements, we develop a scalable framework to adapt our method to different scenarios. As shown in Fig. 5, we begin with a collected open-vocabulary dataset and employ a pre-trained object detector to extract the object mask m𝑚m for images from the dataset. Then, we select a background image from a predefined background set. By adhering to the provided layout conditions, we resize and position the object mask m𝑚m within the background image, resulting in a new image denoted by I∗superscript𝐼I^{*}. Following this operation, the positions of the main objects in the new image I∗superscript𝐼I^{*} align with the specified layout requirements. Subsequently, we utilize the DDIM inversion process described in Eq. (3) to transform I∗superscript𝐼I^{*} into a spatial-aware latent variable zT∗superscriptsubscript𝑧𝑇z_{T}^{*}. Notably, zT∗superscriptsubscript𝑧𝑇z_{T}^{*} effectively captures spatial information within the given bounding boxes. Therefore, instead of initializing the sampling process with a random noise zTsubscript𝑧𝑇z_{T}, we initiate it with the spatial-aware latent zT∗superscriptsubscript𝑧𝑇z_{T}^{*} to ensure that the target object appears at the desired position. In the following, we introduce an additional attention guidance during sampling to enhance layout control. Attention Guidance. Inspired by [ref]2, we employ cross-attention maps to guide the layout during the inference stage. Initially, attention maps Misubscript𝑀𝑖M_{i} are extracted for each object 𝒫isubscript𝒫𝑖\\mathcal{P}_{i}. The objective is to ensure that high attention values of Misubscript𝑀𝑖M_{i} are predominantly confined within the given bounding box bisubscript𝑏𝑖b_{i}. To achieve this, we adopt the following loss function to guide the layout: where Mp​isubscript𝑀𝑝𝑖M_{pi} defines the attention value of object 𝒫isubscript𝒫𝑖\\mathcal{P}_{i} on the p𝑝p-th pixel in the latent space, and λ𝜆\\lambda is a coefficient that balances the alignment and regularization term. Different from the alignment method proposed in [ref]2, we introduce a regularization term ∑p∼biMp​isubscriptsimilar-to𝑝subscript𝑏𝑖subscript𝑀𝑝𝑖\\sum_{p\\sim b_{i}}M_{pi} to the loss function to ensure that the generated objects are closer to the target positions. For the noisy latent zt∗superscriptsubscript𝑧𝑡z_{t}^{*} at sampling timestep t𝑡t, the loss function L𝐿L is first used to update the variable zt∗superscriptsubscript𝑧𝑡z_{t}^{*} as follows: where η𝜂\\eta is the learning rate. Subsequently, zt−1∗superscriptsubscript𝑧𝑡1z_{t-1}^{*} is recovered from zt∗superscriptsubscript𝑧𝑡z_{t}^{*} by incorporating the noise ϵ^θsubscript^bold-italic-ϵ𝜃\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}_{\\theta} estimated according to Eq. (4). A key distinction between our approach and the one proposed in [ref]2 lies in the choice of the initialization noise. While [ref]2 utilizes a random noise zTsubscript𝑧𝑇z_{T} as the starting point, we begin with the spatial-aware latent zT∗superscriptsubscript𝑧𝑇z_{T}^{*}.\nNote that this distinction helps accelerate the optimization process. Specifically, the method in [ref]2 requires 10 steps to achieve the desired layout control performance, whereas our approach typically achieves better results in just 1-3 steps, demonstrating superior efficiency in layout control. Plug-and-Play Module in Mask Guidance. The proposed spatial-aware initialization latent can be extended to other training-free layout guidance approaches. For instance, ZestGuide [ref]20 proposes leveraging segmentation masks as the layout condition to control the position. This approach is similar to [ref]2 in aiming to control the layout by aligning the cross-attention maps with the layout condition. Both of them face the challenges associated with the influence of initialization noise on spatial control performance. Thus, we can incorporate our spatial-aware latent initialization as a plug-and-play module into their frameworks.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: that the target object appears at the desired position.
