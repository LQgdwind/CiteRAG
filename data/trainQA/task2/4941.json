Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Facial Action Units Detection Aided by Global-Local Expression Embedding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe first compare our method with the state-of-the-art. The compared methods include LSVM , JPML , DRML , APL , EAC-Net , DSIN , ARL , SRERL [ref]20, ML-GCN [ref]6, MS-CAM , LP-Net , FACS3D-Net , UGN-B , JÂA-Net [ref]31, MHSA-FFN , SEV-Net , HMP-PS .\nFollowing the experimental settings of most previous works, we employ the F1 score  on the frame level as the evaluation metric. Evaluation on BP4D.\nThe results on BP4D are shown in Table 1. The average F1 score of our method is 65.7%, which outperforms all the competing methods. In terms of the performance on single AUs, our GLEE-Net achieves the highest or the second highest F1 score among all the methods on 9 of the 12 evaluated AUs. Compared to SEV-Net and JÂA-Net that employ textual embedding and facial landmarks as auxiliary training information, our method obtains better results with the compact expression embedding as prior knowledge. Our method also outperforms MHSA-FFN that also introduces Transformer into classifiers. Evaluation on DISFA.\nTable 2 shows the results on DISFA. The average F1 score of our method outperforms all the state-of-the-art methods. Compared to the most recent works SEV-Net, HMP-PS and MHSA-FFN, our method obtains the improvement of 11.4%, 7.4% and 6.5%, respectively. As the number of subjects in DISFA is smaller than that of BP4D, most of the previous methods suffer from overfitting to the appearance of training subjects more severely. Therefore, benefiting from our identity-independent expression representations, our method achieves an even more significant improvement. Evaluation on BP4D+.\nTable 3 shows the results of the three-fold cross validation on BP4D+. Results of the compared methods are reported by SEV-Net . Our method achieves the F1 score of 63.7% and outperforms all the state-of-the-art methods.\nTo further evaluate the generalization performance on large scale testing identities, we train our method on BP4D and evaluate it on the full BP4D+ of 140 subjects. The results are shown in Table 4. We use the reported results in the work [ref]31 for comparison. Again, our method outperforms all the compared methods under the large-scale cross-dataset evaluation. It proves that our method can extract identity-independent information and generalize well to new identities.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: We first compare our method with the state-of-the-art. The compared methods include LSVM , JPML , DRML , APL , EAC-Net , DSIN , ARL , SRERL [ref]20, ML-GCN [ref]6, MS-CAM , LP-Net , FACS3D-Net , UGN-B , JÂA-Net [ref]31, MHSA-FFN , SEV-Net , HMP-PS .\nFollowing the experimental settings of most previous works, we employ the F1 score  on\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
