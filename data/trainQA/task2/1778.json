      "content": "Paper Title: Embedding Transfer with Label Relaxation for Improved Metric Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep metric learning.\nDeep metric learning is an approach to learning embedding spaces using class labels.\nPrevious work in this field has developed loss functions for modeling inter-sample relations based on class labels and reflecting them on the learned embedding spaces.\nContrastive loss   pulls a pair of samples together if their class labels are the same and pushes them away otherwise.\nTriplet loss   takes a triplet of anchor, positive, and negative as input, and makes the anchor-positive distance smaller than the anchor-negative distance.\nThe idea of pushing and pulling a pair is extended to consider higher order relations in recently proposed losses   .\nMeanwhile, self-supervised representation learning\nhas been greatly advanced by leveraging pairwise relations between data as in deep metric learning.\nFor example, MoCo   and SimCLR \npull embedding vectors of the same image closer and push those of different images away.\nSince these approaches to learning embedding spaces demand binary relations, \\ie, the equality of classes or identities, they cannot be used directly for transferring knowledge of an embedding space that is not binary. Knowledge distillation.\nKnowledge distillation means a technique that transfers knowledge of a source model to a target model; embedding transfer can be regarded as its variant focusing on metric learning.\nA seminal work by Hinton et al.  achieves this goal by encouraging the target model to imitate class logits of the source model,\nand has been extended to transfer various types of knowledge of the source model [ref]36 6 1 .\nKnowledge distillation has been employed for various purposes including model compression  [ref]36 6 1, cross-modality learning 5, and network regularization 5 as well as performance improvement 1.\nIn terms of target task, however, it has been applied mostly to classification; only a few methods introduced in the next paragraph study transferring knowledge of embedding spaces, \\ie, embedding transfer. Embedding transfer.\nEarly approaches in this area extract and transfer the rank of similarities between samples  and probability distributions of their similarities  in the source embedding spaces.\nUnfortunately, these methods have trouble capturing elaborate relations between samples.\nOn the other hand, recently proposed methods utilize geometric relations between samples like distances and angles as the knowledge to take fine details of the source embedding space into account  4.\nHowever, they let the target model blindly accept the knowledge without considering the relative importance of samples, leading to less effective embedding transfer.\nOur method overcomes the aforementioned limitations: It makes use of rich pairwise similarities between samples as the knowledge, and can take relative importance of samples into account when transferring the knowledge.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: by Hinton et al.  achieves this goal by encouraging the target model to imitate class logits of the source model,\nand has been extended to transfer various types of knowledge of the source model [ref]36 6 1 .\nKnowledge distillation has been employed for various purposes including model compression  [ref]36 6 1, cross-modality learning 5, and network regularization 5 as well as performance\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
