      "content": "Paper Title: HYGENE: A Diffusion-based Hypergraph Generation Method\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph Generation Using Deep Learning.\nThe field of graph generation using deep learning models was pioneered by GraphVAE [ref]15.\nThis approach employs an autoencoder to embed graphs into a latent space, from which new graphs could be generated by sampling and decoding. Subsequently, [ref]16 significantly enhanced generation quality by utilizing a recurrent neural network to produce the adjacency matrix column-wise.\nRecent advancements include the work by , which formalized the generation process as an inverse discrete absorption.\nIn this method, nodes from a training graph are sequentially absorbed, and a mixture of multinomials is trained to predict the necessary edge additions when reintroducing a node.\nDiffusion models, which have shown remarkable success in image generation, were adapted for graph generation in [ref]22.\nThis approach was further refined by  and expanded in  by incorporating target degree distributions. A departure from typical methods in graph generation was proposed by .\nInstead of sequentially adding nodes and predicting their connections, this approach reverses a coarsening process.\nDuring training, graphs are reduced by merging nodes into clusters.\nThe model then learns to identify these clusters, decompose them, and reconstruct the original connections between their nodes.\nGraph generation begins with a single-node graph and progressively expands it using the trained model, mirroring the diffusion approaches seen in modern image generation techniques.\nSimilar hierarchical concepts have been explored in molecule generation, with  applying normalizing flows to this domain.\nRelated ideas can also be found in the work of . In contrast to previous work, we focus on the problem of hypergraph generation, which extends the concept of graph generation to higher-order structures.\nFurthermore, we employ a hierarchical view of the problem instead of the sequential edge-by-edge generation commonly employed.\nWe also depart from the classical view of edge prediction, where a model outputs the probability of existence for all possible edges, and, instead, predict both the number of hyperedges and their composition.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: Graph Generation Using Deep Learning.\nThe field of graph generation using deep learning models was pioneered by GraphVAE [ref]15.\nThis approach employs an autoencoder to embed graphs into a latent space, from which new graphs could be generated by sampling and decoding.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
