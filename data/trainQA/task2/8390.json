      "content": "Paper Title: SuperGaussians: Enhancing Gaussian Splatting Using Primitives with Spatially Varying Colors\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNovel-view synthesis (NVS) has always been an important task in computer graphics and computer vision, with various applications in robotics, AR/VR, and autonomous driving.\nCompared with neural radiance fields (NeRF) -based methods, recent Gaussian splatting methods   directly reconstruct 3D scenes by splatting explicit Gaussian primitives like ellipsoids  or surfels , achieving significant progress in novel view synthesis and geometric reconstruction. Though impressive NVS quality has been achieved by these Gaussian splatting-based methods, these methods are ineffective and non-compact in representing a complex scene.\nIn these methods, the input images are fitted by splatting a set of Gaussian primitives. Each primitive only has a single view-dependent color and an opacity to represent the appearance and geometry of the scene. However, when the scene has complex geometry and appearance, these methods have to create a large number of these simple Gaussians to approximate the spatially varying opacity and textures on the scene, which leads to a huge waste of Gaussians. An example is shown in the right bottom of Fig. 1, where our target is to fit a round plane with four different colors, while the original 2DGS  or 3DGS  all fail to reconstruct the colors and opacity of this simple shape by using one Gaussian primitive. To address this problem, we introduce a new method called SuperGaussians that utilizes spatially varying colors and opacity in a single Gaussian primitive to improve its representation ability.\nThis spatially varying attribute means that different rays that intersect the same Gaussian primitive may have different colors if these rays intersect the Gaussian at different locations. In the vanilla Gaussian Splatting, Gaussian primitives always have the same opacity or view-dependent colors for all rays while our spatially varying Gaussians show different colors for different intersection points.\nThis makes a single Gaussian more capable of fitting complex textures and geometry in the scene, increasing representation ability and making our representation more compact and effective, as shown in Fig. 1. To define the spatially varying function inside a Gaussian primitive, we try three different designs.\nAs shown in Fig. 2, all three spatially varying functions are implemented based on Gaussian surfels .\nThe first function divides each Gaussian surfel into four quadrants using bilinear interpolation, assigning a learnable color and opacity value to each quadrant, which enhances color expression but may cause gradient vanishing issues (See Fig. 3 (a)).\nIn the second design, we define four movable kernels based on the original Gaussian surfel, providing higher flexibility and stronger expressiveness, as shown in Fig. 3 (b).\nThird, we apply a tiny three-layer neural network on each Gaussian surfel that can return a color and opacity value for any intersection point on the surfel. Such neural network-based representation shows strong representation ability but with significantly more parameters than the other two functions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SuperGaussians, we conduct experiments on the Synthetic Blender , DTU [ref]13, Mip-NeRF360 [ref]3, and Tanks&Temples  datasets to validate all three designs.\nExperimental results demonstrate that all three spatially varying functions outperform the baseline method 2DGS  in novel view synthesis, while the compact movable kernels design achieves the best results.\nMoreover, SuperGaussians with movable kernels surpasses all other Gaussian Splatting-based methods on almost all datasets.\nWe further demonstrate the compactness of SuperGaussians by using a limited number of Gaussian primitives to achieve superior rendering quality.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: representation ability but with significantly more parameters than the other two functions.
