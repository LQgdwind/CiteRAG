      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Code Summarization with Block-wise Abstract Syntax Tree Splitting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo answer RQ1, we compare BASTS with seven state-of-the-art methods: CODE-NN999https://github.com/sriniiyer/codenn [ref]19 uses LSTM and a global attention mechanism in the seq2seq framework. Hybrid-DRL101010https://github.com/wanyao1992/code_summarization_public  applies an actor-critic network. The actor network produces the hidden space. The critic network adopts BLEU as the reward function. Hybrid-DeepCom111111https://github.com/xing-hu/EMSE-DeepCom  uses GRU to build a code encoder for code tokens, and an AST encoder for serialized ASTs from SBT.\nA hybrid attention component fuses the lexical and syntactical information. AST-attendgru121212https://bit.ly/2MLSxFg  applies two GRU encoders on code sequences and serialized ASTs from SBT. A different attention mechanism compared to Hybrid-DeepCom is used for information fusion. ASTNN131313https://github.com/zhangj111/astnn  splits an AST into a sequence of statement trees. Statement trees are encoded by an RvNN based encoder. The learned sequence of statement tree representations are fed into GRU to generate the representation of the original code for code classification and clone detection. For a fair comparison, we feed the code representation learned by ASTNN into Eq. 4 for code summarization, and other components are the same as BASTS. Transformer141414https://github.com/wasiahmad/NeuralCodeSum  employs the Transformer model  in code summarization task. Rencos151515https://github.com/zhangj111/rencos  retrieves two code snippets that are most similar to the input code snippet. Then, it encodes the input and two retrieved code snippets, and generates the summary by fusing them during decoding. We use the default hyper-parameter settings provided by each method. Following Hu et al. , we set maximal code length to 100100100, maximal comment length to 303030, and maximal epochs to 505050 for all methods (we also report the impact of different code/comment lengths in Sec. VI-D).\nWe use 512 as the embedding size and 128 as the batch size. The exception is that we use the batch size 64 for ASTNN since ASTNN with the batch size 128 will encounter out-of-memory error. For a fair comparison, we also compare ASTNN with BASTS when both methods are trained with the batch size 64 in Sec. VI-C. We use 8 heads in Transformer and BASTS.\nWe adopt greedy search for AST-attendgru and Hybrid-DRL, following their original design. We use beam search with beam size 555 for CODE-NN and Hybrid-DeepCom, as mentioned in their papers. For BASTS, greedy search is used for simplicity. We adopt adam [ref]29 for optimization. Tab. 2 and Tab. 3 report the results on two datasets. Note that the authors of ASTNN do not provide the implementation for splitting python code using their method. Hence we only evaluate ASTNN on Java dataset. From the results, we can observe that BASTS is robustly better than state-of-the-art competitors. In most cases, BASTS exceeds baselines by more than 10% in terms of all measures. As pointed out by Gros et al. [ref]27, existing neural code summarization methods may not indeed surpass traditional retrieval-based methods. Therefore, we compare BASTS with Rencos which combines the merits of both retrieval-based and neural network-based methods. From Tab. 2 and Tab. 3, we can see that BASTS has better performance than Rencos in almost all cases, showing that BASTS is better than the retrieval-based model.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: To answer RQ1, we compare BASTS with seven state-of-the-art methods: CODE-NN999https://github.com/sriniiyer/codenn [ref]19 uses LSTM and a global attention mechanism in the seq2seq framework.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
