      "content": "Paper Title: Training Subset Selection for Weak Supervision\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDue to the difficulty of hand-labeling large amounts of training data, an\nincreasing share of models are trained with weak supervision\n1 . Weak supervision uses expert-defined\n‚Äúlabeling functions‚Äù to programatically label a large amount of training data\nwith minimal human effort. This pseudo-labeled training data is\nused to train a classifier (e.g., a deep neural network) as if it were\nhand-labeled data. Labeling functions are often simple, coarse rules, so the pseudolabels derived from them are not always correct.\nThere is an intuitive tradeoff between the\ncoverage of the pseudolabels (how much pseudolabeled data do we\nuse for training?) and the precision on the covered set (how accurate are\nthe pseudolabels that we do use?).\nUsing all the pseudolabeled training data ensures the best possible generalization to the population pseudolabeling function Y^‚Äã(X)^ùëåùëã\\hat{Y}(X).\nOn the other hand, if we can select a high-quality subset of the pseudolabeled\ndata, then our training labels Y^‚Äã(X)^ùëåùëã\\hat{Y}(X) are closer to the true label YùëåY,\nbut the smaller training set may hurt generalization.\nHowever, existing weak supervision approaches such as Snorkel , MeTaL , FlyingSquid [ref]10, and Adversarial Label Learning\n use all of the pseudolabeled data to train\nthe classifier, and do not explore this tradeoff. We present numerical experiments demonstrating that the status quo of using all\nthe pseudolabeled data is nearly always suboptimal.\nCombining good pretrained representations with the cut statistic\n for subset selection, we obtain subsets of the weakly-labeled training data where the weak labels are very accurate.\nBy choosing examples with the same pseudolabel as many of their nearest neighbors in the representation, the cut statistic uses the representation‚Äôs geometry to identify these accurate subsets without using any ground-truth labels.\nUsing the smaller but higher-quality training sets selected by the cut statistic improves the accuracy of\nweak supervision pipelines by up to 19% accuracy (absolute).\nSubset selection applies to any ‚Äúlabel model‚Äù (Snorkel, FlyingSquid,\nmajority vote, etc.) and any classifier, since it is a modular, intermediate\nstep between creation of the pseudolabeled training set and training.\nWe conclude with a theoretical analysis of a special case of\nweak supervision where the precision/coverage tradeoff can be made precise.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: labels Y^‚Äã(X)^ùëåùëã\\hat{Y}(X) are closer to the true label YùëåY,\nbut the smaller training set may hurt generalization.\nHowever, existing weak supervision approaches such as Snorkel , MeTaL , FlyingSquid [ref]10, and Adversarial Label Learning\n use all of the pseudolabeled data to train\nthe classifier, and do not explore this tradeoff.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
