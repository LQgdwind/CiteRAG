      "content": "Paper Title: Disjoint Projected Enumeration for SAT and SMT without Blocking Clauses\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe work in [ref]17 exclusively describes the calculus and a formal proof of correctness for a model counting\nframework on top of CDCL and CB, with neither any algorithm nor any reference in modern state-of-the-art solvers. To this extent, we\nstart by presenting an AllSAT procedure for the search algorithm combining the two techniques, which are reported in this section. In particular, we highlight the major differences to a classical AllSAT solver implemented on top of CDCL and NBC. Alg. 1 presents the main search loop of the AllSAT algorithm.\n(In Alg. 1 the reader is supposed to ignore the blue lines from 8 to 11, which refer to the SMT version of the algorithm and which will be illustrated in ¬ß6.) The goal is to find a total trail T that satisfies FùêπF. At each decision level, it iteratively decides one of the unassigned variables in FùêπF and assigns a truth value (Alg. 1, lines 15-16); it then performs unit propagation\n(Alg. 1, line 4) until either a conflict is reached (Alg. 1, lines 5-11), or no other variable can be\nunit propagated leading to a satisfying total assignment (Alg. 1, lines 7-13) or Decide has to be called again (Alg. 1, lines 15-16). Notice that the main loop is identical to an AllSAT solver based on non-chronological CDCL; the only differences are embedded in the procedure to get the conflict and the partial assignments. (From now on, we color in red the lines that differ from the baseline CDCL AllSAT solver.) Suppose UnitPropagation finds a conflict, returning one clause cùëêc in FùêπF which is falsified by the current trail T, so that we invoke AnalyzeConflict. Alg. 2 shows the procedure to either generate the conflict clause or stop the search for new assignments if all models have been found. We first compute the maximum assignment level of all literals in the conflicting clause cùëêc and\nbacktrack to that decision level (Alg. 2, lines 1-2) if strictly smaller than d‚Äãlùëëùëôdl. This additional step, not contemplated by AllSAT solvers that use NCB, is necessary to support out-of-order\nassignments, the core insight in chronological backtracking when integrated into CDCL as described in . Apart from this first step, Alg. 2 behaves similarly to a standard conflict analysis algorithm. If the solver\nreaches decision level 0 at this point, it means there are no more variables to flip and the whole search space has been visited,\nand we can terminate the algorithm (Alg. 2, lines 4-5). Otherwise, we perform conflict analysis up to the last Unique Implication Point (last UIP, i.e. the decision variable at the current decision level), retrieving the conflict clause c‚Ä≤superscriptùëê‚Ä≤c^{\\prime} (Alg. 2, line 7),\nas proposed in¬†[ref]17. Finally, we perform backtracking (notice how we force chronological backtracking independently from the decision level of the conflict clause), push the flipped UIP into the trail, and set c‚Ä≤superscriptùëê‚Ä≤c^{\\prime} as its assignment reason for the flipping (Alg. 2, lines 8-11). Suppose instead that every variable is assigned a truth value without generating conflicts (Alg. 1, line 7); then\nthe current total trail T satisfies FùêπF, and we invoke AnalyzeAssignment. Alg. 3 shows the steps to possibly shrink the assignment, store it and continue the search. First, Implicant-Shrinking checks if, for some decision level d‚Äãl‚Ä≤ùëësuperscriptùëô‚Ä≤dl^{\\prime}, we can backtrack up to d‚Äãl‚Ä≤<d‚Äãlùëësuperscriptùëô‚Ä≤ùëëùëôdl^{\\prime}<dl and obtain a partial trail still satisfying the formula (Alg. 3, lines 1-3).\n(We discuss the details of chronological implicant shrinking in the next subsection.)\nWe can produce the current assignment from the current trail T (Alg. 3, line 5). Then we check if all variables in T are assigned at decision level 00.\nIf this is the case, then this means that we found the last assignment to cover FùêπF, so that we can end the search (Alg. 3, lines 6-7). Otherwise, we perform chronological backtracking, flipping the truth value of the currently highest decision variables and searching for a new total trail T satisfying FùêπF (Alg. 3, lines 9-13). We remark that in\n[ref]17 it is implicitly assumed that one can determine if a partial trail satisfies the formula right after being generated, whereas modern SAT\nsolvers cannot check this fact efficiently, and\ndetect satisfaction only when trails are total. To cope with this issue, in our approach the\npartial trail satisfying the formula is computed a posteriori from the total one by implicant shrinking. Moreover, the mutual exclusivity among different assignments is guaranteed, since the shrinking of the assignments is performed so that the generated partial assignments fall under the conditions of Section 3 in [ref]17). Notice that the calculus discussed in [ref]17 assumes the last UIP is the termination criteria for the conflict analysis. We provide the following counter-example to\nshow that the first UIP does not guarantee mutual exclusivity between returned assignments. Let FùêπF be the propositional formula: For the sake of simplicity, we assume Chrono-CDCL to return total truth assignments. If the initial variable ordering\nis x3,x2,x1subscriptùë•3subscriptùë•2subscriptùë•1x_{3},x_{2},x_{1} (all set to false) then the first two total and the third partial trails generated by Algorithm 1 are: Notice how T3subscriptùëá3T_{3} leads to a falsifying assignment: x2subscriptùë•2x_{2} forces x1subscriptùë•1x_{1} due to c1subscriptùëê1c_{1} and ¬¨x1subscriptùë•1\\neg x_{1} due to c3subscriptùëê3c_{3} at the same time. A\nconflict arises and we adopt the first UIP algorithm to stop conflict analysis. We identify x2subscriptùë•2x_{2} as the first unique implication point (UIP) and construct the conflict clause ¬¨x2subscriptùë•2\\neg x_{2}. Since this is a unit clause, we force its negation ¬¨x2subscriptùë•2\\neg x_{2} as an initial unit. We can now set x3subscriptùë•3x_{3} and x1subscriptùë•1x_{1} to ‚üÇperpendicular-to\\perp and obtain a satisfying assignment. The resulting total trail T=¬¨x3‚Äã¬¨x2‚Äã¬¨x1ùëásubscriptùë•3subscriptùë•2subscriptùë•1T=\\neg x_{3}\\neg x_{2}\\neg x_{1} is covered twice during the search process.\n‚ãÑ‚ãÑ\\hfill\\diamond We also emphasize that the incorporation of restarts in the search algorithm (or any method that implicitly exploits restarts, such as rephasing) is not feasible, as reported in [ref]17.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: The work in [ref]17 exclusively describes the calculus and a formal proof of correctness for a model counting\nframework on top of CDCL and CB, with neither any algorithm nor any reference in modern\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
