      "content": "Paper Title: Fast and scalable neuroevolution deep learning architecture search for multivariate anomaly detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we analyze anomaly detection methods for multivariate time-series data, as well as neuroevolution methods that are most relevant for our research scope.\nRecent surveys on general anomaly detection , deep learning based anomaly detection ,  and unsupervised time-series anomaly detection  present techniques relevant to unsupervised and semi-supervised multivariate time series anomaly detection.\nAutoencoder-based methods include fully-connected auto-encoder (FC AE),\nUSAD , and UAE .\nLSTM-based methods include NASA-LSTM , LSTM-AE  (which is based on ), and LSTM-VAE .\nCNN-based methods include temporal convolutional AE (TCN AE) 7.\nGAN-based methods include OCAN 8, and BeatGAN [ref]7. Graph neural network-based approaches include .\nFinally, hybrid approaches include MSCRED , DAGMM 0, and OmniAnomaly 1. Regarding autoencoder-based approaches, the FC AE model introduced in  is similar to UAE, but it involves a single model over all the features, where the input sample is a vector resulting from the concatenation of time steps observed for all sensors. The USAD model is an auto-encoder with an additional discriminator model and loss extensions to boost the final scores.\nIn  authors present comparative studies on multivariate anomaly detection models. They describe Univariate fully-connected Auto-Encoder (UAE) as a model consisting of multiple auto-encoders, each connected by its input to a separate feature. Each encoder is a multi-layer perceptron with a number of nodes corresponding to the number of time steps (window size), and a reduced number of dimensions in the latent space by a factor of 2. The decoder is a mirror image of the encoder with t‚Äãa‚Äãn‚Äãhùë°ùëéùëõ‚Ñétanh activation.\nThe resulting ensemble model outperforms many other deep learning architectures. Focusing on LSTM-based approaches, NASA LSTM is a 2-layer LSTM model that uses predictability modeling, i.e., forecasting for anomaly detection . The LSTM-AE presented in  consists of single LSTM layer for each encoder and decoder. LSTM-VAE 2 models the data generating process from the latent space to the observed space using variational techniques. The CNN-based approach of temporal convolutional network AE (TCN AE) described in  is an architecture in which the encoder is built from a stack of temporal convolution (TCN) 7 residual blocks. In the decoder, convolutions in the TCN residual blocks are replaced with transpose convolutions. The study shows that the scoring function has a significant impact on the point-wise f1-score. GAN-based methods include OCAN 8, an end-to-end one-class classification method in which the generator is trained to produce examples that are complimentary to normal data patterns, which is used to train a discriminator for anomaly detection using the GAN framework. BeatGAN [ref]7 uses a Generative Adversarial Network framework where reconstructions produced by the generator are regularized by the discriminator instead of fixed reconstruction loss functions. The dense graph neural network approach presented in  models the anomaly detection problem as a graph neural network, where each node represents a single feature, and edges allow to represent data exchanged between different nodes. The graph-based modeling capabilities represent a distinctive trait of this method, and were shown to yield a significant performance boost other state-of-the-art methods with very well known multivariate time series datasets. Hybrid methods such as MSCRED  learn to reconstruct signature matrices, i.e. matrices representing cross-correlation relationships between channels constructed by pairwise inner product of the channels. It is efficient in the case of long-term anomalies that are significantly out of the normal data distribution. Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model 0 uses a deep autoencoder to generate a low-dimensional representation and reconstruction error for each input data point. The output of the autoencoder is further fed into a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). DAGMM jointly optimizes the parameters of the deep autoencoder and the mixture model in an end-to-end fashion. The joint optimization balances autoencoding reconstruction and density estimation of latent representation. The proposed regularization helps the autoencoder escape from less attractive local optima and further reduce reconstruction errors. OmniAnomaly 1 is a stochastic recurrent neural network for multivariate time series. Its main idea is to capture the normal patterns of multivariate time series by learning their robust representations with key techniques such as stochastic variable connection and planar normalizing flow. Then, it reconstructs input data and uses the reconstruction probabilities to determine anomalies.\nOne common drawback of these methods is that they do not perform automatic model optimization, and therefore require a significant manual effort to identify and tune the right architecture for the right domain and dataset. This limitation may be solved by neuroevolution approaches, which have recently been used in many machine learning tasks for improving the accuracy of deep learning models and finding optimal network topologies 3, 4, 5 and 6. The authors in  show that a two-level neuroevolution strategy scheme can outperform human-designed models in some specific tasks e.g. language modeling and image classification. This strategy is based on the co-deep NEAT algorithm with two optimisation levels: single sub-block optimisation and composition of sub-blocks to form a whole network. In 6, a novel deep reinforcement learning-based framework is proposed for electrocardiogram time-series signal. The framework is optimized by neuroevolution algorithm. The authors in 5 present the framework of the self-organizing map-based neuroevolution solver by which the SOM-like network represents the abstract carpool service problem. The self organizing map network is trained by using neural learning and evolutionary mechanism. In 4 the novel neuroevolution approach is described. The algorithm is incorporated with powerful representation which unifies most of the neural networks into one representation and with new diversity preserving method called spectrum diversity. The combination of spectrum diversity with a unified neuron representation enables the algorithm to either outperform or have similar performance with NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) on five classes of problems tested. Ablation tests show the importance of new added features in the unified neuron representation.\nIn 7 a novel neuroevolutionary method for optimization the architecture and hyperparameters of convolutional autoencoders. The hypervolume indicator in the context of neural architecture search is introduced. Results show that images can be compressed by a factor of more than 10, while still retaining enough information. In 8 it is shown that genetic algorithm could evolve autoencoders that can reproduce the data better as the manually created autoencoders with more hidden units. The experiments were performed on the MNIST dataset. The first approach of co-evolutionary neuroevolution-based multivariate anomaly detection system is presented in .\nHowever, one substantial limitation is that optimization of subspaces and models occur separately, so that one model is optimized for all subspaces. This characteristic limits the capability of the neuroevolution process to optimize the model for each specific subspace, forcing the model to compromise in order to handle all subspaces simultaneously, and potentially resulting in a loss of anomaly detection accuracy. Moreover, the proposed method does not provide fine-tuning capabilities, which would provide the opportunity to further optimize the model and improve anomaly detection performance.\nFine-tuning is a quite popular technique for improving the accuracy of the pre-trained models. The most popular technique is gradient-based fine-tuning 9, 0. The non-gradient approach is quite rare but can yield significant improvements as shown in 1. The presented method improves the accuracy of pretrained quantised models.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: .\nLSTM-based methods include NASA-LSTM , LSTM-AE  (which is based on ), and LSTM-VAE .\nCNN-based methods include temporal convolutional AE (TCN AE) 7.\nGAN-based methods include OCAN 8, and BeatGAN [ref]7.
