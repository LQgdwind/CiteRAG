      "content": "Paper Title: Sim-Suction: Learning a Suction Grasp Policy for Cluttered Environments Using a Synthetic Benchmark\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe development of autonomous mobile manipulation platforms is crucial for the future of space habitats, where robots can perform various tasks in cluttered environments with minimal human intervention. In these habitats, tasks such as maintenance, cargo handling, and assembly of structures have unique challenges for grasping and manipulation due to confined spaces, limited resources, and the need to handle objects with diverse shapes, sizes, and materials. Furthermore, space habitats often contain cluttered environments with objects that may be partially occluded or challenging to access. While space habitats represent a vital application area, mobile manipulation platforms also play an essential role in industry 4.0 and household settings due to their flexibility and efficiency. However, humans expect mobile manipulation platforms to be fully autonomous without any intervention. This is challenging for manipulation tasks, where robots have trivial or no pre-existing knowledge, unlike tasks on a predictable assembly line under controlled conditions. For example, typical dynamic manipulation tasks may include picking objects from a bin, cleaning a cluttered workbench, or retrieving products from a shelf. These tasks are challenging for mobile manipulation platforms, both in terms of identifying the grasp region and executing the mechanical grasping process. Unlike familiar objects, novel objects are items that the robot has never encountered before, hence, no prior information about their shape, size, weight, texture, and other physical properties is available. To solve these tasks, mobile manipulation platforms require the ability to observe the cluttered environments, decide on the way to grasp the object of interest, and perform a robust grasp once found. This is a difficult task due to the challenges associated with where to grasp and the uncertainties on how objects with varying size, weight, shape, and texture will react when trying to establish grasp contact point. The mobile manipulation platforms need to understand the task requirements that humans give and make the right decisions in such settings. Our work in this paper aims to tackle the picking-up challenges by using text prompts to guide the robot in completing tasks such as picking up all novel objects from a bin or selecting specific novel objects from the bin based on a brief text description. Suction cup grippers play a vital role in warehouses due to their simplicity, compactness, light weight, and minimal maintenance requirements. They can also handle a wide range of objects, from fragile parts to large dimension objects. The Amazon Picking Challenge showed that the suction cup gripper is commonly used for general picking tasks with a higher success rate than other grippers . Experiments from DexNet 4.0  also demonstrate the preference for choosing a suction gripper over a parallel jaw gripper, with an 82% selecting rate on the bin-picking task. Previous studies show that the suction cup gripper outperforms other grippers in successfully grasping objects from cluttered environments due to its ability to create a single contact point on the object surface through a narrow space. Suction grippers are particularly suited for handling objects in space habitats with various surface properties, as they can establish a secure grip on a wide range of materials without causing damage. This is particularly important for delicate equipment and components that require gentle handling and precise placement. Our previous work designed a modular end-effector system , which enables a mobile manipulation platform to use a suction cup gripper more efficiently with an embedded vacuum generator and control module. In this work, we focus on developing the suction grasping policy for mobile manipulation platforms to tackle the challenge of grasping objects from a cluttered environment. In the grasping research community, a large number of studies pay particular attention to the parallel-jaw gripper grasping policy. At the same time, a relatively small body of literature is concerned with the suction grasping policy. Studies on suction grasping[ref]4 [ref]5 [ref]6  have begun to examine the data-driven approaches  0 1 using deep learning and achieve better performances over traditional online heuristic baseline approaches. The data-driven approaches can be classified into training on realistic datasets [ref]5,[ref]6 and training on synthetic datasets [ref]4. The key problem of realistic datasets collected from human or real experiments2 is that the time cost to retrieve object information is large3. It is also difficult to get object instance masks and their 6D pose information due to occlusion. Therefore realistic datasets are usually small in size and have sparse information. The human labeling process [ref]5 is another potential concern because it is hard to generalize to other systems, and the accuracy of annotating suction grasp poses as ground truth is questionable. More recent training on synthetic dataset approaches can help reduce the cost of data collection but still have limitations regarding the analytical model accuracy, domain gap, fixed vision system, neglecting objects and suction cup gripper dynamics, and insufficient information on cluttered environments. Furthermore, different neural network-based learning methods  [ref]4 [ref]5 [ref]6 4 5 for suction cup grippers have been proposed to predict the grasp success using pixel-wise affordance with RGB or depth inputs. These 2D affordance methods rely on images that experience some issues with generalization to unseen objects. Learning on 3D point clouds provides better generalization 6 for novel objects. However, to our knowledge, no study on suction cup grasp success prediction uses object-aware point-wise affordance, which directly takes the 3D point cloud and text prompt as input and generates robust 6D suction grasp poses for object instances. Additionally, the current evaluation metrics ,[ref]5 for suction grasp prediction precision by comparing the pre-annotated suction grasp ground truth with the prediction result, suffer from the fact that the pre-annotated suction grasp dataset can only include a subset of all possible candidates depending on the sampling number, due to the nature of infinite suction grasp poses existing in every cluttered environments7. Together, these limitations demand a universal, accurate, and efficient dataset generation process and network architecture and evaluation metrics, which can serve as a benchmark for developing suction grasp policies. In this paper, we propose Sim-Suction, a deep learning-based system that uses a suction cup gripper to pick up novel objects from cluttered environments (Fig. 1). It consists of two components: (1) Sim-Suction-Dataset: a large-scale synthetic dataset for cluttered environments, and (2) Sim-Suction-Pointnet: an object-aware point-wise affordance policy that predicts the most robust suction grasp pose for the target object. The primary contributions of our work include: A large-scale synthetic dataset for cluttered environments that include RGB images, depth information, single-viewed point clouds, multi-viewed point clouds, object instance segmentation masks, 6D object poses, 2D object bounding boxes, 6D object bounding boxes, camera matrices, 6D suction grasp poses, and 3D suction grasp score maps. A suction grasp candidate evaluation process that integrates an analytical model and simulation, assessing object collision, seal formation, suction cup gripper dynamics, and multi-body rigid dynamics in cluttered environments. Physical robot experiments validating the Sim-Suction analytical suction model and comparing it with the DexNet model. A novel point-wise affordance network that trains on point clouds and annotated 3D suction grasp score map, which outputs point-wise suction grasp success probability. An online evaluation metric capable of assessing the precision of suction grasp predictions across different benchmarks. A thorough ablation study examining the effectiveness of the Sim-Suction-Dataset diversity and Sim-Suction-Pointnet architecture. Simulation and physical robot experiments quantifying the Sim-Suction-Pointnet suction grasp success rate without prior knowledge of objects in cluttered environments.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: particular attention to the parallel-jaw gripper grasping policy.
