It is the task of the agent to learn the value function V𝑉V from experience (by interacting with the environment). In order to do so, it usually performs multiple self-play training episodes until a certain training budget is exhausted or a certain game-playing strength is reached. Our base RL algorithm TD-FARL is described in detail in   and is partly inspired by Jaskowski et al. , van der Ree et al.  and partly by our own experience with RL-n-tuple training. The key elements of the new RL-logic – as opposed to our previous RL algorithms   – are n-tuple systems, temporal coherence learning (TCL)  and final adaptation RL (FARL)  . All these key elements will be briefly described in Sec. II-C, II-D and II-E. Despite being successful on a variety of games  , this base algorithm shares one disadvantage with other deep learning algorithms that are only value-based: they base their decision on the value of the current state-action pairs. They have no planning component, no what-if scenarios to think about further consequences, like possible counter-actions of the other player(s), further own actions and so on. This is where AlphaZero’s MCTS-trick\ncomes into play: Silver et al.  [ref]2 combine a deep learning RL agent with an MCTS wrapper (Fig. 1) to introduce such a planning component. They do this throughout the whole training procedure,\nwhich is better for the overall performance but also very computationally demanding. In this work, we take a simpler approach: we first train our RL agent, a TD n-tuple network, and then use the MCTS wrapping only at test time (i. e. during game play). This usage of MCTS adds a form of planning at test time.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: to think about further consequences, like possible counter-actions of the other player(s), further own actions and so on.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
