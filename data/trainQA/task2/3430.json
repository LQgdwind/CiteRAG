      "content": "Paper Title: A Robot Web for Distributed Many-Device Localisation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile the focus of the paper is on distributed localisation using range-bearing sensor measurements, the fact that our method operates on an arbitrary factor graph enables the framework to work with different sensor modalities, for instance, inter-robot 𝐒𝐄​(3)𝐒𝐄3\\mathbf{SE}(3) transformation, often used in distributed pose-graph optimisation (PGO). Here, we solve the following problem: where ε𝜀\\varepsilon is a set of all measurements, 𝚁isubscript𝚁𝑖{{\\mathtt{R}}}_{i} is a rotation variable, 𝐭isubscript𝐭𝑖{{\\mathbf{t}}}_{i} is a translation variable, 𝚁i,jzsubscriptsuperscript𝚁𝑧𝑖𝑗{{\\mathtt{R}}}^{z}_{i,j} is the measured rotation from i𝑖i to j𝑗j and similarly 𝐭i,jzsubscriptsuperscript𝐭𝑧𝑖𝑗{{\\mathbf{t}}}^{z}_{i,j} is the measured translation from i𝑖i to j𝑗j.\nτi​j,κi​jsubscript𝜏𝑖𝑗subscript𝜅𝑖𝑗\\tau_{ij},\\kappa_{ij} are the noise parameter computed from the dataset as done in   . The main complexities of PGO lie in how we handle poor initialisation. As the optimisation problem is non-convex, there exist many local minima. If we directly solve Equation (77), we will get stuck in a local minimum, even with small noise .\nFollowing [ref]13, we thus solve a relaxed, linear problem in two stages in a distributed manner.\nFirst, we solve the rotation problem: We solve the quadratic relaxation of this problem, by dropping the 𝐒𝐎​(3)𝐒𝐎3\\mathbf{SO}(3) constraint and then projecting the solution back to 𝐒𝐎​(3)𝐒𝐎3\\mathbf{SO}(3) via SVD. We then solve for the full pose using a linear approximation of rotation perturbation: where Exp~​(θ)=𝙸3+𝚂​(θ)~Exp𝜃subscript𝙸3𝚂𝜃\\tilde{\\operatorname{Exp}}(\\theta)={{\\mathtt{I}}}_{3}+{{\\mathtt{S}}}(\\theta), and 𝚂​(θ)𝚂𝜃{{\\mathtt{S}}}(\\theta) is a skew symmetric matrix. In [ref]13, Equation (78), and (79) is solved using distributed Block Gauss-Seidel (DGS) or distributed Block Jacobi method.\nHere, we compare GBP and DGS for solving the two-stage PGO problem. We compare against DGS as it is used as an initialisation for other works  [ref]49, and relaxation is simple to perform with the factor graph framework.\nIn our evaluation, we report the initial and final cost and the number of iterations required to satisfy the termination condition. We evaluate the trajectories on pose-graph optimisation dataset . Each trajectory is split into 50 segments to simulate a multi-robot pose-graph. The setup of our evaluation favours the DGS. We count one iteration as a full DGS sweep, where the robots sequentially send the updated information to the next robots in a specific order. GBP on the contrary is robot-wise parallel and does not require coordinated updates.\nHence, the communication pattern of GBP is closer to the distributed Block Jacobi method rather than DGS. Furthermore, we enable flagged initialisation for both DGS and distributed Block Jacobi method.\nFor all methods, we terminate the iterations once the norm of the change in the rotation or the pose is below a specified threshold. Here, we use 10−2superscript10210^{-2} as the threshold for both the rotation and the pose update, for all of our distributed solvers as recommended in [ref]13. Furthermore, for DGS and distributed Block Jacobi, we use the recommended relaxation parameter of 1.0 which we too found to work the best.\nWe allow all the solvers to run for up to 10000 iterations. As shown in Table IV, GBP performs comparable to DGS and obtains cost close to the centralised Gauss-Netwon solver, though the setup favours DGS, and DGS has distributed pose-graph specific heuristics such as flagged initialisation. Compared to the distributed Block Jacobi method which has a similar communication pattern as GBP, GBP performs significantly better, both in terms of final cost and the number of iterations.\nThis result highlights the generality of GBP and makes GBP a promising alternative to the existing distributed solvers.\nDevising a fair and complete evaluation of different distributed solvers is an interesting direction for future work.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: initialisation.
