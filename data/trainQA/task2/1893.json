      "content": "Paper Title: Contrastive Learning for Compact Single Image Dehazing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nResults on Synthetic Dataset.\nIn Table 1, we summarize the performance of our AECR-Net and SOTA methods on RESIDE dataset  (a.k.a, SOTS). Our AECR-Net achieves the best performance with 37.17dB PSNR and 0.9901 SSIM, compared to SOTA methods. In particular, compared to FFA-Net  with the second top performance, our AECR-Net achieves 0.78dB PSNR and 0.0015 SSIM performance gains with the significant reduction of 2M parameters. We also compare our AECR-Net with SOTA methods on the quality of the restored images, which is shown in Fig. 6. We can observe that DCP 7 and DehazeNet [ref]5 and AOD-Net  cannot successfully remove dense haze, and suffer from the color distortion (see Fig. 6(b)-6(d)). Compared to DCP, DehazeNet and AOD-Net, the hazy-to-clear image translation based methods in an end-to-end manner (e.g. GridDehazeNet , FFA-Net , MSBDN  and KDDN 3) achieve the restored images with higher quality. However, they still generate some gray mottled artifacts as shown in Fig. 6(e)-6(f) and cannot completely remove the haze in some regions (see the red rectangles of Fig. 6(g)-6(h)). Our method generates the most natural images and achieves the similar patterns to the ground-truth both in low and high frequency regions. More examples can be found in the supplementary. Results on Real-world Datasets.\nWe also compare our AECR-Net with SOTA methods on Dense-Haze  and NH-HAZE  datasets.\nAs shown in Table 1, we can observe: (1) Our AECR-Net outperforms all SOTA methods with 19.88dB PSNR and 0.7173 SSIM on NH-HAZE dataset.\n(2) Our AECR-Net also achieves the highest PSNR of 15.80dB, compared to SOTA methods. Note that MSBDN achieves only about 0.02 higher SSIM, but with 12Ã—\\times parameters, compared to our AECR-Net. (3) Compared to RESIDE dataset, Dense-Haze and NH-HAZE dataset are more difficult to remove the haze, especially on Dense-Haze dataset. This is due to the real dense haze which leads to the severe degradation of information.\nWe also compare our AECR-Net with SOTA methods on the quality of restored images, which are presented in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8.\nObviously, our AECR-Net generates the most natural images, compared to other methods. The restored images by DCP 7, DehazeNet [ref]5, AOD-Net , GridDehazeNet , FFA-Net  and KDDN 3 suffer from the serious color distortion and texture loss. Besides, there are still some thick haze existed in the restored images by MSBDN  and KDDN 3. More examples can be found in the supplementary.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: the significant reduction of 2M parameters. We also compare our AECR-Net with SOTA methods on the quality of the restored images, which is shown in Fig. 6. We can observe that DCP 7 and DehazeNet [ref]5 and AOD-Net  cannot successfully remove dense haze, and suffer from the color distortion (see Fig. 6(b)-6(d)).

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
