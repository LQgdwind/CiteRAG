      "content": "Paper Title: DiverGAN: An Efficient and Effective Single-Stage Framework for Diverse Text-to-Image Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets. We evaluate DiverGAN on three extensively employed data sets, which are used by StackGAN [ref]3, AttnGAN ,\nMirrorGAN , ControlGAN ,\nSDGAN , DM-GAN , DF-GAN [ref]1, etc. ‚àô‚àô\\bullet Oxford-102. The Oxford-102 data set includes 5,878 and 2,311 images for training and testing, respectively. Each image is accompanied by 10 textual descriptions. ‚àô‚àô\\bullet CUB bird. The CUB data set consists of 11,788 images, where 8,855 images belong to the training set and the other 2,933 images belong to the test set. Each image contains 10 sentences for text descriptions. ‚àô‚àô\\bullet MS COCO. The MS COCO data set is a more challenging data set comprising 123,287 images which are divided into 82,783 training images and 40,504 test images. Each picture has 5 human annotated captions. Implementation details. For the text encoder, following the method of AttnGAN , we utilize a pretrained bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network  to acquire the word embeddings and the global sentence vector, respectively. We adopt the losses in DTGAN  owing to its superior results. We set the dimension of the latent code to 100. As for the training, we leverage the Adam optimizer ¬† with Œ≤=(0.0,0.9)ùõΩ0.00.9\\beta=(0.0,0.9) to train our network. We also follow the two time-scale update rule (TTUR) 0 and set the learning rates for the generator and the discriminator to 0.0001 and 0.0004, respectively. The batch size is set to 16. Our DiverGAN is implemented by PyTorch¬†1. All the experiments are performed on a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU (32 GB memory). Evaluation metrics. Our DiverGAN is evaluated by calculating three widely used metrics including an inception score (IS) , a Fr√©chet inception distance (FID) 4 score and a learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) 5 score. The first two are to measure the visual quality, and the last one is employed to assess the diversity of generated samples. ‚àô‚àô\\bullet IS. The IS is acquired via the KL divergence between the conditional class distribution and the marginal class distribution. It‚Äôs defined as: where xùë•x is a generated sample and yùë¶y is the corresponding label obtained by a pre-trained Inception v3 network 4. The produced samples are split into multiple groups and the IS is calculated on each group of images, then the average and standard deviation of the score are reported.\nHigher IS demonstrates better quality among the generated images. For the COCO data set, DTGAN , DFGAN [ref]1 and ObjGAN 6 argue that the IS fails to evaluate the synthetic samples and can be saturated, even over-fitted. Consequently, we do not compare the IS on the COCO data set. ‚àô‚àô\\bullet FID. The FID computes the Fr√©chet distance between the distribution of generated samples and the distribution of true data. A lower FID means that the synthetic samples are closer to the corresponding real images. We use a pre-trained Inception v3 network to achieve the FID. For the Oxford-102 data set, we do not list the FID due to lack of compared scores. It should be noted that we synthesize 30000 pictures from unseen textual descriptions for the IS and FID. ‚àô‚àô\\bullet LPIPS. LPIPS measures diversity by computing the average feature distance between synthetic images. The generated samples are meant to be diverse if the LPIPS score is large. The results of LPIPS will be discussed in Section¬†5.3.4\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Datasets.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
