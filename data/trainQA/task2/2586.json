      "content": "Paper Title: ProtoMIL: Multiple Instance Learning with Prototypical Parts for Whole-Slide Image Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA typical supervised learning scenario assumes that each data point has a separate label. However, in Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, only one label is usually assigned to a gigapixel image due to the laborious and expensive labeling. Because of the hardware limitations, the direct application of supervised deep learning methods to WSI two highest magnification is impossible. That is why recent approaches  divide the WSI into smaller patches (instances) and process them separately to obtain their representations. Such representations form a bag of instances associated with only one label, and it is unspecified which instances are responsible for this label . This kind of problem, called Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) , appears in many medical problems, such as the diabetic retinopathy screening  , bacteria clones identification using microscopy images [ref]7, or identifying conformers responsible for molecule activity in drug design  . In recent years, with the rapid development of deep learning, MIL is combined with many neural network-based models    7 [ref]34     . Many of them embed all instances of the bag using a convolutional block of a deep network and then aggregate those embeddings. Moreover, some aggregation methods specify the most important instances that are presented to the user as prediction interpretation   7 [ref]34 .\nHowever, those methods usually only exhibit instances crucial for the prediction and do not indicate the cause of their importance. Naturally, there were attempts to further explain the MIL models  [ref]7 , but overall, they usually introduce additional bias into the explanation  or require additional input . To address the above shortcomings of MIL models, we introduce Prototypical Multiple Instance Learning (ProtoMIL). It builds on case-based reasoning, a type of explanation naturally used by humans to describe their thinking process . More precisely, we divide each WSI into patches and analyze how similar they are to a trainable set prototypical parts of positive and negative data classes, as defined in . Since, the prototypes are trainable, they are automatically derived by ProtoMIL. Then, we apply an attention pooling operator to accumulate those similarities over instances. As a result, we obtain bag-level representation classified with an additional neural layer.\nThis approach significantly differs from non-MIL approaches because it applies an aggregation layer and introduces a novel regularization technique that encourages the model to derive prototypes from the instances responsible for the positive label of a bag. The latter is a challenging problem because those instances are concealed and underrepresented. Lastly, the prototypical parts are pruned to characterize the data classes compactly. This results in detailed interpretation, where the most important patches according to attention weights are described using prototypes, as shown in Fig. 1. To show the effectiveness of our model, we conduct experiments on five WSI datasets: Bisque Breast Cancer , Colon Cancer , Camelyon16 Breast Cancer , Lung cancer subtype identification TCGA-NSCLC  and Kidney cancer subtype classification . Additionally, in the Supplementary Materials, we show the universal character of our model in different scenarios such as MNIST Bags  and Retinopathy Screening (Messidor dataset) . The results we obtain are usually on par with the current state-of-the-art models. However, at the same time, we strongly enhance interpretation capabilities with prototypical parts obtained from the training set. We made our code publicly available at https://github.com/apardyl/ProtoMIL. The main contributions of this work are as follows: Introducing the ProtoMIL method, which substantially improves the interpretability of existing MIL models by introducing case-based reasoning. Developing a training paradigm that encourages generating prototypical parts from the underrepresented instances responsible for the positive label of a bag. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present recent advancements in Multiple Instance Learning and deep interpretable models. In Section 3, we define the MIL paradigms and introduce ProtoMIL. Finally, in Section 4, we present the results of conducted experiments, and Section 5 summarizes the work.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: This kind of problem, called Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) , appears in many medical problems, such as the diabetic retinopathy screening  , bacteria clones identification using microscopy images [ref]7, or identifying conformers responsible for molecule activity in drug design  .
