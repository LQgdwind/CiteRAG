      "content": "Paper Title: Attentional Separation-and-Aggregation Network for Self-supervised Depth-Pose Learning in Dynamic Scenes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInferring the 3D structure and camera’s ego-motion from videos is significant in 3D computer vision tasks, especially for robotics, autonomous driving, and augmented reality. The traditional methods take the idea of structure-from-motion, using the stereo matching to recover the depth map, and solving the essential matrix by the perspective-n-point (PnP) [ref]1 method. These geometric methods usually rely on the hand-crafted features with correspondence search and epipolar geometry. Recently, learning-based depth estimation [ref]2    and ego-motion estimation     methods have emerged and achieved great success. However, the requirement of the high-precision ground-truth limits their flexibility and transportability. To utilize the pervasive unlabeled monocular videos, Zhou et al.  propose to learn depth and ego-motion jointly from videos in a self-supervised manner. Along this line, many works have put forward many improvements in consistency constraints    and awareness of occlusion . Another remaining challenge is moving objects, which can destroy the scene’s rigid global transformation caused by the camera’s ego-motion. To tackle the issue of the moving objects, most previous works  [ref]15 used a pre-trained segmentation model to preprocess the data, and then separately estimated the movements of the individuals. The pre-trained model, like Mask R-CNN , is always bulky and introduces the exterior annotated knowledge, making the possible online adaptation  difficult, which is one of the main advantages of self-supervised learning. In this paper, we aim to design a dynamic-aware learning system under the pure self-supervision from monocular videos. Since Gordon et al. [ref]15 have demonstrated that the CNN-based model can estimate the camera’s ego-motion and the motion field of selected regions, monocular videos naturally contain all features required to complete these two estimations. We note that ego-motion estimation, or called visual odometry, relies on static elements in the scene, while dynamic features contribute to motion field estimation for moving objects. In order to distinguish and exploit the static and dynamic features of the scene, we propose an attentional separation-and-aggregation network (ASANet). There are two weights-sharing feature propagation paths inside the ASANet, corresponding to the static and dynamic characteristics. In each layer of each path, the features are first decomposed into static and dynamic elements using soft attention, and then the decomposed static and dynamic features from two paths are aggregated into a new pair of features and fed into the subsequent layers. Through multiple separation-and-aggregation operations, ASANet finally outputs pure static and dynamic features. Leveraging the ASANet as the encoder, our extended MotionNet can simultaneously estimate the ego-motion of the camera and the scene’s motion field by two separate decoders. Also, we design an auto-selecting mechanism to select the appropriate transformation to build supervision automatically, i.e., using ego-motion for projecting stationary elements and motion field for transforming the moving objects. We conduct extensive experiments to verify our method’s performance and compare our method with the existing methods, showing that our method can achieve better performance at a lower cost. Our contributions in this work can be summarized as follows: We propose an Attentional Separation-and-Aggregation Network (ASANet), which can extract the static and dynamic features simultaneously from stacked images. We propose an auto-selecting approach to eliminate the moving objects issue in a self-supervised manner. To our best knowledge, we are the first to alleviate effect from arbitrary moving objects in self-supervised depth-pose learning from monocular videos without any exterior knowledge. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the depth estimation and end-to-end visual odometry tasks of the KITTI benchmark   with only a small additional cost.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: reality.
