A few pioneer studies [ref]17  explore solving the distribution shift problem in time series forecasting.\nRevIN [ref]17 proposes an instance-level normalization technique to reduce the discrepancy in data distributions such as mean and variance.\nOur work is orthogonal to RevIN by adopting representation learning to enhance the generalization of forecasting models.\nOur work is most related to ADARNN , which first attempts to characterize the worst-case distribution shift in time series and then matches the distributions to learn a generalizable model.\nWe advance ADARNN by eliminating the worst-case assumption and fully exploiting the diversity of the distribution shifts in the training data.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: Domain adaptation [ref]14  and domain generalization [ref]15 are generic solutions to the distribution shift problem.\nDomain adaptation focuses on the disparity difference between the source and target domain, whereas\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
