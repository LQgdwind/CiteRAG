      "content": "Paper Title: Fast Design Space Exploration of Nonlinear Systems: Part II\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNonlinear system design forms the core of various applications that include healthcare,\nsmart grid, transportation, and smart home  . Design of such systems involves solving a combinatorial optimization\nproblem with a large design space of various system architectures and constituent components.\nIt often requires solving a constrained multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem that arises in\nseveral disciplines like circuit design and cyber-physical system synthesis. Typically, the designer\nhas access to a black-box simulator but without knowledge of the underlying dynamics governing\nsystem response to inputs. To reduce the development time, the designer needs to minimize the number\nof calls to the simulator that may take anywhere from minutes to hours to even days to obtain the\nresponse for a given choice of input. Development time can be reduced through active\nlearning of best inputs to simulate.\nThe input sample can be selected based on past system response to inputs and the corresponding\noutputs. Existing techniques for nonlinear system design include reinforcement learning (RL), Bayesian\noptimization (BO), and evolutionary algorithms (EAs) like genetic algorithm (GA). However, using RL\nand BO requires formulating MOO as a weighted sum of objectives. Setting the weights requires domain\nexpertise and manual tuning. Moreover, deep RL requires access to a large number of graphical\nprocessing units (GPUs), thus increasing development cost. BO is generally very slow as the\ncomplexity of generating candidate solutions increases with an increase in the number of simulations.\nEAs like\nGA have been very successful in solving MOO problems. However, due to GA’s inherent randomness, the\nalgorithm needs to be executed over a large number of generations to meet system\nspecifications. Thus, they are not sample-efficient.\nSurrogate-assisted EA can help improve the sample efficiency. The global search technique proposed in [ref]3 uses Gaussian process based surrogate model and computes probability of improvement to determine the candidate solution. This limits the methodology in [ref]3 to a single objective or a weighted sum of objectives. We propose ASSENT, a two-step methodology that builds upon CNMA111CNMA stands for Constrained\noptimization with Neural networks, MILP and Active learning : a sample-efficient\nexploration method that is described in detail in a sister Part I of this article. In contrast to\nCNMA that uses multiple solvers to escape local minima, in Step 1 of ASSENT, we use GA to account for\nsystem response over the entire design space.\nStep 1 either explores system architectures and constituent component values or only component\nvalues for a fixed system architecture. We harness the benefits of GA to perform exploration in a\ndiscrete design space and the ease with which it can encode system architectures. We terminate\nGA after some stopping criteria are met even if the design requirements are not yet met since GA\nis sample-inefficient and requires a large number of iterations to meet the requirements. We thus\nobtain a coarse design at the end of the first step. In Step 2, based on CNMA, we fine-tune the coarse design to search for component\nvalues in a continuous design space. This step uses a neural network (NN) as a surrogate function to\nmodel system response. We convert the NN into a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) to incorporate\nthe constraints imposed by the permissible range of inputs (i.e., component values), outputs (i.e.,\ndesired response), and the MILP formulation of the NN. We use this formulation to obtain an\ninverse design of the system and find an input that satisfies the set of system constraints.\nA feasible solution of the MILP yields the input that is used to simulate the system. In the case\nof an infeasible solution, we use a random sample for simulation. The NN thus enables active\nlearning by generating high-quality input samples until system requirements are met or the sampling\nbudget is exhausted. We summarize the major contributions of this article as follows: We formulate system design as an MOO problem and propose ASSENT, a two-step method for\nsample-efficient system synthesis. In Step 1 of ASSENT, we explore a large discrete design space using GA and synthesize\na coarse design. Exploring the entire search spaces helps avoid local minima. We terminate GA even\nif the design requirements are not met. Early termination helps avoid costly simulations. In Step 2 of ASSENT, we explore a continuous design space of component values to improve the value of the objective function. We use the saved simulations from Step 1 to\nincorporate knowledge over the entire design space. We use an NN as a surrogate to model the system response.\nWe use an MILP formulation of the NN to obtain an inverse\ndesign of the system. The MILP formulation builds on top of CNMA where we dynamically replace the design around which we search for possible solutions. We demonstrate the efficacy of ASSENT on a wide array of design problems, ranging from\nnonlinear system design to circuit design. System design problems include Lunar lander\n, Acrobot , Polak3 , Waveglider , Rover path planning ,\nand sensor placement for a power grid [ref]9. We show that ASSENT improves the\nvalue of the objective function in comparison to CNMA based system synthesis by up to 54%percent\\%. We also\nsynthesize two-stage and three-stage transimpedance amplifiers and show that ASSENT attains a better\nvalue of the objective function compared to RL, BO, and human designs proposed in\n0. The rest of the article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we\ndiscuss related work. Section 3 provides the necessary background, followed by\na simple motivational example in Section 4. In Section 5, we\nintroduce the methodology for sample-efficient nonlinear system design. We apply the methodology to\nthe synthesis of nonlinear systems in Section 6.\nFinally, Section 7 concludes the article.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: large number of generations to meet system\nspecifications.
