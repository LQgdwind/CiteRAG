      "content": "Paper Title: GeoMIM: Towards Better 3D Knowledge Transfer via Masked Image Modeling for Multi-view 3D Understanding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMasked Image Modeling Inspired by BERT  for Masked Language Modeling, Masked Image Modeling (MIM) becomes a popular pretext task for visual representation learning [ref]6 5       . MIM aims to reconstruct the masked tokens from a corrupted input. SimMIM  points out that raw pixel values of the randomly masked patches are a good reconstruction target and a lightweight prediction head is sufficient for pretraining. Different from SimMIM, MAE 5 only takes the visible patches as the input of the encoder. Mask tokens are added in the middle of the encoder and the decoder. BEiT [ref]6 utilizes a pretrained discrete VAE (dVAE) 1 0 as the tokenizer. PeCo 3 proposed to apply perceptual similarity loss on the training of dVAE can drive the tokenizer to generate better semantic visual tokens, which helps pretraining. In contrast to those works, our GeoMIM utilizes a geometry-rich LiDAR model and transfers its knowledge via MIM pretraining, aiming to improve the multi-view camera-based 3D models. Multi-view camera-based 3D detection The field of camera-based 3D object detection has seen significant progress in recent years 8 9 1 2 0 8 8 . FCOS3D 8 proposed a fully convolutional single-stage detector for monocular 3D object detection. DETR3D 9 extends the DETR framework to the 3D domain, and proposes a framework for end-to-end 3D object detection.\nBEVFormer 1 combines BEV (bird’s eye view) representation and transformer networks for 3D object detection.\nBEVDepth 0 focuses on accurately estimating the depth of objects in the BEV representation.\nAdditionally, considering the promising performance of the LiDAR-based detectors, there are several papers that use a pretrained LiDAR detector for knowledge distillation 7.\nLIGA-Stereo 4 proposes to mimic the LiDAR BEV features for training a camera-based detector. UVTR 9 represents different modalities in a unified manner and supports knowledge transfer with the voxel representations. More recent BEVDistill  and CMKD 8 not only use the LiDAR BEV features for knowledge distillation but also transfer the teacher’s knowledge through sparse instance distillation and response-based distillation respectively.\nIn comparison, we utilized the pretrained LiDAR model in a pretraining-finetuning paradigm to avoid the LiDAR-camera BEV domain gap.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: Masked Image Modeling Inspired by BERT  for Masked Language Modeling, Masked Image Modeling (MIM) becomes a popular pretext task for visual representation learning [ref]6 5       .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
