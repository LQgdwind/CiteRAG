      "content": "Paper Title: A Topological Perspective on Causal Inference\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs elucidated in  [ref]4, the causal hierarchy helps characterize many standard problems of causal inference, in as far as these problems typically involve ascending levels of the hierarchy. Some examples include: Classical identifiability: given observational data about some variables in 𝐕𝐕\\mathbf{V}, estimate a causal effect of setting variables 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} to values 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x}  . In the notation here, given information about pℳ​(𝐕)superscript𝑝ℳ𝐕p^{\\mathcal{M}}(\\mathbf{V}), can we determine pℳ𝐗≔𝐱​(𝐘)superscript𝑝subscriptℳ≔𝐗𝐱𝐘p^{\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathbf{X}\\coloneqq\\mathbf{x}}}(\\mathbf{Y})? General identifiability: given a mix of observational data and limited experimental data—that is, information about pℳ​(𝐕)superscript𝑝ℳ𝐕p^{\\mathcal{M}}(\\mathbf{V}) as well as some experimental distributions of the form pℳ𝐖≔𝐰​(𝐕)superscript𝑝subscriptℳ≔𝐖𝐰𝐕p^{\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathbf{W}\\coloneqq\\mathbf{w}}}(\\mathbf{V})—determine pℳ𝐗≔𝐱​(𝐘)superscript𝑝subscriptℳ≔𝐗𝐱𝐘p^{\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathbf{X}\\coloneqq\\mathbf{x}}}(\\mathbf{Y})  [ref]25. Structure learning: given observational data, and perhaps experimental data, infer properties of the underlying causal influence relation →→\\rightarrow  . Counterfactual estimation: given a combination of observational and experimental data, infer a counterfactual quantity, such as probability of necessity , or probability of necessity and sufficiency   (see also §3.3 below). Global identifiability: given observational data drawn from pℳ​(𝐕)superscript𝑝ℳ𝐕p^{\\mathcal{M}}(\\mathbf{V}) infer the full counterfactual distribution pcfℳ​(A×𝐕)superscriptsubscript𝑝cfℳ𝐴𝐕p_{\\text{cf}}^{{\\mathcal{M}}}(A\\times\\mathbf{V})  . This is not an exhaustive list, and these problems are not all independent of one another. They are also all unsolvable in general. Problems 1, 2, and 3 involve ascending to Level 2 given information at Level 1 (and perhaps partial information at Level 2); problems 4 and 5 ask us to ascend to Level 3 given only Level 1 (and perhaps also Level 2) information. The upshot of the causal hierarchy theorem from [ref]4 is that these steps are impossible without assumptions, formalizing the common wisdom, “no causes in, no causes out” .\nTo understand the statement of the causal hierarchy theorem—and our topological version of it—we explain what it means for the hierarchy to collapse.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: As elucidated in  [ref]4, the causal hierarchy helps characterize many standard problems of causal inference, in as far as these problems typically involve ascending levels of the hierarchy.
