      "content": "Paper Title: Noise-Aware and Equitable Urban Air Traffic Management: An Optimization Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe future UAM system, when operational in urban and suburban environments, is expected to function as a network system. Network design and air traffic management are two crucial problems to ensure effective and sustainable UAM operations. Both problems encompass multiple objectives in the design process and have garnered interest from researchers across a range of fields such as aerospace engineering, transportation, operations research, and urban planning. Existing studies in the literature have explored UAM network design and traffic flow management for various objectives, such as serving passenger demand , minimizing ground traffic congestion [ref]15, managing traffic overflows due to physical and operational disruptions , incorporating the multi-leg operational strategy , reducing air traffic complexity , and serving the demands of urban communities in a fair manner . In both air traffic management and the larger scope of operations management, the importance of equity and fairness is on the rise. Through incorporating fairness consideration, planners strive to equitably distribute both merits (e.g., resources) and downsides (e.g., delays) of a system among all participants. In the field of air transportation, the concept of fairness has been integrated into optimization problems related to service distribution , delay management  , airport slot allocation  , conflict resolution , and separation management . In other important fields such as healthcare, fairness has also been considered in problems including kidney transplantation  and healthcare facility location . In future system design problems involving multiple participants/parties, the efficiency-fairness trade-off  is likely to emerge as a new norm.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: Existing studies in the literature have explored UAM network design and traffic flow management for various objectives, such as serving passenger demand , minimizing ground traffic congestion [ref]15, managing traffic overflows due to physical and operational disruptions , incorporating the multi-leg operational strategy , reducing air traffic complexity , and serving the demands of urban\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
