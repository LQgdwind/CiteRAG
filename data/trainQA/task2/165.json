      "content": "Paper Title: Cognitively-Inspired Model for Incremental Learning Using a Few Examples\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHumans can continuously learn new concepts over their lifetime. In contrast, modern machine learning systems often must be trained on batches of data¬† . Applied to the task of object recognition, incremental learning is an avenue of research that seeks to develop systems that are capable of continually updating the learned model as new data arrives¬†. Incremental learning gradually increases an object classifier‚Äôs breadth by training it to recognize new object classes¬†. This paper examines a sub-type of incremental learning known as class-incremental learning. Class-incremental learning attempts to first learn a small subset of classes and then incrementally expand that set with new classes. Importantly, class-incremental evaluation of a final model is tested on a single blended dataset, an evaluation known as single-headed evaluation¬†. To paraphrase Rebuffi et al.¬†9, a class-incremental learning algorithm must: Be trainable from a stream of data that includes instances of different classes at different times; Offer a competitively accurate multi-class classifier for any classes it has observed thus far; Be bounded or only grow slowly with respect to memory and computational requirements as the number of training classes increase. Creating a high accuracy classifier that incrementally learns, however, is a hard problem. One simple way to create an incremental learner is by tuning the model to the data of the new classes. This approach, however, causes the model to forget the previously learned classes and the overall classification accuracy decreases, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting¬†[ref]14 . To overcome this problem, most existing class-incremental learning methods avoid it altogether by storing a portion of the training data from the earlier learned classes and retrain the model (often a neural network) on a mixture of the stored data and new data containing new classes¬†9 [ref]7 . These approaches are, however, neither scalable nor biologically inspired i.e. when humans learn new visual objects they do not forget the visual objects they have previously learned, nor must humans relearn these previously known objects. Furthermore, current methods for incremental learning require a large amount of training data and are thus not suitable for training from a small set of examples. We seek to develop a practical incremental learning system that would allow human users to incrementally teach a robot different classes of objects. In order to be practical for human users, an incremental learner should only require a few instances of labeled data per class. Hence, in this paper we explore the Few-Shot Incremental Learning (FSIL) problem, in which an agent/robot is required to learn new classes continually but with only a small set of examples per class. With respect to class-incremental learning and FSIL, this paper contributes a novel cognitively-inspired method termed Centroid-Based Concept Learning (CBCL). CBCL is inspired by the concept learning model of the hippocampus and the neocortex¬†  . CBCL treats each image as an episode and extracts its high-level features. CBCL uses a fixed data representation (ResNet¬† pre-trained on ImageNet¬†) for feature extraction. After feature extraction, CBCL generates a set of concepts in the form of centroids for each class using a cognitively-inspired clustering approach (denoted as Agg-Var clustering) proposed in . After generating the centroids, to predict the label of a test image, the distance of the feature vector of the test image to the nùëõn closest centroids is used. Since CBCL stores the centroids for each class independently of the other classes, the decrease in overall classification accuracy is not catastrophic when new classes are learned. CBCL is tested on three incremental learning benchmarks (Caltech-101¬†, CUBS-200-2011¬†, CIFAR-100¬†) and it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a sizable margin. Evaluations for FSIL show that CBCL outperforms some class-incremental learning methods, even when CBCL uses only 5 or 10 training examples per class and other methods use the complete training set per class (500 images per class for CIFAR-100). For FSIL, CBCL even beats a few-shot learning baseline that learns from the training data of all classes (batch learning) on the three benchmark datasets. The main contributions of this paper are: A cognitively-inspired class-incremental learning approach is proposed that outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the three benchmark datasets listed above. A novel centroid reduction method is proposed that bounds the memory footprint without a significant loss in classification accuracy. A challenging incremental learning problem is examined (FSIL) and experimental evaluations show that our approach results in state-of-the-art accuracy when applied to this problem.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: of the new classes.
