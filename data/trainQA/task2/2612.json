      "content": "Paper Title: InSeGAN: A Generative Approach to Segmenting Identical Instances in Depth Images\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we review some of the closely related approaches to our method. Multiple Objects and Instance Segmentation:\nIn IODINE , a variational generative model is proposed for instance segmentation of RGB images using an iterative refinement of latent vectors to characterize the object instances, similar to an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Their key idea is to use a fixed number of latent vectors to describe the scene and iteratively infer the association of these vectors to the instances, an approach that can be unstable for complicated scenes (such as the depth images we consider in our dataset). In Slot Attention , abstract scene components, called slots, are learned for each instance in an unsupervised manner, but they do not account for the 3D structure of the scene or the instances. In Liao et al. [ref]26 and O3V-voxel [ref]13, multiple object instances are created in an adversarial setting through image composition. Both of these methods produce a 3D feature latent space—the former a 2D primitive of the 3D object and the latter a 3D voxel representation—for each object instance. Using a fixed number of instances, [ref]26 composes the scene by projecting the primitive to create depth and alpha maps. In [ref]13, the authors propose a scheme to generate a video sequence to extract the multiple instance images. They follow a framework similar to  , where the initial image is generated from a sequence of real images, through an encoder. However, they generate a feature voxel representation for each object. At each time instance, each object is rendered and they are composed together. There are prior approaches that tackle the multiple instance segmentation problem for 2D and 3D images in a supervised manner. Most of these methods, e.g.,   , first extract Regions of Interest (RoI) from the input, subsequently classifying the object in each selected region. Mask RCNN  expands Faster RCNN  by creating a new segmentation branch to classify per-pixel object segments. DeepMask  learns those RoIs and their underlying masks, which are then passed through the Fast RCNN  for classification. Along similar lines, point cloud segmentation has been explored in several recent works. For example, 0  propose a 2D architecture. GsPN 0 proposes a network to generate shapes with their specific segmentations and bounding boxes. SGPN  generates a similarity matrix and group proposals to create independent clusters for classification. In contrast to these popular methods for instance segmentation, we differ in that we approach the problem from an unsupervised perspective. 3D Disentanglement: Several recent works have proposed approaches for disentangling 3D attributes using deep learning via implicit or explicit representations. Deep Voxels  proposes a synthesis approach to learning an implicit 3D representation of the object. The method learns to synthesize novel perspectives of an object from a learned voxel feature volume. From these voxels, one may create an explicit 3D model of the object. However, their model is not generative and requires camera parameters. HoloGAN  proposes a generative method that creates an implicit 3D volume of single instances. It first learns a 3D representation, which it transforms using a target pose, then projects to 2D features and renders to a final image. Our method is inspired by HoloGAN, but we go beyond it by deriving a scheme for disentangling the object instances. Another related work is PlatonicGAN , which creates a 3D representation of an object while generating different unseen views via adversarial learning. However, as in HoloGAN, this method is limited to a single rotated object. The prior work that is most similar to ours is Wu et al. , which proposes to disentangle object instances and their 6D poses in an unsupervised manner, concurrently learning an explicit 3D point cloud template of the object. While our objective is similar, our proposed framework is completely different. The framework of  requires explicit modeling of point occlusions and computes point cloud alignments using Chamfer distance, which make the scheme computationally expensive. We avoid these challenges by using depth images, and we introduce a discriminator that implicitly learns these steps efficiently.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: abstract scene components, called slots, are learned for each instance in an unsupervised manner, but they do not account for the 3D structure of the scene or the instances.
