      "content": "Paper Title: Combining Recurrent, Convolutional, and Continuous-time Models with Linear State-Space Layers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe provide an extended related work comparing the LSSL to previous recurrent, convolutional, and continuous-time models. The LSSL is most closely related to the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memory [ref]24 and its predecessor, the Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) .\nThe HiPPO-RNN and the LMU define dynamics of the form of equation (1), and incorporate it into an RNN architecture.\nA successor to the LMU, the LMU-FFT  keeps the original linear dynamics, allowing the LMU to be computed with a cached convolution kernel. These methods all suffer from two main limitations.\nFirst, the state matrix Aùê¥A and discretization timescale Œî‚ÄãtŒîùë°\\Delta t cannot be trained due to both limitations in theoretical understanding of which Aùê¥A matrices are effective, as well as computational limitations.\nSecond, (1) is a 1-D to NùëÅN-D map, requiring states to be projected back down to 1-D.\nThis creates an overall 1-D bottleneck in the state, limiting the expressivity of the model. Compared to these, the LSSL does not use a conventional RNN architecture, instead keeping the linear recurrence (4) and downprojecting it with the second part of the state space representation (5).\nTo avoid the 1-D feature bottlneck, it simply computes HùêªH copies of this 1-D to 1-D independently, creating an overall HùêªH-dimensional sequence-to-sequence model.\nHowever, this exacerbates the computational issue, since the work is increased by a factor of HùêªH. This work resolves the expressivity issue with new theory.\nCompared to HiPPO and the LMU, LSSL allows training the Aùê¥A matrix by showing generalized theoretical results for the HiPPO framework,\nshowing that there is a parameterized class of structured state spaces that are HiPPO operators. The LSSL makes progress towards the second issue with new algorithms for these structured matrices (Theorem¬†2).\nHowever, as noted in Sections¬†4.2 and¬†6, the algorithm presented in Theorem¬†2 was later found to be not practical,\nand an improved representation and algorithm was found in subsequent work. The CKConv is the only example of a continuous-time CNN that we are aware of, and is perhaps the strongest baseline in our experiments.\nRather than storing a finite sequence of weights for a convolution kernel,\nthe CKConv parameterizes it as an implicit function from  [ref]1‚Üí‚Ñù‚Üí01‚Ñù [ref]1\\to\\mathbb{R} which allows sampling it at any resolution.\nA successor to the CKConv is the FlexConv¬†,\nwhich learns convolutional kernels with a flexible width.\nThis is similar to the convolution interpretation of LSSL when using certain HiPPO bases (Section¬†3.2). The connection from RNNs to continuous-time models have been known since their inception, and recent years have seen an explosion of CT-RNN (continuous-time RNN) models based on dynamical systems or ODEs. We briefly mention a few classic and modern works along these lines, categorizing them into a few main topics. First are theoretical works that analyze the expressivity of RNNs from a continuous-time perspective.\nThe connection between RNNs and dynamical systems has been studied since the 90s , fleshing out the correspondence between different dynamical systems and RNN architectures .\nModern treatments have focused on analyzing the stability¬† and dynamics¬† of RNNs. Second, a large class of modern RNNs have been designed that aim to combat vanishing gradients from a dynamical systems analysis.\nThese include include the AntisymmetricRNN¬†, iRNN¬†[ref]30, and LipschitzRNN¬†, which address the exploding/vanishing gradient problem by reparatermizing the architecture or recurrent matrix based on insights from an underlying dynamical system. Third is a class of models that are based on an explicit underlying ODE introduced to satisfy various properties.\nThis category includes the UnICORNN¬† and its predecessor coRNN¬† which discretize a second-order ODE inspired by oscillatory systems.\nOther models include the Liquid Time-Constant Networks (LTC)¬† and successor CfC¬†, which use underlying dynamical systems with varying time-constants with stable behavior and provable rates of expressivity measured by trajectory length.\nThe LTC is based on earlier dynamic causal models (DCM)¬†, which are a particular ODE related to state spaces with an extra bilinear term.\nFinally, the LMU¬† and HiPPO¬†[ref]24 also fall in this category, whose underlying ODEs are mathematically derived for continuous-time memorization. Fourth, the recent family of neural ODEs¬†, originally introduced as continuous-depth models, have been adapted to continuous-time, spawning a series of ‚ÄúODE-RNN‚Äù models.\nExamples include the ODE-RNN¬†, GRU-ODE-Bayes¬†, and ODE-LSTM¬†, which extend adjoint-based neural ODEs to the discrete input setting as an alternative to standard RNNs.\nNeural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDE)¬† and Neural Rough Differential Equations (NRDE)¬† are memory efficient versions that integrate observations more smoothly and can be extended to very long time series. As a special case of continuous-time RNNs, some works have observed the relation between gating mechanisms and damped dynamical systems¬†.\nSome examples of continuous-time RNNs based on such damped dynamical systems include the LTC¬† and iRNN¬†[ref]30.\nCompared to these, Lemma¬†3.1 shows a stronger result that sigmoid gates are not just motivated by being an arbitrary monotonic function with range (0,1)01(0,1), but the exact formula appears out of discretizing a damped ODE.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: an extended related work comparing the LSSL to previous recurrent, convolutional, and continuous-time models.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
