      "content": "Paper Title: PATE-AAE: Incorporating Adversarial Autoencoder into Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles for Spoken Command Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe introduce AAE training as follows. Instead of training the noisy generator as in GAN, AAE leverages upon an autoencoder-based regression model to minimize a reconstruction loss between input data (x𝑥x) and decoded output (x′superscript𝑥′x^{\\prime}). The bottleneck vector (latent space z𝑧z) is modeling as variational autoencoder  but uses a discriminator to refine z𝑧z closing to a real vector (η𝜂\\eta) sampling from a fixed Gaussian distribution as shown in Fig. 2(a). This discriminative training resulted in a better test-likelihood on synthetic samples . The recent success  of probabilistic autoencoder for audio synthesis motivates our solution that combines PATE with AAE for spoken command classification. Let x𝑥x and z𝑧z be the input and the bottleneck latent vector of an encoder-decoder model, respectively. The universal approximator posterior q​(z)𝑞𝑧q(z) introduced  is: where the stochasticity in q​(z)𝑞𝑧q(z) comes from both the data-distribution x𝑥x and the random noise η𝜂\\eta with a fixed Gaussian distribution at the input of the encoder. The adversarial training procedure can match q​(z)𝑞𝑧q(z) to p​(z)𝑝𝑧p(z) by back-propagation through the encoder network directly. The encoder encodes an input data x𝑥x into latent vector, zi′∼𝒩​(μi​(𝐱),σi​(𝐱))similar-tosubscriptsuperscript𝑧′𝑖𝒩subscript𝜇𝑖𝐱subscript𝜎𝑖𝐱z^{\\prime}_{i}\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mu_{i}(\\mathbf{x}),\\sigma_{i}(\\mathbf{x})\\right), by variational inference used in . Therefore, a training objective for reconstructing input x𝑥x is computed by minimizing the following upper-bound on the negative log-likelihood of x𝑥x: Makhzani et al.  further introduce a discriminative update into the second terms of Eq. (6) that makes q​(z)𝑞𝑧q(z) to match to the distribution of p​(z)𝑝𝑧p(z) to train an AAE. The discriminative training objective between the latent vector z′superscript𝑧′z^{\\prime} (denoted as a fake sample as 00) and the sampling noise η𝜂\\eta (denoted as a real sample as 111) is computed by BCE loss and back-propagated gradients to input data (x𝑥x) for updating encoder’s parameters (Fig. 2 (a)). Next, for training teacher models, we partition the sensitive dataset into n𝑛n subsets, 𝒟1,…,𝒟I,subscript𝒟1…subscript𝒟𝐼\\mathcal{D}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathcal{D}_{I}, with |𝒟i|=|𝒟|Isubscript𝒟𝑖𝒟𝐼\\left|\\mathcal{D}_{i}\\right|=\\frac{|\\mathcal{D}|}{I} for ∀qfor-all𝑞\\forall q. Each teacher model (Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i}) is training with discriminator loss: To generate synthetic samples for training student model, we take I𝐼I samples of Gaussian distribution, η1,…,ηIsubscript𝜂1…subscript𝜂𝐼\\eta_{1},...,\\eta_{I} using the trained AAE decoder network (G𝐺G) to synthesize sample 𝐮^j=G​(ηj)subscript^𝐮𝑗𝐺subscript𝜂𝑗\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{j}=G\\left(\\eta_{j}\\right)\nfor each class. Following the PATE mechanism for knowledge transfer, the aggregated noisy output from the teachers models in Eq. (7) labels the synthetic data for training a differentially private student model, where noisy label refers rj=PATE⁡(𝐮^j,λ)subscript𝑟𝑗PATEsubscript^𝐮𝑗𝜆r_{j}=\\operatorname{PATE}\\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{j},\\lambda\\right) from Eq. (3). Finally, we train the student model to maximize the standard cross-entropy loss on this teacher-labeled data: We train G𝐺G, T1,…,TIsubscript𝑇1…subscript𝑇𝐼T_{1},...,T_{I} and S𝑆S iteratively, with each iteration of G consisting of first performing gradient updates on all teachers, then performing gradient updates of the student. The major difference between proposed PATE-AAE and PATE-GAN  is on the generative process. Proposed AAE method uses a regression autoencoder architecture to reconstruct the input samples and use a random variable for the refined latent space as the decoder (generator) input for generating new synthetic samples. Instead, PATE-GAN adapts discriminator on the sample generator directly to refine the learning process from random noise to synthetic data, which produces worse test-likelihood on high dimensional data from previous studies [ref]14  related to the convergence properties [ref]34 of GAN. To conduct privacy-preserving speech processing frameworks, we select PATE-GAN , and DP-GAN [ref]20 as baselines in our studies motivated by the condition of without any available non-sensitive audio dataset.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: discriminator on the sample generator directly to refine the learning process from random noise to synthetic data, which produces worse test-likelihood on high dimensional data from previous studies [ref]14  related to the convergence properties [ref]34 of GAN.
