      "content": "Paper Title: An Empirical Study on Bugs Inside PyTorch: A Replication Study\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThung et al.  analyzed the bug database of three ML-based systems and labeled the bugs into different categories. They also analyzed the relationships between different dimensions of bugs, such as the category, severity, cost of fixing, impact, etc. Kim et al. [ref]24 developed a benchmark of bugs in ML systems with a focus to help with automatic debugging. In addition, some empirical studies have also been done on bugs in applications of a branch of ML known as deep learning. Y. Zhang et al. [ref]6 conducted an empirical study of bugs in applications that call the APIs of TensorFlow  and their corresponding fixes to find the root causes of the bugs. Islam et al. [ref]7 analyzed applications using DL libraries, such as Caffe , Keras , Theano , and Torch . Humbatova et al.  also conducted a similar study on applications using TensorFlow , Keras  and PyTorch . X. Zhang et al.  studied the bugs related to incorrect decisions provided by DL systems and characterized such bugs.\nFinally, J. Chen et al. 0 conducted a study of bugs on four DL frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNET, and DL4) by analysing 1000 bugs. They analyze the root causes and symptoms of these bugs alongside the components in which they appeared in. By analyzing the related works mentioned above, we observe that there have been many studies done on analyzing defects in traditional software systems, ML/DL systems, and software which incorporate ML/DL components. However, there has been very little study on the DL frameworks themselves.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there are only two works done in this area. An empirical study done by Jia et al.  on bugs inside TensorFlow and a study done by Chen et al. 0 on bugs on 4 different DL frameworks. Alongside TensorFlow, PyTorch is also a popular DL framework that is used in research and industry alike. Our aim of doing a replication study on PyTorch based on the study that investigated TensorFlow by Jia et al. , is to draw direct comparisons between the two most popular DL libraries and to observe the defects that are most prevalent in developing DL systems. The study done by Chen et al. 0 has similarities to our work as they study TensorFlow and PyTorch alongside MXNET and DL4J. However, there exist differences in the depth and scope of analysis of both works. As mentioned, our work is a replication of the study done by Jia et al. to directly compare the different root causes, symptoms, and bug locations between TensorFlow and PyTorch. We also investigate the different repair patterns that are used to address these bugs by PyTorch’s development team, which is not present in the work of Chen et al. 0.\nWe believe our work complements well the literature cited above and contributes to building an even stronger empirical foundation about bugs on DL framework.\nBy replicating the study of Jia et al. , our study provides a direct and detailed comparison of bugs and their fixing process on the two most popular DL frameworks, PyTorch and TensorFlow.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: and labeled the bugs into different categories. They also analyzed the relationships between different dimensions of bugs, such as the category, severity, cost of fixing, impact, etc. Kim et al.

In addition, some empirical studies have also been done on bugs in applications of a branch of ML\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
