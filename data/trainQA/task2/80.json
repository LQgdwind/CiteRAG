They considered the gradient sharing strategy, where, in each communication round, the server aggregates the gradient information of the cost function from the clients and applies one step of gradient descent for model training. However, as mentioned in , the gradient sharing based methods would require a large number of communication rounds to produce a good model. It is also worth noting that the existing model averaging based FL algorithms  [ref]9  [ref]11  are not directly applicable to problem (1) because these existing studies have assumed smooth and unconstrained problems while (1) is constrained, and the existing algorithms are designed to deal with problems with single-block variable while (1) involves two blocks of variables. On the other hand, although many distributed MF methods have been proposed, they did not consider the FL scenario and address the associated issues. Specifically,\na large body of the existing distributed MF methods are parallel implementations of the centralized sequential SGD or alternating least square (ALS) algorithms, either on MapReduce    or Parameter server .\nAnalogously, parallel implementations of the multiplicative rule  and block coordinate descent   on MapReduce are developed for non-negative MF (NMF) models.\nAgain, these works usually assume that there is a shared memory that all nodes can access, and careful model/data partition is required for efficient parallelization.\nAnother category of works considered decentralized MF methods such as\n    with the absence of the central server.\nConsensus methods are often used to achieve distributed optimization. However, the critical issues of FL such as unbalanced/non-i.i.d. data are not considered therein. In summary, firstly, the existing FedMF and distributed MF algorithms have not been fully customized to overcome the challenges of FL in massive and heterogeneous networks. Secondly, the current studies have focused on specific applications (such as item recommendation), there still lacks a systematic algorithm design for the general MF model (1) so that the designed algorithms can subsequently be employed in various MF applications. Thirdly, the existing FedMF works do not present theoretical convergence analysis and thus are not able to analytically explain how various factors, such as non-i.i.d. data distribution and partial communication, can affect the algorithm performance.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: For example, the recent works [ref]13 and  studied the federated MF (FedMF) problem for recommendation systems.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
