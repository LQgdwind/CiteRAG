      "content": "Paper Title: Generative Densification: Learning to Densify Gaussians for High-Fidelity Generalizable 3D Reconstruction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFeed-forward Gaussian models learn a mapping from a single or a set of few input images to a set Gaussian representations that can be rendered into any viewpoint.\nOne common approach combines a pre-trained image encoder (e.g., DINO [ref]2 ) with a learnable embedding decoder, where the decoder generates explicit 3D features via a series of cross-attention between 3D embeddings and image features.\nThese 3D features are commonly represented as voxels (LaRa  and Geo-LRM ), point-cloud (Point-to-Gaussian), or a hybrid of point-cloud and triplane (Triplane Gaussian Splatting ), and the Gaussian parameters can be obtained by decoding the features using an MLP.\nCovering a wide range of view with an explicit 3D representation, this approach is effective for 360-degree object-level reconstruction.\nHowever, the cross-attention on the 3D features is memory-intensive and computationally expensive. Another approach involves pixel-aligned Gaussian representations [ref]29 [ref]3, where each Gaussian is assumed to be on a ray of each pixel and distanced from the ray origin by a depth.\nThe depth is either directly regressed from pixel-wise image features [ref]29 or determined by the probability that a Gaussian exists at a depth along a ray [ref]3.\nSince its introduction, substantial efforts have been made to estimate the depth more accurately and extend it to large models for better generalizability.\nMVSplat  and MVSGaussian  propose to utilize cost volumes to leverage cross-view feature similarities for depth estimation, and, more recently, Flash3D  and DepthSplat  further use a pre-trained depth estimator, enabling more robust estimation.\nLGM  and other works   extend the pixel-aligned Gaussians to the large models by attaching a Gaussian head layer on the top of 2D U-Net or ViT.\nTrained on large multi-view datasets, these models can generate the Gaussians even when out-of-domain input images (e.g., generated images from text-to-3D models ) are given. While both of these approaches can effectively generate Gaussian representations from a single or a few input images, they often struggle to reconstruct fine details.\nThis is primarily due to the limited number of Gaussians to represent the details and the lack of a densification strategy to refine the Gaussians generated by the feed-forward models.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: a mapping from a single or a set of few input images to a set Gaussian representations that can be rendered into any viewpoint.\nOne common approach combines a pre-trained image encoder (e.g., DINO [ref]2 ) with a learnable embedding decoder, where the decoder generates explicit 3D features via a series of cross-attention between 3D embeddings and image features.\nThese 3D features are commonly\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
