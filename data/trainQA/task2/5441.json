      "content": "Paper Title: Average-Constrained Policy Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) techniques\nhave achieved remarkable successes on a variety of complex\ntasks including the game of Go , robotic control , and the real-time game StarCraft . In these tasks, the agents are allowed to explore the state space and experiment with every action during training. However, in many realistic applications such as navigation robots  [ref]4\nand robotic assistants, considerations of safety and cost require the agent to operate with some constraints. A standard RL formulation for learning with constraints is the constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) framework [ref]12, where the agent must satisfy constraints on auxiliary costs while learning the optimal policy [ref]42 . To this end,  and 2 proposed algorithms for discounted MDPs with constraints. However, these deep RL (DRL) constrained policy algorithms are only suitable for the discounted setting. In many tasks such as robot locomotion or large language model deployment, we often care about maximizing the undiscounted average-rewards in the long run, which is generally considered as a more challenging objective. Given the need for average-reward algorithms, one might posit that having the discount factor Œ≥‚Üí1‚Üíùõæ1\\gamma\\to 1 in algorithms for the discounted setting would obviate the need for policy optimization algorithms specifically for the constrained average-reward setting. However, many algorithms break down when the discount factor gets too close to 1   .\nAlthough policy optimization algorithms for the average reward case have been proposed  8 , they cannot incorporate constraints. In this work, we propose such a policy optimization algorithm for an average-CMDP with function approximation. Our approach is motivated by theoretical guarantees that bound the difference between the average long-run rewards or costs of different policies. We build on , which presents a policy improvement theorem for the discounted setting based on the trust region methods of . We show that this result trivializes for the average setting and hence is not directly useful. Instead, we derive a new bound that depends on the worst-case level of ‚Äúmixture\" of the irreducible Markov chain associated with a policy. We then use trust region methods to provide policy degradation and constraint violation guarantees.\n Motivated by these theoretical developments, we propose a novel Average-Constrained Policy Optimization (ACPO) algorithm for average-CMDPs. For experimental validation, we use several MuJoCo environments 4, train large neural network policies and demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of the ACPO algorithm as compared to others. A brief summary of our work‚Äôs contributions: We propose ACPO, the first on-policy Deep RL algorithm with function approximation specifically designed for average-CMDPs, inspired by policy optimization algorithms. Our empirical results show that ACPO out-performs all state-of-the-art Deep RL algorithms such as CPO , PCPO [ref]42, PPO , BVF-PPO  and ATRPO , that while not designed for average-CMDPs could be applied with some tweaks. We introduce an approximate but novel line search procedure that improves the empirical performance of our algorithm, and suggests that the same may hold for policy optimization algorithms like PPO as well.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: StarCraft .
