      "content": "Paper Title: Local and Global Context-Based Pairwise Models for Sentence Ordering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEarly approaches proposed for this task relied on manually crafted linguistic\nfeatures by domain experts. Lapata  developed linguistic\nvectors for sentences to model transition probabilities of adjacent sentences.\nBarzilay and Lee  captured domain specific content structures of text\nin terms of topics the text addresses which are further represented as the\nstates of Hidden Markov Model . Barzilay and Lapata \ndeveloped entity-grid models to capture entity transitions between adjacent\nsentences. However, as these methods rely on hand-crafted features, they suffer\ngreatly when transferred to another domain or language. Recently, various neural network based approaches have been proposed for this\ntask. Window networks [ref]20 take as input a fixed window of\nsentences and outputs the coherence probability of the window. The embeddings of\nsentences are learned using Recurrent Neural Networks. Chen et al. \nproposed this task as a pairwise ranking task, an LSTM \nbased model is used to determine the order of a pair of sentences and then\nfurther beam search is used to predict the sub-optimal order. Pairwise\napproaches were further explored in Agrawal et al. [ref]23 and\nLi and Jurafsky . Almost all the methods proposed further frame this task as\na seq2seq task and apply end-to-end global context-based approaches. Language Models play an enormous role in various NLP tasks and are of utmost\nimportance in text coherence  and sentence ordering as\nwell. Most of the sentence ordering models till now have made use of BERT\n, an excellent review of which was provided by\n. Various extensions of BERT for different tasks have\nalso been proposed like by Zhao and Yu  and Song et al. .\nALBERT , which was built with sentence ordering as a goal,\nhas been proposed to perform better when the problem is framed as a constraint\nordering problem in Prabhumoye et al. [ref]31 as well. A new\nhierarchical transformer based approach for contextual sentence level\nrepresentation was proposed in , which would also be useful for\nsentence ordering tasks. Gong et al.  and Logeswaran et al.  capture sentence\nembeddings using LSTMs, they further capture the paragraph embedding using LSTMs\nbuilt on top of sentence embeddings and feed this as the initial state to a\npointer-network  based decoder. Self-attention\nmechanism  based paragraph encoding is used in\nCui et al.  to obtain a richer paragraph embedding compared to\nLSTMs. This framework was further enhanced in , where\na self-attention mechanism based encoder is used for sentence-level embedding,\nparagraph-level embeddings and the pointer network is replaced by self-attention\nmechanism based decoder. Graph Recurrent Networks are built on entities in\nYin et al.  to capture the paragraph embedding. The problem is framed\nas a ranking problem in Kumar et al.  and ranking losses like listMLE\n are used to train the network. In Zhu et al. ,\nall the sentences are concatenated and fed to BERT along with special tokens,\nthese token representations are used as embeddings for sentence and listMLE is\nused for scoring. Farahnak and Kosseim  enhance pointer network with conditional\nsentence representation. Recently there has been a surge in the use of pairwise models.\nYin et al.  enhances the performance of the pointer network decoder\nsignificantly using pairwise ordering scores. In Cui et al. , a\nsimilar strategy is proposed, where they leverage BERT for pairwise level\npredictions and improve the state of the art for the task. The same authors have\nnow come up with another approach in Li et al. , where they diffuse BERT\nfor richer sentence representations. Some other methods do not use pointer\nnetworks, but instead explore this problem with other solving strategies.\nPrabhumoye et al. [ref]31 framed the task of Sentence Ordering as a\nconstraint learning problem, where the constraint to be learned is the pairwise\nordering score of two sentences. To predict the optimal order, they represent\neach sentence as a node in a graph, and a directed edge exists between two nodes\nrepresented by s1subscript𝑠1s_{1} and s2subscript𝑠2s_{2} (from s1subscript𝑠1s_{1} to s2subscript𝑠2s_{2} ) if the pairwise score\nindicates that s2subscript𝑠2s_{2} comes after s1subscript𝑠1s_{1} . The final order is then the topological\nsort of this graph. Zhu et al.  also created a similar\nconstraint graph and used it to get individual sentence embeddings using graph\nneural networks  . ’ Considering this recent interest and advances in Sentence Ordering using pairwise models, this paper serves as a more fundamental exposition of the same; towards better understanding and improvement of key algorithmic and implementation aspects like incorporation of global context from other sentences and error propagation analysis for different decoding strategies.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: rely on hand-crafted features, they suffer\ngreatly when transferred to another domain or language. Recently, various neural network based approaches have been proposed for this\ntask. Window networks [ref]20 take as input a fixed window of\nsentences and outputs the coherence probability of the window. The embeddings of\nsentences are learned using Recurrent Neural Networks.
