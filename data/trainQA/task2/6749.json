      "content": "Paper Title: Knowledge-aware Collaborative Filtering with Pre-trained Language Model for Personalized Review-based Rating Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPersonalized rating prediction and top-N recommendation are the two main task types in recommender systems .\nThe contrast is that the former one is a regression task  while the latter one is a ranking task.\nThis paper concentrates on personalized review-based rating prediction.\nCompared with conventional personalized rating prediction, personalized review-based rating prediction  considers not only user, item, and rating, but also review text information.\nIn the last decade, many efforts have been devoted to this task.\nBasically, the rating prediction models could be summarized into two categories: shallow rating prediction   [ref]4  and deep rating prediction    . The pioneering study HFT  in shallow rating prediction utilizes probabilistic topic models [ref]21 to learn a topic distribution for each review.\nThe representation of either the user or the item associated with the review is directly transformed by the topic distribution.\nTopicMF  makes a step further by simultaneously associating both user and item representations with review topic distributions.\nTo utilize both advantages of latent factors learned by matrix factorization and topic factors learned by topic models, ITLFM [ref]4 combines them to form unified representations and exhibits better performance than HFT and TopicMF.\nHowever, these shallow rating prediction models have a limited model capacity and thus it is hard for them to learn more expressive representations. Thanks to the wave of development in deep learning , deep learning-based rating prediction models have emerged and dominated this field.\nThe major reason is attributed to the fact that deep learning does well in representation learning, which is crucial for review text modeling.\nDeepCoNN  is a representative study that uses convolutional neural networks for the task.\nFor a given user-item pair, DeepCoNN fuses all the reviews of the user into a long review document and this operation is repeated for the item.\nThen the convolutional neural network builds the user representation and the item representations based on the corresponding long review document, respectively.\nOn top of the convolutional neural networks, the user and item representation are concatenated and fed into Factorization Machine (FM) [ref]23 to estimate the rating.\nLater on, NARRE  argues that different reviews of a user or an item do not have exactly the same importance.\nAttention mechanism  is introduced to compute the importance weights.\nThey are used to combine review representations for representing the user or the item.\nSimilarly, CARL  exploits the attention mechanism to calculate the importance of each word to represent users and items.\nIn summary, all the above models learn user review text and item review text in a separate manner, without capturing their mutual interactions. To alleviate this issue, the models such as MPCN , DAML , and AHN  are proposed.\nFor MPCN, its most intriguing part is the review-level co-attention which calculates the affinity between anyone review from a user and anyone review from an item.\nThe affinity could be further used to select the most important review for composing user and item representations.\nSimilarly, DAML performs mutual attention between the local contextual features of a user and an item to capture the correlation of their reviews.\nThe local contextual features are obtained by convolution operation over the word vector matrices of reviews.\nAs such, both MPCN and DAML realize mutual attention between users and items from a symmetrical perspective.\nThe main difference between MPCN and DAML is the semantic level considered for attention computation.\nOn the contrary, AHN implements co-attention with an asymmetrical perspective.\nIt means that the attention-based review aggregation on the user side is guided by the item side, while on the item side, the review aggregation is not affected by the user side. To sum up, all the above models concentrate on directly modeling unstructured review text.\nBesides these models, there are some other studies investigating personalized review-based rating prediction from new perspectives.\nFor example, the study  considers the reliability of reviews by arguing that fake reviews would hurt the modeling performance.\nIt formulates a multi-task learning setting to simultaneously predict the rating score and the reliability score.\nIn contrast, this paper focuses on not only modeling the unstructured review text but also leveraging the fine-grained aspects extracted from reviews to achieve personalized review-based rating prediction. To our knowledge, there are a few studies that consider modeling the aspects of the studied task.\nSpecifically, EFM  incorporates explicit factors related to aspects into matrix factorization.\nSince it mainly focuses on explainability, there is much room for improving its rating prediction performance.\nANR  builds aspect-level user and item representations, and the importance of each aspect is estimated to generate overall ratings.\nAARM  performs interaction modeling on the combinatorial pairs of the aspects, wherein each pair is composed of one aspect from the user side and one aspect from the item side.\nCARP  associates each aspect representation with a sentiment capsule for rating prediction, which is beneficial for understanding the attitude of a user towards an aspect.\nBesides, aspect matching between different domains is also utilized for cross-domain rating prediction .\nHowever, these studies are only based on aspect modeling, overlooking simultaneously learning from both unstructured text and structured aspects.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: review text information.\nIn the last decade, many efforts have been devoted to this task.\nBasically, the rating prediction models could be summarized into two categories: shallow rating prediction   [ref]4  and deep rating prediction    . The pioneering study HFT  in shallow rating prediction utilizes probabilistic topic models [ref]21 to learn a topic distribution for each review.\nThe\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
