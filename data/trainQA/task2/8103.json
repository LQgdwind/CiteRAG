      "content": "Paper Title: Advancing Cyber Incident Timeline Analysis Through Rule-Based AI and Large Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, there has been a significant increase in cyber incidents due to exposed vulnerabilities, impacting a wide range of digital devices, including computers, IoT devices, network hardware (such as routers, switches, and IDS), and embedded systems. Data and artefacts resulting from these incidents are consistently considered and identified as evidence during the Digital Forensics (DF) investigation process .\nDigital Forensics (DF), including Threat Forensics (TF), is crucial for uncovering evidence and reconstructing the sequence of events . DF works closely with the Incident Response (IR) process, serving as a primary defense mechanism. Following a cyber incident, IR teams act immediately to identify, detect, and contain the threat. Subsequently, DF analysts and experts are tasked with collecting data and digital artefacts from the incident for in-depth investigations . However, the large volume and variety of data present significant challenges during Timeline Analysis (TA), necessitating rapid automated solutions . Unfortunately, few tools can perform this task accurately, promptly, and effectively. In response to this need, integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the DF process, particularly into TA, has become essential. AI represents a significant advancement in the field, offering new tools and methodologies for investigation and analysis\n, , [ref]7 . The AI landscape is broad and diverse, with each branch suited to specific tasks. For greater precision in DFIR, particularly within this research’s scope, Generative AI (GenAI) Large Language Models (LLMs) and Rule-Based AI (R-BAI) algorithms are considered optimal due to their unique characteristics and functionalities. LLMs surpass mere human-like creativity, playing a transformative role across various domains by enhancing productivity and automating complex tasks traditionally requiring human ingenuity [ref]8. Multimodal LLMs, which can process diverse data types such as images, audio files, and documents, are particularly noteworthy . Both multimodal and single-modal LLMs are applicable to tasks such as sentiment analysis, predictive text generation, pattern recognition, and natural language understanding and generation. While LLMs excel in semantic understanding, they lack true memory and genuine comprehension 0. To address these limitations, techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are employed to enhance context and performance by indexing external knowledge 1. In contrast, R-BAI algorithms are simpler and utilize straightforward if-then statements, making them suitable for rule-based tasks 2. Given the substantial data volume during DF data acquisition, R-BAI algorithms are effective for filtering and reducing data to manageable amounts. By applying predefined rules set by field professionals, we can focus on collecting only relevant digital artefacts and data. Combining these two AI technologies and techniques for TF analysis presents promising opportunities to improve the efficiency, accuracy, depth, and speed of digital investigations. However, it is crucial to ensure responsible deployment and address ethical considerations, including potential biases, privacy concerns, and the limitations inherent in AI-powered forensic practices 3.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: (AI) into the DF process, particularly into TA, has become essential.
