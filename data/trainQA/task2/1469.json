      "content": "Paper Title: CAnet: Uplink-aided Downlink Channel Acquisition in FDD Massive MIMO using Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince the standardization of the fifth generation (5G) communication system has gradually been solidified, researchers in the communication community are beginning to turn their attention to 5G evolution and 6G .\nFurther advancement, such as massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) with increased antennas, distributed antenna arrangement combined with new network topology, and increased layers for spatial multiplexing, is expected [ref]2.\nA massive MIMO architecture is integral to 5G networks, especially as a key technology to utilize millimeter waves effectively  .\nIn massive MIMO systems, base station (BSs) are equipped with a large number of antennas to improve spectral and energy efficiencies through relatively simple (linear) processing.\nHowever, reaping the full benefits of massive MIMO requires perfect knowledge of the\ndownlink channel state information (CSI) at the BSs. In time-division duplexing (TDD) systems, the downlink CSI can be inferred from the uplink CSI on the basis of the assumption of channel reciprocity.\nIn frequency-division duplexing (FDD) systems, where the downlink and the uplink use different frequency bands, channel reciprocity no longer holds.\nTo obtain the downlink CSI at the BS, a two-stage procedure is required.\nFirst, the BS transmits pilot symbols to the user equipment (UE).\nThen, the UE feeds back the estimated channel to the BS through the uplink.\nThis CSI acquisition strategy leads to considerable capacity reduction.\nTo simplify the channel estimation process, the pilots are designed to be orthogonal; hence, the number of pilots is proportional to the antenna number at the BS.\nThe feedback overhead is also proportional to the number of antennas at the BS .\nWith the large antenna dimensions of massive MIMO, the overhead of training and feedback is prohibitively large and consumes the entire system capacity, thereby hindering the implementation of FDD systems in future communications, especially in an uplink centric broadband communication scenario that will enable a 10-fold increase in uplink bandwidth .\nNevertheless, compared with TDD, the FDD mode is more effective for the systems that have symmetric traffic and delay-sensitive applications [ref]7. Several possible ways have been proposed to enable FDD in massive MIMO systems by reducing the downlink CSI acquisition overhead.\nCompressed sensing (CS), which is based on the sparsity assumption under some basis or dictionary, is regarded as a potential technology to alleviate this problem .\nIn massive MIMO systems, channel responses corresponding to different antennas are correlated, and a hidden joint sparsity property from shared local scatterers exists in the signal propagation environment.\nResearch has shown that this sparsity can be exploited to shrink the channel to an effective one that has a much lower dimension.\nFor example, the authors in [ref]7 propose CS-based pilot design schemes to reduce the training overhead by exploiting the hidden joint sparsity.\nFor the downlink CSI feedback, CS algorithms can be exploited to compress and reconstruct CSI at the UE and the BS, respectively.\nIn this way, the feedback overhead can be greatly reduced, as in .\nHowever, the CS-based pilot design, channel estimation, and CSI feedback only exploit the sparsity as the prior information and ignore the fact that the CSI is highly related to the environment of the UE.\nMeanwhile, CS problems are often solved using iterative algorithms, which are of high complexity and are time consuming.\nThese drawbacks hinder the implementation of CS-based algorithms in communications. Recently, deep learning (DL) has achieved great success in many applications, such as computer vision and natural language processing.\nIn communications, among all technological works pertaining to 6G, DL has been regarded as one of the most eye-catching ideas, which will be the ground-breaking technology in 6G  [ref]2.\nConsiderable DL-based applications to communications exist, especially in the physical layer 0 1.\nDL is widely used to enhance certain modules of conventional communication systems, such as channel prediction 2 3, joint channel estimation and signal detection 4 5, and beamforming (BF) design 6.\nMoreover, an end-to-end communication has been proposed to change the classic communication structure completely 7. The CsiNet introduced by 8 is the first attempt to apply DL to CSI feedback.\nCsiNet is based on autoencoder architecture in which the encoder and the decoder compress and reconstruct the downlink CSI, respectively.\nDifferent from the CS-based algorithms that exploit only the sparsity characteristic and solve optimization problems by using iterative methods with high complexity, the DL-based method can learn the environment and realize reconstruction with high accuracy in a short time by exploiting graphics processing units (GPUs) 0.\nThe temporal correlation is exploited using long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture to improve the feedback accuracy of time-varying channels in 9.\nOn the basis of the high correlation in magnitude among bidirectional channels in the delay domain, DualNet in  uses the uplink magnitude information to help in the reconstruction of the downlink channel magnitude.\nThe authors in   introduce CoCsiNet and distributed DeepCMC, which exploit the correlation among nearby UE.\nA quantization module and a multiple-rate feedback framework are introduced to the DL-based CSI feedback in .\nTo reduce the feedback bits further, the authors in  add an entropy-coding module following the quantization.\nThe authors in  consider the BF design with DL-based CSI feedback and propose joint feedback and BF design frameworks for single- and multi-cell systems, respectively.\nThe neural network (NN) complexity, feedback noise, joint channel estimation and feedback, and feedback safety are studied in     , respectively.\nThe performance of DL-based CSI feedback in practical systems is evaluated in 0 1.\nThe experimental results in 1 show that the DL-based\nchannel feedback framework can offer an average of 73% airtime\noverhead reduction and increase throughput by approximately 69%\ncompared with the 802.11 feedback protocols.\nThese results show the high potential of DL-based CSI feedback in the 6G era. Most of the aforementioned works, except , consider only the feedback process and assume that the UE has obtained perfect downlink CSI, which is impossible in practical systems.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, the downlink CSI acquisition of FDD systems comprises three main steps: pilot transmission, channel estimation, and feedback.\nThese steps interact and affect one another.\nEven if one step achieves optimal performance, the performance of the total system may not be optimal.\nFor example, given that the feedback is lossy and introduces errors into the CSI, whether the downlink channel should be estimated as accurately as possible at the expense of the high training overhead causes a doubt.\nTherefore, a complete downlink CSI acquisition framework for FDD massive MIMO systems should be designed. In this paper, we propose a DL-based uplink-aided downlink CSI acquisition framework (called CAnet) for FDD massive MIMO systems.\nIf the duplex distance is not large in FDD systems, a loose and abstract form of reciprocity exists between the downlink and uplink channels 2 3 4 5 6.\nFor instance, assuming that the angle of arrival of the signals in the uplink transmission is the same as the angle of departure (AoD) of the signals in the downlink transmission is reasonable.\nThat is, the directions of signal paths are invariant to carrier frequency shift 4.\nThis characteristic is exploited in this study to alleviate the acquisition overhead of the downlink CSI, including channel estimation and feedback. In existing wireless systems, the downlink CSI is estimated at the UE from the pilot signals sent by the BS.\nDuring this phase, the pilot design exploits only the statistical CSI information, and the pilot is fixed.\nIn other words, the pilot cannot be adjusted in accordance with the real channel environment.\nThe BS has the knowledge of the uplink CSI; accordingly, designing the downlink pilot by exploiting the obtained downlink CSI is rational.\nToward this end, the pilot design and channel estimation modules in this paper are jointly trained via an end-to-end learning.\nAs such, we introduce an adaptive pilot design strategy, where\nthe downlink pilot can adapt to the corresponding uplink channel rather than\nthe widely used statistical channel information. Compared with the fixed pilot design 7, such an adaptive strategy can achieve considerable performance gains. In existing DL-based feedback works, to exploit the correlation between the bidirectional channels in the delay domain  and the nearby UE in the angular domain , the magnitude and the phase of the downlink are fed back separately, which leads to a complicated bit allocation problem between the feedback of CSI magnitude and phase.\nTo avoid this problem, we propose to send back the complex CSI directly and fuse the side information, i.e., downlink CSI magnitude, into the decoder.\nCompared with the traditional algorithms that need hand-designed information mixture, the DL-based method can fuse the information automatically 3.\nIn this work, NNs learn and exploit the correlation through an end-to-end learning. Practical wireless systems first estimate the downlink channel, then compress and feed back it to the BS.\nWhether estimating the downlink channel at the UE first, which needs extra computing power compared with directly feeding back the received signals, is necessary is being questioned.\nIn this process, additional side information, such as the uplink CSI, is available at the BS and can help reconstruct the downlink channel.\nNonetheless, this information is unavailable at UE in real applications.\nIf the UE has to estimate the full CSI, then the received pilot signals have to contain all information about the downlink channel, which necessitates increased training and feedback overheads.\nIf the UE directly feeds back the pilot signals, then the BS reconstructs the downlink CSI by exploiting the feedback pilot signals and side information, i.e., uplink channel, which may reduce the CSI acquisition overhead.\nThus, we propose and compare two different feedback strategies: explicit and implicit feedback.\nIn the former, we divide the downlink CSI acquisition into two steps: joint uplink-aided pilot design and channel estimation and uplink-aided feedback.\nThe implicit feedback considers the downlink CSI acquisition as an indivisible task.\nOnce the UE obtains the pilot signal, it directly compresses and quantizes the received signal and then feeds back the bitstreams to the BS.\nThe entire process is realized using an NN-based module rather than two separated modules.\nIf the proposed NNs are applied to practical systems, the complexity problem cannot be ignored.\nConsequently, we apply NN weight pruning, a representative NN compression technique, to the proposed\nCAnet framework, thereby greatly reducing the requirement of memory, power consumption, and model storage space. The major contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: To design the pilot in accordance with the instantaneous channel characteristic rather than fixed pilot in existing systems, we propose an adaptive pilot design strategy by exploiting the correlation of the bidirectional channels in the magnitude domain, thereby reducing channel estimation errors. On the basis of the DL’s ability to mix information automatedly, we directly feed back the complex downlink channel and embed the uplink channel magnitude to the reconstruction module at the BS rather than feeding back the magnitude and the phase separately, thereby avoiding the complicated bit allocation problem that hinders the deployment of the existing uplink-aided CSI feedback. Existing systems estimate the downlink CSI first at the UE, which may be unnecessary.\nTherefore, we propose and compare two types of DL-based CSI acquisition frameworks. The first framework initially designs downlink pilots and realizes channel estimation and then feeds back the estimated CSI by using NNs.\nThe second one regards the entire downlink CSI acquisition process as an indivisible task and realizes it by using an NN-based module, which is an implicit feedback strategy.\nThe simulation results show that, with the aid of uplink, directly feeding back the pilot signals can save approximately 20% of feedback bits. We also consider the high complexity of the NN-based CAnet framework and apply an NN compression technique, i.e., NN weight pruning, to the proposed NNs.\nThe weight pruning greatly reduces the NN complexity without performance drop. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.\nSection II introduces the massive MIMO channel model and the conventional entire downlink CSI acquisition process.\nSections III and IV present the motivations and NN details of the uplink-aided downlink pilot design and channel estimation framework and the uplink-aided downlink CSI feedback framework, respectively.\nSection V introduces two CSI acquisition frameworks, CAnet-J and CAnet-S, and applies NN weight pruning to the proposed NNs.\nSection VI provides the numerical results of the proposed NN frameworks and demonstrates the effects of NN weight pruning on the proposed NNs.\nSection VII concludes our paper.
