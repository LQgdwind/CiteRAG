      "content": "Paper Title: Finite-Time Analysis of Asynchronous Q-learning under Diminishing Step-Size from Control-Theoretic View\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we reformulate Q-learning update in algorithm 1 into a state-space representation of a control system , which is commonly used in control literature. Using matrix notations, the Q-learning algorithm with i.i.d. observation model in algorithm 1 can be written as follows: where D∈ℝ|𝒮|​|𝒜|×|𝒮|​|𝒜|𝐷superscriptℝ𝒮𝒜𝒮𝒜D\\in{\\mathbb{R}}^{|{\\cal S}||{\\cal A}|\\times|{\\cal S}||{\\cal A}|} is a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements being the current state-action distributions, i.e., and is an i.i.d. noise term. Note that the noise term is unbiased conditioned on Qksubscript𝑄𝑘Q_{k}, i.e., 𝔼​[wk|Qk]=0𝔼delimited-[]conditionalsubscript𝑤𝑘subscript𝑄𝑘0{\\mathbb{E}}[w_{k}|Q_{k}]=0.\nMoreover, using the above bound on ‖Qk‖∞subscriptnormsubscript𝑄𝑘||Q_{k}||_{\\infty}, a bound on wksubscript𝑤𝑘w_{k} can be established as follows. Under i.i.d. observation model, the stochastic noise, wksubscript𝑤𝑘w_{k}, defined in (12), is bounded as follows: for all k≥0𝑘0k\\geq 0, where ℱksubscriptℱ𝑘\\mathcal{F}_{k} is a σ𝜎\\sigma-field induced by {(si,ai,si′,ri,Qi)}i=0ksuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑠𝑖subscript𝑎𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑠𝑖′subscript𝑟𝑖subscript𝑄𝑖𝑖0𝑘\\{(s_{i},a_{i},s_{i}^{\\prime},r_{i},Q_{i})\\}_{i=0}^{k}. The proof is given in Appendix Section 9.4. Furthermore, using Bellman equation in (7), one can readily prove that the error term Qk−Q∗subscript𝑄𝑘superscript𝑄Q_{k}-Q^{*} evolves according to the following dynamic system: where In particular, this representation follows from the relations where the first equality comes from the Bellman equation (7), the second and third equalities are obtained by simply rearranging terms, and the last equality comes from (16) just by simplifying the related terms. Note that compared to the linear stochastic approximation, the Q-learning update, has affine term bQ,ksubscript𝑏𝑄𝑘b_{Q,k}, which imposes difficulty in the analysis of the algorithm. Now, we can view AQ,ksubscript𝐴𝑄𝑘A_{Q,k} as a system matrix of a stochastic linear time-varying switching system in the following senses: The system matrix is switched due to the max operator; The system matrix is time-varying due to the diminising step-size. In this paper, we will study convergence of Q-learning based on control system perspectives with the above interpretations. In particular, to analyze the convergence, we will use notions in control community such as Lyapunov theory for stability analysis of dynamical systems. First of all, we introduce the following result. For any Q∈ℝ|𝒮|​|𝒜|𝑄superscriptℝ𝒮𝒜Q\\in\\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{S}||\\mathcal{A}|}, and k≥0𝑘0k\\geq 0, The column sum for each row becomes where the second equality is due to the fact that each element of AQ,ksubscript𝐴𝑄𝑘A_{Q,k} is positive. Taking maximum over the row index, we get ∎ Using similar arguments, one can also prove that TQsubscript𝑇𝑄T_{Q}, which can be thought of as system matrix for continuous dynamics, is Hurwitz matrix, which can be proved using the strict diagonal dominance in Definition 2.2. TQsubscript𝑇𝑄T_{Q} is Hurwitz for all Q∈ℝ|𝒮|​|𝒜|𝑄superscriptℝ𝒮𝒜Q\\in\\mathbb{R}^{|{\\cal S}||{\\cal A}|}. In addition, we have From Lemma 2.1, it suffices to prove that TQsubscript𝑇𝑄T_{Q} is strictly row diagonally dominant which is defined in Definition 2.2. Each component can be calculated as follows: Now, we can prove that the diagonal part dominates the off-diagonal part, i.e., from the following relation: Since the diagonal term is negative, TQsubscript𝑇𝑄T_{Q} is Hurwitz by Lemma 2.1. Moreover, ∎ Proceeding on, consider the stochastic update (15). Ignoring the stochastic term αk​wksubscript𝛼𝑘subscript𝑤𝑘\\alpha_{k}w_{k}, it can be viewed as a discrete-time switched affine system. Unfortunately, analysis of a switched affine system is more involved than that of a switched linear system. The recent result in [ref]31 overcame this difficulty by introducing the notion of the upper and lower comparison systems corresponding to the original system. In particular, [ref]31 introduced a switching system representation of the continuous-time O.D.E. model corresponding to Q-learning. Then, the stability has been proved based on comparison of the upper and lower comparison systems of the original system in (15). Moreover,  extended this framework to a discrete-time setting, and derived finite-time convergence analysis under constant step-sizes. The overall idea is illustrated in Figure 1. However, when a time-varying step-size is used, it imposes significant difficulties in the analysis, which will be illustrated in the following sections.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: it can be viewed as a discrete-time switched affine system.
