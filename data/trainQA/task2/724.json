In recent years, reduction rules have frequently been added to branch-and-bound methods yielding so-called branch-and-reduce algorithms¬†.\nThese algorithms are able to improve the worst-case runtime of branch-and-bound algorithms by applications of reduction rules to the current graph before each branching step.\nFor the unweighted case, a large number of branch-and-reduce\nalgorithms have been developed in the past. The currently best exact\nsolver 2, which won the PACE challenge\n2019¬†2  , uses a portfolio of branch-and-reduce/bound solvers for the\ncomplementary problems.\nHowever, for a long time, virtually no weighted reduction rules were known, which is why hardly any branch-and-reduce algorithms exist for the MWIS problem. To the best of our knowledge, the first and only branch-and-reduce algorithm for the weighted case was recently presented by Lamm¬†et¬†al.¬†5.\nThe authors first introduce two meta-reductions called neighborhood removal and neighborhood folding, from which they derive a new set of weighted reduction rules.\nOn this foundation a branch-and-reduce algorithm is developed using pruning with weighted clique covers similar to the approach by Warren and Hicks¬† for upper bounds and an adapted version of the ARW local search¬† for lower bounds.\nThe experimental evaluation shows that their algorithm can solve a large set of real-world instances and outperform state-of-the-art algorithms. Finally, there are exact procedures which are either based on other extension of the branch-and-bound paradigm, e.g.¬†0 7 6, or on the reformulation into other ùí©‚Äãùí´ùí©ùí´\\mathcal{NP}-complete problems, for which a variety of solvers already exist.\nFor instance, Xu¬†et¬†al.¬†9 recently developed an algorithm called SBMS, which calculates an optimal solution for a given MWVC instance by solving a series of SAT instances.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: resulting in a search tree.\nOver the years, branch-and-bound methods have been improved by new branching schemes or better pruning methods using upper and lower bounds to exclude specific subtrees¬†[ref]7  .\nIn particular, Warren and Hicks¬† proposed three branch-and-bound algorithms that combine the use of weighted clique covers and a branching scheme first introduced by Balas and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
