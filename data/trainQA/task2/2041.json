      "content": "Paper Title: A Hybrid SIE-PDE Formulation Without Boundary Condition Requirement for Transverse Magnetic Electromagnetic Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe first illustrate the detailed derivation of the equivalent model with the single electric current density for objects with piecewise homogeneous media. To make the derivation concise, a single penetrable object with the permittivity ε1subscript𝜀1{\\varepsilon_{1}}, permeability μ1subscript𝜇1{\\mu_{1}}, and conductivity σ1subscript𝜎1{\\sigma_{1}} is first considered, as shown in Fig. 2(a). Its boundary is denoted as γ1subscript𝛾1{\\gamma_{1}}. According to the surface equivalence theorem [38, Ch. 12, pp. 653-658], an equivalent model can be obtained, in which the object is replaced by its surrounding medium, and a surface equivalent electric current density is introduced on γ1subscript𝛾1\\gamma_{1}. To further enforce the electric fields in the original and equivalent configurations equal to each other on γ1subscript𝛾1{\\gamma_{1}}, a single-source (SS) formulation with only the electric current density on γ1subscript𝛾1{\\gamma_{1}} is obtained in Fig. 2(b) . (a) (b) Without loss of generality, the penetrable object does not include any sources. Therefore, the electric fields inside the penetrable object must satisfy the following homogeneous scalar Helmholtz equation subject to the boundary condition where E1subscript𝐸1{E_{1}}, E^1subscript^𝐸1{\\widehat{E}_{1}} denote the electric fields inside γ1subscript𝛾1{\\gamma_{1}} for the original and equivalent models, respectively, and E1​(𝐫)|𝐫∈γ1evaluated-atsubscript𝐸1𝐫𝐫subscript𝛾1{\\left.{{E_{1}}\\left({\\mathbf{r}}\\right)}\\right|_{\\mathbf{r}\\in{\\gamma_{1}}}}, E^1​(𝐫)|𝐫∈γ1evaluated-atsubscript^𝐸1𝐫𝐫subscript𝛾1{\\left.{{{\\widehat{E}}_{1}}\\left({\\mathbf{r}}\\right)}\\right|_{\\mathbf{r}\\in{\\gamma_{1}}}} denote their values on the inner side of γ1subscript𝛾1{\\gamma_{1}}. (1) can be solved through the contour integral method . Then, the electric fields inside γ1subscript𝛾1{\\gamma_{1}} can be expressed in terms of E1subscript𝐸1{E_{1}} and its normal derivative on γ1subscript𝛾1{\\gamma_{1}} as where T=1/2𝑇12T=1/2, when the source point 𝐫′superscript𝐫′\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime} and the observation point 𝐫𝐫\\mathbf{r} are located on the same boundary, otherwise, T=1𝑇1T=1. G1​(𝐫,𝐫′)subscript𝐺1𝐫superscript𝐫′{G_{1}}\\left({\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}}\\right) is the Green’s function, which is given by G1​(𝐫,𝐫′)=−j​H0(2)​(k1​ρ)/4subscript𝐺1𝐫superscript𝐫′𝑗superscriptsubscript𝐻02subscript𝑘1𝜌4{G_{1}}\\left({\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}}\\right)=-jH_{0}^{\\left(2\\right)}\\left({{k_{1}}\\rho}\\right)/4, where j=−1𝑗1j=\\sqrt{-1}, ρ=|𝐫−𝐫′|𝜌𝐫superscript𝐫′\\rho=\\left|{\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}}\\right|, k1subscript𝑘1{k_{1}} denotes the wave number in the penetrable object, and H0(2)​(⋅)superscriptsubscript𝐻02⋅H_{0}^{\\left(2\\right)}\\left(\\cdot\\right) denotes the zeroth-order Hankel function of the second kind. 𝐧𝐧\\mathbf{n}, 𝐧′superscript𝐧′\\mathbf{n}^{\\prime} denote the unit normal vector pointing outward γ1subscript𝛾1{\\gamma_{1}} at the observation point 𝐫𝐫\\mathbf{r} and the source point 𝐫′superscript𝐫′\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}, respectively. In addition, the tangential magnetic field on γ1subscript𝛾1{\\gamma_{1}}, which is related to the electric field through the Poincare-Steklov operator , can be written as where μ1subscript𝜇1{\\mu_{1}} is the permeability of the penetrable object. We introduce the surface admittance operator (SAO) 𝒴𝒴\\mathcal{Y} [ref]42, which relates the normal derivative of electric fields to electric fields on γ1subscript𝛾1{\\gamma_{1}} . Therefore, it can be expressed as By substituting (5) into (3), we have To make the derivation more concise, we borrow some notations from [ref]42. Then, (6) is compactly expressed in an operator format as where g1subscript𝑔1{g_{1}}, g1​n′subscript𝑔1superscript𝑛′{g_{1n^{\\prime}}} denote the integral operators for the Green’s function and its normal derivative on γ1subscript𝛾1{\\gamma_{1}}, respectively. Their expressions are given by After moving the second term of (7) on its right hand side (RHS) to its left hand side (LHS) and inverting the integral operator g1subscript𝑔1{g_{1}}, 𝒴1subscript𝒴1{\\mathcal{Y}_{1}} can be expressed as where I𝐼I is the identity operator. Therefore, (4) can be rewritten via the SAO as Then, the surface equivalence theorem is applied through replacing the penetrable object inside γ1subscript𝛾1{\\gamma_{1}} by its surrounding medium. The equivalent model with only the single electric current density is derived, as shown in Fig. 2(b), and 𝒴^1subscript^𝒴1\\widehat{\\mathcal{Y}}_{1} can be expressed as The tangential magnetic field H^t1​(𝐫)subscript^𝐻subscript𝑡1𝐫{{\\widehat{H}_{t_{1}}}\\left({\\mathbf{r}}\\right)} on γ1subscript𝛾1{\\gamma_{1}} can also be achieved through the SAO in the equivalent model (a) (b) (c) (d) Since the boundary condition (2) is enforced, the magnetic current density in the equivalent configuration vanishes, and only the electric current density J1subscript𝐽1{J_{1}} is introduced on γ1subscript𝛾1{\\gamma_{1}} to keep fields outside γ1subscript𝛾1{\\gamma_{1}} unchanged. According to the surface equivalence theorem [38, Ch. 12, pp. 653-658], the equivalent electric current density J1subscript𝐽1{J_{1}} is expressed as By substituting (9) and (11) into (12), J1subscript𝐽1{J_{1}} can be rewritten as where 𝒴s1subscript𝒴subscript𝑠1{\\mathcal{Y}_{{s_{1}}}} is the differential surface admittance operator (DSAO)  defined on γ1subscript𝛾1\\gamma_{1}. (13) relates the surface equivalent electric current density J1subscript𝐽1{J_{1}} to electric fields E1subscript𝐸1{E_{1}} on γ1subscript𝛾1{\\gamma_{1}}. When complex objects embedded in multilayers, composite structures with partial connected penetrable and PEC objects are involved in the SIE domain, as shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), equivalent models with only the electric current density Jnsubscript𝐽𝑛{J_{n}} can still be derived through replacing those objects by the background medium, as shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d). Interested readers are referred to  for more details to obtain the equivalent models. In a word, the tangential magnetic fields on γnsubscript𝛾𝑛{\\gamma_{n}} for the original and equivalent models can also be achieved through the SAO given by Here Htnsubscript𝐻subscript𝑡𝑛{H_{t_{n}}}, H^tnsubscript^𝐻subscript𝑡𝑛{\\widehat{H}_{t_{n}}}, Ensubscript𝐸𝑛{E_{n}}, E^nsubscript^𝐸𝑛{{\\widehat{E}}_{n}}, 𝒴nsubscript𝒴𝑛\\mathcal{Y}_{n}, 𝒴^nsubscript^𝒴𝑛\\widehat{\\mathcal{Y}}_{n} denote the tangential magnetic fields and electric fields on γnsubscript𝛾𝑛{\\gamma_{n}}, and the SAO for the original and equivalent models, respectively. Similar to the boundary condition (2), we also enforce En​(𝐫)|𝐫∈γn=E^n​(𝐫)|𝐫∈γnevaluated-atsubscript𝐸𝑛𝐫𝐫subscript𝛾𝑛evaluated-atsubscript^𝐸𝑛𝐫𝐫subscript𝛾𝑛{\\left.{{E_{n}}\\left({\\mathbf{r}}\\right)}\\right|_{\\mathbf{r}\\in{\\gamma_{n}}}}={\\left.{{{\\widehat{E}}_{n}}\\left({\\mathbf{r}}\\right)}\\right|_{\\mathbf{r}\\in{\\gamma_{n}}}} on γnsubscript𝛾𝑛{\\gamma_{n}}. Then, the equivalent electric current density on γnsubscript𝛾𝑛{\\gamma_{n}} can be derived and expressed as where 𝒴snsubscript𝒴subscript𝑠𝑛{\\mathcal{Y}}_{s_{n}} is the DSAO defined on γnsubscript𝛾𝑛\\gamma_{n}.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: through the Poincare-Steklov operator , can be written as where μ1subscript𝜇1{\\mu_{1}} is the permeability of the penetrable object. We introduce the surface admittance operator (SAO) 𝒴𝒴\\mathcal{Y} [ref]42, which relates the normal derivative of electric fields to electric fields on γ1subscript𝛾1{\\gamma_{1}} . Therefore, it can be expressed as By substituting (5) into (3), we have To make the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
