      "content": "Paper Title: Retrosynthesis Prediction via Search in (Hyper) Graph\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe template serves as a reaction representation thatâ€™s both more efficient and interpretable . After establishing a library of reaction templates, the methods involve comparing a target molecule against these templates. Upon finding a match, the corresponding template is utilized to transform product molecules into reactant molecules. Numerous research efforts have introduced various strategies for prioritizing templates. In prior studies, [ref]3 utilized molecular fingerprint similarity between the intended product and compounds in the dataset to prioritize potential templates. Meanwhile,  employed Neuralsym, a hybrid neural-symbolic model, to glean insights for a multi-class classification task focused on template selection. Additionally,  interpreted chemical insights within reaction templates as logical rules, utilizing graph embeddings to derive the conditional joint probability of these rules and reactants. Furthermore,  evaluated pertinent local templates within forecasted reaction centers of a target molecule. It also accounted for the non-local impacts of chemical reactions by integrating global reactivity attention.   composes templates by selecting and annotating molecule subgraphs from training templates. Despite their interpretability, template-based methods have restricted applicability due to their incapability to forecast reactions beyond the template library. Moreover, their suitability diminishes when dealing with extensive template sets due to the challenges inherent in subgraph matching.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: corresponding template is utilized to transform product molecules into reactant molecules.
