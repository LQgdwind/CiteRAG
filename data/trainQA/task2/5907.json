      "content": "Paper Title: Dichotomies for Maximum Matching Cut: 𝐻-Freeness, Bounded Diameter, Bounded Radius1footnote 11footnote 1An extended abstract of this paper appeared in the proceedings of MFCS 2023 [33].\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe already mentioned the known generalization of Matching Cut (i.e. 111-Cut) to d𝑑d-Cut. In our paper, we consider a different kind of generalization, namely Maximum Matching Cut, which is to determine a largest matching cut of a connected graph (if a matching cut exists).\nSo far, this problem has only been studied for the extreme case, where the task is to decide if a connected graph has a perfect matching cut, that is, a matching cut that saturates every vertex; see also Figure 2. This variant was introduced as Perfect Matching Cut by Heggernes and Telle , who proved that it is NP-complete. We briefly discuss some very recent results for Perfect Matching Cut on special graph classes below. It is readily seen that the gadget in the NP-hardness reduction of Heggernes and Telle  has diameter 666 and radius 333. We recall that the NP-hardness gadget of Le and Le  for (3​P6,2​P7,P14)3subscript𝑃62subscript𝑃7subscript𝑃14(3P_{6},2P_{7},P_{14})-free graphs even has diameter 444 (and radius 333). It is also known that Perfect Matching Cut is polynomial-time solvable for graphs of radius (and thus also diameter) at most 222 . Hence, we only obtain a dichotomy for graphs of bounded radius but in this case, only a partial complexity classification for graphs of bounded diameter. For integers d𝑑d and r𝑟r, Perfect Matching Cut for graphs of diameter d𝑑d and for graphs of radius r𝑟r is polynomial-time solvable if d≤2𝑑2d\\leq 2 or r≤2𝑟2r\\leq 2, respectively, and NP-complete if d≥4𝑑4d\\geq 4 or r≥3𝑟3r\\geq 3, respectively. For 1≤h≤i≤j1ℎ𝑖𝑗1\\leq h\\leq i\\leq j, the graph Sh,i,jsubscript𝑆ℎ𝑖𝑗S_{h,i,j} is the tree of maximum degree 333 with exactly one vertex u𝑢u of degree 333,\nwhose leaves are at distance hℎh, i𝑖i and j𝑗j, respectively, from u𝑢u; note S1,1,1=K1,3subscript𝑆111subscript𝐾13S_{1,1,1}=K_{1,3}. It is known that Perfect Matching Cut is polynomial-time solvable for\nS1,2,2subscript𝑆122S_{1,2,2}-free graphs (and thus for K1,3subscript𝐾13K_{1,3}-free graphs) [ref]31; P6subscript𝑃6P_{6}-free graphs ; and for pseudo-chordal graphs [ref]31 (and thus for\nchordal graphs, i.e., (C4,C5,…)subscript𝐶4subscript𝐶5…(C_{4},C_{5},\\ldots)-free graphs). Moreover, Perfect Matching Cut is polynomial-time solvable for (H+P4)𝐻subscript𝑃4(H+P_{4})-free graphs if it is polynomial-time solvable for H𝐻H-free graphs . It is also known that Perfect Matching Cut is NP-complete even for 333-connected cubic planar bipartite graphs , (3​P6,2​P7,P14)3subscript𝑃62subscript𝑃7subscript𝑃14(3P_{6},2P_{7},P_{14})-free graphs ,\nK1,4subscript𝐾14K_{1,4}-free bipartite graphs of girth g𝑔g for every g≥3𝑔3g\\geq 3 [ref]31 and for Hi∗superscriptsubscript𝐻𝑖H_{i}^{*}-free graphs for every i≥1𝑖1i\\geq 1 . This gives us a partial complexity classification: For a graph H𝐻H, Perfect Matching Cut on H𝐻H-free graphs is polynomial-time solvable if H⊆is​P4+S1,2,2subscript𝑖𝐻𝑠subscript𝑃4subscript𝑆122H\\subseteq_{i}sP_{4}+S_{1,2,2} or s​P4+P6𝑠subscript𝑃4subscript𝑃6sP_{4}+P_{6} for some s≥0𝑠0s\\geq 0, and NP-complete if H⊇iK1,4subscriptsuperset-of-or-equals𝑖𝐻subscript𝐾14H\\supseteq_{i}K_{1,4}, P14subscript𝑃14P_{14}, 2​P72subscript𝑃72P_{7}, 3​P63subscript𝑃63P_{6}, Crsubscript𝐶𝑟C_{r} for some r≥3𝑟3r\\geq 3 or Hj∗superscriptsubscript𝐻𝑗H_{j}^{*} for some j≥1𝑗1j\\geq 1. From Theorem 1.4 it can be seen that again only cases where H𝐻H is a linear forest remain open. However, the number of open cases is smaller than for Matching Cut. So far, all known complexities for Matching Cut and Perfect Matching Cut on special graph classes coincide except for (sub)cubic graphs.\nWe note that whenever Maximum Matching Cut is polynomial-time solvable for some graph class, then so are Matching Cut and Perfect Matching Cut.\nSimilarly, if one of the latter two problems is NP-complete, then Maximum Matching Cut is NP-hard. For instance, this immediately yields a complexity dichotomy for graphs of maximum degree at most ΔΔ\\Delta. Namely, as Maximum Matching Cut is trivial if Δ=2Δ2\\Delta=2 and Perfect Matching Cut is NP-complete if Δ=3Δ3\\Delta=3, we have a complexity jump\nfrom Δ=2Δ2\\Delta=2 to Δ=3Δ3\\Delta=3, just like Perfect Matching Cut; recall that for Matching Cut this jump appears from Δ=3Δ3\\Delta=3 to Δ=4Δ4\\Delta=4.\nWe consider the following research question: For which graph classes is Maximum Matching Cut harder than Matching Cut and Perfect Matching Cut and for which graph classes do the complexities coincide?\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: It is known that Perfect Matching Cut is polynomial-time solvable for\nS1,2,2subscript𝑆122S_{1,2,2}-free graphs (and thus for K1,3subscript𝐾13K_{1,3}-free graphs) [ref]31; P6subscript𝑃6P_{6}-free graphs ; and for pseudo-chordal graphs [ref]31 (and thus for\nchordal graphs, i.e., (C4,C5,…)subscript𝐶4subscript𝐶5…(C_{4},C_{5},\\ldots)-free graphs).
