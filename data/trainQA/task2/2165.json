      "content": "Paper Title: pix2rule: End-to-end Neuro-symbolic Rule Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate our approach‚Äôs ability to learn symbolic rules in a differentiable manner, scalability and performance in the presence of input noise. To learn full logic rules such as in Fig.¬†1(a), we stack two semi-symbolic layers, one conjunctive and one disjunctive, for a disjunctive normal form (DNF) layer. While theoretically different combinations of SL layers can extend the space of possible logic programs to a larger language including constraints and predicates with arity greater than two, we focus on learning first-order (recursive) normal logic programs without function symbols and excluding constraints. We also work with the nullary/1, unary/2 and binary/3 predicates since any logic program can be converted to a program using this signature.\nThe DNF layer is constructed with a maximum number of variables |V‚Äã(‚Ñãi)|ùëâsubscript‚Ñãùëñ|V({\\mathcal{H}}_{i})| and fixed |‚Ñç|‚Ñç|{\\mathbb{H}}| to learn first-order rules rather than just propositional formula. When viewed as a fully-connected graph with variable symbols as the nodes (similar to Fig.¬†1(a)), the maximum number of edges |E‚Äã(‚Ñãi)|ùê∏subscript‚Ñãùëñ|E({\\mathcal{H}}_{i})| corresponds to the maximum length (number of body atoms) of the learnable rules. We gather all combinations (|V‚Äã(ùí¢)||V‚Äã(‚Ñãi)|)binomialùëâùí¢ùëâsubscript‚Ñãùëñ\\binom{|V({\\mathcal{G}})|}{|V({\\mathcal{H}}_{i})|} to effectively curate every possible object to variable binding, shown as Permute step in Fig.¬†2. This grounding step converts first-order normal rules in question into their propositional instantiations over which SL layers from Section¬†2 are used. Although this binding is combinatorial, the evaluation of the rule under every binding can be computed in parallel which benefits from the increasing computing infrastructure available.\nIn cases where the desired rules require specific constants as literal arguments, the instantiations could be restricted at the permutation step to adjust the hypothesis space accordingly.\nAfter the conjunctive SL, we use the max\\max operator over the instantiations of any existential variables that may occur in the rules.\nThe DNF layer is used as a standalone model for the subgraph set isomorphism dataset or in tandem with upstream image processing layers for the relations game as in Fig.¬†2.\nWe train all deep models using Adam¬† with a fixed learning rate of 0.001 and the negative log-likelihood loss on an Intel Core i7 CPU and report the median results to avoid outliers. For all the hyper-parameters and further training details, please refer to Section¬†A.6. Can the DNF layer learn symbolic rules in a scalable, differentiable manner? We train a standalone DNF layer on the subgraph set isomorphism dataset for 10k batch updates with a batch size of 128. The results with continuous weights (DNF) and with pruning, thresholding (DNF+t) are compared against two state-of-the-art symbolic learners: ILASP¬† (2i as the recommended version for non-noisy tasks) and the recent more scalable FastLAS¬†.\nWe also considered state-of-the-art rule mining system AMIE¬†[ref]36 but it does not support negated rules and uses breath-first search that does not scale well to long rules.\nWe were only able to run the symbolic learners for the easy size because they do not report progress or allow checkpointing making them infeasible for distributed shared computing infrastructure. FastLAS on an isolated machine did not terminate after 16 hours on the medium difficulty. In Table¬†2, we observe that DNF layer scales better than symbolic learners to larger rule sizes and since it is trained for fixed number of iterations maintains a steady training time. Since DNF+t is thresholded, we have exact logic semantics which correspond to the symbolic rules learnt by the symbolic systems. We can convert the thresholded weights into ASP rules and test them using clingo¬†[ref]24 to verify that our approach has indeed learnt correct symbolic rules in a differentiable manner. How does the DNF layer cope with input noise? We perturb the input since learnt latent representations of low-level signals are likely to be noisy. Hence, we add input noise to the subgraph set isomorphism dataset by randomly flipping the truth values of E‚Äã(ùí¢)ùê∏ùí¢E({\\mathcal{G}}) in the training set with a fixed probability shown in Table¬†3. We observe that the DNF layer performs well up to 0.3 where the median accuracy drops below 0.9. The pruning and thresholding steps seem to improve the performance with lower levels of noise, likely because incorrect weights are removed against a non-noisy validation set. To perform neuro-symbolic reasoning with images, we now combine the DNF layer with upstream convolutional neural networks (CNN) and object selection layers to construct the full neuro-symbolic DNF model (DNF), Fig.¬†2. The image is processed in patches by the CNN to obtain a set of 9 candidate objects. Since reasoning with 9 objects at the same time creates a large grounding for the DNF layer, we use an attention based object selection layer.\nAttention models¬†[ref]8  allow neural networks to focus on specific parts of the input, in this case selecting relevant patches of the given input image. The attention map is used as the parameters of a Gumbel-Softmax¬†, also known as Concrete¬†, distribution to gradually sharpen the attention maps and have a clear correspondence between the selected objects and the rules applied thereafter.\nWe leave more complex, unsupervised scene object recognition and decomposition methods¬†   for future work. We then use a single feed-forward layer with shared weights to compute all relations between the selected objects, and pass onto a DNF layer. For further details please refer to Appendix¬†A. We construct 2 additional variants: DNF-h has extra hidden DNF layers, one for each 14 invented predicates, and DNF-r iterates the DNF layer twice learning recursive rules with 7 invented predicates. The invented predicates are evaluated in parallel using matrix operations similar to a feed-forward layer with many outputs. Is the DNF model more data efficient? We compare our approach against PrediNet¬†, an explicitly relational neural network and the current state-of-the-art in the relations game dataset. Note that PrediNet already outperforms MLP baselines and Relation Networks¬†. Looking at columns with different data sizes in Table¬†4, we observe that the DNF models consistently match or outperform PrediNet, especially DNF-h with training size 100 for the between task. This gap eventually narrows as the training size is increased.\nDespite failing to recognise and reason with four objects in the Occurs and XOccurs tasks with 100 training examples, all the models seem to tackle them better when mixed with other tasks, i.e. the All task. This might suggest that a mixture of tasks is beneficial to learning such that tasks with 2, 3 and 4 objects are presented together.. The failure cases observed with 100 training data points highlight how our approach is still prone to over-fitting due to its neural network based formulation which may be further mitigated using standard techniques such as regularisation. Can the DNF model generalise to unseen shapes and colours? After training on pentominoes, the models are tested on unseen hexominoes and striped shapes, Section¬†B.2. The results for Hex. and Stripe in Table¬†4 are similar to that of pentominoes for all models. This lack of change might be because of the tasks‚Äô requirement to determine whether the shapes match or not, which can encourage a simple subtraction based representation that would generalise to unseen shapes and colours. Indeed, PrediNet uses subtraction as the main relational operator while our model would need to learn that solely from examples. Does image reconstruction improve DNF model performance? We try to reconstruct the image from the selected objects using deconvolutional layers as an auxiliary loss (DNF-hi), see Section¬†A.5 for reconstruction details and Appendix¬†D for examples. Comparing DNF-hi and DNF-h rows, we do not observe any improvement above 5% despite the extra computation required to reconstruct the images. Although the representations of objects would need to accommodate both the reasoning and the reconstruction, we believe the simplicity of the shapes might be why the auxiliary loss does not yield any advantage for the rule learning. Can we extract symbolic rules in an image classification task? Finally, the goal is to obtain a coherent neuro-symbolic pipeline where objects, their relations and symbolic rules are learnt. We take the best variant DNF-h and threshold its weights DNF-h+t to get symbolic rules. Comparing DNF-h with DNF-h+t in Table¬†4, only if DNF-h achieves ‚â•0.99absent0.99\\geq 0.99 accuracy does DNF-h+t consistently yield better than random performance.\nThis highlights the difficulty of learning both the predicates and the rules in tandem as well as the fragility of thresholding weights.\nYet, there are some successful outliers ignored by the median, shown in Appendix¬†D.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: two state-of-the-art symbolic learners: ILASP¬† (2i as the recommended version for non-noisy tasks) and the recent more scalable FastLAS¬†.\nWe also considered state-of-the-art rule mining system AMIE¬†[ref]36 but it does not support negated rules and uses breath-first search that does not scale well to long rules.\nWe were only able to run the symbolic learners for the easy size because they do not\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
