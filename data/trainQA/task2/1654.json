      "content": "Paper Title: Boundary-induced and Scene-aggregated Network for Monocular Depth Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHandcraft-based depth prediction methods\nutilize the handcrafted features to estimate the depth from a single image.\nSaxena et al.  design a multi-scale Markov Random Field to predict the depth\nand extend it with multiple cues combination .\nLiu et al. [ref]20 define the task as a discrete-continuous optimization via Conditional Random Field.\nHowever,\nhandcrafted features limit the expression of depth and are unable to predict accurate depth. Deep learning based depth prediction methods significantly improve the performance of depth prediction.\nInitially,\nthe encoder-decoder structure is widely utilized\nand the deep learning based depth prediction is divided into two parts  [ref]22:\nthe global coarse depth prediction and the local shape detail refinement.\nThe former obtains a low-resolution depth map as an intermediate product,\nwhile the latter obtains a final depth map with original-resolution.\nTo obtain smooth and accurate depth,\nHu et al.  utilize the multi-level features and multi-task loss.\nWith a similar goal,\nChen et al.  gradually refine the final depth.\nHao et al.  reserve the high resolution of feature maps by utilizing continuous dilated convolutions.\nZhang et al.  retain the object shape by hierarchically fusing the side-output with the decoder.\nDhamo et al.  propose the Layered Depth\nImage to perceive the occluded scene regions.\nSome others focus on optimizing the absolute depth by first predicting the relative depth between pixels or regions.\nFu et al.  introduce the spacing-increasing discretization to regress the ordinal.\nSimilarly,\nLee et al.  refine the final map by combining the predicted relative depth of various scales.\nBesides,\nmulti-task learning is widely concerned.\nSeveral methods  [ref]22    jointly utilize the labels of depth, semantic segmentation, and surface normal in predicting monocular depth.\nHowever, existing encoder-decoder based methods always focus on how to obtain detailed shapes of objects\nand ignore the false prediction of the farthest region,\nwhich leads to the distortion of the 3D structure.\nOur method focuses on addressing this problem. The datasets for depth prediction\nare divided into two categories according to the scene,\nnamely indoor datasets and outdoor datasets.\nIn the datasets of indoor scenes   ,\nonly the NYUD v2 dataset  provides dense and accurate depth and aligns with the corresponding RGB images.\nThus, it is utilized to evaluate the performance of monocular depth prediction methods.\nOther datasets provide raw dense depth and RGB pairs captured by Kinect.\nThus, they are utilized to evaluate the generalization.\nSince our method uses gradients to express the boundary in the depth map,\nwe utilize the NYUD v2 dataset to verify the performance of our method,\nand other datasets to verify the generalization of our method.\nFor the datasets of outdoor scenes  [ref]32 ,\nKITTI [ref]32 and CityScapes  provide the RGB images captured by the camera and the corresponding sparse depth captured by the 3D Lidar.\nBut since the sparse depth cannot be used to extract pixel-wise gradients,\nthese two datasets are not employed to verify our method.\nMono3D  provides dense but inaccurate depth.\nThus, it is not employed either.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: handcrafted features to estimate the depth from a single image.\nSaxena et al.  design a multi-scale Markov Random Field to predict the depth\nand extend it with multiple cues combination .\nLiu et al.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
