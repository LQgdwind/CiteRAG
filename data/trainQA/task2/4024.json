      "content": "Paper Title: You Can’t Count on Luck: Why Decision Transformers and RvS Fail in Stochastic Environments\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOffline Reinforcement Learning. Offline reinforcement learning is a framework where logged data is used to learn behaviors [ref]3. In contrast to most online RL methods, offline RL avoids the need for often-expensive online data collection by using fixed datasets of trajectories generated by various policies and stitching together observed behaviors in order to optimize a reward function. The main challenge in the offline setting is that offline RL agents cannot collect more data to reduce their uncertainty and therefore offline RL approaches often have some type of value pessimism or policy constraints to keep the learned policy within the support of the offline dataset. Conservative Q-Learning  accomplishes this by learning a conservative lower-bound on the value of the current policy and achieve state-of-the-art performance on most offline-RL benchmarks. Other methods rely on ensembles (e.g., ) or policy regularization (e.g.,  7 ). Several standardized benchmarks have emerged for testing offline RL agents, including D4RL  and RL Unplugged . In contrast to our work, prior methods for offline RL primarily evaluate on deterministic environments, such as robotics and locomotion tasks as well as Atari tasks, which are near-deterministic . Reinforcement Learning via Supervised Learning. At the core of our work is the idea of reducing reinforcement learning to a prediction problem and solving it via supervised learning. This idea was first proposed by Schmidhuber [ref]6 and Kumar et al. , who proposed to learn behaviors by predicting actions conditioned on a desired outcome such as return. Ghosh et al.  proposed to use the same approach to solve goal-conditioned tasks and Paster et al.  proposed to predict multi-step action sequences, showing a connection between sequence modeling and optimal open-loop planning. Decision Transformer  proposed to use a transformer  to condition on trajectory history when predicting actions and tested the approach on offline RL rather than online, achieving results competitive with value-based offline RL approaches. Several followup extensions to Decision Transformer were explored, including using non-return goals 8 and using pretrained transformers . In a recent work, Emmons et al.  coined the term RvS (reinforcement learning via supervised learning) to describe such approaches. Notably found that a transformer is not necessary to perform well on most tasks, showing that a two-layer MLP with sufficient regularization can actually outperform transformers at a fraction of the computational cost. No prior RvS approach has been thoroughly evaluated in stochastic environments. Paster et al.  describes a counter-example where an RvS agent in Ghosh et al.  doesn’t converge in a stochastic environment, and proposes a solution. However, the approach can only be used to plan action sequences rather than reactive plans and therefore won’t achieve maximal performance in many stochastic settings. Ortega et al.  give a high level view of how sequence modeling can be affected by delusions in various problem settings when not treating actions as interventions. Our contribution is a more precise characterization of the problem within the framework of RvS which relates the choice of goal to environmental stochasticity and directly evokes an efficient algorithm for using RvS in stochastic environments without the need for explicit causal inference or intervention by carefully choosing the goals on which the agents conditions. Adversarial Learning. ESPER uses an adversarial loss to ensure that trajectory statistics are independent from environment stochasticity. Adversarial losses are also widely used in fairness (e.g.,   ), where it is used to prevent models from using sensitive attributes, and in generative modeling such as in GANs .\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Offline Reinforcement Learning.
