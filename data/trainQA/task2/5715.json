      "content": "Paper Title: MeshDiffusion: Score-based Generative 3D Mesh Modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep marching tetrahedra (DMTet)  is a method to parametrize and optimize meshes of arbitrary topology in a differentiable way. The 3D space is discretized with a deformable tetrahedral grid, in which each vertex possesses a SDF value. The SDF of each 3D position in the space is computed by marching tetrahedra , which assumes SDF values to be barycentric interpolation of the SDF values of the vertices of the enclosing tetrahedra. More specifically, for a point xqsubscript𝑥𝑞x_{q} inside a tetrahedron of vertices x1,x2,x3,x4subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2subscript𝑥3subscript𝑥4x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},x_{4} with SDF values being s1,s2,s3,s4subscript𝑠1subscript𝑠2subscript𝑠3subscript𝑠4s_{1},s_{2},s_{3},s_{4}, we obtain its unique barycentric coordinate (a1,a2,a3,a4)subscript𝑎1subscript𝑎2subscript𝑎3subscript𝑎4(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},a_{4}) such that xq=∑iai​xisubscript𝑥𝑞subscript𝑖subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑥𝑖x_{q}=\\sum_{i}a_{i}x_{i} (ai∈ [ref]1subscript𝑎𝑖01a_{i}\\in [ref]1). The SDF value sqsubscript𝑠𝑞s_{q} of xqsubscript𝑥𝑞x_{q} is then computed as sq=∑iai​sisubscript𝑠𝑞subscript𝑖subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑠𝑖s_{q}=\\sum_{i}a_{i}s_{i}. As a result, if there exists a triangular mesh in the tetrahedron (i.e., s1,s2,s3,s4subscript𝑠1subscript𝑠2subscript𝑠3subscript𝑠4s_{1},s_{2},s_{3},s_{4} are not of the same sign), then we can know that the triangular mesh is exactly the zero surface in the tetrahedron. The triangular mesh vertex vpsubscript𝑣𝑝v_{p} on a tetrahedron edge (va,vb)subscript𝑣𝑎subscript𝑣𝑏(v_{a},v_{b}) is therefore computed by vp=(va​sb−vb​sa)/(sb−sa)subscript𝑣𝑝subscript𝑣𝑎subscript𝑠𝑏subscript𝑣𝑏subscript𝑠𝑎subscript𝑠𝑏subscript𝑠𝑎v_{p}={(v_{a}s_{b}-v_{b}s_{a})}/{(s_{b}-s_{a})}. The advantage of using DMTet, compared to variants of deep marching cubes   which rely on the marching cubes algorithm , is that the grids are deformable and thus more capable of capturing some finer geometric details like very thin handles of chairs. While the cubic grid used for deep marching cubes can be deformable as well, the deformed cubes are much worse objects to deal with, compared to tetrahedra which will remain tetrahedra after deformation.\nNotably, DMTet can be fitted with a differentiable renderer by jointly optimizing for the geometry, the texture and the lighting of a 3D shape given multi-view RGB images within a reasonable amount of time and memory budget . Diffusion models are a family of score-based generative models which learn and infer with the ground-truth time-dependent score function defined by a forward diffusion process [ref]16. Under the stochastic differential equation (SDE) framework proposed in [ref]47, diffusion models construct the probability of each point in a space by diffusing all data points x0∈𝒟subscript𝑥0𝒟x_{0}\\in\\mathcal{D} to a target distribution at time T𝑇T (normally pT​(xT)=𝒩​(xT;0,I)subscript𝑝𝑇subscript𝑥𝑇𝒩subscript𝑥𝑇0𝐼p_{T}(x_{T})=\\mathcal{N}(x_{T};0,I)) in a time-variant manner: log⁡pt​(xt|𝒟)=𝔼x0∈𝒟[log⁡pt​(xt|x0)]subscript𝑝𝑡conditionalsubscript𝑥𝑡𝒟subscript𝔼subscript𝑥0𝒟delimited-[]subscript𝑝𝑡conditionalsubscript𝑥𝑡subscript𝑥0\\log p_{t}(x_{t}|\\mathcal{D})=\\mathop{\\mathbb{E}}_{x_{0}\\in\\mathcal{D}}[\\log p_{t}(x_{t}|x_{0})],\nwhere pt​(xt|x0)subscript𝑝𝑡conditionalsubscript𝑥𝑡subscript𝑥0p_{t}(x_{t}|x_{0}) is modeled by the following Itô process, with w​(t)𝑤𝑡w(t) being a standard Wiener process: d​x=F​(x,t)​d​t+G​(t)​d​w𝑑𝑥𝐹𝑥𝑡𝑑𝑡𝐺𝑡𝑑𝑤dx=F(x,t)dt+G(t)dw, in which F​(x,t)𝐹𝑥𝑡F(x,t) and G​(t)𝐺𝑡G(t) are some predefined functions. The training objective is to approximate the score function ∇xlog⁡pt​(xt|x0)subscript∇𝑥subscript𝑝𝑡conditionalsubscript𝑥𝑡subscript𝑥0\\nabla_{x}\\log p_{t}(x_{t}|x_{0}) with a neural network denoted by sθ​(xt,t)subscript𝑠𝜃subscript𝑥𝑡𝑡s_{\\theta}(x_{t},t), where λ​(t)𝜆𝑡\\lambda(t) is a scalar weight subject to the model design: With the trained score function predictor, samples can be generated by solving the reverse SDE [ref]47 with the initial distribution pT​(xT)subscript𝑝𝑇subscript𝑥𝑇p_{T}(x_{T}) using solvers like Euler-Maruyama method : A popular diffusion model DDPM [ref]16, which utilizes a discrete diffusion process p​(xt|xt−1)=𝒩​(xt;(1−βt)​xt−1,βt​I)𝑝conditionalsubscript𝑥𝑡subscript𝑥𝑡1𝒩subscript𝑥𝑡1subscript𝛽𝑡subscript𝑥𝑡1subscript𝛽𝑡𝐼p(x_{t}|x_{t-1})=\\mathcal{N}(x_{t};(1-\\beta_{t})x_{t-1},\\beta_{t}I), can be formulated within this SDE framework as [ref]47: d​x=−βt​x​d​t+βt​d​w𝑑𝑥subscript𝛽𝑡𝑥𝑑𝑡subscript𝛽𝑡𝑑𝑤dx=-\\beta_{t}xdt+\\sqrt{\\beta_{t}}dw. The parameters βtsubscript𝛽𝑡\\beta_{t} are chosen such that pT​(xT)subscript𝑝𝑇subscript𝑥𝑇p_{T}(x_{T}) is close to a standard Gaussian distribution.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: barycentric coordinate (a1,a2,a3,a4)subscript𝑎1subscript𝑎2subscript𝑎3subscript𝑎4(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},a_{4}) such that xq=∑iai​xisubscript𝑥𝑞subscript𝑖subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑥𝑖x_{q}=\\sum_{i}a_{i}x_{i} (ai∈ [ref]1subscript𝑎𝑖01a_{i}\\in [ref]1). The SDF value sqsubscript𝑠𝑞s_{q} of xqsubscript𝑥𝑞x_{q} is then computed as sq=∑iai​sisubscript𝑠𝑞subscript𝑖subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑠𝑖s_{q}=\\sum_{i}a_{i}s_{i}.
