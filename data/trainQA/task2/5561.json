The agent receives a reward of +1 for each increase in the score, regardless of its value. It does not receive any other reward or punishment. The state (input to the models) is represented by four consecutive frames of pixels on greyscale, so the dimensionality of the state representation is 4×\\times96×\\times96. The action space is discrete, consisting of 18 actions, of which only some make sense (depending on the environment), the other actions have no impact on the environment. We also tested 4 Procgen environments: Coinrun, Caveflyer, Jumper and Climber. Procgen is a set of procedurally generated environments, designed primarily for testing the agent’s generalisation [ref]16. The paper shows several problems for generalisation in RL, requiring special training and a huge number of samples. From our perspective, interesting findings (provided in Appendix B.1 of [ref]16) are that for several seeds, the baseline agent was not able to reach a non-zero score. Those seeds lead to hard exploration environments with only a single reward at the end. Together with a fast run of these environments (thousands of FPS on a single CPU core), this makes Procgen a very good candidate for our experiments. The state is represented by two consecutive stacked frames of RGB images, so the dimensionality of the state representation is 6×\\times64×\\times64.\nThe action space is discrete, consisting of 15 actions.\nPreliminary experiments performed in  provided initial insights and led to the extensions in this work. Before running the main experiments, we sought suitable values of hyperparameters. For this search, we chose Montezuma’s Revenge environment which represents a good compromise between game complexity and reward sparsity. This environment has been well studied (e.g. in\n[ref]4  [ref]12 ) and therefore provides a good comparison for tuning hyperparameter.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: We also tested 4 Procgen environments: Coinrun, Caveflyer, Jumper and Climber. Procgen is a set of procedurally generated environments, designed primarily for testing the agent’s generalisation [ref]16.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
