      "content": "Paper Title: Online AUC Optimization for Sparse High-Dimensional Datasets\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOnline AUC optimization.  AUC optimization algorithms have been developed under batch learning setting    where the predictor is generated based on the entire training samples. The reason why designing online AUC maximization methods is challenging is twofold: 1) in contrast to accuracy-based classification approaches where the loss is based on one individual example, the loss function of AUC optimization involves a pair of examples; 2) in practice, individual examples are arriving sequentially rather than pairs of examples. The first work of online AUC optimization has been proposed in   . The key idea is to use the gradient of a local empirical error which compares the current training example with all previous ones. However, these methods need to save all (or part of) previous training samples and need to compare the current example with previous ones, which leads to high per-iteration 𝒪​(t​d)𝒪𝑡𝑑\\mathcal{O}(td) at time t𝑡t.\nThe appealing work by Gao et. al  follows the same spirit but observes, in the case of the least square loss, that updates of such algorithms only rely on covariance matrix. This leads to a per-iteration cost 𝒪​(d2).𝒪superscript𝑑2\\mathcal{O}(d^{2}). Similarly, Ding et. al  use the same formulation but with an adaptive learning rate with similar per-iteration cost. More recent studies [ref]16   develop online AUC optimization with per-iteration cost 𝒪​(d)𝒪𝑑\\mathcal{O}(d) with competitive convergence results. The key idea is to introduce a new equivalent saddle-point formulation of AUC optimization. In particular, it is shown that maximizing AUC score is equivalent to solving a min-max problem, and hence stochastic primal-dual gradient-based algorithms can be applied. The work   develops fast algorithms for online AUC maximization with sparse regularization.\nHowever, all the methods do not take into account the inherent sparsity of data and the per-iteration cost is of 𝒪​(d)𝒪𝑑\\mathcal{O}(d) which is still expensive if d𝑑d is very large. Moreover, such sparse online AUC optimization algorithms are essentially variants of stochastic proximal gradient algorithms which, as shown in  , do not produce desired sparse solutions. Online learning algorithms with sparsity. \nA natural approach to obtain sparsity under batch learning setting is to add the ℓ1superscriptℓ1\\ell^{1} regularization. However, this is not the case for online setting where only one training sample is available at each time. Indeed, this is shown in  that simply applying ℓ1superscriptℓ1\\ell^{1} regularization fails to work since the gradient of each sample does not induce sparsity. Many important works      have been proposed to capture problem sparsity. For example, the regularized dual-averaging method proposed in  captures sparsity more effectively. The idea of online dual averaging is based on  as all gradients used are equally important. As demonstrated in these works   , the regularized dual averaging can be regarded as a special case of the follow-the-regularized-leader. This type of algorithms is originally proposed in  which is based on the follow-the-leader . It has been shown that both Regularized Dual Averaging (RDA)  and Follow The Proximally Regularized Leader (FTPRL)  can capture the sparsity effectively. However, the FTRL and regularized dual averaging methods are developed for accuracy-based loss depending on individual examples, while the objective function of AUC maximization is of U-Statistics based on pairs of examples. It remains unclear that how we can incorporate the FTRL framework with the AUC setting to design efficient online AUC optimization methods exploring inherent sparsity of high-dimensional sparse data. We aim to design online AUC maximization algorithms which not only achieve much cheaper O​(k)𝑂𝑘O(k) per-iteration cost but also generate much sparser solutions than existing methods. By this, we mean the following two requirements. The first one is that the gradient of loss of each training sample should be sparse. The other one is that the loss needs to be convex with respect to current model variable in order to guarantee a sublinear or logarithmic regret bound. We will illustrate our new developments in the subsections to achieve this goal.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: a per-iteration cost 𝒪​(d2).𝒪superscript𝑑2\\mathcal{O}(d^{2}).
