Since the two inequalities associated with s​R​t𝑠𝑅𝑡sRt are equivalent modulo residuation, and since residuation preserves the polarity of variable occurrences, we can say that a variable occurrence in an ℒs​p​dFOsubscriptsuperscriptℒFO𝑠𝑝𝑑\\mathcal{L}^{\\mathrm{FO}}_{spd}-atom s​R​t𝑠𝑅𝑡sRt is positive (resp. negative) if it is positive (resp. negative) in the signed generation trees of ρ​(s​R​t)𝜌𝑠𝑅𝑡\\rho(sRt). Moreover, if all nodes of the branch from that occurrence to the root are Skeleton nodes (cf. Section 2.5), we will also say that the given occurrence is displayable.777Indeed, the next lemma shows that if a variable occurrence is displayable, then, modulo application of splitting rules and residuation rules (cf. Footnote 6), it can be displayed. However, notice that this fact only holds under the additional requirement that, for every SLR node occurring in the branch from x𝑥x to the root, the signature ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} includes the residual of the corresponding connective in the coordinate through which the branch from x𝑥x to the root passes. Any ℒLEsubscriptℒLE\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{LE}}-inequality (ϕ≤ψ)[v/!x](\\phi\\leq\\psi)[v/!x] such that the placeholder variable x𝑥x is displayable can equivalently be rewritten as a conjunction of inequalities, one of which is of the form v≤θ𝑣𝜃v\\leq\\theta for some ℒLEsubscriptℒLE\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{LE}}-formula θ𝜃\\theta, if x𝑥x is positive, or of the form θ≤v𝜃𝑣\\theta\\leq v, if x𝑥x is negative. By induction on the number n𝑛n of ancestors of the displayable occurrence.\nIf n=0𝑛0n=0, then the inequality is either of the form x≤ψ𝑥𝜓x\\leq\\psi or of the form φ≤x𝜑𝑥\\varphi\\leq x, hence the claim is immediately true. As to the inductive step, we proceed by cases.\nIf φ≔φ′(!x)∨φ′′\\varphi\\coloneqq\\varphi^{\\prime}(!x)\\vee\\varphi^{\\prime\\prime}, then φ≤ψ𝜑𝜓\\varphi\\leq\\psi is equivalent to the conjunction of the inequalities φ′(!x)≤ψ\\varphi^{\\prime}(!x)\\leq\\psi and φ′′≤ψsuperscript𝜑′′𝜓\\varphi^{\\prime\\prime}\\leq\\psi. By applying the inductive hypothesis, φ′(!x)≤ψ\\varphi^{\\prime}(!x)\\leq\\psi can be equivalently rewritten as a conjunction of inequalities, one of which of the form v≤θ𝑣𝜃v\\leq\\theta or θ≤v𝜃𝑣\\theta\\leq v. Hence, by adding φ′′≤ψsuperscript𝜑′′𝜓\\varphi^{\\prime\\prime}\\leq\\psi to this conjunction, we obtain the required conjunction of inequalities. The proof for ψ≔ψ′(!x)∧ψ′′\\psi\\coloneqq\\psi^{\\prime}(!x)\\wedge\\psi^{\\prime\\prime} is analogous. If φ≔f(χ¯/!z¯)\\varphi\\coloneqq f(\\overline{\\chi}/!\\overline{z}) with χi=χ(!x)\\chi_{i}=\\chi(!x) and εf​(i)=1subscript𝜀𝑓𝑖1\\varepsilon_{f}(i)=1, then, by applying residuation on the i𝑖ith coordinate of f𝑓f (cf. Footnote 6), φ≤ψ𝜑𝜓\\varphi\\leq\\psi is equivalent to χ(!x)≤fi♯(ψ/!zi,χ′¯/!z′¯)\\chi(!x)\\leq f^{\\sharp}_{i}(\\psi/!z_{i},\\overline{\\chi^{\\prime}}/!\\overline{z^{\\prime}}), where χ′¯¯superscript𝜒′\\overline{\\chi^{\\prime}} denotes the vector χ¯¯𝜒\\overline{\\chi} except its i𝑖ith coordinate. Then the required conjunction is obtained by applying the induction hypothesis to this inequality. The proofs for εf​(i)=∂subscript𝜀𝑓𝑖\\varepsilon_{f}(i)=\\partial and ψ≔g(χ¯/!z¯)\\psi\\coloneqq g(\\overline{\\chi}/!\\overline{z}) are analogous.\n∎ The following abbreviations will be used throughout the present section: where f∈ℱA𝑓subscriptℱ𝐴f\\in\\mathcal{F}_{A} and g∈𝒢A𝑔subscript𝒢𝐴g\\in\\mathcal{G}_{A}. Expressions such as (∀y≺x)precedesfor-all𝑦𝑥(\\forall y\\prec x) or (∃y¯≥gx)subscript𝑔¯𝑦𝑥(\\exists\\overline{y}\\geq_{g}x) above are referred to as restricted quantifiers. The variable y𝑦y (resp. the variables in y¯¯𝑦\\overline{y}) in the formulas above is (resp. are) restricted, and the variable x𝑥x is restricting, while the inequality occurring together with φ𝜑\\varphi in the translation of the restricted quantifier is a restricting inequality. Throughout the present section, we will use the following letters (possibly with sub- or superscripts) to distinguish the roles of different variables ranging in the domain of an arbitrary spd-algebra, both in respect to Algorithms 1 and 2 of Section 3 and to the ones of Section 6. These variables will be assigned different conditions in Definition 5.24 on their polarity and their distribution in the formula, which determines the way in which they are introduced/eliminated: variables occurring in the input inequality of Algorithm 1, or in the output inequalities of Algorithm 5; positive variables introduced/eliminated by means of the first approximation lemma (cf. Lemma 3.16). It must be possible to rewrite the quasi-inequality so that each such variable occurs only once on each side of the main implication; negative variables introduced/eliminated by means of the first approximation lemma. The same considerations which apply to a𝑎a-variables apply also to b𝑏b-variables; variables introduced/eliminated using Lemma 2.9 in the antecedent of the main implication; variables introduced/eliminated using Lemma 2.9 in the consequent of the main implication. An ℒs​p​dFOsubscriptsuperscriptℒFO𝑠𝑝𝑑\\mathcal{L}^{\\mathrm{FO}}_{spd}-sentence is a Kracht formula888In the modal logic literature, Kracht formulas (cf. [5, Section 3.7]) are those first order sentences in the frame correspondence language of Kripke frames, introduced by Kracht , each of which is (equivalent to) the first-order correspondent of some Sahlqvist axiom. The notion of Kracht formulas has been recently generalized in  [ref]18 from classical modal logic to (distributive) LE-logics, and from a class of first order formulas targeting Sahlqvist LE-axioms to a class targeting the strictly larger class of inductive LE-axioms. The notion of Kracht formulas introduced in Definition 5.24 is different and in fact incomparable with those in  [ref]18, since it targets a different and incomparable class of modal axioms. if it has the following shape: where Ri′,Rj∈{≤,≥,≺,≻,𝒞,𝒞−1,𝒟,𝒟−1,≤f,≥g}subscriptsuperscript𝑅′𝑖subscript𝑅𝑗precedessucceedscancel𝒞superscriptcancel𝒞1cancel𝒟superscriptcancel𝒟1subscript𝑓subscript𝑔R^{\\prime}_{i},R_{j}\\in\\{\\leq,\\geq,\\prec,\\succ,\\cancel{\\mathcal{C}},\\cancel{\\mathcal{C}}^{-1},\\cancel{\\mathcal{D}},\\cancel{\\mathcal{D}}^{-1},\\leq_{f},\\geq_{g}\\} for all 1≤i≤m1𝑖𝑚1\\leq i\\leq m and 1≤j≤o1𝑗𝑜1\\leq j\\leq o; variables in z¯¯𝑧\\overline{z} are amongst those of a¯¯𝑎\\overline{a}, b¯¯𝑏\\overline{b}, and c¯≔c1¯⊕…⊕cm¯≔¯𝑐direct-sum¯subscript𝑐1…¯subscript𝑐𝑚\\overline{c}\\coloneqq\\overline{c_{1}}\\oplus\\ldots\\oplus\\overline{c_{m}};999Here ⊕direct-sum\\oplus denotes the concatenation of sequences, i.e. (a1,…,an)⊕(b1,…,bm)≔(a1,…,an,b1,…,bm)≔direct-sumsubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑛subscript𝑏1…subscript𝑏𝑚subscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑛subscript𝑏1…subscript𝑏𝑚(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n})\\oplus(b_{1},\\ldots,b_{m})\\coloneqq(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n},b_{1},\\ldots,b_{m}). variables in y¯¯𝑦\\overline{y} are amongst those of a¯¯𝑎\\overline{a}, b¯¯𝑏\\overline{b}, and d¯≔d1¯⊕…⊕dm¯≔¯𝑑direct-sum¯subscript𝑑1…¯subscript𝑑𝑚\\overline{d}\\coloneqq\\overline{d_{1}}\\oplus\\ldots\\oplus\\overline{d_{m}}; η𝜂\\eta and ζ𝜁\\zeta are conjunctions of relational atoms s​R​t𝑠𝑅𝑡sRt with R∈{≤,≥,≺,≻,𝒞,𝒞−1,𝒟,𝒟−1}𝑅precedessucceedscancel𝒞superscriptcancel𝒞1cancel𝒟superscriptcancel𝒟1R\\in\\{\\leq,\\geq,\\prec,\\succ,\\cancel{\\mathcal{C}},\\cancel{\\mathcal{C}}^{-1},\\cancel{\\mathcal{D}},\\cancel{\\mathcal{D}}^{-1}\\}; all occurrences of variables in a¯¯𝑎\\overline{a} (resp. b¯¯𝑏\\overline{b}) are positive (resp. negative) in all atoms (including those in restricting quantifiers) in which they occur; every variable in c¯¯𝑐\\overline{c} (resp. in d¯¯𝑑\\overline{d}) occurs uniformly in η𝜂\\eta (resp. in ζ𝜁\\zeta); occurrences of variables in c¯¯𝑐\\overline{c} (resp. d¯¯𝑑\\overline{d}) as restricting variables have the same polarity as their occurrences in η𝜂\\eta (resp. ζ𝜁\\zeta). all occurrences of variables in a¯¯𝑎\\overline{a}, b¯¯𝑏\\overline{b}, c¯¯𝑐\\overline{c}, and d¯¯𝑑\\overline{d} in atoms of η𝜂\\eta and ζ𝜁\\zeta are displayable; each atom in η𝜂\\eta contains exactly one occurrence of a variable in a¯¯𝑎\\overline{a}, b¯¯𝑏\\overline{b}, or c¯¯𝑐\\overline{c} (all other variables are in v¯¯𝑣\\overline{v}); each atom s​R​t𝑠𝑅𝑡sRt in ζ𝜁\\zeta contains at most one occurrence of a variable in d¯¯𝑑\\overline{d}. Moreover, for every two different occurrences of the same variable not in v¯¯𝑣\\overline{v} (i.e., in a¯¯𝑎\\overline{a} or b¯¯𝑏\\overline{b}), the first common ancestor in the signed generation tree of s​R​t𝑠𝑅𝑡sRt is either +⁣∧+\\wedge or −⁣∨-\\vee. The definition above captures a more general syntactic shape of ℒs​p​dFOsubscriptsuperscriptℒFO𝑠𝑝𝑑\\mathcal{L}^{\\mathrm{FO}}_{spd}-formulas than the general shape of the output of the algorithm defined in Section 3. Indeed, such outputs have a much simpler antecedent, composed only of atoms x​R​t𝑥𝑅𝑡xRt and t​R​x𝑡𝑅𝑥tRx, with x𝑥x in c¯¯𝑐\\overline{c} or in a¯¯𝑎\\overline{a} if in positive polarity and y𝑦y in b¯¯𝑏\\overline{b} if in negative polarity, and with t𝑡t containing only variables in v¯¯𝑣\\overline{v}. This automatically simplifies some of the items of Definition 5.24, such as item 9. Similar considerations also apply to the atoms in the consequent. The condition ∀v​∀a​∀c​(a≤c&c≺v⇒a​𝒞​v)for-all𝑣for-all𝑎for-all𝑐𝑎𝑐𝑐precedes𝑣⇒𝑎cancel𝒞𝑣\\forall v\\forall a\\forall c(a\\leq c\\ \\&\\ c\\prec v\\Rightarrow a\\cancel{\\mathcal{C}}v) is a Kracht formula, since it can be rewritten as ∀v​∀a​(∀c≥a)​(c≺v⇒a​𝒞​v)for-all𝑣for-all𝑎for-all𝑐𝑎precedes𝑐𝑣⇒𝑎cancel𝒞𝑣\\forall v\\forall a(\\forall c\\geq a)(c\\prec v\\ \\Rightarrow a\\cancel{\\mathcal{C}}v), and in this shape, it readily satisfies conditions 1-9 of Definition 5.24. The following computation illustrates how Algorithm 5 (cf. Section 6) runs on it, and shows how an equivalent modal axiom can be effectively computed by eliminating the variables c𝑐c and a𝑎a. Unrestricted variables in c¯¯𝑐\\overline{c} (resp. d¯¯𝑑\\overline{d}) are allowed in Definition 5.24 because they can be readily eliminated, given that they occur uniformly in η𝜂\\eta (resp. ζ𝜁\\zeta). To illustrate how this elimination is effected, consider the condition ∀v​∀a​∀c1​∀c2​(a≺c2&c2≺v&c1≺v⇒a≺v)for-all𝑣for-all𝑎for-allsubscript𝑐1for-allsubscript𝑐2precedes𝑎subscript𝑐2subscript𝑐2precedes𝑣subscript𝑐1precedes𝑣⇒𝑎precedes𝑣\\forall v\\forall a\\forall c_{1}\\forall c_{2}(a\\prec c_{2}\\ \\&\\ c_{2}\\prec v\\ \\&\\ c_{1}\\prec v\\Rightarrow a\\prec v), which is a Kracht formula when equivalently rewritten as ∀v​∀a​∀c1​(∀c2≻a)​(c2≺v&c1≺v⇒a≺v)for-all𝑣for-all𝑎for-allsubscript𝑐1succeedsfor-allsubscript𝑐2𝑎precedessubscript𝑐2𝑣subscript𝑐1precedes𝑣⇒𝑎precedes𝑣\\forall v\\forall a\\forall c_{1}(\\forall c_{2}\\succ a)(c_{2}\\prec v\\ \\&\\ c_{1}\\prec v\\Rightarrow a\\prec v). Applying Algorithm 5 to it yields: While, in the equivalence marked with (∗∗\\ast), the soundness of the elimination of c2subscript𝑐2c_{2} is a consequence of Lemma 2.9.2(i), the soundness of the elimination of c1subscript𝑐1c_{1} is a consequence of the fact that, on bounded lattices, the formula ∃c1​(c1≤■​v)subscript𝑐1subscript𝑐1■𝑣\\exists c_{1}(c_{1}\\leq\\blacksquare v) is always true. The soundness of the elimination of a𝑎a in the last line is due to the fact that, by Lemma 2.8.2, both ■​v■𝑣\\blacksquare v and ■​■​v■■𝑣\\blacksquare\\blacksquare v belong to O​(Aδ)𝑂superscript𝐴𝛿O(A^{\\delta}). Consider the universal closure of the following condition [ref]47: The quasi inequality above satisfies Definition 5.24 when a𝑎a is regarded as a c¯¯𝑐\\overline{c}-variable, b𝑏b as an a¯¯𝑎\\overline{a}-variable, and x𝑥x as a v¯¯𝑣\\overline{v}-variable. Applying Algorithm 5 to it yields: The soundness of the elimination of a𝑎a is a consequence of the fact that, on bounded lattices, the formula ∃a​(a≤■​x∧▶x)𝑎𝑎limit-from■𝑥▶𝑥\\exists a(a\\leq\\blacksquare x\\wedge{\\blacktriangleright}x) is always true, while the soundness of the elimination of b𝑏b is due to the fact that ▶x∈O​(Aδ)▶absent𝑥𝑂superscript𝐴𝛿{\\blacktriangleright}x\\in O(A^{\\delta}). It turns out that, in the present setting, this condition is a tautology. This is unsurprising, since, by definition, 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} satisfies condition (C3) in Section 2.2, which is a necessary condition for the modal operators ▶▶{\\blacktriangleright} and ⊳contains-as-subgroup{\\rhd} to be normal (i.e. finitely join-reversing). Consider the universal closure of the following condition from [ref]47 on any spd-algebra ℍℍ\\mathbb{H} based on a Heyting algebra: The quasi inequality above satisfies Definition 5.24 when any variable is picked to play the role of an a¯¯𝑎\\overline{a}-variable, and the remaining variables as v¯¯𝑣\\overline{v}-variables. By choosing x𝑥x as the a¯¯𝑎\\overline{a}-variable, and applying Algorithm 5 to it, we get: which shows that Consider the universal closure of the following condition from : The quasi inequality above satisfies Definition 5.24, since it can be equivalently rewritten as\n∀a​∀y​(∀x′≻a)​(∀x≥x′)​(a∧x≺y⇒a≺y)for-all𝑎for-all𝑦succeedsfor-allsuperscript𝑥′𝑎for-all𝑥superscript𝑥′precedes𝑎𝑥𝑦⇒𝑎precedes𝑦\\forall a\\forall y(\\forall x^{\\prime}\\succ a)(\\forall x\\geq x^{\\prime})(a\\wedge x\\prec y\\Rightarrow a\\prec y) when a𝑎a is regarded as a v¯¯𝑣\\overline{v}-variable, y𝑦y as a b¯¯𝑏\\overline{b}-variable, and x𝑥x and x′superscript𝑥′x^{\\prime} as c¯¯𝑐\\overline{c}-variables.

Applying Algorithm 5 to it yields: Consider the universal closure of the following condition from [ref]47 on any spd-algebra ℍℍ\\mathbb{H} based on a De Morgan101010a De Morgan algebra ia a distributive lattice endowed with a unary operation which is involutive and both finitely meet- and join-reversing. algebra: which is readily equivalent to the conjunction of the two conditions a≺x&(a∧x)​𝒞​¬y⇒a​𝒞​¬xprecedes𝑎𝑥𝑎𝑥cancel𝒞𝑦⇒𝑎cancel𝒞𝑥a\\prec x\\ \\&\\ (a\\wedge x)\\cancel{\\mathcal{C}}\\neg y\\Rightarrow a\\cancel{\\mathcal{C}}\\neg x and a≺x&(a∧x)​𝒞​¬y⇒a​𝒞​¬yprecedes𝑎𝑥𝑎𝑥cancel𝒞𝑦⇒𝑎cancel𝒞𝑦a\\prec x\\ \\&\\ (a\\wedge x)\\cancel{\\mathcal{C}}\\neg y\\Rightarrow a\\cancel{\\mathcal{C}}\\neg y, on which we proceed separately. The first quasi-inequality satisfies Definition 5.24 when a𝑎a is regarded as an a¯¯𝑎\\overline{a}-variable, y𝑦y as a c¯¯𝑐\\overline{c}-variable, and x𝑥x as a v¯¯𝑣\\overline{v}-variable. Applying Algorithm 5 to it yields: The equivalence marked with (∗∗\\ast) follows immediately from the fact that ∃y​(¬⊳(a∧x)≤y)𝑦contains-as-subgroup𝑎𝑥𝑦\\exists y(\\neg{\\rhd}(a\\wedge x)\\leq y) is always satisfied, since A𝐴A is a bounded lattice.\nThe second quasi-inequality satisfies Definition 5.24 when x𝑥x is regarded as a c¯¯𝑐\\overline{c}-variable, y𝑦y as a b¯¯𝑏\\overline{b}-variable, and a𝑎a as a v¯¯𝑣\\overline{v}-variable.

Applying Algorithm 5 to it yields: The formula\n∀x​∃y​(x​𝒟​y&y​𝒞​x)for-all𝑥𝑦𝑥cancel𝒟𝑦𝑦cancel𝒞𝑥\\forall x\\exists y(x\\cancel{\\mathcal{D}}y\\ \\&\\ y\\cancel{\\mathcal{C}}x) is Kracht when regarding y𝑦y as a d¯¯𝑑\\overline{d}-variable. Applying Algorithm 5 to it yields: The formula\n∀x​∀y​(x​𝒟​y⇒y​𝒞​x)for-all𝑥for-all𝑦⇒𝑥cancel𝒟𝑦𝑦cancel𝒞𝑥\\forall x\\forall y(x\\cancel{\\mathcal{D}}y\\Rightarrow y\\cancel{\\mathcal{C}}x) is not Kracht; indeed, neither variable can be regarded as an a¯¯𝑎\\overline{a}- or a b¯¯𝑏\\overline{b}-variable, since they both violate condition 4 on the polarity\n(this is better seen after the translation step, which yields\n∀x​∀y​(⊲y≤x⇒x≤⊳y)for-all𝑥for-all𝑦subgroup-of𝑦𝑥⇒𝑥contains-as-subgroup𝑦\\forall x\\forall y({\\lhd}y\\leq x\\Rightarrow x\\leq{\\rhd}y)). However, this violates condition 8 of Definition 5.24, which prevents Algorithm 5 to be applied successfully.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: of Kripke frames, introduced by Kracht , each of which is (equivalent to) the first-order correspondent of some Sahlqvist axiom.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. Generate exactly 40 titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning."
