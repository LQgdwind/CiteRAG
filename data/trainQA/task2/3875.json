      "content": "Paper Title: Episodic Memory Question Answering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nModel Architecture.\nThe visual odometry (VO) model takes as input a pair of consecutive RGB-D observations (otsubscript𝑜𝑡o_{t}, ot+1subscript𝑜𝑡1o_{t+1}) and estimates three relative pose transformation components – the translation along X and Z axis, and the rotation angle (θ𝜃\\theta).\nFor our experiments, we employ a stripped-down (bare-bones) version of the architecture proposed in . The architecture includes a Resnet-18 [ref]18 feature extractor backbone followed by two fully-connected (FC) layers with Dropout. We do away with the soft top-down projection and discretized depth inputs, and only use RGB+Depth observation pairs from successive steps. Additionally, as suggested by the authors , we train action-specific models to deal with the differences in the action distributions. Dataset Preparation.\nThe pre-trained VO models provided by the authors of  were trained on the Gibson dataset of 3D scans [ref]35. In contrast, we work with scenes from the Matterport3D [ref]6 dataset. More importantly, these models were trained in a setup that used agent actuation specifications (forward step: 25cm, rotation angle: 30°) that are significantly different from those used in our exploration tours (forward step: 10cm, rotation angle: 9°). Therefore, a zero-shot transfer of models pre-trained by the authors in  to our setup is likely to not work well. We qualitatively verify this in Fig. 12. Note that the trajectory formed by integrating predictions from a pre-trained VO model applied directly to our setup doesn’t match the original trajectory at all. To remedy this, we retrain the VO models from  on scenes from the Matterport3D dataset and under the actuation specificns of EMQA. To do that, we first create a separate VO dataset in Matterport3D [ref]6. For generating the dataset, we follow the protocol laid out in . We sample (uniformly, at random) two navigable points in the scene and compute the shortest navigable path between the two points. Then, we sample (again, uniformly, ar random) consecutive observation pairs along these shortest-path trajectories. Using this method, we create a dataset of 100k and 20k training and validation data points. Training and Evaluation.\nFollowing the training regime proposed by , we train our model by jointly minimizing the regression and geometric invariance losses from . Fig. 12 (blue) shows the trajectory generated via integration of predictions from the retrained VO model. We note a significant qualitative improvement in the trajectory as it much closely resembles the ground truth trajectory. In addition to that, in Tab. 3, we also quantitatively analyze the improvements gained through retraining by comparing the average deviation in the trajectories (as measured by the average over per-step pose RMSEs) predicted via the pre-trained and the re-trained VO models. We note that with a retrained VO model, we significantly improve the quality of our trajectories by getting ∼6similar-toabsent6\\sim 6x less deviation with the ground truth trajectory. For completeness, Tab. 3 also contains metrics for trajectories generated by independently adding noise to the ground-truth pose. It is evident that both (a) increasing the intensity of independently added noise and (b) moving from independent to VO-based cumulative noise leads to larger deviations in the predicted trajectories from the ground truth (∼similar-to\\sim1.3x and ∼similar-to\\sim15x increase respectively).\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: along X and Z axis, and the rotation angle (θ𝜃\\theta).\nFor our experiments, we employ a stripped-down (bare-bones) version of the architecture proposed in .
