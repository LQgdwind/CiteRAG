Our main results are\nproved in the theories 𝖲𝟤𝟣subscriptsuperscript𝖲12{\\mathsf{S^{1}_{2}}} and its\nextension 𝖲𝟤𝟣+𝖽𝖶𝖯𝖧𝖯​(𝖯𝖵)subscriptsuperscript𝖲12𝖽𝖶𝖯𝖧𝖯𝖯𝖵{\\mathsf{S^{1}_{2}}}+\\mathsf{dWPHP}({\\mathsf{PV}}).\nThese are single-sort theories for arithmetic, namely,\nnumber theory over ℕℕ\\mathbb{N}. The theory 𝖲𝟤𝟣subscriptsuperscript𝖲12{\\mathsf{S^{1}_{2}}} is the first\nin Buss’ hierarchy of theories of bounded arithmetic,\nand defines precisely the polynomial-time computable functions .\nThe theory 𝖲𝟤𝟣+𝖽𝖶𝖯𝖧𝖯​(𝖯𝖵)subscriptsuperscript𝖲12𝖽𝖶𝖯𝖧𝖯𝖯𝖵{\\mathsf{S^{1}_{2}}}+\\mathsf{dWPHP}({\\mathsf{PV}}) denotes its extension with\nthe Dual Weak Pigeonhole Principle (dWPHP) for polynomial-time functions (𝖯𝖵𝖯𝖵\\mathsf{PV}),\nwhich allows to reason about probabilities and do approximate counting,\nbased on the work of Jeřábek .\nFor a rigorous yet concise survey on bounded arithmetic the reader is referred\nto Buss  (for a full treatment of the area see  [ref]26;\nas well as a contemporary survey by Oliveira ).\nWe refer the reader to Tzameret and Cook  for treatment of\nalgebraic circuits over the integers inside theories of bounded arithmetic.\nHere we use a similar treatment of algebraic circuits,\ndiscussed in the next section. The language ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} contains the\nfunction symbols +,×,⌊⋅/2⌋,|⋅|,#,0,1+,\\times,{\\lfloor{\\cdot/2}\\rfloor},|\\cdot|,\\#,0,1, and\nthe relation symbol ≤\\leq. A finite\ncollection of axioms called 𝖡𝖠𝖲𝖨𝖢𝖡𝖠𝖲𝖨𝖢\\mathsf{BASIC} gives these\nsymbols their intended meaning: 00 and 111 are\nconstant symbols for the numbers 00 and 111, the symbols ++\nand ×\\times denote addition and multiplication of numbers, and\nthe unary functions ⌊⋅/2⌋{\\lfloor{\\cdot/2}\\rfloor} and |⋅||\\cdot| denote\nrounded halving and binary length, respectively.\nPrecisely, if x𝑥x is a natural number, then ⌊x/2⌋𝑥2{\\lfloor{x/2}\\rfloor}\nis the largest natural number bounded by x/2𝑥2x/2, and |x|𝑥|x|\nis the length of x𝑥x written in binary notation,\nexcept for x=0𝑥0x=0 where |x|𝑥|x| is defined as 00 by convention.\nI.e., |x|=⌈log2⁡(x+1)⌉𝑥subscript2𝑥1|x|={\\lceil{\\log_{2}(x+1)}\\rceil}.\nWe say that |x|𝑥|x| is the length of x𝑥x. The only\nnon-self-explanatory symbol is the “smash” binary function\nsymbol ##\\# introduced by Buss . The\nintention of x​#​y𝑥#𝑦x\\#y is 222 raised to the power of the\nlength of x𝑥x times the length of y𝑦y, namely\n2|x|⋅|y|superscript2⋅𝑥𝑦2^{|x|\\cdot|y|}. This function allows us to work with\nstrings as follows: assume we wish to talk about a binary\nstring S𝑆S of length n𝑛n in the\ntheory.\nSince the theory only talks about numbers, we represent\nthe string as the number x𝑥x between 2n−1superscript2𝑛12^{n-1} and 2n−1superscript2𝑛12^{n}-1\nwhose unique binary representation of length n𝑛n is S𝑆S.\nNote that the length n𝑛n of S𝑆S is precisely |x|𝑥|x|.\nTo consider\na polynomial growth rate\nin the length of S𝑆S, we need to be able to express strings of\nlength ncsuperscript𝑛𝑐n^{c}, for a constant c𝑐c. Strings of length at\nmost ncsuperscript𝑛𝑐n^{c} are\nencoded, as before, by numbers of magnitude less than We write n∈Log𝑛Logn\\in\\mathrm{Log} to mean that n𝑛n serves\nas the length of some string, namely, n=|x|𝑛𝑥n=|x| for\nsome x𝑥x. Note that in bounded arithmetic theories\nwhere exponentiation may not be total, the formula\n∀n​∃x​|x|=nfor-all𝑛𝑥𝑥𝑛\\forall n\\exists x\\ |x|{=}n is not provable.\nWe use ∀n∈Log​ψfor-all𝑛Log𝜓\\forall n{\\in}\\mathrm{Log}\\ \\psi and ∃n∈Log​ψ𝑛Log𝜓\\exists n{\\in}\\mathrm{Log}\\ \\psi\nas shorthand notations for\nthe formulas ∀x​∀n​(|x|=n→ψ)for-all𝑥for-all𝑛𝑥𝑛→𝜓\\forall x\\forall n\\ (|x|{=}n\\rightarrow\\psi)\nand ∃x​∃n​(|x|=n∧ψ)𝑥𝑛𝑥𝑛𝜓\\exists x\\exists n\\ (|x|{=}n\\wedge\\psi). We need to define several polynomial-time computable\nfunctions in the theory and show\nthat the theory proves some basic properties of these functions.\nWe work in the extension of the language ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} with\nthe language 𝖯𝖵𝖯𝖵{\\mathsf{PV}} which has a new symbol for every polynomial-time\ncomputable function (to be precise, it has a new symbol for every function defined\nby Cobham’s bounded recursion on notation ).\nThe theory will be Buss’s 𝖲𝟤𝟣subscriptsuperscript𝖲12{\\mathsf{S^{1}_{2}}} extended with the axioms defining the added\n𝖯𝖵𝖯𝖵{\\mathsf{PV}}-symbols (; see ). This theory is sometimes\ndenoted 𝖲𝟤𝟣​(𝖯𝖵)subscriptsuperscript𝖲12𝖯𝖵{\\mathsf{S^{1}_{2}}}({\\mathsf{PV}}) but we will use the shorter notation\n𝖲𝟤𝟣subscriptsuperscript𝖲12{\\mathsf{S^{1}_{2}}} if this does not lead to confusion as\n𝖲𝟤𝟣​(𝖯𝖵)subscriptsuperscript𝖲12𝖯𝖵{\\mathsf{S^{1}_{2}}}({\\mathsf{PV}}) is a conservative extension\nof 𝖲𝟤𝟣subscriptsuperscript𝖲12{\\mathsf{S^{1}_{2}}} for statements in the ℒℒ\\mathcal{L}-language.\nFor the precise definition of 𝖲𝟤𝟣​(𝖯𝖵)subscriptsuperscript𝖲12𝖯𝖵{\\mathsf{S^{1}_{2}}}({\\mathsf{PV}}) see Krajíček [26, page 78]. Objects like strings, circuits, etc. in the theory are coded by\nnumbers (cf.  [ref]26). In this sense, we may refer to an object in the\ntheory, meaning formally its code.\nThe inputs and outputs of 𝖯𝖵𝖯𝖵{\\mathsf{PV}}-functions are natural numbers.\nHowever, the polynomial-time algorithms/Turing machines\nthat compute the functions\nas 𝖯𝖵𝖯𝖵{\\mathsf{PV}}-symbols get their inputs presented in binary notation\nas binary strings. The statement that n𝑛n is an argument that is\npresented to a 𝖯𝖵𝖯𝖵{\\mathsf{PV}}-function in unary notation means that it\nis expected that n∈Log𝑛Logn\\in\\mathrm{Log} (so 2nsuperscript2𝑛2^{n} exists) and that\nthe argument is actually 2nsuperscript2𝑛2^{n}, so in this case\nthe binary representation 100​⋯​0100⋯0100\\cdots 0 of 2nsuperscript2𝑛2^{n} is given in\nthe input of the polynomial-time algorithm that computes the\nfunction.\nAn alternative convention would be to think of 𝖯𝖵𝖯𝖵{\\mathsf{PV}}-functions\nas getting inputs of two sorts: numbers in unary\nnotation and numbers in binary notation.\nThis is the approach taken in the two-sorted theories\nof bounded arithmetic . Let ΦΦ\\Phi be a class of formulas in the language ℒℒ\\mathcal{L}.\nA set of natural numbers S⊆ℕ𝑆ℕS\\subseteq\\mathbb{N} is called ΦΦ\\Phi-definable (with parameters)\nif there exists a formula φ​(x;y)𝜑𝑥𝑦\\varphi(x;y) in ΦΦ\\Phi, with all free variables indicated,\nsuch that for some c∈ℕ𝑐ℕc\\in\\mathbb{N} we have\nS={a∈ℕ:ℕ⊧φ​(a;c)}𝑆conditional-set𝑎ℕmodelsℕ𝜑𝑎𝑐S=\\{a\\in\\mathbb{N}:\\mathbb{N}\\models\\varphi(a;c)\\}.\nThis is definability in the meta-theory, or\nin the standard model. In a formal theory T𝑇T such as 𝖲𝟤𝟣subscriptsuperscript𝖲12{\\mathsf{S^{1}_{2}}}, a\nformula φ​(x;y)𝜑𝑥𝑦\\varphi(x;y) defines a set in every model M𝑀M of the theory for every\nchoice of the parameter c∈M𝑐𝑀c\\in M in the model: When the model or the parameter are not specified, a definable set is simply given\nby the formula φ​(x;y)𝜑𝑥𝑦\\varphi(x;y) that defines it (parametrically in y𝑦y),\nand we write [φ​(x;y)]delimited-[]𝜑𝑥𝑦[\\varphi(x;y)]. For example, if we take φ​(x;y):=1≤x∧x≤yassign𝜑𝑥𝑦1𝑥𝑥𝑦\\varphi(x;y):=1{\\leq}x\\wedge x{\\leq}y, then\nfor every standard c∈ℕ𝑐ℕc\\in\\mathbb{N} we have When this is not confusing, we use the same\nnotation [c]:={1,2,…,c}assigndelimited-[]𝑐12…𝑐[c]:=\\{1,2,\\ldots,c\\} in the theory instead of the more accurate [1≤x∧x≤c]delimited-[]1𝑥𝑥𝑐[1{\\leq}x\\wedge x{\\leq}c],\neven when c𝑐c is a free variable. Also, we use x∈[c]𝑥delimited-[]𝑐x{\\in}[c]\nas short-hand notation for the formula 1≤x∧x≤c1𝑥𝑥𝑐1{\\leq}x\\wedge x{\\leq}c. More generally, if we\ndeclare that a formula φ​(x;c)𝜑𝑥𝑐\\varphi(x;c) defines a set which we denote Scsubscript𝑆𝑐S_{c}, then\nwe are entitled to use the following short-hand notations: When Scsubscript𝑆𝑐S_{c} is a bounded set, i.e., there exists a term t​(c)𝑡𝑐t(c) such that\nevery x∈Sc𝑥subscript𝑆𝑐x\\in S_{c} satisfies x≤t​(c)𝑥𝑡𝑐x\\leq t(c) provably in the theory, then\nthe quantifiers in (4) can be bounded: ∃x≤t​(c)​(φ​(x;c)∧ψ)𝑥𝑡𝑐𝜑𝑥𝑐𝜓\\exists x{\\leq}t(c)\\ (\\varphi(x;c)\\wedge\\psi) and ∀x≤t​(c)​(φ​(x;c)→ψ)for-all𝑥𝑡𝑐→𝜑𝑥𝑐𝜓\\forall x{\\leq}t(c)\\ (\\varphi(x;c)\\rightarrow\\psi). Let f𝑓f be a 𝖯𝖵𝖯𝖵{\\mathsf{PV}}-symbol. The axiom 𝖽𝖶𝖯𝖧𝖯​(f)𝖽𝖶𝖯𝖧𝖯𝑓\\mathsf{dWPHP}(f)\nis the universal closure of the following formula with free variables a,b,c𝑎𝑏𝑐a,b,c: where fc​(x)subscript𝑓𝑐𝑥f_{c}(x) is notation for f​(x,c)𝑓𝑥𝑐f(x,c),\nthinking of c𝑐c\nas a parameter for f𝑓f.\nWe write 𝖽𝖶𝖯𝖧𝖯​(𝖯𝖵)𝖽𝖶𝖯𝖧𝖯𝖯𝖵\\mathsf{dWPHP}({\\mathsf{PV}}) for the axiom-scheme that contains all axioms 𝖽𝖶𝖯𝖧𝖯​(f)𝖽𝖶𝖯𝖧𝖯𝑓\\mathsf{dWPHP}(f) for\nall 𝖯𝖵𝖯𝖵{\\mathsf{PV}}-symbols f𝑓f. The presence of the parameter c𝑐c in fcsubscript𝑓𝑐f_{c} makes the statement of 𝖽𝖶𝖯𝖧𝖯​(f)𝖽𝖶𝖯𝖧𝖯𝑓\\mathsf{dWPHP}(f) more expressive.\nFor example, the parameter\nmay specify the sizes a𝑎a and b𝑏b of the intended domain and range of a function fc:[a]→[b]:subscript𝑓𝑐→delimited-[]𝑎delimited-[]𝑏f_{c}:[a]\\to[b],\nsay as c=⟨a,b⟩𝑐𝑎𝑏c=\\langle a,b\\rangle, for an appropriate pairing function ⟨⋅,⋅⟩⋅⋅\\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle.\nAnother example of the power of parameters is the following.\nThe class of 𝖯𝖵𝖯𝖵{\\mathsf{PV}}-functions admits a natural universal-like\nfunction, that we call evaleval\\mathrm{eval}, which provably in 𝖲𝟤𝟣subscriptsuperscript𝖲12{\\mathsf{S^{1}_{2}}} evaluates\nany 𝖯𝖵𝖯𝖵{\\mathsf{PV}} function f𝑓f: the theory\n𝖲𝟤𝟣subscriptsuperscript𝖲12{\\mathsf{S^{1}_{2}}} proves ∀b​∀x<b​eval⁡(Cf​(b),x)=f​(x)for-all𝑏for-all𝑥𝑏evalsubscript𝐶𝑓𝑏𝑥𝑓𝑥\\forall b\\ \\forall x{<}b\\ \\operatorname{eval}(C_{f}(b),x){=}f(x) for a certain\nnatural 𝖯𝖵𝖯𝖵{\\mathsf{PV}}-function Cfsubscript𝐶𝑓C_{f}.\nIt follows from this that\nthe infinite axiom scheme 𝖽𝖶𝖯𝖧𝖯​(𝖯𝖵)𝖽𝖶𝖯𝖧𝖯𝖯𝖵\\mathsf{dWPHP}({\\mathsf{PV}}) is equivalent, over 𝖲𝟤𝟣subscriptsuperscript𝖲12{\\mathsf{S^{1}_{2}}}, to\nthe single axiom 𝖽𝖶𝖯𝖧𝖯​(eval)𝖽𝖶𝖯𝖧𝖯eval\\mathsf{dWPHP}(\\operatorname{eval}).\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: and do approximate counting,\nbased on the work of Jeřábek .\nFor a rigorous yet concise survey on bounded arithmetic the reader is referred\nto Buss  (for a full treatment of the area see  [ref]26;\nas well as a contemporary survey by Oliveira ).\nWe refer the reader to Tzameret and Cook  for treatment of\nalgebraic circuits over the integers inside theories of bounded arithmetic.\nHere we\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
