      "content": "Paper Title: S.T.A.R.-Track: Latent Motion Models for End-to-End 3D Object Tracking with Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Appearance Representations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRobust perception and tracking of movable objects in the environment form the basis for safe decision-making in autonomous agents such as self-driving cars.\nClassical  multi-object tracking (MOT) pipelines follow a tracking-by-detection paradigm, using object detectors coupled with greedy matching  and state estimators  [ref]3 to track objects.\nBuilding on recent advances in object detection from multi-view camera images, transformer-based architectures  [ref]5  can yield strong tracking performance   using relatively low-cost sensors.\nHowever, decoupling the detection and tracking tasks comes with two main drawbacks: (1) the object detection model is optimized towards a detection metric, rather than directly optimizing for the downstream tracking performance, which is prone to compounding errors   and (2) it makes it non-trivial to incorporate appearance information, which poses a challenge to consistent association.\nThis in particular can lead to difficulties in handling confusion among object identities in crowded scenarios with many partial object-to-object occlusions 0. Recent works 1 2 propose an alternative tracking-by-attention paradigm that unifies perception and tracking into a single module.\nUnder this paradigm, the geometric and semantic information contained in the latent object queries of query-based detectors can be leveraged for the association of object instances across time via attention 3.\nAdditionally, tracking-by-attention allows to use these queries as detection priors in the following frames.\nThis requires adjusting them to the expected future object state, analogous to the model-based prediction step in classical state estimator-based trackers 4. For geometric features, this can be done by applying the transformation corresponding to both ego and estimated object motion.\nHowever, this is not possible for latent object queries, as they also encode semantics and appearance in addition to geometric information.\nMUTR3D 2 sidesteps this issue by anchoring object queries to geometric reference points which can be analytically updated.\nWhile this enables some adjustment, only the object translation rather than the full pose is considered and the change in appearance resulting from changes in the relative pose is not modeled.\nA tracking method that corrects both geometric and appearance information directly in latent space is proposed in 5. However, this approach forfeits the ability to analytically update geometric information and does not model object motion. In this paper, we propose to compensate for appearance changes resulting from both ego and object motion via a novel lmm which updates queries in latent space as a function of the geometric motion.\nPaired with analytical updates on geometric reference points for each query, we obtain a transformable Spatio-Temporal geometry and Appearance Representation for each object that enhances consistency with future observations.\nFurthermore, we propose track embeddings that encode information on the lifetime of a tracked object to distinguish track queries from new detections. Our approach termed Star-Track, exhibits improved tracking performance. Specifically, we observe that accounting for appearance changes between frames as well as the improved existence probability modeling eases association, leading to a drastically reduced number of switches in object instance identities. In summary, we make the following main contributions: We are the first to compensate for the appearance change induced by both, ego- and object motion in a tracking-by-attention paradigm leveraging a  latent motion model (lmm) that extends query-based object detectors. We introduce novel track embeddings allowing to implicitly model the life cycle of a tracked object. We outperform current state of the art DETR3D-based tracking approaches on nuScenes 6 where the lmm and track embeddings in particular reduce fragmentations and identity switches by a large margin.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: agents such as self-driving cars.\nClassical  multi-object tracking (MOT) pipelines follow a tracking-by-detection paradigm, using object detectors coupled with greedy matching  and state estimators  [ref]3 to track objects.\nBuilding on recent advances in object detection from multi-view camera images, transformer-based architectures  [ref]5  can yield strong tracking performance   using\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
