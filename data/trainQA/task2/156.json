      "content": "Paper Title: Polynomial algorithms for p-dispersion problems in a planar Pareto Front\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn real-world applications, optimization problems may be driven by several conflicting objectives.\nDesigning network or (system of) system architectures, financial costs must be traded off with quality of service or robustness  .\nDealing with complex maintenance planning problems, stability and robustness of the planning matter as well as financial costs .\nMulti-objective optimization (MOO) supports such decision making.\nMany efficient (i.e. best compromise) solutions of MOO problems may exist with Pareto dominance .\nA Pareto Front (PF) denotes the projection of efficient solutions in the objective space. This work aims to select p𝑝p solutions from n≫pmuch-greater-than𝑛𝑝n\\gg p non dominated solutions, while\nmaximizing the diversity of these p𝑝p solutions in the objective space.\nFirstly, such problem occurs when selecting alternatives for decision makers. Secondly,\nMOO approaches use such operators to represent large PF  7,\nand MOO meta-heuristics archive diversified solutions during the heuristic search 9  .\nThirdly, a similar problem occurs in a Skyline for databases\n[ref]5  .\nWhen selecting alternatives for decision makers, p𝑝p is small, p⩽5𝑝5p\\leqslant 5 is realistic.\nOtherwise, p𝑝p is larger, having p=100𝑝100p=100 or p=1000𝑝1000p=1000 is realistic. The hypervolume measure is often used in such a context   .\nCovering and clustering algorithms  [ref]16 \nare also used to select points in a PF.\nIn this paper, we consider (discrete) p𝑝p-dispersion problems, to select p𝑝p points and while maximizing dispersion measures among selected points .\nAlthough p𝑝p-dispersion is mentioned to have relevant applications for MOO  5, no specific studies concerned the p𝑝p-dispersion in a PF to the best of our knowledge.\nFour variants of discrete p𝑝p-dispersion problems are defined .\nMax-min and Max-Sum p𝑝p-dispersion problems, the most studied variants, are 𝒩​𝒫𝒩𝒫\\mathcal{N}\\mathcal{P}-hard  0.\nMax-min p𝑝p-dispersion maximizes the minimal distance between each pair of selected points.\nMax-Sum p𝑝p-dispersion maximizes the total sum of the distances between selected points. Max-Sum-min p𝑝p-dispersion variant maximizes\nthe sum of the distances between each selected points to the closest different selected points.\nMax-min-Sum p𝑝p-dispersion variant maximizes\nthe minimal sum of distances between each selected point to the other selected points.\nThis paper studies p𝑝p-dispersion variants in the case of a two-dimensional (2D) PF, which is an extension of one-dimensional (1D) cases.\nA novel variant of Max-Sum-min p𝑝p-dispersion, denoted Max-Sum-Neighbor p𝑝p-dispersion, is specifically introduced for 2D PFs.\nFor these five p𝑝p-dispersion problems, the cases p=2𝑝2p=2 and p=3𝑝3p=3 are proven to be solvable in O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) time and the cases p=4𝑝4p=4 and p=5𝑝5p=5 are solvable respectively in O​(n2)𝑂superscript𝑛2O(n^{2}) and O​(n3)𝑂superscript𝑛3O(n^{3}) time.\nGenerally, the Max-min, Max-Sum-min and Max-Sum-Neighbor p𝑝p-dispersion problems are proven to be solvable in polynomial time in a 2D PF with dynamic programming (DP) algorithms.\nFor Max-Sum-min p𝑝p-dispersion, it is the first time that this problem is proven to be polynomially solvable in 1D. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.\nIn Section 2, we introduce the notation and formally describe the problems.\nIn Section 3, we discuss related state-of-the-art elements to situate our contributions.\nIn Section 4, intermediate results are presented. In Sections 5, 6 and 7, DP algorithms with a polynomial complexity are respectively presented for the Max-Sum-Neighbor,\nMax-min and Max-min-Sum variants.\nIn Section 8, our results are discussed from both a theoretical and a practical point of view.\nIn Section 9, our contributions and the open perspectives are summarized.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: use such operators to represent large PF  7,\nand MOO meta-heuristics archive diversified solutions during the heuristic search 9  .\nThirdly, a similar problem occurs in a Skyline for databases\n[ref]5  .\nWhen selecting alternatives for decision makers, p𝑝p is small, p⩽5𝑝5p\\leqslant 5 is realistic.\nOtherwise, p𝑝p is larger, having p=100𝑝100p=100 or p=1000𝑝1000p=1000 is realistic.
