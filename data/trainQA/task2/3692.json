      "content": "Paper Title: HetSched: Quality-of-Mission Aware Scheduling for Autonomous Vehicle SoCs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe consider two real-world AV benchmarks; ADSuite and MAVBench. ADSuite [ref]35 provides an autonomous driving application comprised of kernels like object detection (DET), object tracking (TRA), localization (LOC), mission planning and motion planning. For DET, we use YOLOv3 , a DNN-based detection algorithm, on a series of 7 images derived from the VOC dataset .\nWe use the Tiny-YOLOv3 pre-trained set of weights, which is much faster and lightweight, but less accurate compared to the regular YOLO model.\nFor TRA, we use GOTURN , a DNN-based single object tracking algorithm, on a series of 14 videos in the ALOV++ dataset .\nFor LOC, we use ORB-SLAM , a highly-ranked vehicle localization algorithm, on 3 sequences from the KITTI datasets .\nFurther, for our GPU evaluation, we adopt the ORB-SLAM implementation in , where the hot paths are rewritten using CUDA. We also obtain timing profile of DET, TRA and LOC on their respective accelerators from [ref]35.\nFor motion and mission planning, we use the op_local_planner and op_global_planner  kernels in Autoware . The fusion kernel combines the coordinates of the objects being tracked with the AV location. It has a small latency, for which we only consider CPU execution. MAVBench  provides a set of computational kernels that form the building blocks of many aerial vehicle applications. For some of the kernels, we use different algorithms than the ones in , in order to better exploit the heterogeneity in our hardware. Specifically, for the perception, tracking and localization kernels, we reuse our ADSuite implementations. For occupancy map generation, we use OctoMap [ref]32 and GPU-Voxels  for the CPU and GPU implementations, respectively. OctoMap performs 3D occupancy grid mapping, and GPU-Voxels is a CUDA-based library for robotics planning and monitoring tasks. We generate a map composed of 200×\\times200×\\times200 voxels. Point cloud generation and collision check consume 10–1000×\\times lower latency in comparison to other kernels (Table I in ), and so we only employ CPU implementations for these.\nFor the shortest-path planners, we use the CPU-based parallel RRT (pRRT)  implementation in the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) , on the “Cubicle” benchmark. For the GPU implementation, we use a Poisson-disk samples based GPU algorithm . For frontier exploration, we use the RRT ROS package that implements a multi-robot RRT-based map exploration algorithm , on the “single_simulated_house” scenario. Finally, we consider only CPU execution for path tracking as it has a low latency. We consider two applications from MAVBench in this work, namely Package Delivery, where an aerial AV navigates through an obstacle-filled environment to reach its destination, deliver a package and return back to its origin, and 3D Mapping, that instructs the aerial AV to build a 3D map of an unknown polygonal environment specified by its boundaries.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: We consider two real-world AV benchmarks; ADSuite and MAVBench.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
