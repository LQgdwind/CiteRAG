      "content": "Paper Title: Sharp Eyes: A Salient Object Detector Working The Same Way as Human Visual Characteristics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSalient object detection (SOD) is commonly interpreted in computer vision as a process that includes two stages:1) detecting the most salient object and 2) segmenting the accurate region of that object . As a pre-processing procedure, SOD is widely used in downstream vision tasks, such as image understanding [ref]2, object tracking  and image retrieval [ref]4. In recent years, with the breakthrough of deep learning technology, many methods , [ref]6, , ,  based on convolution neural network (CNN) have greatly boosted the performance of salient object detection. However, in the process of extracting image features, CNN processes shape, color, texture and brightness together. In some complex scenes with cluttered background which are often similar in color or texture to the foreground, the predicted saliency maps still suffer from incomplete predictions. As shown in Fig. 1, incomplete prediction means that only a part of the salient object can be predicted (rows 1), or the object cannot be highlighted uniformly (row 3, column 5), or no object can be detected (row 2, column 3). To get the fine saliency maps, current state-of-the-arts methods mainly focus on how to integrate multi-level features or introduce auxiliary information (i.e., edge and skeleton) to obtain complementary features. To learn comprehensive features, Zhang et al.  and Zhuge et al.  proposed the aggregation networks to integrate multi-level features. However, due to the repeated sub-sampling operation in CNN model, the detail of the salient objects with complex structures will be gradually weaken, which can hardly uniformly highlight the entire salient objects. To obtain the precise boundaries, Zhou et al.  and Wei et al. 0 introduced the edge information into models, but the edge information only contains a small part of the entire object, which is difficult to fill the interior of objects. To obtain more complementary features, Liu et al. 1 and Wu et al. [ref]6 integrated both edge and skeleton information into networks. However, the divergence of feature domains may bring background noises, which is difficult to assistant network generate complete saliency maps. Since 100% recall can be achieved by setting the whole saliency map to be foreground, the challenge is how to solve the problem of incomplete prediction under the premise of low noises in a complex scene. In brief, the above three kinds of methods are all from the perspective of supplementary information. When encountering the cluttered background, it is difficult to separate the target completely. Fig. 1 shows the sample results of different methods in cluttered scenes, including the PurNet  based on using purificatory mechanism, DCN [ref]6 based on introducing the boundary and skeleton information, and ICON  based on aggregating multi-level features. In addition, most of existing models adopt binary cross entropy and interaction-over-union as loss functions, but they treats all pixels equally and independently. Since the imbalance distribution between boundary pixels and non-boundary ones, it is difficult to predict clear boundary. To solve this problem, various loss functions 2, 3, 4 have been proposed to enhance the boundary details by assigning high weights to the pixels near boundary. Despite impressive, considering only the pixels around boundary is not comprehensive enough, pixels with similar appearance located in the border region between foreground and background are prone to wrong. Therefore, attention should be paid to pixels in grades, rather than treating the pixels inside the object equally. To address above problems, we propose the sharp eyes network (SENet), which based on the strategy of separating first and then segmenting to generate more complete saliency maps with low noises. Compared with the method based on supplementing information, the proposed method is reverse, i.e., the detection range is large to small, which is consistent with the characteristics of the human vision. First, to prevent background interference and locate the complete targets, we design target separation (TS) branch to produce saliency features with expanded boundary (SF w/ EB), which is a fractal structure under the supervision of expanded ground truth encoded by the operations of dilation and erosion. Compared with edge or skeleton information, the proposed SF w/ EB is able to enlarge the differences between salient objects and cluttered background in detail. Second, to get fine salient objects, we develop the object segmentation (OS) branch, which consists of feature aggregation (FA) module and feature interaction (FI) module. The FA module is used to generate more complementary features, which aggregates high-level semantic features, low-level detail features, and global context information in a progressively way. The FI module is applied to improve the structural and detailed information of the salient objects, which feed the SF w/ EB into the above aggregated features by element-wise multiplication. The interactive features share the properties of consistent semantics and structural information. Moreover, to suppress the redundancy and noise caused by interactive features, we use a series of weighted convolution layers to refine them. Finally, the FA module and FI module will cascade three times to generate the final saliency maps. In each cascade, the original ground truth is applied to supervise the output of the FI module to stop the SF w/ EB confusing the model in learning process. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical difference aware (HDA) loss to further improve the prediction of structural integrity and local details. Different from previous loss functions which assign high weights to pixels around boundary, the proposed HDA loss distributes weights to pixels according to the distance from boundary hierarchically, which assigns each pixel a weight by calculating the sum of differences between a pixel and pixels in its neighborhoods in dilated ground truth and eroded one. In consequence, hard pixels in border region will be given more attention to discriminate the similar parts between foreground and background. In summary, our main contributions can be summarized as follows: 1) We propose a novel salient object detector working the same way of human\nvisual characteristics, which separates target first and then segment it. It is a framework of detection range from large to small and segmentation accuracy from coarse to fine, which can integrate expanded saliency features and aggregated complementary features to generate more complete but less noisy saliency maps. 2) We design a hierarchical difference aware loss that assigns weights to pixels according to their distance from boundary in grades, which can further improve the prediction of structural integrity and local details by focusing on the indistinguishable regions. 3) Extensive experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nthe proposed model outperforms 15 state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. In addition, our model is more efficient with an inference speed 39.539.539.5 FPS when processing a 320×320320320320\\times 320 image.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: detecting the most salient object and 2) segmenting the accurate region of that object .
