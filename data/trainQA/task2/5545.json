      "content": "Paper Title: Pseudo Contrastive Learning for Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOver the past decades, deep learning has achieved great success in many fields, largely due to the extensive efforts of human annotators in labeling large amounts of training samples. However, unlike other data (e.g., pictures, languages, and videos), annotating graph data usually requires expertise in understanding not only the important properties of each node but also the complex relationships between different nodes. For example, identifying the category that a research paper belongs to often requires expensive efforts from the experts since many research works are associated with multiple different domains. Therefore, graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL)    , which addresses heavy dependence on labeled data by leveraging the potential of unlabeled data, has recently attracted more attention from the research community. The motivation of graph-based SSL is to leverage the vast amount of unlabeled nodes, together with limited labeled nodes, to learn a model that can accurately predict the properties of graphs, such as the classes of nodes. In this paper, we focus on the semi-supervised node classification problem in graph-based SSL, which is one of the research highlights. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)  [ref]6 [ref]7 [ref]8  0 1 2 have emerged as the dominant technology in graph-based SSL. The success of GNNs can be attributed to their ability to exchange information between connected nodes. However, this mechanism limits the access of GNNs to only a small number of neighbor nodes in the local area defined by the model depth. As a result, GNNs struggle to effectively utilize the vast amount of unlabeled nodes beyond this confined area. Considering the different strengths of various GNNs (simplicity [ref]8, explainability [ref]6 3, expressive ability [ref]7, etc.), it motivates us to develop a general technique for GNNs to compensate for this shortcoming, i.e., limited ability to leverage unlabeled nodes. Exploring extra labels is a typical answer to this problem. Pseudo Labeling (PL) 4, as a simple yet effective SSL approach, has been extensively used to generate additional pseudo-labels. We roughly categorize PL variants into two groups according to how pseudo-labels are generated and used: (1) Positive Pseudo Labeling (PPL) 5 6 7 8 9 0. It assigns positive pseudo-labels to unlabeled samples according to the maximum model prediction. Then, it teaches the model by Positive Learning (standard classification objective) to learn “the samples should belong to these positive pseudo-labels.” (2) Negative Pseudo Labeling (NPL) 1. For those unlabeled samples with sufficiently low predicted scores, it generates negative pseudo-labels and tells the model through Negative Learning 2 that “the samples should not belong to these negative pseudo-labels.” Compared to PPL which provides “what to learn” information, NPL which provides “what not to learn” information can decrease the risk of learning from incorrect information. It is due to the fact that there is only (possibly) one truth and numerous false instructions. PL-based999In the next content, we refer to PL/pseudo-labels as a general term for PPL and NPL/positive and negative pseudo-labels. methods can exploit additional supervision, thereby benefiting the training process. However, it could introduce false pseudo-labels, easily leading to corrupting the learning process. This is because classification-based objectives are highly dependent on the accuracy of the given labels 3. For instance, whether decreasing (or increasing) the distance between a sample and a wrong positive (or negative) pseudo-label would depart it from its correct cluster. What’s more, iteratively optimizing the classification-based objective would accumulate incorrect information. In this work, instead of fitting nodes into untrustworthy pseudo-labels, we develop a fault-tolerant way by guiding GNNs to separate two nodes whose positive and negative pseudo-labels target the same class (the opposite pseudo-label). For example, in Figure 1, C1subscript𝐶1C_{1} and C2subscript𝐶2C_{2} are marked as the opposite pseudo-labels for 𝒗1subscript𝒗1\\boldsymbol{v}_{1} and 𝒗2subscript𝒗2\\boldsymbol{v}_{2} since 𝒗1subscript𝒗1\\boldsymbol{v}_{1}’s positive/negative pseudo-label and 𝒗2subscript𝒗2\\boldsymbol{v}_{2}’s negative/positive pseudo-label target C1subscript𝐶1C_{1}/C2subscript𝐶2C_{2}. Building upon the insights from recently developed Contrastive Learning (CL) 4 5 6 7, we propose Pseudo Contrastive Learning (PCL) to enhance separation between nodes for GNNs, which can significantly reduce the error probability of PL. To better understand PCL, we take the red area in Figure 1 as an example: (a) PPL pulls 𝒗1subscript𝒗1\\boldsymbol{v}_{1} toward C1subscript𝐶1C_{1}; (b) NPL pushes 𝒗1subscript𝒗1\\boldsymbol{v}_{1} away from C2subscript𝐶2C_{2} and C3subscript𝐶3C_{3}; (c) PCL instead directly pushes 𝒗1subscript𝒗1\\boldsymbol{v}_{1} away from 𝒗2subscript𝒗2\\boldsymbol{v}_{2} via the opposite pseudo labels C1subscript𝐶1C_{1} or C2subscript𝐶2C_{2}. Let pi​jsubscript𝑝𝑖𝑗p_{ij} (or p~i​j=1−pi​jsubscript~𝑝𝑖𝑗1subscript𝑝𝑖𝑗\\tilde{p}_{ij}=1-p_{ij}) represents the probability that 𝒗isubscript𝒗𝑖\\boldsymbol{v}_{i} does (or does not) belong to class Cjsubscript𝐶𝑗C_{j}. Table 1 further explains that we can decrease the error probability from 0.3 (PPL) and 0.3 (NPL) to 0.18 (our PCL). Despite the remarkable success achieved by CL in the graph domain 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4, its generalization to various supervised GNNs remains largely unexplored with two unresolved issues. One crucial issue revolves around the traditional CL objective, which relies on carefully selected positive nodes generated through customized augmentation techniques 5 6 5 in the unsupervised setting or sampled from nodes of the same class 1 2 in the supervised setting. While strong augmentations can enhance unsupervised CL models by creating ”better views” and generating more generalized representations, they might not significantly benefit supervised CL models, as these models require task-specific representations 6. Additionally, augmentations introduce computational costs and can potentially mislead the message-passing scheme, making it challenging to generalize the approach to any GNN architecture 7. The supervised CL models often employ the strategy of pulling nodes with the same class (ground-truth or pseudo-labels) closer together. However, optimizing the classification objective (e.g., cross-entropy loss function) could also increase the similarity between training samples of the same class to some extent, demonstrating that the classification objective is capable of maximizing the agreement between positive pairs. Overemphasizing cohesion between positive pairs may not guarantee sufficient separation between negative pairs. The theoretical analysis of 8 also suggests that the positive pairs are relatively drawn close by pushing negative pairs farther away. Furthermore, finding negative nodes, which are more abundant, is comparatively easier than identifying positive nodes. Considering these limitations and inspirations, our proposed PCL focuses on pushing negative pairs farther apart to assist GNNs in learning more separable representations, instead of pulling positive pairs together, which produces trivial improvements but leads to laborious augmentation and positive node sampling. Another important issue is that the traditional CL objective weights all the negative pairs equally, disregarding their topological relationships. When negative pairs have a smaller topological distance, they become more challenging to separate because a GNN encoder tends to learn similar representations for nearby nodes. To tackle this challenge, it would be beneficial to introduce reasonable biases into different negative pairs based on their topological relationships. Thus, we devise Topologically Weighted Contrastive Loss (TWCL). This loss assigns larger weights to negative pairs with smaller topological distances, allowing PCL to emphasize the separation between nearby negative pairs and further enhance the discriminative ability of GNNs. Our main contributions are summarized as: We propose a comprehensive framework called Pseudo Contrastive Learning (PCL) that facilitates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in learning discriminative node representations for graph-based SSL. Our novel supervised CL framework eliminates the need for positive pairs, ensuring that GNNs achieve significant separation between nodes. We further enhance the discriminative ability of GNNs by introducing a topologically weighted contrastive loss (TWCL) that incorporates the structural relationships of node pairs into CL. By considering the topological distances between nodes, TWCL provides additional guidance for GNNs to generate more discriminative representations. We enable several commonly used GNN models to achieve considerable performance improvements, surpassing recent state-of-the-art performance in the semi-supervised node classification task. We validate our approach on five real-world graphs, demonstrating the effectiveness and versatility of our proposed PCL framework.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: such as the classes of nodes.
