New contributions include considering the speed and previous poses of the robot and the people around it. It also provides a new dataset. Submitted to Multimedia Tools and Applications, Springer.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHuman-aware robot navigation deals with the challenge of endowing mobile social robots with the capability of considering the emotions and safety of people nearby while moving around their surroundings.\nThere is a wide range of works studying human-aware navigation from considerably diverse perspectives.\nPioneering works such as 8 started taking into account the personal spaces of the people surrounding the robots, often referred to as proxemics.\nSemantic properties were also considered in .\nIn addition to proxemics, human motion patterns were analysed in  to estimate whether humans are willing to interact with a robot.\nAlthough not directly applied to navigation, the relationships between humans and objects were used in the context of ambient intelligence in .\nProxemics and object affordances were jointly considered in [ref]42 for navigation purposes.\nTwo extensive surveys on human-aware navigation can be found in 3 and [ref]4. Despite the previously mentioned approaches being built on well-studied psychological models, they have limitations.\nConsidering new factors programmatically (i.e., writing additional code) involves a potentially high number of coding hours, makes systems more complex, and increases the chances of including bugs.\nAdditionally, with every new aspect to be considered for navigation, the decisions made become less explainable, which is precisely one of the main advantages of handcrafted approaches over data-driven ones.\nIn addition to the mentioned model scalability and explainability issues, handcrafted approaches have the intrinsic and rather obvious limitation that they only account for what the model explicitly considers.\nGiven that these models are manually written by humans, they cannot account for aspects that the designers are not aware of. Approaches leveraging machine learning have also been published.\nThe parameters of a social force model  are learned in  and 0 to navigate in human-populated environments.\nInverse reinforcement learning is used in 2 and  to plan navigation routes based on a list of humans in a radius.\nSocial norms are implemented using deep reinforcement learning in , again, considering a set of humans.\nAn approach modelling crowd-robot interaction and navigation control is presented in .\nIt features a two-module architecture where single interactions are modelled and then aggregated.\nAlthough its authors reported good qualitative results, the approach does not contemplate integrating additional information (e.g., relations between humans and objects, structure and size of the room).\nThe work in  tackles the same problem using Gaussian Mixture Models.\nIt has the advantage of requiring less training data, but the approach is also limited in terms of the input information it can process. All the previous works and many others not mentioned have achieved outstanding results.\nSome model-based approaches such as  or [ref]42 can leverage structured information to take into account space affordances.\nStill, the data considered to make such decisions are often handcrafted features based on an arbitrary subset of the data that a robot can potentially work with.\nThere are many reasons motivating to seek learning-based approaches not limited to a selection of handcrafted features.\nTheir design is time-consuming and often requires a deep understanding of the particular domain (see discussion in ).\nAdditionally, there is generally no guarantee that a particular hand-engineered set of features is close to being the best possible one.\nOn the other hand, most end-to-end deep learning approaches have important limitations too.\nThey require a large amount of data and computational resources that are often scarce and expensive, and they are hard to explain and manually fine-tune.\nSomewhere in the middle of the spectrum, we have proposals advocating not to choose between hand-engineered features or end-to-end learning.\nIn particular,  proposes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as a means to perform learning that allows combining raw data with hand-engineered features, and most importantly, to learn from structured information.\nThe relational inductive bias of GNNs is specially well-suited to learn about structured data and the relations between different types of entities, often requiring less training data than other approaches.\nIn this line, we argue that using GNNs for human-aware navigation reduces the time and effort required to integrate new social cues. In this work, we trained different GNN models to estimate people’s comfort given a scenario and its previous states.\nThe state of a scenario includes objects, walls, the robot, and humans who can be interacting with other humans or objects.\nFor moving entities (i.e., humans and the robot) the network also considers not only their pose but also their linear and angular velocities.\nGNNs are proposed because the information that social robots can work with is not just a map and a list of people, but a more sophisticated data structure where the entities represented can have different relations among them.\nFor example, social robots could potentially have information about who a human is talking to, where people are looking at, who is friends with whom, or who is the owner of an object in the scenario.\nRegardless of how this information is acquired, it can be naturally represented using a graph, and GNNs are a particularly well-suited and scalable machine learning approach to work with these graphs.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: not directly applied to navigation, the relationships between humans and objects were used in the context of ambient intelligence in .\nProxemics and object affordances were jointly considered in [ref]42 for navigation purposes.\nTwo extensive surveys on human-aware navigation can be found in 3 and [ref]4.
