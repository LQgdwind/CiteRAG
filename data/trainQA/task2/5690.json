      "content": "Paper Title: DOMINO: Visual Causal Reasoning with Time-Dependent Phenomena\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor this discussion we shall distinguish among two types of temporal data, namely, time series data which are a set of observations obtained through repeated measurements over time, and event sequence data which are a set of discrete events ordered in time of occurrence. While the former is typically collected at regular intervals, the latter may not be. Often, event sequence data are derived from raw time series data via feature extraction and pattern analysis. Many works on time series analysis have been focusing on efficient algorithms to identify frequent patterns, either in a supervised  or unsupervised fashion  . Methods based on deep neural networks \nhave gained much attention recently as they promise fully automated solutions for pattern identification and prediction. However, explaining to human analysts the reasoning behind such identifications and predictions remains challenging. Early work on the visual analysis of event sequence data includes Lifelines  which emphasizes detailed records of a single patient. A follow-up version, Lifelines2 , utilizes a set of dynamic aggregations to highlight the prevalence of events occurring in multiple sequences. Zgraggen et al.  propose a touch-based system featuring a visual query language for time series built via regular expressions. WireVis  connects temporal events by monitoring a set of user-defined keywords and visualizing the detected relations as a network. Lee and Shen  define salient local features in time series as trends and utilize visual tools for matching and grouping similar patterns. Zhao et al.  aggregate large numbers of short sequences into connected matrices such that common patterns can be easily observed. To investigate the common progressions of events, DecisionFlow  and its related projects [ref]44  consolidate temporal events as alternative pathways with embedded patterns. The recent survey by Guo et al.  provides a comprehensive overview on the visual analysis of event sequence data. Recent work by Jin et al.  proposes a visual analytics method to aid users in the construction of general causal models from large collections of multivariate event sequence data. Their system uses Granger causality on Hawkes processes to derive a set of causal relations that form the basis of the proposed user-assisted model construction procedure. Our work differs from their’s in that we begin with a single raw multivariate time series dataset, and our primary goal is to help analysts understand the causal relations, and their time windows, that govern the specific phenomena captured by these data. As such, our system aids users in the extraction of events under the premise of time-dependent causality, interactively with visual support.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: large numbers of short sequences into connected matrices such that common patterns can be easily observed.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
