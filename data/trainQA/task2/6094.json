      "content": "Paper Title: New Adversarial Image Detection Based on Sentiment Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur experiment setup is consistent with¬†[ref]7 in terms of image classifiers, datasets, attack models, benchmark detectors, and performance indicators. Since¬†[ref]7 presented the latest study on adversarial example detection in the literature, and developed the state-of-the-art detector, namely, NNIF, which is also used as a benchmark in our experiments. Image classifier: By default, the image classifier (a DNN) under attack is a Deep Residual Network¬† with 34 hidden layers, referred to as ResNet-34. The feature extraction layers of ResNet-34 are divided into five successive hidden blocks, i.e., Batch Normalization 1 (BN1subscriptBN1\\text{BN}_{1}), Residual Block 1 (Res1subscriptRes1\\text{Res}_{1}), Res2subscriptRes2\\text{Res}_{2}, Res3subscriptRes3\\text{Res}_{3}, and Res4subscriptRes4\\text{Res}_{4}. A convolutional layer is followed by a batch normalization layer in BN1subscriptBN1\\text{BN}_{1}. The rest of the hidden blocks are residual blocks, which are basic building blocks in a deep residual network model. We also adopt Inception to build another image classifier based on the third version of the Inception Network (referred to as Inception-V3). The feature extraction layers of Inception-V3 are divided into seven hidden blocks: Stem block, Inception-A block (Inception-A), Reduction-A block (Reduction-A), Inception-B, Reduction-B, Inception-C, and global Avg-pool block. The Stem block is divided into seven successive hidden layers, including five convolution layers and two pool layers. An Inception Block consists of three parallel sub-blocks of convolution layers and pooling layers, whose outputs are later concatenated. The rest of the hidden blocks are Reduction blocks, which are made up of three parallel sub-blocks (two convolution layers and one pooling layer). The feature maps from the following hidden blocks of Inception-V3 are used as inputs to the proposed detector: Stem, Inception-A, Inception-C, Reduction-B, and Avg-pool. Datasets: Three popular image datasets are considered: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN. Each of the three image datasets is divided into three subsets: A training set of 49,000 images, a validation set of 1,000 images, and a testing set of 10,000 images. Attack models: Seven latest adversarial attack strategies are considered:\nAutoAttack¬†,\nFGSM¬†[ref]11, JSMA¬†[ref]12, DeepFool¬†, C&W¬†, PGD¬†, and EAD¬†; see Section¬†II-A. The neural network tool used in support of the defense algorithms¬†is PyTorch, except for the case when PNDetector is taken as the defense technique. This is because the PNDetector is based on TensorFlow¬†8. In this case, Cleverhans¬†9, which supports Tensorflow,¬†is used as the toolbox to support the attack strategies to produce adversarial samples against PNDetector. The other parameter configurations of the attacks are summarized in Table¬†I. Table¬†II illustrates the adversarial examples generated by the latest attacks. All of the attacks can mislead ResNet-34 into misclassifying inputs, often with high confidence. The residuals in the third column of the table show that these attack algorithms cause minor perturbation to the benign images, and hence may evade human inspection. Performance indicator: The area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, or ‚ÄúAUC‚Äù, serves as a performance metric to evaluate the adversarial example detectors. The AUC of a model with 100% incorrect predictions is 0. The AUC of a model with 100% correct predictions is 1 (or 100%). AUC is a useful tool. It assesses the accuracy of the model‚Äôs predictions, regardless of classification threshold¬†. State-of-the-art detectors: The proposed detector is compared with the state-of-the-art adversarial example detectors, namely, LID¬†, DkùëòkNN¬†, NNIF¬†[ref]7, Mahalanobis¬†, BEYOND¬†, and PNDetector¬†, as summarized in Section¬†II-B. The setups of the benchmark detectors are optimized under each of the considered attack models and datasets. Specifically, we optimize the number of neighbors, denoted by kùëòk, for BEYOND, DkùëòkNN and LID; the noise magnitude, denoted by Œ≥ùõæ\\gamma, for the Mahalanobis algorithm; the number of high-influence samples, denoted by HùêªH, for the NNIF; and the false positive ratio (FPR) for the PNDetector.\nBased on the AUC values of the detection ROC curve, all hyper-parameters are validated with the validation set using nested cross entropy validation (except that the original hyper-parameters of NNIF in¬†[ref]7 are used because of significant time to re-train the NNIF, as also pointed out in¬†[ref]7). The hyper-parameters of the benchmark detectors are summarized in Table¬†III. FGSM (0.1) FGSM (8/255) JSMA (1,0.1) JSMA (0.8,0.3) DeepFool C&W PGD (0.02) PGD (8/255) EAD Auto (8/255) Auto (0.02) Setting of the proposed detector: We select five hidden layers from the ResNet-34 model as inputs to the word embedding layer of our detector. Each one is the last layer of a hidden block in the ResNet-34 model (i.e., BN1subscriptBN1\\text{BN}_{1}, Res1subscriptRes1\\text{Res}_{1}, Res2subscriptRes2\\text{Res}_{2}, Res3subscriptRes3\\text{Res}_{3}, and Res4subscriptRes4\\text{Res}_{4}). For the Inception-V3 model, we choose the last layers of its five hidden blocks (i.e., Stem, Inception-A, Inception-C, Reduction-B, and Avg-pool) as inputs to the word embedding layer of the proposed detector. The size of the convolutional kernel used in the CP module is 3√ó3333\\times 3. We use 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-gram convolutional kernels in the sentiment analyzer of the proposed detector. Each of the convolutional kernels has 100 instances with randomly initialized parameters. The proposed detector is trained for 10 epochs to minimize the cross-entropy loss, using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Our experiment setup is consistent with¬†[ref]7 in terms of image classifiers, datasets, attack models, benchmark detectors, and performance indicators.
