      "content": "Paper Title: Framing Relevance for Safety-Critical Autonomous Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis section gives an overview of the history of relevance condensed to the works that we consider especially important with regard to our notion of relevance for an autonomous safety-critical system 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S}.\nWe thereby like to stress that early on approaches were developed to formally describe relevance, that more recently there is intensified research on cognitive aspects of relevance, and that due to mobile IR, a strong link to the real world in space and time has been recognized.\nThe following short compilation is based on   and extended by an update. In the period 1959–1976 efforts were focused on understanding the nature and conceptual subtleties of relevance and devising definitions using various mathematical tools.\nThe main contributions to foundational work were [ref]22: In the year 1960, Maron and Kuhns propose weighted indexing.\nThe computed weights are meant to reflect the probably of the document beeing relevant to that user, so that the documents can be ranked in descending order of predicted relevance. : 1966, Rees notes that the definition of relevance should reflect the influence of “the previous knowledge” of the user and the “usefulness” of the information.\nRelevance is thereby a user construct and highly subjective. , : In 1971, Cooper uses in  mathematical logic to define relevance.\nIn particular, Cooper defines that a sentence s𝑠s is relevant to a sentence r𝑟r if s𝑠s belongs to a minimal set of premises M𝑀M entailing r𝑟r, i.e., relevant​(s,r)relevant𝑠𝑟\\textit{relevant}(s,r) iff ∃M𝑀\\exists M (s∈M∧M⊧r∧M−s⊧̸r)𝑠𝑀𝑀models𝑟𝑀𝑠not-models𝑟(s\\in M\\land M\\models r\\land M-s\\not\\models r).\nA document D={s1,s2,…,sn}𝐷subscript𝑠1subscript𝑠2…subscript𝑠𝑛D=\\{s_{1},s_{2},\\ldots,s_{n}\\} is relevant to a request r𝑟r, R​e​l​e​v​a​n​t​(D,r)𝑅𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑛𝑡𝐷𝑟Relevant(D,r), iff ∃i​(r​e​l​e​v​a​n​t​(si,r))𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑛𝑡subscript𝑠𝑖𝑟\\exists i(relevant(s_{i},r)).\nThereby Cooper gives rise to the today’s notion of logical relevance. In  Wilson (1973) tries to improve Cooper’s definition by taking into account a user’s “situation”, “stock of information” and “goals”.\nToday this kind of relevance is referred to as situational relevance This period ends with the surveys     of Saracevic where he summarizes and classifies previous work, laying the bases for future research. In the following period, a new stream of works is concerned with the importance of the user.\nBy means of empirical end-users studies further relevance criteria, apart from topicality, are identified, based on which users judge the relevance of the retrieved such as e.g. recency, quality or verification.\nDuring this period, cognitive relevance and situational relevance are elaborated by e.g.      . A second stream of works, concerned with defining a logic for IR, is triggered by the works of van Rijsbergen  .\nAs an example we want to mention in particular , where Nie formalises relevance via modal logic and\nKripke’s possible world semantics.\nThe query is represented by a formula and the document by possible worlds. A third stream deals with the challenges induced by mobile scenarios and digitalisation.\nFor this domain the need of representing the world surrounding a user was recognized       . Research on the notion of relevance is still ongoing.\nAmong the open questions is, how are the different dimensions of relevance related?\nHuang & Soergel remark in  that “Relevance is still by and large a black box […] We may be capable of telling whether A is relevant to B, but specifying precisely in what way A is relevant to B is much harder” [19, p. 32]\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: efforts were focused on understanding the nature and conceptual subtleties of relevance and devising definitions using various mathematical tools.\nThe main contributions to foundational work were [ref]22: In the year 1960, Maron and Kuhns propose weighted indexing.\nThe computed weights are meant to reflect the probably of the document beeing relevant to that user, so that the documents can be\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
