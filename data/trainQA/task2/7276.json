      "content": "Paper Title: Zoom-shot: Fast and Efficient Unsupervised Zero-Shot Transfer of CLIP to Vision Encoders with Multimodal Loss\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nComputer vision has recently witnessed a paradigm shift with the integration of the vision and language domains leading to the creation of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). These VLMs, exemplified by CLIP 4, have enabled many applications, from zero-shot classification to image generation   . However, many of the existing VLMs demand significant resources for training and inference    . The cost of training especially limits the discovery of novel applications. It confines novel VLMs to being created by large organisations with access to significant computing resources. In many cases, combating this has required a huge effort by the open-source community 3. Unfortunately, this all remains out of scope for the vast majority of research efforts. We need an accessible method, in terms of both compute and data, for developing the next generation of VLMs, such that they can be feasibly trained by researchers with access to limited computing resources. With regard to this, we consider training from scratch to be infeasible. Instead, we consider methods that can transfer the knowledge inside existing VLMs into new ones. As an analogy, gaining the knowledge to write a book may take years, yet gaining the knowledge from reading it, may only take days.\nA recent work, [ref]28, demonstrates a promising route through cross-model alignment, obviating training from scratch by mapping between the latent spaces of pre-trained vision encoders. Surprisingly, this can be performed by learning only a linear mapping. Doing so, one can augment a vision only model as a novel VLM via mapping to CLIP’s joint vision-language latent space.\nHowever, their method only focuses on mapping image features into a fundamentally multimodal latent space.\nThis is problematic, as the interaction between text and image features enables CLIP’s VLM capabilities.\nMoreover, the recently identified modality gap   between CLIP’s image and text features underscores that solely mapping image features only accounts for a subspace within CLIP’s larger latent space. In our work, we propose Zoom-shot (ZerO-shOt transfer with Multimodal loss), named for its fast and efficient transfer of CLIP’s zero-shot capabilities to arbitrary pre-trained vision encoders. Zoom-shot improves the quality of the learnt linear map by utilising multimodal loss functions. These loss functions are designed to capture the interaction between text and image features in CLIP’s latent space. Furthermore, Zoom-shot is entirely unsupervised and is trained using unpaired data. We conduct zero-shot classification tests using five pre-trained vision encoders of varying size and capability (MobileNetV3 small 1, DenseNet-121 2, ResNet-18 , DINOv1 , DINOv2 2). From the efficiency of MobileNetV3, to the robustness of DINOv2, these vision encoders were selected as they cover a range of capabilities. Additionally, it is important to examine our methods’ performance across a range of image classification datasets. As such, we select three coarse grained and four fine-grained datasets of varying difficulty. The coarse grained datasets are CIFAR-10 8, CIFA-R100 8 and ImageNet , with the fine-grained being CUB200 3, Flowers-102 0, Herbarium-19 1, Oxford-IIIT Pets 3 and Stanford Cars 7. Using our multimodal loss functions, Zoom-shot achieves a new state-of-the-art on nearly all tested datasets and models within this problem domain. A summary of our results is shown Figure 1.\nWe conduct a number of ablation experiments to further investigate how the multimodal loss functions improve the quality of the linear mapping. Doing so, we find Zoom-shot posses a trade-off between compute and data; and show the linear mapping can be learnt using only 1% of the ImageNet training data, given sufficient epochs. Additionally, we find the distribution of training images significantly impacts performance. We liken this approach to the vision encoders reading different books on different subjects (different training distributions), all written by the teacher, CLIP. We release all models and make our code available on GitHub.\n Our main contributions are as follows: We introduce multimodal loss functions for the unsupervised training of linear mapping functions between CLIP and pre-trained vision encoders, enhancing knowledge transfer in our Zoom-shot approach. Even though the training does not require paired image-text data, it still can capture important interactions between text and image features. Our multimodal loss functions comprise two parts: the cycle-consistency loss  and the novel prompt-guided knowledge distillation (PG-KD). Whilst the cycle-consistency loss has been widely used in the literature, our novel PK-KD is unique. By combining the concept of knowledge distillation 0 with the CLIP zero-shot classification, PG-KD enables Zoom-shot to learn the interactions between text and image/vision. We demonstrate the importance of capturing these interactions by achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance over the previous method, [ref]28. In comparison, [ref]28 only focus on mapping features from the vision encoder and require 6 epochs for training. Zoom-shot only requires a single epoch to achieve these impressive results. We conduct extensive ablation studies in order to fully understand our method. We discover Zoom-shot possesses a trade-off between compute and training data, meaning situations with limited data can be overcome with compensatory compute. Additionally, we find data coverage is a limiting factor.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: the knowledge inside existing VLMs into new ones.
