      "content": "Paper Title: Distributed Learning with Dependent Samples\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the development of data mining, data of massive size are collected in numerous application areas including recommender systems, medical analysis, search engines, financial analysis, online text sensor network monitoring and social activity mining.\nThese massive data certainly bring benefits for data analysis in terms of improving the prediction capability , discovering potential structure of data which cannot be reflected by data of small size , and creating new growth opportunities to combine and analyze industry data . However, they also bring several challenges, called massive data challenges, in data analysis as follows: ∙∙\\bullet Distributive storage: Chunks of data are spread across multiple possibly distant servers.\nThe cost of data communications between different servers and risk of loading data in a remote server are relatively large. This makes the classical batch learning schemes such as kernel methods  and neural networks  be not available. For example, Google has seen 30 trillion URLs, crawls over 20 billion of those a day , and answers 100 billion search queries a month. It is impossible to store all these data in a serve and answer the query swiftly by using all these data in a batch manner. ∙∙\\bullet Data privacy preservation: Individual data such as clinical records, personal social networks and financial fraud detection [ref]29 are frequently sensitive and cannot be shared for the sake of privacy. It is difficult to analyze these data in a batch manner, hoping that all sensitive data can be successfully collected.\nThe data privacy issue becomes urgent when data are owned by different organizations that wish to collaboratively use them.\nFor instance, multiple hospitals are highly desired to collaboratively train a classifier to improve the quality of clinical decision-making, in the premise of preserving the privacy of their own medical records . ∙∙\\bullet Dependence for samples:\nMassive data are collected asynchronously throughout time and behave as a stream or a collection of streams in many applications such as medical research and revenue management. Therefore, it is unreasonable to assume them to be collected via an independent and identical (i.i.d.) manner. Under this circumstance, the classical learning approaches    developed for i.i.d. samples are no more efficient. For example, WTI (Western Texas Intermediate) Spot Prices from EIA (Energy Information Administration), an important part of the international energy pricing system , collect numerous spot prices as time series data which obviously do not satisfy the i.i.d. assumption. Analysis of massive WTI data is of great significance for economic development, enterprise production operations and investment. Distributed learning  is a natural and preferable approach to conquer massive data challenges. Different from the popular decentralized setting  3 2 2, we are interested in distributed learning with a global coordination (global machine) among servers (local machines) 0  3 1 . In such a setting, data subsets are stored on numerous local machines and some specific learning algorithm is implemented on each local machine to yield a local estimator. Then, communications between different local machines are conducted to exchange information to improve the quality of local estimators. Finally, as shown in Figure 1, all the obtained local estimators are transmitted to a global machine to produce a global estimator. Therefore, there are three ingredients of the\ndistributed learning: local processing, communication, and synthesization. Such a distributed learning is a special type of the well known map-reduce approach  and can be easily realized via the well developed Hadoop system . Since communications among different local machines bring additional risk of privacy disclosure , we consider distributed learning without communications among local machines, where only local processing and synthesization are adopted in the distributed system  0.\nIf the data are i.i.d. drawn, it was proved in   7 1 that such a distributed learning scheme performs the same as its batch counterpart that runs learning algorithms with whole data stored on a large enough machine, provided the number of local machines is not too large. The problem is, however, that such nice results depend heavily on the i.i.d. nature of data and cannot be extended to non-i.i.d. sequences directly. In fact, it remains open to demonstrate the feasibility of distributed learning in tackling distributively stored non-i.i.d. data, especially for the theoretical side. The aim of this paper is to present theoretical verifications to guarantee the feasibility and efficiency of distributed learning for non-i.i.d. data.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: the query swiftly by using all these data in a batch manner. ∙∙\\bullet Data privacy preservation: Individual data such as clinical records, personal social networks and financial fraud detection [ref]29 are frequently sensitive and cannot be shared for the sake of privacy.
