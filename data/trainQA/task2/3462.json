      "content": "Paper Title: Do Lessons from Metric Learning Generalize to Image-Caption Retrieval?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGiven a query item in one modality, cross-modal retrieval is the task of retrieving similar items in another modality¬†.\nWe focus on image-caption retrieval (ICR)¬†[ref]24  [ref]23 .\nFor the ICR task, given an image or a caption as a query, systems have to retrieve the positive (e.g., matching or similar) item(s) in the other modality.\nMost ICR methods work with a separate encoder for each modality to map the input data to a representation in a shared latent space¬† [ref]24 2  [ref]23.\nThe encoders are optimized by using a contrastive-loss criterion, so as to enforce a high degree of similarity between representations of matching items in the latent space.\nFor retrieval, a similarity score between a query and each candidate in a candidate set is computed to produce a ranking with the top-kùëòk best matching items.\nA lot of recent work on ICR relies on\n\n\n(1) pre-training on large amounts of data   , and\n\n(2) more sophisticated (and data-hungry) model architectures  2 [ref]24  [ref]23 .\n\n\nHowever, pre-training on large-scale datasets is not always an option, either due to a lack of compute power, a lack of data, or both.\nHence, it is important to continue to develop effective ICR methods that only rely on a modest amount of data. To learn the similarity between a query and candidate representations, most ICR work relies on the standard Triplet loss with semi-hard negatives (Triplet SH)¬†2 [ref]24   [ref]23   or on the cross-entropy based NT-Xent¬†  loss.\nIn metric learning, the focus is on loss functions that result in more accurate item representations (in terms of a given evaluation metric) that can distinguish between similar and dissimilar items in a low-dimensional latent space¬†.\nThere has been important progress in metric learning, with the introduction of new loss functions that result in better evaluation scores on a specific (evaluation) task.\nFor example SmoothAP¬†, it is a smooth approximation of the discrete evaluation metric Average Precision. By using SmoothAP, a retrieval method can be optimized with a discrete ranking evaluation metric and can handle multiple positive candidates simultaneously, which is not possible for the standard Triplet loss.\nLoss functions such as SmoothAP narrow the gap between the training setting and a discrete evaluation objective and thereby improve evaluation scores. Research goal.\nMost metric learning functions work with general representations of similar/dissimilar candidates and, in principle, there is no clear argument why obtained results on a specific task/method should not generalize to other tasks or methods.\nHence, can newly introduced metric learning approaches, that is, alternative loss functions, be used to increase the performance of ICR methods?\nWe compare three loss function for the ICR task:\n\n\n(1) the Triplet loss , including semi-hard negative mining,\n\n(2) NT-Xent loss¬†, and\n\n(3) SmoothAP¬†.\n\n\nWe expect SmoothAP to result in the highest performance based on the findings in in the context of image retrieval  and in representation learning¬†. Main findings.\nFollowing¬†, we evaluate the three loss functions on fixed methods, with different datasets, and with a fixed training regime (i.e., training hyper-parameters) to verify which loss function uses the given training data as effectively as possible.\nSurprisingly, the lessons from metric learning do not generalize to ICR.\nThe Triplet loss with semi-hard negative mining still outperforms the other loss functions that we consider.\nThe promising results obtained by SmoothAP and the NT-Xent loss in other fields do not generalize to the ICR task. To get a better grasp of this unexpected outcome, we propose counting contributing samples (COCOS), a method for analyzing contrastive loss functions.\nThe gradient w.r.t.¬†the query for the Triplet loss, NT-Xent and SmoothAP can be formulated as a sum over the representations of the positive and negative candidates in the training batch.\nThe main difference between the loss functions lies in the number of samples used when computing the gradient w.r.t.¬†the query and how each sample is weighted.\nWe compare loss functions by counting how many samples contribute to the gradient w.r.t.¬†the query representation at their convergence points.\nThis yields an explanation of why one loss function outperforms another on the ICR task. Main contributions.\n\n\n(1) We experimentally compare three loss functions from the metric learning domain to determine if promising results from metric learning generalize to the ICR task, and find that the Triplet loss semi-hard (SH) still results in the highest evaluation scores.\n\n(2) We propose COCOS, a way of analyzing contrastive loss functions, by defining a count that tells us how many candidates in the batch contribute to the gradient w.r.t.¬†the query. On average, the best performing loss function takes at most one (semi-hard) negative sample into account when computing the gradient.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: Given a query item in one modality, cross-modal retrieval is the task of retrieving similar items in another modality¬†.\nWe focus on image-caption retrieval (ICR)¬†[ref]24  [ref]23 .\nFor the ICR task, given an image or a caption as a query, systems have to retrieve the positive (e.g., matching or similar) item(s) in the other modality.\nMost ICR methods work\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
