      "content": "Paper Title: Taming the Tail in Class-Conditional GANs: Knowledge Sharing via Unconditional Training at Lower Resolutions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConditional Generative Adversarial Networks The initial work on conditional image generation using GANs  was presented by 8, in which the class conditions were concatenated to the inputs of the generator and discriminator networks. The AC-GAN 2 proposed the use of auxiliary classification in the discriminator.  introduced BigGAN and set a milestone in large-scale and high-resolution conditional image generation. The Authors of StyleGAN  [ref]16 first map the input noise and class condition to a latent style space, which is then passed to the multiple layers of the generator for image synthesis. More recently, an extension of the StyleGAN called StyleGAN-XL  has become the state-of-the-art in conditional image generation on several datasets, including ImageNet and outperforming more complex and time-consuming approaches such as diffusion models . GAN Regularization under Limited Data Training GANs under limited data is challenging as the discriminator can memorize the training samples, resulting in the collapse of the training or quality degradation of the generated images. Recently, data augmentation techniques have been incorporated into GAN training as a means to mitigate this problem  [ref]16 . Additionally,  introduced a regularization term to the GAN objective, which tracks the predictions of the discriminator for real and generated images using separate moving averages. 0 employed off-the-shelf vision models in an ensemble of discriminators, demonstrating improved performance in both limited-data and large-scale GAN training. In the context of few-shot image generation, FastGAN 2 proposed a lightweight architecture with a self-supervised discriminator.  introduced cross-domain distance consistency in order to transfer the diversity from a source domain to a target domain. Subsequently,  proposed a latent-mixup strategy to smooth the latent space through controlled latent interpolation. Recently,   have observed that class-conditioning can cause mode collapse in the limited data regime. Their proposed work learns from limited but balanced/unlabelled data, which is different from our setup: heavily imbalanced long-tail data.  proposed Transitional-cGAN, a training strategy that starts with unconditional GAN objective and injects class-conditional information during a transition period. This approach was found to be effective in mitigating mode-collapse in the limited data regime.\nOur main idea of separating pathways between the low-resolution and high-resolution is novel w.r.t. : to promote knowledge sharing, we modify cGAN architecture such that the lower-resolution part of the generator is entirely unconditional while only the higher-resolution part is conditional and received class-conditional information. Long-tail Recognition\nTo address the long-tail recognition problem  , previous research has primarily focused on techniques such as class re-balancing  7 7, learning algorithm and model design   , and information augmentation 3  .\nMore related to our work, re-sampling   has been widely used to handle class imbalance problems. This involves balancing the number of samples used during training through over-sampling and/or under-sampling. Over-sampling increases the frequency of tail classes  0 while under-sampling reduces the imbalance by reducing the frequency of head class instances 4 . Note, our research diverges from prior studies on long-tail recognition by addressing the more challenging task of generative modeling of the long-tail data, as opposed to the conventional long-tail classification task. Training GANs on Long-tail Data Recent years have seen a growing interest in learning from long-tail data. However, most focus has been directed toward recognition tasks, with a limited number of studies addressing the development of generative models for long-tail data. GAMO 0 uses adversarial training to over-sample from minority classes. 4 introduced class-balancing regularization to the GAN objective, which leverages the predictions of a pretrained classifier to improve the generation of underrepresented classes in an unconditional setting. However, this method trains an unconditional GAN and is restricted to having access to a pre-trained classifier on the long-tail data to guide the training. The most closely related work to ours is the Group Spectral Regularization (GSR) 5 and NoisyTwins 6 regularizations.\nThe authors identified mode collapse on tail classes as a result of the spectral norm explosion in class-conditional BatchNorms and the collapse of the latents in the StyleGANs 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} space, respectively. In contrast, we present a novel approach for sharing knowledge between head and tail classes to enhance long-tail learning — which is orthogonal to regularization techniques. In addition, while 6 is constrained to StyleGANs, our framework can be extended to different GAN architectures.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: 2 proposed the use of auxiliary classification in the discriminator.  introduced BigGAN and set a milestone in large-scale and high-resolution conditional image generation.
