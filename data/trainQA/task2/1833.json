      "content": "Paper Title: Affordance Transfer Learning for Human-Object Interaction Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHuman-object interaction (HOI) detection are receiving increasing attention from the community . HOI detection aims to not only detect object and human in an image, but also reason the relationships between human and objects. Since Gputa et al.[ref]12 presented a Human-Object Interaction approach, massive traditional methods   were introduced for HOI recognition using spatial relation [ref]12, pose , human part  in the early. Recently, Chao et al. introduced a large HOI recognition data HICO  and a challenging HOI detection dataset HICO-DET  for HOI understanding. Meanwhile, Gupta et al.[ref]13 introduced the V-COCO dataset, which mainly focuses on the grounding of verbs and their semantic roles. Currently, there are a large number of HOI detection approaches   9 6 2  8 5 3 3  improving the HOI benchmark  [ref]13 [ref]17. According to the target, current methods can be categoried into two-stage HOI detection, which contains common HOI detection   4 6 5 and few-and zero-shot HOI detection 2  8 [ref]17 8  5 6, and one-stage HOI detection 3 7 . Recently, Hou et al.[ref]17 propose a visual compositional learning framework to compose novel HOI samples between pair-wise HOI images for low-and zero-shot HOI detection. However, VCL [ref]17 can not compose human-novel-object interactions and ignores the possibility of affordance recognition with HOI model. We introduce a novel framework, Affordance Transfer Learning, to transfer the affordance representation to novel objects via composing affordance and novel object representations, and thus enable the detection of HOIs with novel objects.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: receiving increasing attention from the community .
