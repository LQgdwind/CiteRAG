      "content": "Paper Title: Tight approximability of MAX 2-SAT and relatives, under UGC\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor over half a century , computer scientists have been concerned with designing optimal approximation algorithms for a variety of optimization problems. One of the most popular classes of optimization problems to study is Boolean Constraint Satisfaction Problems, where one is given a collection of Boolean variables with constraints (or predicates) on subsets of variables dictating what a valid assignment to the variables should satisfy. The optimization problem MAX CSP is concerned with finding a solution that maximizes the number of satisfied constraints. In general, this problem is NP-hard, but much research has gone into finding optimal approximation algorithms with corresponding hardness results. The leading technique for approximating MAX CSPs is via semidefinite programming (SDP). This method was first used by Goemans and Williamson  for a variety of MAX CSPs including MAX CUT, MAX 2-SAT, MAX DI-CUT  and MAX SAT. In particular, the Goemans-Williamson algorithm for MAX CUT achieves an approximation ratio of αGW≈0.87856subscript𝛼GW0.87856\\alpha_{\\text{GW}}\\approx 0.87856, which is still the best known to date. The best evidence for the optimality of this algorithm is that, assuming Khot’s Unique Games Conjecture (UGC) , it is NP-hard to approximate MAX CUT to a ratio of αGW+εsubscript𝛼GW𝜀\\alpha_{\\text{GW}}+\\varepsilon for any ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0. This was proved by the combined efforts of Khot, Kindler, Mossel and O’Donnell  who outlined the hardness reduction and Mossel, O’Donnell and Oleszkiewicz  (see also ) who proved the Majority is Stablest conjecture to complete the analysis. However, the algorithms found by Goemans and Williamson for MAX 2-SAT, MAX DI-CUT  and MAX SAT have since been improved by Feige and Goemans , Matuura and Matsui  and Lewin, Livnat and Zwick  and others. See the survey of Makarychev and Makarychev  and the recent progress by Brakensiek, Huang, Potechin and Zwick [ref]9 for MAX DI-CUT. In this paper, we primarily focus on studying MAX 2-SAT. Since the work of Lewin, Livnat and Zwick , the best known approximation ratio for MAX 2-SAT has been βL​L​Z≈0.940subscript𝛽𝐿𝐿𝑍0.940\\beta_{LLZ}\\approx 0.940. However, a proof of optimality has remained elusive. Khot, Kindler, Mossel and O’Donnell  also showed that it is UGC-hard, i.e., NP-hard under the UGC conjecture, to approximate BALANCED MAX 2-SAT, to within βB​A​L+εsubscript𝛽𝐵𝐴𝐿𝜀\\beta_{BAL}+\\varepsilon, for any ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, where βB​A​L≈0.943943subscript𝛽𝐵𝐴𝐿0.943943\\beta_{BAL}\\approx 0.943943 and BALANCED MAX 2-SAT is the version of MAX 2-SAT in which the total weight of clauses in which a variable appears positively is equal to the total weight of clauses in which it appears negatively. They also conjectured that balanced instances are the hardest for MAX 2-SAT. Austrin , refuting the conjecture of Khot, Kindler, Mossel and O’Donnell  that balanced instances are hardest for MAX 2-SAT, showed that it is UGC-hard to approximate MAX 2-SAT to within βL​L​Z−+εsubscriptsuperscript𝛽𝐿𝐿𝑍𝜀\\beta^{-}_{LLZ}+\\varepsilon, for any ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, where βL​L​Z−≈0.94016567subscriptsuperscript𝛽𝐿𝐿𝑍0.94016567\\beta^{-}_{LLZ}\\approx 0.94016567 is the ratio obtained by the LLZ algorithm with the optimal tuning of its parameters on simple, but not necessarily balanced, configurations. Austrin  conjectured that βL​L​Z−=βL​L​Zsubscriptsuperscript𝛽𝐿𝐿𝑍subscript𝛽𝐿𝐿𝑍\\beta^{-}_{LLZ}=\\beta_{LLZ}, where βL​L​Zsubscript𝛽𝐿𝐿𝑍\\beta_{LLZ} is the ratio obtained by the optimally tuned LLZ algorithm on all, not necessarily simple, configurations, and hence on all instances of MAX 2-SAT. We prove this conjecture, which we refer to as the Simplicity Conjecture. (The conjecture is also implicit in .) This shows that it is UGC-hard to approximate MAX 2-SAT to within βL​L​Z+εsubscript𝛽𝐿𝐿𝑍𝜀\\beta_{LLZ}+\\varepsilon, for any ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, that the LLZ algorithm is essentially an optimal approximation algorithm for MAX 2-SAT, and that βL​L​Z≈0.94016567subscript𝛽𝐿𝐿𝑍0.94016567\\beta_{LLZ}\\approx 0.94016567 is the exact approximability threshold of MAX 2-SAT, under UGC. 111Several previous papers, e.g.,    , state this result without mentioning that it relies on the now proven simplicity conjecture.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: by Feige and Goemans , Matuura and Matsui  and Lewin, Livnat and Zwick  and others.
