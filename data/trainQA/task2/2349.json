      "content": "Paper Title: Repo2Vec: A Comprehensive Embedding Approach for Determining Repository Similarity\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe provide some background on GitHub and describe embedding approaches, which we extend and use later.\n A. GitHub and its features.\nGitHub is a massive software archive, which\nenables users to store and share code\ncreating a global social network of interaction. Users can collaborate on a repository by raising issues or forking projects, where they copy and evolve projects. Users can follow projects, and “up-vote” projects using “stars”.\nWe describe the key elements of a GitHub repository here. A repository contains three types of information (a) metadata, (b) project directory, and (c) source code files, which we explain below. a. Metadata: A repository in GitHub has a large number of metadata fields. Most notable are: (a) title, (b) descriptions, (c) topics, and (d) readme file. All these fields are optional and they are provided by\nthe author. Commit and issues are other sources of textual metadata which include messages about the specific functionality of the repository.\nAt the same time, there are metrics that capture the popularity of a repository including: (a) stars, (b) forks, and (c) watches. As the text fields are provided by the repository author, they can be unstructured,\nnoisy, or missing altogether. b. Source code: It is the core element of a software repository. A repository contains software projects written in various programming languages such as C/C++, Java, Python, and so on. These source codes are the logical centre of a software stored in a repository. c. Project directory structure: A well-crafted software repository follows a best-practices directory structure containing dataset, source code, and other auxiliary files. We hypothesize that the structure could be useful in establishing similarity between repositories. B. Embedding approaches.\nAn embedding (a.k.a. distributed representation) is\nan unsupervised approach for mapping entities, such as words or images, into a relatively low-dimensional space by using a deep neural network on a large training corpus  .\nAlthough the method is unsupervised, it relies on ideally a large dataset,\nwhich is used to “train” the neural network. The neural network develops a model of the dataset, which we can think of as probabilities and correlations of its entities.\nEmbedding approaches have revolutionized research in several fields, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP)   [ref]16 [ref]17, computer vision , graph mining  [ref]20, and software analysis . The power of an embedding is twofold:\n(a) it can simplify the representation of a complex entity with diverse features, including categorical, and (b) it provides a way to quantify entity similarity as a function of the distance of their corresponding vectors.\nAn efficient embedding has the following properties: (a) it gives a fixed and low dimensional vector, and (b) it ensures that semantically similar objects are “close by” in the embedding space. a. Word embedding: word2vec.\nIn the seminal word2vec work ,\nwe map words to vectors in a way that similar words, such as “father” and “parent”, map to nearby vectors.\nThis similarity is established by “feeding” a large corpus of documents to the deep\nneural network.\nIn other words, the model captures word correlations by\ncalculating the probability with which a\nword can appear within a given neighborhood of words. b. Document embedding: doc2vec.\nThe doc2vec  is an unsupervised embedding model for a variable length paragraph or document.\nThe model takes a document as input and maps it to an M-dimensional embedding vectors while doing a proxy task, predicting target word or sampled words in the document. In more detail, the document embedding model is based on the word embedding  model. The main difference between them is the introduction of the document id vector.\nLike word2vec, there are two types of doc2vec available:\n(a) Distributed Memory Model of Paragraph Vectors (PV-DM) and (b) Distributed Bag of Words version of Paragraph Vector (PV-DBOW).\nPV-DM is similar to the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) model in word2vec.\nThe PV-DBOW model is similar to the skip-gram model of word2vec. The document vector is calculated at the same time as the word vectors of the document.\nNote that, PV-DM performs better for large, and well-structured documents. On the other hand, PV-DBOW is considered a better choice for small and defective documents, as it is computationally fast.\n c. Code embedding: code2vec.\nEmbedding approaches have also been proposed for detecting code similarity.\nA recent approach is code2vec\nwhich maps a method (or more generally a code snippet) of arbitrary length\nto an M-dimensional vector  .\nThe code2vec approach uses program structure explicitly\nto predicting program properties and uses an attention based neural network that learns\na continuous\ndistributed vector representation for the code snippet.\nAs a result, one can compare and group code snippets.\nThe process is fairly involved as it attempts to capture\nthe logical structure and flow of the program and the sequence of commands.\nFor example, the code is decomposed into a set of paths based on its\nabstract syntax tree. The neural network learns simultaneously:\nthe representation of each path and how to aggregate a set of them.\nDue to space limitations, we refer the interested reader to the original work . d. Node embedding: node2vec.\nThe node2vec [ref]20 is a graph embedding approach for mapping a node in a network to an M-dimensional embedding vector. The model maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). In more detail, the model computes the embedding based on nodes neighborhoods. First, the network structure is converted to a set of paths (node sequences) using a biased random walk sampling strategy which combines Depth-First Sampling (DFS) and Breadth-First Sampling (BFS) for every nodes. The sampling strategy efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods of a given node.\nThese sets of paths can be analogized to the sentences in a document.\nThen the model is trained on these node sequences with the skip-gram models presented in word2vec  to get the vector representations for each node. For more details about the model, we refer to the original paper [ref]20.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: the dataset, which we can think of as probabilities and correlations of its entities.\nEmbedding approaches have revolutionized research in several fields, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP)   [ref]16 [ref]17, computer vision , graph mining  [ref]20, and software analysis . The power of an embedding is twofold:\n(a) it can simplify the representation of a complex entity with diverse\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
