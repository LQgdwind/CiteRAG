      "content": "Paper Title: Map matching queries on realistic input graphs under the Fréchet distance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLocation-aware devices have enabled the tracking of vehicle trajectories. In urban environments, vehicle trajectories align with an underlying road network. However, imprecision in the Global Positioning System introduces errors into the trajectory data. Map matching aims to mitigate the effects of these errors by computing a path on the underlying road network that best represents the vehicle’s trajectory. See Figure 1. Map matching is a common preprocessing step for analysing vehicle trajectories. As such, numerous map matching algorithms have been proposed across multiple communities (e.g. in the Urban Planning, Geographic Information Systems, and Databases communities). Map matching was the focus of the 2012 ACM SIGSPATIAL Cup . For an overview of the extensive literature on map matching, see the surveys  0 2 4  . In the theory community, by far the most popular approach is to embed the road network and the trajectory into the Euclidean plane, and to compute a path on the road network that is the most spatially similar to the trajectory  [ref]8   [ref]38 8 1, where spatial similarity is measured using the Fréchet distance [ref]6. Formally, the map matching problem under the Fréchet distance is defined as follows. Given a graph P𝑃P and a trajectory Q𝑄Q in the plane, compute a path π𝜋\\pi in P𝑃P that minimises dF​(π,Q)subscript𝑑𝐹𝜋𝑄d_{F}(\\pi,Q), where dF​(⋅,⋅)subscript𝑑𝐹⋅⋅d_{F}(\\cdot,\\cdot) denotes the Fréchet distance. In a seminal paper by Alt, Efrat, Rote and Wenk , the authors study Problem 1 on geometric planar graphs. They provide an O​(p​q​log⁡p)𝑂𝑝𝑞𝑝O(pq\\log p) time algorithm, where p𝑝p is the complexity of the graph and q𝑞q is the complexity of the trajectory. Their idea is to construct a free space surface, which is a generalisation of the free space diagram [ref]6, and then to perform a sweep line algorithm where a set of reachable points is maintained at the sweep line’s current position. Alt et al. ’s algorithm forms the basis of several existing implementations [ref]8  8 9 1. Brakatsoulas et al. [ref]8 implement Alt et al. ’s algorithm and experimentally compare it to a linear-time heuristic and an algorithm minimising the weak Fréchet distance. In their experiments, forty-five vehicle trajectories, each with approximately one hundred edges, are mapped onto an underlying road network with approximately ten thousand edges. Their experiments conclude that out of the three algorithms, Alt et al. ’s provides the best map matching results but is the slowest. Subsequent papers focus on improving the practical running time of the algorithm 8 1. We show that a significantly faster algorithm for geometric planar map matching is unlikely to exist, unless SETH fails. Traditional analysis focuses on worst case instances, which are unlikely to occur in practice. By making realistic input assumptions, we can circumvent these worst-case instances, and provide bounds that better reflect running time on realistic input. In computational movement analysis, the most popular realistic input assumption is c𝑐c-packedness. A set of edges is c𝑐c-packed if the total length of edges inside any ball is at most c𝑐c times the radius of the ball. Given two c𝑐c-packed trajectories of complexity n𝑛n, one can (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-approximate their Fréchet distance in O​(c​ε−1/2​log⁡(1/ε)​n+c​n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑐superscript𝜀121𝜀𝑛𝑐𝑛𝑛O(c\\varepsilon^{-1/2}\\log(1/\\varepsilon)n+cn\\log n) time  , circumventing the Ω​(n2−δ)Ωsuperscript𝑛2𝛿\\Omega(n^{2-\\delta}) lower bound for all δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0 implied by SETH  . Chen, Driemel, Guibas, Nguyen and Wenk  study map matching on realistic input graphs and realistic input trajectories. They provide a (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-approximation algorithm that runs in O​((p+q)​log⁡(p+q)+(ϕ​q+c​p)​log⁡p​q​log⁡(p+q)+(ϕ​ε−2​q+c​ε−1​p)​log⁡(p​q))𝑂𝑝𝑞𝑝𝑞italic-ϕ𝑞𝑐𝑝𝑝𝑞𝑝𝑞italic-ϕsuperscript𝜀2𝑞𝑐superscript𝜀1𝑝𝑝𝑞O((p+q)\\log(p+q)+(\\phi q+cp)\\log pq\\log(p+q)+(\\phi\\varepsilon^{-2}q+c\\varepsilon^{-1}p)\\log(pq)) time, where the graph is ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi-low-density and has complexity p𝑝p, and the trajectory is c𝑐c-packed and has complexity q𝑞q. A graph is ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi-low-density if, for any ball of radius r𝑟r, the number of edges with length at least r𝑟r that intersect the ball is at most ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi. Note that a c𝑐c-packed graph is 2​c2𝑐2c-low-density . Chen et al.  implement their algorithm to map trajectories, each with at most one hundred edges, onto an underlying road network with approximately one million edges. Their experiments show significant running time improvements compared to previous work. On large road networks, their map matching algorithm runs in under a second, whereas previous algorithms [ref]8 1 require several hours. For both general graphs and realistic input graphs, a shortcoming of the existing map matching algorithms is that, every time a trajectory is matched, the entire road network needs to be reprocessed from scratch. This is reflected in the linear dependence on p𝑝p in the running times of Alt et al.  and Chen et al. , where p𝑝p is the complexity of the input graph. If we were to build a data structure for efficient map matching queries, then we would remove the need to reprocess the graph every time a new trajectory is mapped. Formally, the query version of the map matching problem is given below. Given a graph P𝑃P in the plane, construct a data structure so that given a query trajectory Q𝑄Q in the plane, the data structure returns minπ⁡dF​(π,Q)subscript𝜋subscript𝑑𝐹𝜋𝑄\\min_{\\pi}d_{F}(\\pi,Q), where π𝜋\\pi ranges over all paths in P𝑃P and dF​(⋅,⋅)subscript𝑑𝐹⋅⋅d_{F}(\\cdot,\\cdot) denotes the Fréchet distance. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to study map matching queries under the Fréchet distance. Obtaining a data structure for Problem 2 with query time that is sublinear in the complexity of the graph is stated as an open problem in  and in [ref]38.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: the most popular approach is to embed the road network and the trajectory into the Euclidean plane, and to compute a path on the road network that is the most spatially similar to the trajectory  [ref]8   [ref]38 8 1, where spatial similarity is measured using the Fréchet distance [ref]6.
