      "content": "Paper Title: Sanity Checks Revisited: An Exploration to Repair the Model Parameter Randomisation Test\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the following, we summarise the concerns that have been raised about various methodological aspects of\nMPRT, specifically its choice of (a) pre-processing, (b) layer-order and (c) similarity measure. For each issue, we put forward a\nsolution. (a) Pre-processing. In the original formulation of MPRT [ref]15, the explanations 𝒆𝒆{\\bm{e}} and 𝒆^^𝒆\\hat{{\\bm{e}}} are normalised using their minimum and maximum values. This is problematic as these statistics are highly variable and almost arbitrary across attributions, complicating meaningful comparison across randomisations [ref]20. Taking absolute attribution values may erase meaningful information [ref]17—a caveat already addressed by the seminal work [ref]15. (Proposed Solution) To maintain the original scale and distribution of the explanation, we recommend normalising 𝐞𝐞{\\bm{e}} by the square root of the average second-moment estimate [ref]20 (see Equation 5 in Supplement) which does not constrain attributions to a fixed range and enhances comparability across methods and randomisations [ref]20. (b) Layer-order. While one might intuitively expect a significant difference in the explanation output upon top-layer randomisation, i.e., ρ​(𝒆,𝒆^)≪1much-less-than𝜌𝒆^𝒆1\\rho({\\bm{e}},\\hat{{\\bm{e}}})\\ll 1 with f^ltsubscriptsuperscript^𝑓𝑡𝑙\\hat{f}^{t}_{l} up to layer l∈[L,L−1,…,1]𝑙𝐿𝐿1…1l\\in[L,L-1,\\ldots,1]; [ref]20 provides evidence to the contrary. As discussed in-depth in the original publication [ref]20, top-down randomisation induces only modest alterations in the forward pass where (i) irrelevant features from lower, non-randomised layers persist in higher, randomised layers, (ii) high activations in lower layers are relatively likely to continue to dominate the network’s response and (iii) architectures with skip connections, e.g., ResNets  maintain a baseline explanation that stays constant even after randomisation, preserving certain features.\nAs such, only a limited degree of change between 𝒆𝒆{\\bm{e}} and 𝒆^^𝒆\\hat{{\\bm{e}}} can be expected from faithful explanation methods post-model randomisation.\n(Proposed Solution) To avoid preserving information in the forward pass, it is advisable to perform bottom-up randomisation (as further discussed in the Supplement 6.2)\nor perform the comparison of explanations only after full randomisation (see Equation 3. (c) Similarity Measures. Another shortcoming identified by [ref]20 is the property of SSIM and other pairwise similarity measures, e.g., Spearman Rank Correlation, to be minimised by statistically uncorrelated random processes. This is problematic since it implies that certain explanation methods with more intrinsic (shattering) noise, e.g., gradient-based methods, will be favoured in ranking comparisons, ultimately biasing evaluation outcomes. (Proposed Solution) While no solution has been proposed to date, we put forward the sMPRT and eMPRT modifications which separately addresses the issues by denoising attributions as a pre-processing step and replacing the pairwise similarity measure with a complexity measure, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: of\nMPRT, specifically its choice of (a) pre-processing, (b) layer-order and (c) similarity measure.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
