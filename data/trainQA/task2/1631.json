      "content": "Paper Title: Image Captioning using Deep Stacked LSTMs, Contextual Word Embeddings and Data Augmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe can classify the approaches used for image caption generation into three categories. In first category are the template-based approaches which use caption templates and generate the captions according to a template after detecting objects and recognizing attributes in an input image. As an example, Li et. al.  first learn the relationships between different objects present in an image and then parse a sentence into multiple phrases followed by learning relationships between objects in the image and constituent phrases in the sentence. Kulkarni et. al. , use conditional random field (CRF) to correspond to the objects, attributes, and prepositions in the image and try to learn the most appropriate label. Template based methods have to be hand-designed and have rigid templates. This limits the number of possible sentences that can be generated thereby leading to poor performance. Also generating sentences with variable-length is very difficult with this approach. Retrieval-based approaches fall into the second category. These methods approach image captioning as a retrieval task where they retrieve images with similar captions and then modify and combine the captions to produce new captions. A distance metric is used to find images that have similar captions, such as the method proposed in Kuznetsova et. al. . In addition, these approaches also have an intermediate “generalization” step to fine-tune the caption by discarding the information within the caption that was a carryover from the retrieved images and is not relevant to the image for which the caption is being generated, such as the name of a landmark or a type of food. Recently, Deep Neural Network based approaches have been adopted which have provided state of the art results over the last few years. These are mostly due to success of CNNs in object recognition task, as in Krizhevsky et. al. , and the success of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) on the sequence to sequence tasks, particularly with the advent of machine translation with RNNs as in Sutskever et. al. [ref]15 and Bahdanau et. al.. Sutskever et. al.[ref]15 proposed the encoder-decoder format of machine translation using an RNN for encoding the text information into a context vector and another RNN which decoded the context vector and produces the caption recursively. Whereas Bahdanau et. al.  used attention mechanism to focus on certain regions of the input sentence so that decoder has more relevant information at a certain time-step. Both these models are the basis of work done in Image Captioning models proposed by Vinyals et. al. [ref]2 and Xu et. al. [ref]4, respectively. For Image Captioning, the pioneering work using the encoder-decoder framework was done by Kiros et. al.  who used Structure Content Neural Language Model (SC-NLM) as the decoder. Socher et. al.  proposed a Dependency Tree Recursive Neural Network (DT-RNN) which was used for embedding the sentence into a vector space which is then used to retrieve images. Mao et. al.  proposed the Multimodal Recurrent Neural Network (m-RNN) where the word embeddings and image feature representations are mapped into the same vector space and merged before being used as input to an RNN which then decodes the sentence one step at a time. Vinyals et. al. [ref]2 proposed a system in which word embeddings are mapped into the same space as the hidden representations of the LSTM and used as the initial hidden and cell states of the LSTM. In subsequent steps the input is provided in the form of embedding vectors of the previously generated words and the next word in the sequence is generated. Subsequently, Xu et. al. [ref]4 used attention mechanism to focus on the salient regions of the image. In You et. al., semantic attention model is used where top-down and bottom-up approaches are combined for generating captions with Recurrent Neural Networks. While using the bottom-up approach, semantic concepts are used as attributes whereas in the top-down approach, the authors employ visual features with attention mechanism to guide the RNN. More recently, following the work of Gehring et. al.  for generating sequences with Convolutional Neural Networks, Aneja et. al.  have proposed using two Convolutional Neural Networks where the first network encodes the image information and the next one acts as a decoder to generate the caption sentence.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: in Krizhevsky et. al. , and the success of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) on the sequence to sequence tasks, particularly with the advent of machine translation with RNNs as in Sutskever et. al.
