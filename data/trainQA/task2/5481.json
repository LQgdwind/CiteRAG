      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Artistic Style Transfer with Conditional Adversarial Networks1footnote 11footnote 1\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA neural style transfer paper [ref]1 by Leon et al. first introduced the concept of neural style transformation under image synthesis in the deep learning based computer vision field in 2015. Since then, it has been prevalent in research because of its mainstream appeal. In , the authors have introduced an extension to the [ref]1 to make the image synthesis process more efficient and faster in the NST process. Also, the  color histogram matching algorithm has been used on top of [ref]1 model architecture to preserve the original light condition in the input image. In  [ref]10  they have used semi-supervised learning (GAN) to achieve more controllability in the style transferring process, produce clear and detailed images, and disentangled feature  from both content and style feature spaces. However, as shown in the 1, most research studies in NST have been conducted under the concept of a model per style. Use of GAN   in image synthesis, image super-resolution, image editing, and representation learning is very popular. Google pix-to-pix translation  paper has introduced a U-net based image to image translation model that was trained with GAN. It showed impressive performance in semantic segmentation, semantic labeling, map translation [aerial photo into graphics], edge and boundary detection, and in image-to-image translation tasks such as thermal to color translation. However, the pix-to-pix model could only have a single input. This restricted the use of the pix-to-pix model for the style transfer model. Additionally, the model requires to be fed with original and translated images as a pair.\nHowever, it is not practical to generate transferred images beforehand like in other image synthesis areas in style transfer. For example, we can manually annotate and pair images in semantic segmentation. Jun-Yan Zhu et al. [ref]8, has introduced a consistent and well defined method for bijective validation of image translation between two pixel spaces. In [ref]8, they have introduced image translation between two domains with unpaired initial distributions. In design, the CycleGAN model takes a single image input, making CycleGAN unsuitable for direct use in style transferring. In 2019, StyleGAN model  paper has introduced an effective model to combine features from two different input images and generate a new image with features of input images. Since that paper targeted synthesizing human faces, both images fed into the model were human images. Therefore, they have proposed only a single encoder model (Mapping Network)  for feature extraction. Furthermore, since features in human faces were explicitly localized and acceptable network architecture for global features like texture extraction differ from the Mapping Network architecture. The Wavelet Convolutional neural network model  has been proposed to classify images based on texture features in wavelet representation. The input image was first operated on a multi-resolution image decomposition method called spectral analysis. However, since the wavelet transformation maps pixels into a spectral space, it cannot be used for the generator’s style/texture encoding model In  . They have empirically proven that convolutional models with residual connections can be used for texture classification tasks. In  they have claimed that pre-trained CNN models on ImageNet  dataset have the potential to recognize texture features as well as the shapes such as clothes in complex images. As a part of the style transfer process, we have to extract style/texture from the style image. The style feature of an artwork is represented by different factors such as the medium used to paint, the surface, and the artist’s personality. The paper published by Yang Lia et al.  introduced the GAN-based method to control the style ingrained on the aspect of the continuous flow of color gradient to incorporate with brush stroke patterns in artworks.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: A neural style transfer paper [ref]1 by Leon et al. first introduced the concept of neural style transformation under image synthesis in the deep learning based computer vision field in 2015.
