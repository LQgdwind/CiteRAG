      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Policy Iteration for Robust Markov Decision Processes via Regularization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn accordance with [ref]8, we define (𝚜𝚊)𝚜𝚊(\\mathtt{sa})-rectangular Lpsubscript𝐿𝑝L_{p} constrained uncertainty set as and αs,a,βs,a∈ℝsubscript𝛼𝑠𝑎subscript𝛽𝑠𝑎ℝ\\alpha_{s,a},\\beta_{s,a}\\in\\mathbb{R} are reward noise radius and transition kernel noise radius respectively. These are chosen small enough so that all the transition kernels in (P0+𝒫)subscript𝑃0𝒫(P_{0}+\\mathcal{P}) are well defined. Since the sum of rows of valid transition kernel must be one, hence the sum of rows of noise kernel must be zero (condition A), which we ensured in the above definition of 𝒫s,a.subscript𝒫𝑠𝑎\\mathcal{P}_{s,a}. It makes our result differ from [ref]8, as they did not impose this condition (condition A) on their kernel noise. This renders their setting unrealistic (see corollary 4.1 in [ref]8) as not all transition kernels in their uncertainty set, satisfy the properties of transition kernels. And we see next and later, this condition on the noise makes reward regularizer dependent on the κq​(v)subscript𝜅𝑞𝑣\\kappa_{q}(v) ( q𝑞q-variance of value function) in our result instead of ∥v∥qsubscriptdelimited-∥∥𝑣𝑞\\lVert v\\rVert_{q} (q𝑞qth norm of value function v𝑣v) in [ref]8. Now, we focus on the cases where P0​(s′|s,a)=0subscript𝑃0conditionalsuperscript𝑠′𝑠𝑎0P_{0}(s^{\\prime}|s,a)=0, that is, forbidden transitions. In most practical situations, for a given state, many transitions are impossible. For example, consider a grid world example where only a single-step jump (left, right, up, down) is allowed, so in this case, the probability of making a multi-step jump is impossible. Formally, let ℱssubscriptℱ𝑠\\mathcal{F}_{s} be the set of forbidden states in state s𝑠s, and nominal kernel P0subscript𝑃0P_{0} and all noise kernel in 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} must satisfy As it makes no sense, upon adding noise to the kernel, the system starts making impossible transitions. These constrained can be naturally incorporated without much change in theory below, hence we discuss it in appendix 10. This is also one of our novel contribution.\n (𝚂𝚊)𝚂𝚊(\\mathtt{Sa})-rectangular Lpsubscript𝐿𝑝L_{p} robust Bellman operator is equivalent to reward regularized (non-robust) Bellman operator. That is, we have The proof mainly consists of two parts: a) Separating the noise from nominal values, along the lines of [ref]8. b) The reward noise to yields the term −αs,asubscript𝛼𝑠𝑎-\\alpha_{s,a} and noise in kernel yields −γ​βs,a​κq​(v)𝛾subscript𝛽𝑠𝑎subscript𝜅𝑞𝑣-\\gamma\\beta_{s,a}\\kappa_{q}(v).\n∎ The above result states that robust value iteration (both policy evaluation and improvement ) can be done as easily as non-robust value iteration with reward penalty. Notably, the reward penalty is not only proportional to the uncertainty radiuses but also to the κp​(v)subscript𝜅𝑝𝑣\\kappa_{p}(v) that measures the variance in value function. We retrieve non-robust value iteration by putting uncertainty radiuses (i.e. αs,a,βs,asubscript𝛼𝑠𝑎subscript𝛽𝑠𝑎\\alpha_{s,a},\\beta_{s,a}) to zero, in the above results. Furthermore, the same is true for all subsequent robust results in this paper. The above result implies the Q-learning of the following form where vn​(s)=maxa⁡Qn​(s,a)subscript𝑣𝑛𝑠subscript𝑎subscript𝑄𝑛𝑠𝑎v_{n}(s)=\\max_{a}Q_{n}(s,a), which is further discussed in appendix 12. Observe that p𝑝p-variance κp​(v)subscript𝜅𝑝𝑣\\kappa_{p}(v) can be estimated online, using batches or other more sophisticated methods. This paves the path for generalizing to a model-free setting similar to [ref]28, and policy gradient methods as obtained in .\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: In accordance with [ref]8, we define (𝚜𝚊)𝚜𝚊(\\mathtt{sa})-rectangular Lpsubscript𝐿𝑝L_{p} constrained uncertainty set as and αs,a,βs,a∈ℝsubscript𝛼𝑠𝑎subscript𝛽𝑠𝑎ℝ\\alpha_{s,a},\\beta_{s,a}\\in\\mathbb{R} are reward noise\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
