      "content": "Paper Title: Fair Classification via Unconstrained Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe literature on fairness has been growing quite rapidly. This includes methods for quantifying bias using economics and social welfare theory, developing impossibility results, and proposing algorithms in both the supervised and unsupervised learning setting. In general, algorithms for fair machine learning can be broadly classified into three groups: (1) pre-processing methods, (2) in-processing methods, and (3) post-processing methods . We briefly survey them in this section. Preprocessing: The goal of preprocessing algorithms is to transform the data D={(xi,yi)}i=1,‚Ä¶,Nùê∑subscriptsubscriptxùëñsubscriptyùëñùëñ1‚Ä¶ùëÅD=\\{(\\textbf{x}_{i},\\textbf{y}_{i})\\}_{i=1,\\ldots,N} into a different representation D~~ùê∑\\tilde{D} such that any classifier trained on D~~ùê∑\\tilde{D} in will not exhibit bias. This includes methods for learning a fair representation    [ref]22   or label manipulation . In some cases, such as text classification, a similar objective can be achieved by augmenting the training set with additional examples from other sources to mitigate the unintended bias of the classifier . Recently,  showed that unintended bias could occur even when using the Bayes optimal classifier and the target label was independent of the sensitive class. The intuition behind this result is that even if the target y is independent of the sensitive class, it can be conditionally dependent on it given x. They further showed that disentangled representation could mitigate this effect. In-Processing: In-processing methods constrain the behavior of learning algorithms in order to control bias. This includes methods based on adversarial learning , which adjust the gradient updates, and constraint-based classification, such as by incorporating constrains on the decision margin of the classifiers  or on the choice of features . Importantly,  showed that the problem of learning an unbiased classifier could be modeled as a cost-sensitive classification problem, which, in turn, could be applied to any black-box classifier. One caveat of the latter approach is that it required solving a linear program (LP) and training classifiers several times until convergence. Post-Processing: The algorithm we propose in this paper is a post-processing method. The analysis of  provides one theoretical justification for our approach by showing that the optimal decision rule that the maximizes social utility subject to fairness constraints is a group-dependent thresholding rule on the Bayes regressor. In [ref]9, a method is proposed for postprocessing the output of a classifier using linear programming (LP) to satisfy equalized odds or equality of opportunity. Definitions of Bias: As mentioned earlier, many definitions of bias or fairness have been proposed in the literature. On one hand, there is group fairness, such as statistical parity [ref]7 , equalized odds , and equality of opportunity/disparate mistreatment  [ref]9. On the other hand, there is individual fairness, which postulates that similar individuals need to be treated similarly [ref]7. Unfortunately, individual fairness, while appealing, transfers the burden of defining fairness from having an appropriate statistical criteria to defining a socially acceptable measure of distance/similarity between individuals. Societal Impact: Often, the central motivation behind controlling unintended bias is that it will improve the welfare of the protected group. The work of  challenges this view by illustrating how controlling bias in the learning algorithm could actually harm the protected group over the long term. The intuition behind this result is that misclassification can inflict harm on the protected class, such as by negatively impacting their credit history. Along related lines,  addresses the question of how to quantify bias in the first place. They show that classical measures of inequality in economics and social welfare were motivated by axioms that remain valid for measuring bias and, hence, can be adopted for this particular purpose. In our case, we assume that fairness constraints are fixed (e.g. by Law) and do not discuss whether or not such constraints are justifiable. Impossibility Results: Recent works have established several impossibility results related to fair classification. For example,   showed that statistical parity and equalized odds may not be achieved simultaneously under certain settings. Also,  showed that equalized odds might even be in conflict with probability calibration of the classifier. In our case, we derive a new impossibility result that holds for any deterministic binary classifier and any sensitive attribute except under degenerate conditions, which quantifies the tradeoff between accuracy and fairness. We use this impossibility result to motivate the development of the main algorithm in Section 4. Other Settings: Bias can be defined in other learning settings besides classification. For instance,  presents a method for incorporating fair constraints into kernel regression methods. Also,     present algorithms for unbiased clustering, including kùëòk-means and spectral methods. Moreover, unbiased methods have been proposed for dimensionality reduction  and online learning , among others. In our case, we focus on the binary classification setting.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: into a different representation D~~ùê∑\\tilde{D} such that any classifier trained on D~~ùê∑\\tilde{D} in will not exhibit bias.
