      "content": "Paper Title: Going Beyond Linear Mode Connectivity: The Layerwise Linear Feature Connectivity\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n(Linear) Mode Connectivity.\nFreeman and Bruna 0, Draxler et al. [ref]5, Garipov et al.  observed Mode Connectivity, i.e., different optima/modes of the loss function can be connected through a non-linear path with nearly constant loss.\nNagarajan and Kolter  first observed Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC), i.e., the near-constant-loss connecting path can be linear, on models trained on MNIST starting from the same random initialization.\nLater, Frankle et al. [ref]9 first formally defined and thoroughly investigate the LMC problem. Frankle et al. [ref]9 observed LMC on harder datasets, for networks that are jointly trained for a short amount of time before going through independent training (we refer to this as the spawning method). Frankle et al. [ref]9 also demonstrated a connection between LMC and the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis .\nFort et al.  used the spawning method to explore the connection between LMC and the Neural Tangent Kernel dynamics.\nLubana et al.  studied the mechanisms of DNNs from mode connectivity and verified the mechanistically dissimilar models cannot be linearly connected.\nYunis et al.  showed that LMC also extends beyond two optima and identified a high-dimensional convex hull of low loss between multiple optima.\nOn the theory side, several papers 0      were able to prove non-linear mode connectivity under various settings, but there has not been a theoretical explanation of LMC to our knowledge. Permutation Invariance. Neural network architectures contain permutation symmetries : one can permute the weights in different layers while not changing the function computed by the network. Ashmore and Gashler  utilized the permutation invariance of DNNs to align the topological structure of two neural networks. Tatro et al.  used permutation invariance to align the neurons of two neural networks, resulting in improved non-linear mode connectivity.\nIn the context of LMC, Entezari et al. , Ainsworth et al.  showed that even independently trained networks can be linearly connected when permutation invariance is taken into account. In particular, Ainsworth et al.  approached the neuron alignment problem by formulating it as bipartite graph matching and proposed two matching methods: activation matching and weight matching. Notably, Ainsworth et al.  achieved the LMC between independently trained ResNet models on the CIFAR-10 dataset using weight matching. Model Averaging Methods. LMC also has direct implications for model averaging methods, which are further related to federated learning and ensemble methods. Wang et al.  introduced a novel federated learning algorithm that incorporates unit permutation before model averaging. Singh and Jaggi , Liu et al. 2 approached the neuron alignment problem in model averaging by formulating it as an optimal transport and graph matching problem, respectively.\nWortsman et al.  averaged the weights of multiple fine-tuned models trained with different hyper-parameters and obtained improved performance.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: (Linear) Mode Connectivity.\nFreeman and Bruna 0, Draxler et al.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
