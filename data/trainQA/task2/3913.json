      "content": "Paper Title: Incorporating Prior Knowledge into Neural Networks through an Implicit Composite Kernel\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe equivalence between GPs and randomly initialized single-layer NNs with infinite width was first shown by Neal [ref]39. With the development of modern deep learning, researchers further extended this relationship to deep networks   and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) . This relationship is crucial for showing the resemblance between GPR and our ICK framework, which is discussed in Section 4.1. As mentioned before, one approach to equip NNs with prior knowledge is to modify the loss function. For example, Lagaris et al. [ref]28 solved differential equations (DEs) using NNs by setting the loss to be a function whose derivative satisfies the DE conditions. Another approach is to build integrated models of NNs and kernel-based models. For example, Wilson et al.  implemented a regression network with GP priors over latent variables and made inference by approximating the posterior using Variational Bayes or sampling from the posterior using Gibbs sampling scheme. Garnelo et al. [ref]13 introduced a class of neural latent variable models called Neural Processes (NPs) which are capable of learning efficiently from the data and adapting rapidly to new observations.\nOur ICK framework fuses prior knowledge into NNs by modulating the learnt features using another set of features outputted from a kernel-based mapping, which can also be viewed as an integrated model of NNs and kernel machines. Composite kernel GPs are widely used in both machine learning   and geostatistical modeling  . GPR in geostatistical modeling is also known as kriging  , which serves as a surrogate model to replace expensive function evaluations. The inputs for a composite GP are usually low-dimensional (e.g. spatial distance) as GPs do not scale well with the number of samples for high-dimensional inputs  . To overcome this issue, Pearce et al. 1 and Matsubara et al.  developed BNN analogues for composite GPs. Similar to these studies, our ICK framework can also be viewed as a simulation for composite GPs. For large data sets, approximation methods are needed as exact kernel learning and inference scales ùí™‚Äã(N3)ùí™superscriptùëÅ3\\mathcal{O}(N^{3}). Nystr√∂m low-rank matrix approximation  1 and Random Fourier Features 3 4 are two commonly used methods. A common technique is to choose inducing points as pseudo-inputs to efficiently approximate the full kernel matrix 6 . Our work is inspired by these approximation techniques and we use them as transformation functions to map the kernel matrix into latent space representations in Section 4.2.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: The equivalence between GPs and randomly initialized single-layer NNs with infinite width was first shown by Neal [ref]39.
