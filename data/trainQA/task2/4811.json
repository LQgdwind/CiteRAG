      "content": "Paper Title: Leveraging the Video-level Semantic Consistency of Event for Audio-visual Event Localization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAudio-visual Representation Learning: In recent years, many works have explored audio-visual representation learning, which can be divided into two main tasks. Some      [ref]21 are dedicated to better video understanding at the video level through the utilization of both visual and auditory information. Zellers et al. [ref]21 constructed a large multimodal pretraining model using masking operations for modal alignment to characterize video information. Many other works have focused on predicting whether video frames and audio are temporally aligned and the fusion of video and audio information at the segment level. Hu et al.  proposed a deep multimodal clustering (DMC) network to perform elaborate correspondence learning among audio and visual components. Existing methods often prioritize visual content for classification, overlooking the significance of auditory information. To learn discriminative features for a classifier, it is essential to judge whether the audio and visual signals depict the same event. Some recent methods attempt to evaluate the correspondences by measuring the audio-visual similarity   [ref]23   while ignoring that as an information carrier, each video, especially for short videos, always has a specific theme, i.e., the video-level event semantics. Sounding Object Localization: Sounding object localization aims to localize visual regions that are relevant to the given sound. By digging into the correspondence between deep audio and visual features, recent methods have provided promising solutions to this problem [ref]23      . Afouras et al.  utilized a contrastive loss to train the model in a self-supervised learning way. Qian et al.  achieved the same goal by using the class activation map (CAM) derived from a weakly-supervised approach. Song et al. , inspired by 3D object detection under self-supervision, proposed a contrastive learning strategy based on data augmentation after matching only positive sample pairs to achieve localization of sounding objects in the visual region with self-supervised learning. Most AVE localization methods draw on the sounding object localization task of visually localizing vocal objects to facilitate the recognition of events. In this paper, we utilized the semantic consistency of events to guide the learning of visual and audio modalities, which can ensure that the model better focuses and localizes sounding objects. Audio-visual Event Localization: With the development of joint audio-visual learning, the AVE localization task was formally proposed by Tian et al.  with the first public dataset AVE. They proposed an audio-guided visual attention module (AGVA) and a dual multimodal residual network to fuse information over two modalities. Xu et al. [ref]4 proposed an audio-guided spatial-channel attention (CMRA) module that can guide the model to focus on event-relevant visual regions. Zhou et al.  proposed a positive sample propagation (PSP) module that constructs an all-pair similarity map between each audio and visual segment and removes the entries that are below a preset similarity threshold. Similar to , Fan et al.  proposed a consistent segment selection approach to enhance segment-level semantic consistency across modalities. However, they ignored the event semantic consistency within modalities. Xia et al.  proposed a background suppression scheme based on CMRA [ref]4, whose network is more complex than the others. Similar to [ref]4 , Liu et al.  improves the temporal-spatial-channel attention module and further establishes the cross-modal dense relationship. Recently, Geng et al. 4 introduced a new dense AVE localization task, making a valuable contribution to the field. Nonetheless, it fundamentally differs from AVE localization and is, therefore, beyond the scope of this paper. Although the above works achieve superior performance on the AVE localization task, they ignore the holistic and continuous occurrence of events in the natural environment.\nWhile impressive works 5 6 7 excel in the video temporal grounding (VTG) task by leveraging segment-level features to improve unimodal video frame localization, it is important to note that VTG uses explicit textual semantic information. In contrast, AVE localization relies on hidden semantics within multimedia content with audio-visual disparities and involves processing heterogeneous features from two modalities.\nUnlike those works, we propose a video-level semantic consistency guidance network by further exploring the semantic consistency of AVEs at the video level specifically tailored for audio-visual event localization.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: Audio-visual Representation Learning: In recent years, many works have explored audio-visual representation learning, which can be divided into two main tasks.
