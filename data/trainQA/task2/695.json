      "content": "Paper Title: Blind Face Restoration via Deep Multi-scale Component Dictionaries\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlong with the benefits brought by deep CNNs, single image restoration has achieved great success in many tasks, e.g., image super-resolution     , denoising    , deblurring   , and compression artifact removal   . Due to the specific facial structure, there are also several well-developed methods for face hallucination  [ref]2     [ref]40  [ref]4. Among these methods, Huang et al.  suggest to ultra-resolve a very low resolution face image by using the neural networks to predict the wavelet coefficients of HQ images. Cao et al. [ref]2 propose reinforcement learning to discover the attended regions and then enhance them with a learnable local network. To better recover the structure details, there are also some methods that incorporate the image prior knowledge in the restoring process. Wang et al.  propose to use semantic segmentation probability maps as class prior to recover class-aware textures on natural image super-resolution task. It firstly takes the LR images through a segmentation network to generate the class probability maps. And then these maps and LQ features are fused together by spatial feature transformation. As for face images, Shen et al.  propose to learn a global semantic face prior as input to impose local structure on the output. Similarly, Xu et al.  use a multi-tasks model to predict the facial components heatmaps and use them for incorporating structure information. Chen et al. [ref]4 learn the facial geometry prior (i.e., landmarks heatmaps and parsing maps) and take them to recover the high-resolution results. Yu et al. [ref]40 develop a facial attribute-embedded network by incorporating face attributes vector in the LR feature space. Kim et al.  adopt a progressive manner to generate the successive higher resolution output and propose a facial attention loss on landmarks to constrain the structure of reconstruction. However, most of these facial prior knowledge mainly focus on geometry constrains (i.e., landmarks or heatmaps), which may not bring direct facial details for the restoration of LQ image. Thus, most of these single image restoration methods failed to generate plausible and realistic details on real LQ face images because of the ill-posed problem and the limitation of a single image or facial structure prior brought to the learning process of networks.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: super-resolution     , denoising    , deblurring   , and compression artifact removal   .
