In the real-life deployments of person ReID, task IDs are unavailable both in the training and inference stages.\nFedWeIT [ref]30 requires task IDs for training and inference, and we assume that task IDs are given for FedWeIT [ref]30 to obtain its performance.\nMoreover, we validate FedWeIT [ref]30 under different settings to balance its accuracy and communication cost. FedWeIT (a) is set with l1=1.0√ó10‚àí4subscriptùëô11.0superscript104l_{1}=1.0\\times 10^{-4}, l2=1.0√ó10‚àí6subscriptùëô21.0superscript106l_{2}=1.0\\times 10^{-6}. FedWeIT (b) is set with l1=5.0√ó10‚àí6subscriptùëô15.0superscript106l_{1}=5.0\\times 10^{-6}, l2=1.0√ó10‚àí3subscriptùëô21.0superscript103l_{2}=1.0\\times 10^{-3}. Table II illustrates the performance comparison of different methods.\nOur FedSTIL can outperform other baseline methods in accuracy and communication cost.\nThe most competitive baseline method, FedWeIT [ref]30, is about 4% lower than our method on mAP, and the S2C communication cost is 2.89 times higher compared with our method.\nThe higher accuracy and lower communication cost make our method more applicable in real-world person ReID scenarios.\nThe detailed analysis for each performance metric are as follows.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: size + memory size), server-to-client (S2C) and client-to-server (C2S) communication cost of our method with the following baseline methods. 1) Single task learning (STL); 2) Lifelong learning: EWC [ref]32, MAS [ref]33, iCaRL ; 3) Federated learning: FedAvg , FedProx ; 4) Federated lifelong learning: FedCurv , FedWeIT [ref]30.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
