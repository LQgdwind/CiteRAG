      "content": "Paper Title: Strong Algebras and Radical Sylvester-Gallai Configurations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGiven an algebraic circuit, the Polynomial Identity Testing (PIT) problem asks to determine whether the circuit computes the identically zero polynomial.\nEven though there are efficient randomized algorithms for PIT  , devising an efficient deterministic algorithm for this problem is one of the main challenges in theoretical computer science.\nThe PIT problem is also intimately connected to other fundamental questions such as lower bounds for arithmetic circuits     6  and derandomization problems 5    4.\nWe refer the reader to the excellent surveys [ref]52   for more on the PIT problem and its applications.\nThe results of [ref]6 0 show that in order to solve the PIT problem in general, it is enough to solve the problem for low depth circuits such as unrestricted depth-333 circuits or homogeneous depth-444 circuits.\nTherefore, these classes have received considerable attention in recent years.\nIn particular, we have seen significant progress towards PIT for depth-333 circuits via rank bounds for linear SG-configurations   . Sylvester-Gallai configurations are intrinsic to the PIT problem as demonstrated by the following example.\nSuppose a polynomial P∈ℂ​[x1,⋯,xN]𝑃ℂsubscript𝑥1⋯subscript𝑥𝑁P\\in\\mathbb{C}[x_{1},\\cdots,x_{N}] has the expression P=a1​⋯​ad+b1​⋯​bd+c1​⋯​cd𝑃subscript𝑎1⋯subscript𝑎𝑑subscript𝑏1⋯subscript𝑏𝑑subscript𝑐1⋯subscript𝑐𝑑P=a_{1}\\cdots a_{d}+b_{1}\\cdots b_{d}+c_{1}\\cdots c_{d} where ai,bj,cksubscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑏𝑗subscript𝑐𝑘a_{i},b_{j},c_{k} are pairwise non-associate linear forms (in particular, P𝑃P is represented by a depth-333 circuit of the form Σ​Π[d]​ΣsuperscriptΣdelimited-[]3superscriptΠdelimited-[]𝑑Σ\\Sigma^{}\\Pi^{[d]}\\Sigma).\nIf P≡0𝑃0P\\equiv 0, then whenever ai,bjsubscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑏𝑗a_{i},b_{j} vanish there exists a cksubscript𝑐𝑘c_{k} which also vanishes, in particular ck∈rad​(ai,bj)=(ai,bj)subscript𝑐𝑘radsubscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑏𝑗subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑏𝑗c_{k}\\in\\mathrm{rad}(a_{i},b_{j})=(a_{i},b_{j}).\nHence, the sets R={a1,⋯,ad}𝑅subscript𝑎1⋯subscript𝑎𝑑R=\\{a_{1},\\cdots,a_{d}\\}, B={b1,⋯,bd}𝐵subscript𝑏1⋯subscript𝑏𝑑B=\\{b_{1},\\cdots,b_{d}\\}, G={c1,⋯,cd}𝐺subscript𝑐1⋯subscript𝑐𝑑G=\\{c_{1},\\cdots,c_{d}\\} form a colored Sylvester-Gallai configuration and by the Edelstein-Kelly theorem , we have dim​(span𝕂​(R∪B∪G))≤3dimsubscriptspan𝕂𝑅𝐵𝐺3\\mathrm{dim}(\\mathrm{span}_{\\mathbb{K}}(R\\cup B\\cup G))\\leq 3.\nTherefore, if P≡0𝑃0P\\equiv 0, then we may assume that all the linear forms ai,bj,cksubscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑏𝑗subscript𝑐𝑘a_{i},b_{j},c_{k} depend on three variables after a change of coordinates and reduce the problem to ℂ​[x,y,z]ℂ𝑥𝑦𝑧{\\mathbb{C}}[x,y,z].\nThus the rank bounds in linear SG theorems imply that the constituent linear polynomials of the circuit depend on few variables, and more sophisticated applications of this idea yielded the PIT algorithms for special depth-333 circuits.\nHowever, we are still far from obtaining polynomial time deterministic PIT algorithms for unrestricted depth-333 circuits. For depth-444 circuits, the Sylvester-Gallai configurations appearing in a polynomial identity are no longer linear, due to the presence of higher degree polynomials.\nHence the case of depth-444 circuits is even more challenging.\nIn  5, it was conjectured that such non-linear SG-configurations should also depend on few variables or have low algebraic rank.\nIn particular, Gupta 5 proposed far-reaching non-linear generalizations of the known Sylvester-Gallai type problems and showed that if the posed conjectures are true, then we will have a deterministic polynomial-time black-box PIT algorithm for the model of depth 4 algebraic circuits with constant top and bottom fan-in.\nSuch a circuit is denoted by Σk​Π​Σ​ΠdsuperscriptΣ𝑘ΠΣsuperscriptΠ𝑑\\Sigma^{k}\\Pi\\Sigma\\Pi^{d} (where d,k𝑑𝑘d,k should be thought of as constants) and it computes a polynomial P𝑃P of the form where deg⁡(Qi​j)≤ddegreesubscript𝑄𝑖𝑗𝑑\\deg(Q_{ij})\\leq d for each i,j𝑖𝑗i,j. Gupta conjectured that the non-linear Sylvester-Gallai configuration of polynomials appearing in a depth-444 polynomial identity must also be depend on few variables.\nMore precisely, if a polynomial P𝑃P, evaluated by a depth-444 circuit111One needs to assume that the circuit is simple and minimal. For the precise definitions, we refer the reader to  5. as above, is identically 00, then the transcendence degree of the set {Qi,j}subscript𝑄𝑖𝑗\\{Q_{i,j}\\} is conjectured to be bounded by a function depending only on k𝑘k and d𝑑d. The first challenge in Gupta’s series of conjectures is the following non-linear version of the linear Sylvester-Gallai problem, [35, Conjecture 2]: There is a function λ:ℕ→ℕ:𝜆→ℕℕ\\lambda:{\\mathbb{N}}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{N}} such that the transcendence degree of any d​-radical-SG𝑑-radical-SG{d}\\textnormal{-radical-SG} configuration ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}, is upper bounded by λ​(d)𝜆𝑑\\lambda(d). Since the transcendence degree of ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} is upper bounded by the dimension of the 𝕂𝕂{\\mathbb{K}}-linear span of ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}, the following stronger version of the conjecture has been considered. There is a function λ:ℕ→ℕ:𝜆→ℕℕ\\lambda:{\\mathbb{N}}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{N}} such that for any d​-radical-SG𝑑-radical-SG{d}\\textnormal{-radical-SG} configuration ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}, we have dim(span𝕂​{ℱ})≤λ​(d)dimensionsubscriptspan𝕂ℱ𝜆𝑑\\dim(\\textnormal{span}_{\\mathbb{K}}\\left\\{\\mathcal{F}\\right\\})\\leq\\lambda(d). In other words, for any d​-radical-SG𝑑-radical-SG{d}\\textnormal{-radical-SG} configuration ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}, we must have that dim(span𝕂​{ℱ})dimensionsubscriptspan𝕂ℱ\\dim(\\textnormal{span}_{\\mathbb{K}}\\left\\{\\mathcal{F}\\right\\}) is upper bounded by a function independent of the polynomial ring 𝕂​[x1,⋯,xN]𝕂subscript𝑥1⋯subscript𝑥𝑁{\\mathbb{K}}[x_{1},\\cdots,x_{N}] and the cardinality |ℱ|ℱ|\\mathcal{F}|. In , Shpilka broke ground on 1.5, solving it for d=2𝑑2d=2.\nAfter that,  solved 1.5 for d=3𝑑3d=3. In this work, we positively settle 1.5 for any value of d𝑑d, which in turn positively resolves 1.4.\nIn this work, our Theorem 1.2 completely settles this question in the affirmative. In this paper, we restrict to the case of characteristic 00, since the conjecture is false in characteristic p>0𝑝0p>0.\nIn fact, even the linear Sylvester-Gallai theorem is not true over 𝔽psubscript𝔽𝑝{\\mathbb{F}}_{p}, as one may take the finite set of linear forms to be all the linear forms in 𝔽p​[x1,⋯,xN]subscript𝔽𝑝subscript𝑥1⋯subscript𝑥𝑁{\\mathbb{F}}_{p}[x_{1},\\cdots,x_{N}].\nOur Theorem 1.2 is a consequence of our main technical theorem which holds in the more general setting of reducible forms in strong quotients of polynomial rings.\nIn the following subsection we will describe our main technical theorem and the key ideas behind the proof.\n\nReference markers found: [52]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]52: is also intimately connected to other fundamental questions such as lower bounds for arithmetic circuits     6  and derandomization problems 5    4.\nWe refer the reader to the excellent surveys [ref]52   for more on the PIT problem and its applications.\nThe results of [ref]6 0 show that in order to solve the PIT problem in general, it is enough to solve the problem for low depth circuits\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
