      "content": "Paper Title: G3SR: Global Graph Guided Session-based Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the population of the Internet and rich internet services, recommender systems have become a widely used fundamental technique . On the one hand, recommender systems help users alleviate information overload problems by finding the information they need rapidly and accurately, which significantly improves the user experience. On the other hand, high quality recommendation can lead to more desirable services and therefore facilitate greater retention of users. Traditional recommender systems provide personalized recommendations based on users’ historical behaviors [ref]2  . However, users’ identities may be unknown in some scenarios, i.e., unregistered users may want to experience the provided services to decide whether or not to use it, while some users may refuse to log in for privacy concerns. In such situations, it is still important to provide accurate recommendations, but the system can only observe the current session instead of adequate historical user-item interactions. This is the so-called session-based recommendation that has drawn an increasing amount of attention in the field of recommender systems in recent years. Early efforts have been made in studying sequential recommendation problems such as next-basket prediction with Markov chains methods    . However, these methods are based on complete historical user data and have a strong independence assumption that the user’s next behavior only relies on the current one, which significantly limits the performance. In 2015, Hidasi et al. first propose the session-based recommendation problem and devise a method called GRU4Rec  based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to solve it. Since then, RNNs have become a popular choice for solving session-based recommendation and offer remarkable results. For example, Li et al. propose the Neural Attentive Recommendation Machine (NARM) 0, a model that tries to capture sequential behavioral features as well as users’ main purposes by using a two-way RNN model architecture. Short-term Attention/Memory Priority Model (STAMP) 1 replaces RNNs with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) enhanced by the attention mechanism, which achieves impressive results. More recently, Wu et al. propose SR-GNN 2 which is able to capture higher-order item transitions by introducing Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Despite their promising results, all the above methods and models are trained on session graphs which only model intra-session item-to-item relations, and fail to make full use of global information. Figure 1 shows a simple example of session graphs and the global graph built on the same session data. In this example, sessions are denoted as 𝐬(i)superscript𝐬𝑖\\mathbf{s}^{(i)} and items are denoted as vjsubscript𝑣𝑗v_{j}. Based on the given session sequences, three session graphs and one global graph are built, where an edge vi→vj→subscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝑣𝑗v_{i}\\rightarrow v_{j} is added to the graph if visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} and vjsubscript𝑣𝑗v_{j} are observed to occur consecutively. The existing methods try to capture information based on session graphs. Although session graphs can reflect part of the complex item-to-item transitions, the global information implied in the global graph can be very useful. For example, if the system is requested to recommend an item for session 𝐬(2)superscript𝐬2\\mathbf{s}^{(2)}, v2subscript𝑣2v_{2} is a reasonable choice since the user hasn’t viewed it yet and it often appears along with v1subscript𝑣1v_{1} and v3subscript𝑣3v_{3}. Explicit relations v1→v2→subscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2v_{1}\\rightarrow v_{2} and v3→v2→subscript𝑣3subscript𝑣2v_{3}\\rightarrow v_{2} can be observed directly in the global graph while the model can only learn implicit relations from data if it relies solely on session graphs. Since v2subscript𝑣2v_{2} has never appeared together with v4subscript𝑣4v_{4} and v5subscript𝑣5v_{5}, it may not be recommended in the latter case. Although intuitively, a model can implicitly learn global information with a sufficient amount of data, the extremely sparse nature of the recommendation scenario makes it difficult. In practice, the problem revealed by the above example is ubiquitous since short sessions dominate the data set. Instead of striving to learn global information from tens of thousands of short sessions, constructing a global graph to aggregate the information implied in the overall data is a promising solution. Still, learning directly from the global graph is highly challenging since it introduces additional relational information together with noises that are irrelevant to the current session and this can severely downgrade the performance as shown in 2. Besides, items in a session graph should contribute differently to the session representation since user’s interest drifts with time. Previous works 0 1 have revealed that not all items in the current session are relevant to the next click and the last few items are usually the most crucial ones. The majority of the existing methods adopt the attention mechanism to learn importance weights for different items in the current session. Although these methods have achieved fascinating results, the attention mechanism is purely data-driven and computationally expensive. We believe that incorporating human knowledge (“prior”) is at least equally important as learning from the data. In particular, an empirically effective prior for session-based recommendations is that the more recently clicked items are of higher significance. To tackle the above problems, we propose a novel method named Global Graph Guided Session-based Recommendation (G3SR). Inspired by the recent progress of pre-training3 4 5, we introduce an unsupervised pre-training process to learn global item-to-item relations. First, the global graph is constructed on all session data. Second, graph embedding techniques are applied to learn the global representation for each item. We then use a graph network to refine these item representations based on session graphs. Unlike previous works, we devise a parameter-free graph readout mechanism to obtain the final session representation. The main contributions of this paper are as follows. We introduce an unsupervised pre-training process to extract global item-to-item relational information. On the one hand, it provides richer semantic item representations for the downstream session-based recommendation task. On the other hand, it improves performance while reducing the amount of data required for the supervised training process. It offers a new perspective to solve the session-based recommendation problem. We propose a parameter-free readout mechanism which uses the exponential decaying strategy to aggregate item representations into a session representation. This mechanism is highly competitive with the attention mechanism that is widely used in previous works, which sheds light on potential problems in current mainstream attention-based methods and calls for improved scientific practices. Extensive experiments have been conducted on real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of G3SR. We also conduct abundant ablation studies and sensitivity analyses which provide practical insights into the nature of the session-based recommendation problem. Our experimental results also show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on cold items. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We first review some related literatures in Section II. Then we describe the proposed method in Section III. Experiment results and analysis are demonstrated in Section IV. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section V.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: can lead to more desirable services and therefore facilitate greater retention of users.
