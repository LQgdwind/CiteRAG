      "content": "Paper Title: Uncertainty Quantification via Stable Distribution Propagation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPredictive uncertainties in deep learning can be decomposed into different components:\nmodel and data uncertainty. Model uncertainties arise due to model limitations such as variability in neural network weights and biases.\nData uncertainties originate from incipient noise in the feature space that is propagated through the model as well as, separately, noise in the target space measurements.\nThe focus of our investigation lies on data uncertainties.\n\n\nWhile analyzing the effects of input space uncertainties on predictive uncertainty, prior authors have focused on analytic approaches that avoid sampling.\nSuch investigations address the approximate propagation of normal distributions at individual training samples through the network to model the network response\nto perturbed inputs [ref]28  [ref]20 [ref]18.\n[ref]28 propose Natural-Parameter networks, which allow using exponential-family distributions to model weights and neurons. Similarly,   use uncertainty propagation to sampling-free approximate dropout, and  extend moment matching for Bayesian neural networks.\nThese methods use (marginal) moment matching for propagating parametric probability distributions through neural networks, as we will subsequently discuss in greater detail.\nDeterministic Variational Inference Approximation (DVIA)  is an approximation to (full) moment matching of multi-variate Gaussian distributions for ReLU non-linearities.\n\n\nAs an alternative, some authors have also focused on the output space uncertainty estimation, using approaches that yield both a point prediction along with the predictive uncertainty.  utilize PNNs  where the network outputs both the predicted mean and variance, which they augment via adversarial training and ensembling. Contrastingly,  learn conditional quantiles for estimating data uncertainties.\nWe use several methods from this category as baselines in our example applications. Our proposed approach falls into the first category and is most similar to [ref]20 and [ref]18, but differs in how distributions are passed through non-linearities such as ReLUs.\nPrevious work relies on (marginal) moment matching , also known as assumed density filtering.\nMoment matching is a technique where the first two moments of a distribution, such as the output distribution of ReLU (i.e., the mean and variance) are computed and used as parameters for a Gaussian distribution to approximate the true distribution.\nAs it is otherwise usually intractable, moment matching techniques match the distribution to a marginal multivariate Gaussian (i.e., with a diagonal covariance matrix) at each layer.\nAccordingly, we refer to it as marginal moment matching.\nSDP propagates stable distributions by an approximation that minimizes the total variation (TV) distance for the ReLU activation function.\nWe find that this approximation is faster to compute, better with respect to TV and Wasserstein distances, and allows for efficient non-marginal propagation.\nFurther, as it does not rely on moment matching, it can also be used to propagate Cauchy distributions for which the moments are not finitely defined.\nAnother advantage of SDP is that it can be applied to pre-trained models.\nIn contrast, moment matching changes the mean, causing deviations from regular (point) propagation through the network, leading to poor predictions when applied to pre-trained networks.\n\n\nBeyond UQ, SDP was inspired by propagating distributions through logic gate networks , optimizers , simulators , and algorithms , e.g., for sorting , clustering , and rendering .\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: avoid sampling.\nSuch investigations address the approximate propagation of normal distributions at individual training samples through the network to model the network response\nto perturbed inputs [ref]28  [ref]20 [ref]18.\n[ref]28 propose Natural-Parameter networks, which allow using exponential-family distributions to model weights and neurons.
