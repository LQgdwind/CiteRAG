      "content": "Paper Title: ResizeMix: Mixing Data with Preserved Object Information and True Labels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe goal of cutting augmentations is to make a network pay attention to the entire data like the dropout regularization 7    . Random erasing  selects a patch of an image and masks it out. The width and height of the patch need to be designed manually. Beyond this, Cutout  proposes to mask a region with a fixed-size square. Another type of augmentation methods are based on mixing data. Mixup  attempts to produce an element-wise convex combination of two images. Augmix  mixes up the images augmented by operations sampled from the spaces like AutoAugment  defined ones. Rather than mixing the element-wise convex, RICAP  randomly gets four patches from different images and combines them to a new sample. CutMix [ref]51 randomly crops a patch from one image and pastes it into the corresponding position of another image, which significantly improves the test accuracy and exceeds most augmentation methods on various datasets. Recently, mixing-based augmentation methods are widely used to augment images because they do not require extra searching or training cost while bringing significant performance improvement of networks. For example, CutMix [ref]51 significantly improves the test accuracy and exceeds the most automatic augmentation methods  [ref]33 . However, the cropping and pasting method may cause label misallocation when the cropped patch is from the background of the image. Some studies further improve the performance of CutMix by reserving patches with more saliency information when cropping and pasting the patch between two images. PuzzleMix , which proposes to optimize the position of the mixing mask and the saliency discounted transportation. SuperMix  uses the knowledge of a teacher to mix images on their salient regions. Somewhat differently, FMix  sets a threshold for the low-frequency parts in the image to get the saliency masks for mixing images. SaliencyMix  uses a saliency detection module to select the saliency source patch for mixing. However, they all need extra cost to find the saliency regions. Compared to these methods, we propose a convenient and effective approach that can preserve the object information of images. Parallel with the success of neural architecture search      , automated augmentation methods start to develop rapidly. AutoAugment  attempts to search for better combinations of augmentation operations and their magnitudes. Due to its expensive search cost when implemented with reinforcement learning, PBA  with population evolution strategy and FastAA [ref]33 with matching density are proposed to speed up training without reducing the performance. The augmentation combinations can be treated as a hyper-parameter optimization formulation. OHL-AA  tries to optimize the probability distribution of augmentations, while Faster AA  and DADA  use the differentiable optimization directly to search the combinations and magnitudes of augmentations, which can save lots of searching cost. Integrated with adversarial training  1 0, AdvAA  makes networks learn more hard data samples, in which the domain of dataset becomes more widespread. Different from the search or optimization strategies, RandAugment  reaches identical performance only set up two parameters with the same augmentation spaces. Overall, most of the automated augmentation methods need extra search or training cost to obtain better performance, while our proposed ResizeMix can promote the network performance without any additional cost.\n\nReference markers found: [51]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]51: sampled from the spaces like AutoAugment  defined ones.
