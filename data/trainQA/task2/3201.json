      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Self-supervised Learning with Automated Unsupervised Outlier Arbitration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSelf-supervised learning.\nWithout access to any data annotations, self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches impose additional constraints or hypothesis among distinct views of the original input data  [ref]7    [ref]33    . Recently, mainstream approaches require that different views out of the same instance should be predicative of each others. Such line of research can be roughly classified into several sub-directions. The first family is inspired from the seminal NCE approach  and capitalizes on contrastive loss  [ref]7   4 [ref]33  . These approaches usually rely on the construction of both the positive and negative views of a single instance. In these work, positive samples usually are augmented views of the same reference instance; Negative samples are defined as any views from a distinct instance other than that reference instance. Contrastive loss is then expected to learn useful semantics when forced to distinguish between positive and negative views on each instance. The second line of research further simplify the contrastive assumption, which only imposes invariant constraints between paired positive samples     in the absence of the negative samples. Bias correction for contrastive learning. Existing literature prioritize the sampling bias issue for negative samples, while positive samples are usually considered clean. In , debiased contrastive learning corrects the sampling bias in the negative samples in order to reduce the effect of false negatives. In 4 , harder negatives are created for training in order to improve the learning. The work in  is the only work we are aware of, that touches the noise issue in positive pairs. But  is motivated exclusively for observed caption-frames misalignments issues in narrated videos, and the loss is tailored for applications that are based on contrastive loss only. In contrast, we reveal that OOD noise actually exists in a broader coverage of self-supervised learning frameworks and is influencing the downstream tasks with a non-negligible strength. OOD detection and noisy label problem. Outlier detection is an important problem in machine learning. A popular and intuitive framework for detecting OOD inputs is to train a generative model on training data and use that to detect OOD inputs at test time. For instance, in , a likelihood ratio method is proposed to correct for the background statistics between inliers and outliers. In the meanwhile, for supervised learning tasks, robust training in the presence of noisy labels is also a practical and challenging issue. In 0, a generalized cross entropy loss is used to mitigate the label noise issue. In 3, Mentor-net capitalizes on tailored network architecture to down-weight the samples likely to be associated with noisy labels. All of these work were targeting conventional supervised learning approaches, whereas the noise under the SSL framework is rarely explored. Comparison to existing works. We unveil that the intrinsic positive sample noises exist broadly behind various mainstream SSL frameworks. To both justify and to mitigate the issue, we propose a latent variable framework that is capable improving the SSL optimization via automatic Unsupervised OuTlier Arbitration (UOTA). We are also aware of a contemporary work in 1 that attempts to change the sampling distribution via assigning sample weights to each positive sample. But motivation in 1 is completely opposite to ours, as they oversample the region whenever a positive sample turns out to be remote to its query, while they still assume a perfect invariance on positive keys as critical supporting prerequisite. In 6, a Mahalanobis distance-based confidence score is defined to modify sampling distribution for supervised learning tasks. Note our work differentiates from 6 in many aspects: we analyze the OOD issue particularly for unsupervised SSL frameworks, whereas 6 strongly hinges on data labels to compute confidence. We model the associated sampling ratio as a latent variable model which is exclusively suitable for the SSL problem, and is supported by rigorous analysis. Our model also naturally jettisons the need of any threshold as used in 6.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: learning.\nWithout access to any data annotations, self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches impose additional constraints or hypothesis among distinct views of the original input data  [ref]7    [ref]33    .
