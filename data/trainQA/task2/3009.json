      "content": "Paper Title: Not All Fabrics Are Created Equal: Exploring eFPGA Parameters For IP Redaction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHeterogeneous computing have renewed interest in  embedded field programmable gate arrays (eFPGAs) fabrics due to their flexibility and adaptability.\nCommercially, field programmable gate arrays are coupled tightly to processors in a single-chip so that they can act as a programmable accelerator or co-processor [ref]31 , with benefits like increasing the peak performance of a  System-on-Chip (SoC) by 3.4×\\times along with a 2.9×\\times power reduction.\nDifferent SoCs can be customized with different eFPGA fabrics to best serve a specific application’s requirements, e.g., eFPGAs for machine learning require a high density of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) blocks, embedded memories, and other arithmetic accelerators (such as for multiply and accumulate operations). Recently, open-source (e)FPGA prototyping tools have emerged\n  .\nFig. 5 illustrates principles of the OpenFPGA framework for prototyping customizable eFPGAs .\nThe framework provides a unified environment for FPGA IP Prototyping and supporting FPGA CAD tools. In the XML-to-layout flow, designers produce fabrication-ready eFPGA layouts by specifying designs with XML-based architecture description languages  , customizing circuit elements, standard cells, and flexible hardware IPs.\nThe core engine converts the architecture description Verilog netlists (either tech-mapped or synthesizable). The auto-generated netlists are post-processed , with a focus on easing the physical design flow, and then followed by Place&Route (P&R) tools for generating GDSII layouts and design sign-offs.\nFor functional verification, OpenFPGA also produces Verilog testbenches.\nThe testbenches validate the correctness of a generated fabric, simulating a complete process, including bitstream downloading and eFPGA operation.\nThe ability to create custom fabrics is a better fit for redaction compared with off-the-shelf (commercial) eFPGA IP .\nIn the Verilog-to-Bitstream flow, end-users can implement HDL designs on the eFPGAs. HDL designs are first synthesized by Yosys  and physically mapped (packed, placed, and routed) on the eFPGA programmable resources using VPR  tool. The implemented design is translated to a bitstream which is compatible with configuration protocols of eFPGAs. Open-source efforts aim to overcome two major technical barriers of contemporary eFPGA development: (1) the time-consuming physical design process—by leveraging the sophisticated ASIC design tools rather than manual layouts, and (2) the increasing design complexity of associated  electronic design automation (EDA) tool-chain—by using well-known open-source FPGA architecture exploration tools, e.g., VPR , rather than developing ad hoc, in-house tools.\nUsing the design flows in Fig. 5, the development cycle of a 160k-LUT FPGA layout is ∼similar-to\\sim24 hours and its performance is competitive against commercial products  .\nWe thus adopt the OpenFPGA framework to implement eFPGA fabrics  for redaction and provide insights into our experience.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: their flexibility and adaptability.\nCommercially, field programmable gate arrays are coupled tightly to processors in a single-chip so that they can act as a programmable accelerator or co-processor [ref]31 , with benefits like increasing the peak performance of a  System-on-Chip (SoC) by 3.4×\\times along with a 2.9×\\times power reduction.\nDifferent SoCs can be customized with different eFPGA\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
