      "content": "Paper Title: Zoom-shot: Fast and Efficient Unsupervised Zero-Shot Transfer of CLIP to Vision Encoders with Multimodal Loss\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraining Setup -  We train our linear mapping functions h‚Ñéh, and h‚àí1superscript‚Ñé1h^{-1} on 20% of the ImageNet¬† training split without class labels/groundtruth.\nWe use only 20% of the training split instead of 100% for two reasons: firstly to limit the computational requirement of training, and secondly, we find it delivers optimal performance, as reported in Table Table¬†4. Additionally, Moayeri¬†et al. 8 substantiate this result in their supplementary material A.1.\nWe train for only a single epoch using the Adam¬† optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.0001 and utilize a cosine annealing learning rate decay¬†. When training, our overall loss function consits of the summation of our individual loss functions discussed in Section 3. In accordance with 8 we re-scale both latent spaces to a target variance of 4.5.\nUnless otherwise stated, the zoom-shot results in this section use the logit matching variant for the PG-KD loss. The comparisons between the logit matching and the High Temperature Cross Entropyvariants are discussed in the ablation results in Section¬†5. As the Zoom-shot training does not use any class labels/groundtruth or text-image paired data, we generated a set of general prompts using ChatGPT¬†[ref]31. Examples of these prompts include ‚Äúa photo of a dog‚Äù, ‚Äúa photo of a building‚Äù, and ‚Äúa photo of a computer‚Äù. We intuitively decided to keep these prompts general in the hope to capture different regions of the CLIP text subspace. In total, there are 50 general prompts used. The details of the prompts are shown in the supplementary material. Datasets - We test our Zoom-shot approach across eight classification datasets of varying granularity. Specifically, we use ImageNet¬†, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100¬† as the ‚Äòcoarse‚Äô or general classification datasets as their classes are more broadly defined and should be easier to classify. In addition to these, we use five ‚Äòfine-grained‚Äô datasets of varying difficulty, these being CUB-200¬†3, Flowers-102¬†, Herbarium-19¬†1, Oxford-IIIT pets¬† and Stanford-Cars¬†. The Herbarium-19 dataset is by far the most challenging with 683 classes, where each class is an individual species of the same flowering plant family. We use the pre-defined test splits for each dataset when reporting the top-1 test accuracy throughout this work. Vision Encoders -  We use Zoom-shot to transfer the zero-shot capabilities of CLIP to five different vision encoders of varying size and complexity. These are MobileNetV3 small, DenseNet121¬†, ResNet18¬†, DINOv1 ViT-B/16¬†, DINOv2 ViT-B/14¬†. All vision encoders are initialized using pre-trained ImageNet weights. We selected this range of models as they offer a meaningful trade-off of strengths and weaknesses, demonstrating the expected performance of our approach across a variety of potential use cases ranging from cloud-based to edge-based applications. Zero-shot Setting -  We measure the top-1 zero-shot classification accuracy of our vision encoders using a set of prompts. These prompts are constructed by including the class name Cùê∂C in a prompt template, such as ‚ÄúAn image of a {Cùê∂C}‚Äù. We follow the zero-shot setting used in CLIP¬†[ref]34, where multiple prompt templates are averaged for an individual class. Additionally, we use the prompt templates from [ref]34 where available for our datasets. More details on the exact prompts used can be found in the supplementary material. Baseline methods -  We compare our results against two baseline methods. The first is the recent state-of-the-art method proposed by Moayeri et al.¬†8, which we refer to as Linear Aligner (LA) in all results. We use their training code as provided on their GitHub222https://github.com/k1rezaei/Text-to-concept/ with their described optimal training settings. We also use CLIP¬†[ref]34 as an additional comparison. CLIP should serve as the upper bound of performance for Zoom-shot. We use the ViT-B/16 CLIP image encoder for all results. Both baseline methods follow the same zero-shot settings as described above.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: are discussed in the ablation results in Section¬†5. As the Zoom-shot training does not use any class labels/groundtruth or text-image paired data, we generated a set of general prompts using ChatGPT¬†[ref]31. Examples of these prompts include ‚Äúa photo of a dog‚Äù, ‚Äúa photo of a building‚Äù, and ‚Äúa photo of a computer‚Äù. We intuitively decided to keep these prompts general in the hope to capture\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
