      "content": "Paper Title: BOURNE: Bootstrapped Self-supervised Learning Framework for Unified Graph Anomaly Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, graph anomaly detection (GAD) has received considerable attention due to its critical application in a wide range of domains. Typical application fields include social networks  [ref]2 , traffic analysis , financial risk management , and biological networks , to name a few. GAD seeks to identify anomalous graph objects, such as nodes, edges, or subgraphs, that significantly deviate from the regular patterns observed in most of the graph. In this work, we focus on detecting node and edge anomalies and divide the existing GAD approaches into node anomaly detection (NAD) and edge anomaly detection (EAD) methods. Earlier anomalous node detection researches mainly resort to shallow learning mechanisms. For instance, Radar  utilizes residual analysis to detect anomalies by factorizing node attribute matrix. ANOMALOUS  further employs CUR decomposition  to select structure-related node attributes before residual analysis.\nDespite their simplicity, shallow methods cannot capture the complex interactions inherent in graph data. In light of this, researchers have recently introduced deep learning models into the anomalous node detection task. DOMINANT 0 employs a graph autoencoder to reconstruct both the structural and attributive information of graphs and then evaluate the node abnormality by reconstruction error. CoLA 1 constructs instance pairs consisting of nodes and subgraphs and applies contrastive learning to learn node representation. The anomaly score of a node is then calculated by measuring the agreement between the pair of instances. SL-GAD 2 further integrates both generative attribute reconstruction and contrastive learning. As for anomalous edge detection, they usually first learn node-level representations and then measure the edge abnormality with the embeddings of the nodes it connects. For example, AANE 3 first generates node embeddings using GCN 4 and then calculates the link probability as the hyperbolic tangent of the connected node embeddings. An edge is deemed anomalous if its predicted probability falls below a predefined threshold. UGED 5 utilizes an autoencoder and a fully connected network to predict edge distribution and identify edge abnormality through its appearance probability. Despite the success of existing GAD methods, they still suffer from two major limitations:\n(1) Existing GAD methods typically approach anomalous node and edge detection as independent tasks, failing to consider their associations in real-world datasets (P1). For instance, as shown in Figure 1(a), in online transaction networks, abnormal transactions (anomalous edges) are often associated with fraudsters (anomalous nodes)  6, while in social networks, social spammers (anomalous nodes) frequently send spam messages (anomalous edges) to regular users 7. Due to the strong correlation between two types of anomalies, detecting anomalous patterns of nodes can provide valuable auxiliary information for edge anomaly detection, and vice versa. However, none of the existing methods can detect both types of anomalies simultaneously, and utilize their mutual detection capabilities. (2) The current state-of-the-art GAD models, such as CoLA 1 and SL-GAD 2, employ contrastive learning techniques that aim to maximize agreement among elements within the same instance pairs while minimizing agreement among elements from different pairs. Thus, they heavily rely on extensive negative instance pairs to detect anomalies. Consequently, generating and processing a large number of negative pairs brings extra computational cost, which becomes prohibitively high when dealing with large-scale graphs (P2). In order to address the limitations above, we propose a novel BOotstrapped Self-supervised Learning Framework for Unified GRaph ANomaly DEtection (BOURNE for abbreviation) that efficiently detects anomalous nodes and edges simultaneously.\nThe key idea behind BOURNE is to construct discrimination pairs for both target nodes and target edges, employ self-supervised learning to compare these pairs, and derive anomaly scores. To achieve this, we initially extract enclosing subgraphs centered on each target node as a graph view (node context). Then, we apply dual hypergraph transformations with augmentations to the graph view, resulting in a hypergraph view (edge context). As illustrated in Figure 1(b), an edge in the original graph view corresponds to a node in the hypergraph view, and a node in the graph view corresponds to a hyperedge in the hypergraph view.\nBoth views are then passed through a Graph Neural Network (GNN) encoder and a Hypergraph Neural Network (HGNN) encoder, respectively, to learn latent representations for nodes and edges. We facilitate mutual detection by swapping the surrounding contexts of target nodes and target edges. Specifically, we compute the anomaly score of a target node by comparing its representation from a graph view with the context representations from a hypergraph view. Similarly, we calculate the anomaly score for a target edge by comparing edge representation from the hypergraph view with the context representations from the graph view.\nFinally, by combining both node and edge anomaly scores, we obtain a comprehensive objective. 8 and 9 initially introduced bootstrapped self-supervised learning frameworks to obviate the necessity of negative sampling, but tailored for image and node classification domains, making them not directly applicable to anomaly detection. We present a specialized bootstrapped self-supervised model tailored for graph anomaly detection, demonstrating strong performance without the need of negative pair sampling. Thereby, the proposed model can efficiently handle large-scale graphs. In summary, the main contributions of our work are as follows: We propose a unified graph anomaly detection model, BOURNE, that leverages the correlation of anomalous nodes and edges to enhance the detection of each other. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first unified framework capable of detecting both types of anomalies simultaneously. We develop a bootstrapped self-supervised learning framework for the graph anomaly detection task, and it significantly improves the learning efficiency without the need for negative pair sampling. The proposed model can efficiently handle large-scale datasets without sacrificing performance. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets show that BOURNE achieves superior performance on both node and edge anomaly detection compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: In recent years, graph anomaly detection (GAD) has received considerable attention due to its critical application in a wide range of domains.
