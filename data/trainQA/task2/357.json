      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Vision-and-Language Navigation with Image-Text Pairs from the Web\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPath Selection in VLN.\nIn VLN , an agent is required to follow a navigation instruction from a start location to a goal. While most existing works focus on the setting in which the test environments are previously unseen, many also consider the scenario in which the test environment is previously explored and stored in memory (i.e., fully observable). In this setting, a high-probability path is typically generated by performing beam search through the environment and ranking paths according to either: (1) their probability under a ‘follower’ model  [ref]8 0    , as in Figure 1 (left), or (2) by how well they explain the instruction according to a ‘speaker’ (instruction generation) model [ref]8 [ref]28, as in Figure 1 (center). In contrast, we use beam search with an existing agent model [ref]28 to generate a set of candidate paths, which we then evaluate using our discriminative path-instruction compatibility model, as in Figure 1 (right). Data Augmentation and Auxiliary Tasks in VLN.\nTo compensate for the small size of existing VLN datasets, previous works have investigated various data augmentation strategies and auxiliary tasks. Many papers report results trained on augmented data including instructions synthesized by a speaker model [ref]8   [ref]28. Tan et al. [ref]28 use environmental dropout to mimic additional training environments to improve generalization. Li et al.  incorporate language-only pretraining using a BERT model. Several existing papers 0  and one concurrent hitherto-unpublished work  consider path-instruction compatibility as an auxiliary loss function or reward for VLN agents. We focus on path-instruction compatibility in the context of transfer learning from large-scale internet data, which has not been previously explored. Vision-and-Language Pretraining.\nThere has been significant recent progress towards learning transferable joint representations of images and text 2     . Using BERT-like  self-supervised objectives and Transformer  architectures, these models have achieved state-of-the-art results on multiple vision-and-language tasks by pretraining on aligned image-and-text data collected from the web  and transferring the base architecture to other tasks such as VQA , referring expressions , and caption-based image retrieval . However, these tasks are all based on single images. The extent to which these pretrained models can generalize from human-composed and curated internet images to embodied AI tasks has not been investigated. In this work we propose a training curriculum to handle potential domain-shift and augment a previous model architecture to process panoramic image sequences, extending the progress in vision-and-language to vision-and-language navigation (VLN).\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: this setting, a high-probability path is typically generated by performing beam search through the environment and ranking paths according to either: (1) their probability under a ‘follower’ model  [ref]8 0    , as in Figure 1 (left), or (2) by how well they explain the instruction according to a ‘speaker’ (instruction generation) model [ref]8 [ref]28, as in Figure 1 (center).

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
