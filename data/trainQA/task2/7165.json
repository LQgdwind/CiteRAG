      "content": "Paper Title: JMA: a General Algorithm to Craft Nearly Optimal Targeted Adversarial Examples\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSolving the minimization in (3) is generally hard, then the adversarial examples are determined by solving the simplified problem described below: where ℒ​(x+δ,t)ℒ𝑥𝛿𝑡\\mathcal{L}({x+\\delta},t) is the loss function under the target class t𝑡t, and λ𝜆\\lambda is a parameter balancing the importance of the two terms. The problem in (4) can be solved by the box-constraint L-BFGS method [ref]1. Specifically, a line search is carried out to find the value of λ>0𝜆0\\lambda>0 for which the solution of (4) satisfies the adversarial condition, that is ϕ​(x+δ)=titalic-ϕ𝑥𝛿𝑡\\phi(x+\\delta)=t.\nUsually, the categorical cross entropy loss is considered. From (4), it is immediate to see that, in the one-hot case, when the categorical cross entropy loss is considered, only the target class contributes to the loss term, and then the attack only cares about increasing ft​(x)subscript𝑓𝑡𝑥f_{t}(x), regardless of the other scores, all the more that, due to the presence of the softmax, this also implies decreasing the other outputs. To reduce the complexity of the L-BFGS attack, several suboptimal solutions have been proposed, that consider the problem - equivalent to (4) - of minimizing the loss function ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} subject to a constraint on the perturbation δ𝛿\\delta.\nThe Fast Sign Gradient Method (FGSM) method [ref]2\nobtains an adversarial perturbation in a computationally efficient way by considering the sign of the gradient of the output with respect to the input image.\nThe FGSM attack is a one-step attack whose strength can be modulated only by increasing the value of the term multiplying the gradient sign. In , an iterative version of FGSM is introduced by applying FGSM multiple times, with a smaller step size, each time by recomputing the gradient. This method is often referred to as I-FGSM, or Basic Iterative Method (BIM).\nAnother attack similar to the FGSM attack is the projected gradient descent (PGD) attack , that can be regarded to as a multi-step extension of the FGSM attack where the clip operation performed by BIM on the gradient (to force the solution to stay in the  [ref]1 range) is replaced by the gradient projection. Other gradient-based attacks are\nthe Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA) [ref]3 and the DeepFool attack .\nJSMA [ref]3 consists of a greedy iterative procedure which relies on forward\npropagation to compute, at each iteration, a saliency map, indicating the\npixels that contribute most to the classification.\nIn such attack, the Jacobian matrix of\nthe network function\nis used to compute the forward derivative and build the saliency map.\nA variant of this attack, called Maximal JSMA, has been proposed in .\nDeepFool  is an efficient iterative attack that considers the minimal perturbation with respect to a linearized classifier.\nIn this way, the current version of the adversarial example is projected onto the separating affine hyperplane at each iteration, until the classification boundary is crossed. The above gradient-based methods often fail due to the gradient vanishing problem .\nA solution to overcome this issue has been proposed in , where the values of the logits are scaled by a temperature parameter. However, this approach lacks flexibility and the suitable distillation temperature parameter strongly depends on the network. A more flexible and efficient method working at the logits level has been proposed by Carlini and Wagner (C&W) .\nIn the C&W attack the loss term is replaced by a properly designed function depending on the difference between the logit of the target class and the largest among the logits of the other classes (since the logits do not sum one, two logits at a time must be considered).\nThe perturbation is kept in the valid range by properly modifying the objective function.\nIn this way, the following unconstrained problem is considered and solved (for the case of L2subscript𝐿2L_{2} distortion metric): where δ​(w)=1/2​(tanh⁡(w)+1)−x𝛿𝑤12𝑤1𝑥\\delta(w)=1/2(\\tanh(w)+1)-x is the distortion introduced in the image, and the constant parameter κ>0𝜅0\\kappa>0 is used to encourage the attack to generate a high confidence attacked image.\nSince logits are more sensitive to modifications of the input than the probability values obtained after the softmax activation C&W attack is less sensitive to vanishing gradient problems.\nHowever, we notice that, by considering only two logits at time, and neglecting the effect of the perturbation on the other logits, this approach is particularly suited to the one-hot case and is highly suboptimum when other output encoding schemes are used.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: is the loss function under the target class t𝑡t, and λ𝜆\\lambda is a parameter balancing the importance of the two terms.
