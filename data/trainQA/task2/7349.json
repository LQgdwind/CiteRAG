      "content": "Paper Title: Distillation Enhanced Time Series Forecasting Network with Momentum Contrastive Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTime series forecasting plays a critical role in various domains, ranging from finance and economics to weather forecasting and resource management[ref]17 [ref]23 . The ability to accurately predict future values based on historical data is invaluable for decision-making and planning purposes. For the current time series forecasting study  , the critical problem is how to leverage the inherent structure information of time series to learn discriminate representations to achieve better forecasting accuracy. In this article, the focus of our work is to efficiently integrate representation learning and forecasting into a unified framework and make them mutually supportive.\nWith the emergence of contrastive learning methods, self-supervised representation learning and time series prediction have witnessed increased attention and progress. Several notable methods such as TS2Vec,\nTS-TCC [ref]7, TF-C , and CPD  have been developed in this domain. The objective of contrastive learning is to train one or multiple encoders that can generate representations where similar instances are closer to each other, while dissimilar instances are farther apart.\nIn particular, Yue et al.  introduced a comprehensive framework called TS2Vec for learning time series representations. This framework utilizes a hierarchical approach to distinguish between positive and negative samples.\nEldele et al. [ref]7 proposed a time-series representation learning framework called TS-TCC, which employs temporal and contextual contrastive learning to extract discriminative representations.\nAnother notable contrastive learning approach, CoST, was introduced by Woo et al.  specifically for predicting long sequence time series. It transforms the data into the frequency domain to reveal the seasonal representations of the sequence, enabling a comprehensive understanding of its characteristics.\nThese contrastive learning methods have demonstrated their effectiveness in learning informative representations for time series data. Despite the promising results achieved in time series forecasting modeling, there are three crucial aspects that have often been neglected. These aspects have a significant impact on the accuracy and generalization ability of the models in real-world scenarios: Data Noise and Distribution Shift: Real-world time series data often suffer from noise and incompleteness due to various environmental factors. This introduces additional challenges in accurate forecasting as the noise can corrupt the underlying patterns and relationships within the data. Moreover, the distribution of real-world data may differ from the training data, leading to a distribution shift. This inconsistency can result in poor model performance and inaccurate predictions. Dependence on Single Salient Feature:\nDependence on a single salient feature in time series forecasting can indeed limit the model’s ability to capture the full complexity of the data and generalize well to new instances. Over-reliance on a single feature may lead to the model learning shortcuts or missing out on other relevant predictive features, reducing its performance and interpretability. Additionally, existing models often treat multivariate time series as a single integrated representation, disregarding the correlations between individual instances or variables within the series. False Positive Focusing in Contrastive Learning:\nContrastive learning approaches typically rely on generating positive pairs and negative patterns based on prior knowledge or strong assumptions about the data distribution, which makes the model pay excessive attention on the distances between positive and negative sample pairs within the sample space. This can lead to a neglect of the similarity between different overlapping subsequences within the same sequence, thereby limiting the model’s ability to capture the full complexity of the data and potentially impacting its performance. To address the above challenges, we develop DE-TSMCL, a distillation enhanced framework for time series forecasting based on momentum contrastive learning, which contains three key components: learnable data augmentation, distillation enhanced representation and momentum constrastive learning.\nFirst, we propose learnable data augmentation to learn whether to mask a sample to transform the original two overlapping subseries into enhanced views, which will be fed into the following teacher and student network and jointly optimized with the downstream forecasting task in an end-to-end fashion.\nSecond, we introduce knowledge distillation technique into representation. We propose to train two models, teacher and student. Two models are trained simultaneously. The teacher make full use of of all available knowledge to capture the temporal features of time series to achieve better representation performance.\nThird, in order to calculate the similarity of samples from different timestamp,\nsupervised task is considered. At the same time, considering the commonalities between multiple samples and effectively alleviating the\nproblems of data sparsity, we design a self-supervised strategy powered with momentum contrastive training to further boost the performance. Finally, we jointly optimize these two tasks. The contributions of this thesis can be summarized as follows. We propose a Distillation Enhanced Time Series Forecasting Network via Momentum Contrastive Learning (DE-TSMCL) to improve the time series forecasting performance. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply KD techniques among models that rely on different overlapping subseries in the time series forecasting task. We design supervised and self-supervised learning task for time series forecasting, moreover, we jointly optimize them. In addition, we apply momentum contrastive training to update the teacher and student network at different scales, which solves the noisy and inconsistent issue due to the back-propagation. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets from different domains demonstrate that our model advances the forecasting performance compared\nwith other baselines The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 summarizes the related work. Section 3 gives the preliminaries. Section 4 introduces our proposed DE-TSMCL model. Section 5 gives the comparison and evaluation results of the proposed model on four real-world datasets. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in various domains, ranging from finance and economics to weather forecasting and resource management[ref]17 [ref]23 .
