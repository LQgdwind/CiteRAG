Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Approximate Model-Based Shielding for Safe Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nModel-based RL as a paradigm for learning complex policies has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its superior sample efficiency [ref]19 . Dyna – “an integrated architecture for learning, planning and reacting”  proposed an architecture that learns a dynamics model of the environment in addition to a reward maximising policy. In theory, by utilising the dynamics model for planning and/or policy optimisation we should learn better policies with fewer experience. Model-based policy optimisation (MBPO)  is a sample-efficient neural architecture for optimising policies in learned dynamics model. More recently, more sophisticated neural architectures such as Dreamer [ref]19 and DreamerV2  have been proposed that have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on the DeepMind Visual Control Suite [ref]40 and the Atari benchmark   respectively. Our work is built on DreamerV3  which has demonstrated superior performance in a number of domains (with fixed hyperparameters) including the Atari benchmark   and MineRL [ref]17, which is regarded as a notoriously difficult exploration challenge in the RL literature.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: Model-based RL as a paradigm for learning complex policies has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its superior sample efficiency [ref]19 .
