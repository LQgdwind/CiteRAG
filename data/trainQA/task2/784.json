      "content": "Paper Title: Approximate Partition Selection for Big-Data Workloads using Summary Statistics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe highlight a few design considerations in the system. Layout Agnostic.  A random data layout would make the partition selection problem trivial, but maintaining a random layout requires additional efforts and rarely happens in practice¬†. In read-only or append-only data stores, it is also expensive to modify the data layout. As a result, we observe that in practice, many datasets simply remain in the order that they were ingested in the cluster. In addition, prior work¬† has shown that it is challenging and sometimes impossible to find a partitioning scheme that enables good data skipping for arbitrary input queries. Therefore, instead of requiring re-partitioning or random layout, PS3 explicitly chooses to keep data in situ and tries to make the best out of the given data layout. We show that PS3 can work across different data layouts in the evaluation (¬ß¬†5.5.1). Sampling on a single table.  To perform joins effectively, prior work¬†[ref]44 has shown that sampling each input relation independently is not enough and that the joint distribution must be taken into account. Handling the correlations between join tables at the partition level is another research problem on its own, and is outside the scope of this paper. However, sampling on a single table can still offer non-trivial performance improvements even for queries that involve joining multiple tables. For example, in key‚Äìforeign key joins, fact tables are often much larger compared to dimension tables. Sampling the fact table, therefore, already gets us most of the gains. Generalization.  Prior works make various trade-offs between the efficiency and the generality of the queries that they support, ranging from having access to the entire workload¬† to being workload agnostic¬†. Our system falls in the middle of the spectrum, where we make assumptions about the structure and distribution of the query workload. Specifically, we assume that the set of columns used in GROUP BYs and the aggregate functions are known apriori, with the scope defined in ¬ß¬†2.2; predicates can take any form that fits under the defined scope and we do not assume we have access to the exact set of predicates used. We assume that a workload consists of queries made of an arbitrary combination of aggregates, group bys and predicates from the scope of interest. PS3 is trained per data layout and workload, and generalizes to unseen queries sampled from the same distribution as the training workload. Overall, our system is best suited for commonly occurring queries and should be retrained in case of major changes in query workloads such as the introduction of unseen group by columns. We do not consider generalization to unseen data layouts or datasets and we view broader generalization as an exciting area for future work (¬ß¬†7). Since most summary statistics are computed per column, different datasets might not share any common statistics. Even for the same dataset, the importance of summary statistics can vary across data layouts. For example, the mean of column XùëãX can distinguish partitions in a layout where the dataset is sorted by XùëãX, but may provide no information in a random layout.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: make the best out of the given data layout.
