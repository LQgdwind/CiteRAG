      "content": "Paper Title: Visual Tuning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSequential adapter refers to the technique of inserting parameters into a sequential forward network shown in Fig. 3(a), which typically includes a linear down projection, a non-linear activation function, an up projection, and a residual connection. This approach is commonly applied after the multi-head attention layer and/or the feed-forward layer to enhance model performance. In particular, given a d𝑑d-dimensional input feature map Zlsuperscript𝑍𝑙Z^{l}, the number of parameters of adapter can be adjusted by a hyperparameter db​o​t​t​l​esubscript𝑑𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑙𝑒d_{bottle} (db​o​t​t​l​e≪d)much-less-thansubscript𝑑𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑙𝑒𝑑(d_{bottle}\\ll d). The sequential adapter module first uses a down-projection (i.e., downsampling) with Wd​o​w​n∈ℝd×db​o​t​t​l​esubscript𝑊𝑑𝑜𝑤𝑛superscriptℝ𝑑subscript𝑑𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑙𝑒W_{down}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d{\\times}d_{bottle}} to project the feature to the lower-dimensional representation, followed by a ReLU activation function and an up-projection (i.e., upsampling) with Wu​p∈ℝdb​o​t​t​l​e×dsubscript𝑊𝑢𝑝superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑙𝑒𝑑W_{up}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{bottle}{\\times}d}.\nThe above formulation can be written as below: where Z^lsuperscript^𝑍𝑙\\hat{Z}^{l} denotes the optimized features outputted by the sequential adapter. In sequential adapter strategies, research efforts can be roughly categorized into two groups: inserting residual blocks directly, and using more parameter optimization techniques to minimize the size of the adapter.\nStudies of the first family  [ref]130 [ref]17  emerge in the earlier stage without large-scale models, the initial development of Res-adapt  involves a customized deep network structure that utilizes adapter residual modules to dynamically adjust to different visual domains in real-time.\nFollowing Res-adapt, DAN [ref]130 once converges to a comparable or even a higher level of performance while requiring a fraction of the parameters (typically 13%) of standard fine-tuning procedures.\nTheir recent efforts [ref]17 develop LST, a technique that trains a separate ladder side network using intermediate activations from backbone networks via shortcut connections to make predictions. This approach improves the model’s accuracy while reducing computational complexity.\nIn addition, Conv-Adapter systematically investigates feasible solutions to learn task-specific knowledge, which adapts intermediate features of each residual block in pre-trained ConvNets using four different variants, including the parallel adapter discussed below. A second family of approaches        focuses on optimizing the network architecture in order to better understand the efficiency of sequential adapters.\nAlternatively, EPM  suggests that universal parametric neural network families are used, but with limited parameters. It discusses a number of methods for parametrization, including parallel and series residual adapters, compression of joint adapters, and parameter allocation.\nPolyhistor  decomposes a hyper-network into a pair of separate hyper-networks and factorizes an adapter weight matrix into two kernels for parameter reduction in multi-tasking architecture.\nPro-tuning  exploits semantic information from diverse levels to enrich the feature space by building multiple stage-wise prompt blocks, which can be simply plugged into a model for quickly adapting to a new task.\nBy generating attention weights without token-token interactions, AMixer  captures long-term and short-term spatial dependencies without self-attention.\nShysheya et. al  proposed a novel technique called Fit, which scales and shifts activations and leverages a Naive Bayes final layer classifier for image classification, and is automatically configured and achieves promising results.\nMarouf et. al  introduced TINA, an approach that iteratively reduces the size of every adapter using a scoring function compared to neuron importance. This process enables the automatic estimation of every adapter and improves the efficiency of the overall model.\nLuo et. al  proposed RepAdapter, which uses re-parameterization of sparse structure to approach nearby projection weights and further reduces the parameters of the model while maintaining its effectiveness and lightweight nature. Adapters have become a popular technique for foundation tasks in computer vision, where the pre-training task is often image classification. However, other tasks such as high-level vision tasks [ref]78      , low-level vision tasks  , video understanding [ref]78  , and robotic control  all require designs that are tailored to their specific architecture, in order to efficiently transfer learned parameters and achieve good performance through PETL.\nIn addition to these task differences, recent research has proposed innovative ways to utilize adapters in different applications.\nFor instance, BDTL and ViTDet   adjust a plain backbone with minimal adaptions only during fine-tuning, thus eliminating the hierarchical constraint from the object detection task.\nIn Florence [ref]78, representations are expanded from coarse to fine, from static to dynamic, and from RGB to a number of modalities (caption, depth). It can be used to perform a wide range of vision tasks by incorporating universal visual-language representations from Web-scale image-text data.\nSND  utilizes a dynamic stacked network as the adapter to activate the pre-trained model in a plug-and-play method for image restoration.\nMK-Adapter  introduces a learnable multi-knowledge adapter to adaptively blend the predictions from CLIP and DINO for few-shot classification.\nADA  is developed to perform continual learning using pre-trained transformers and adapters, which adds an adapter before layer norm and feed-forward layers (MLP).\nAIM  introduces spatial, temporal, and joint adapter separately and ST-Adapter  propose a spatiotemporal adapter, which both aim to equip an image model with spatiotemporal reasoning capability for video understanding.\nPEA  addresses the limitations of classical fine-tuning in robotic manipulation by utilizing the classic bottleneck architecture widely used in image classification as a lossless adaptation.\nCAOA  proposes a content-adaptive optimization framework for image compression that trains adapters inserted into the decoder through optimization in terms of rate-distortion, with adapter parameters being additionally transmitted. In the field of multi-modal learning, with the development of large-scale cross-modal pre-trained models, i.e., CLIP  and ALIGN , adapter technique has been widely adopted, using a design analogous to the one mentioned above, to adapt various downstream tasks for efficient fine-tuning      3 6 5 4 7 with excellent results.\nHA  firstly analyses empirically and recommends general recipes for efficient multi-modal transfer learning including LayerNorm-tuning.\nCLIP-Adapter  combines residual-style feature blending with an additional bottleneck adapter to learn new features on either a visual or a language branch.\nOn this basis, Tip-Adapter  aims to enhance the few-shot capability, but does not require backpropagation during training by using a key-value cache.\nMAGMA  combines visual and textual inputs to produce text using adapter-based fine-tuning, resulting in more complex generative language models.\nBALLAD  augments the representations of tail classes on balanced training samples by employing an additional adapter layer for long-tailed vision language learning.\nBuilding on previous work, subsequent methods focus more on parameter efficiency and multi-modal effectiveness.\nThrough a hierarchical adapter module structure, Hierarchical3D 2 integrates multi-modal content into a trained textual summarizer, while tuning only a few model parameters.\nVL-Adapter  adjusts the pre-trained model with sequential adapter layers for the cross-modal domain (i.e., image-text, and video-text) to construct the benchmark.\nHyperPELT 3 is an approach for fine-tuning small modules in a pre-trained language model using a shared hyper-network that takes trainable hyper-embeddings as input.\nThen CrossModal-Adapter and MV-Adapter 6 7 both attempt to make further improvements with a notable difference: allowing cross-modal interactions early in the training process by the weight-sharing mechanism.\nTo perform better on challenging datasets, SVL-Adapter 4 brings together the complementary strengths of vision-language pre-training and self-supervised representation learning for extreme scenes like few-shot learning.\nLAVISH 5 firstly migrates the adapters for pre-trained ViTs to audio-visual tasks by injecting a small number of trainable parameters into every layer of a frozen ViT.\nThese innovative approaches demonstrate the versatility of adapters and their potential for various applications beyond traditional classification tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [130]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]130: can be roughly categorized into two groups: inserting residual blocks directly, and using more parameter optimization techniques to minimize the size of the adapter.\nStudies of the first family  [ref]130 [ref]17  emerge in the earlier stage without large-scale models, the initial development of Res-adapt  involves a customized deep network structure that utilizes adapter residual modules to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
