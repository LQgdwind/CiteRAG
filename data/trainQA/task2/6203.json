      "content": "Paper Title: From Latent Graph to Latent Topology Inference: Differentiable Cell Complex Module\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this Section, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on several heterophilic and homophilic graph benchmarks. Briefly, homophily is the principle that similar users interact at a higher rate than dissimilar ones. In a graph, this means that nodes with similar characteristics are more likely to be connected. Traditional Graph/Cell Complex Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs and CCCNs) implicitly rely on the homophily assumption, and one typically observes performance drops of these models in heterophilic settings [ref]41 [ref]47. Our main goal is to show that latent topology inference via the differentiable cell complex module (DCM) allows learning higher-order relationships among data points that lead to significant improvements w.r.t. latent graph inference. Since DCM is a generalization of the differentiable graph module (DGM), we use as a comparison the original (discrete) DGM  (denoted DGM-E) and its recently introduced non-Euclidean version [ref]12 (denoted DGM-M). Moreover, we also report the results of a simplified variant of our model (denoted as DCM (Œ±=1ùõº1\\alpha=1)), in which the graph is explicitly learned and all the polygons are taken, i.e. Œ±=1ùõº1\\alpha=1 in the PIM; in this (lower complexity) case, the Œ±ùõº\\alpha-DGM guides both the edges (explicitly) and the polygons (implicitly) inference steps. Finally, we report the vanilla MLP and GCN as further baselines. In all the experiments, we utilize GCNs at the graph level and CCCNs at the edge level; the details about the model architectures employed to obtain the presented results are given in Appendix E. The first and the second best results are highlighted. We follow the same core experimental set up of [ref]12 on transductive classification tasks; in particular, we first focus on standard graph datasets such as Cora, CiteSeer , PubMed, Physics and CS , which have high homophily levels ranging from 0.74 to 0.93. We then test our method on several challenging heterophilic datasets, Texas, Wisconsin, Squirrel, and Chameleon , which have low homophily levels ranging between 0.11 and 0.23. The results for the homophilic and heterophilic datasets are presented in Tables¬†1 and¬†2, respectively. All the models were tested in two settings: assuming the original graph is available (marked w graph in Tables¬†1 and¬†2) and a more challenging case in which the input graph is assumed to be unavailable (w/o graph). From Tables¬†1 and¬†2, it is evident that the DCM exhibits consistently superior performance compared to alternative methods across both homophilic and heterophilic datasets, both with and without provided input graphs. As expected, our method achieves top performance when the graph is not provided for the heterophilic datasets and when the graph is provided for the homophilic datasets. Somewhat surprising results are achieved when considering the input graph for heterophilic datasets. Despite the model being given ‚Äúwrong‚Äù input graphs (in the sense that the structure of the graph does not match the structure of the node features), the overall performance of the DCM remains stable, yielding remarkable improvements exceeding 20%percent2020\\% for Texas and approximately 10%percent1010\\% for Wisconsin compared to DGM-M [ref]12. Therefore, observing the results across both homophilic and heterophilic datasets when the input graph is provided, we can appreciate the fact that the DCM is capable of exploiting the available ‚Äúgood‚Äù graph in homophilic cases to improve performance, while also being less sensitive to the available ‚Äúwrong‚Äù graph in the case of heterophilic datasets. The good performance on the heterophilic datasets suggests that the learned latent complex has a homophilic 1-skeleton (graph), that enables the involved GCNs and CCCNs to reach higher accuracies. To corroborate this hypotheses, in Figure 4 we show the evolution of the latent topology during the training for the Texas dataset along with the nodes degree distribution, the percentage of sampled polygons %p\\%_{p}, and the homophily level h‚Ñéh that we note reaching 0.990.990.99 on the final inferred graph from the initial 0.110.110.11. Moreover, the fact that most of the inferred polygons belong to the same class and the pretty high spread of the degree distribution further confirm the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. More experiments, ablation studies, and plots can be found in Appendix C and D.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: Graph/Cell Complex Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs and CCCNs) implicitly rely on the homophily assumption, and one typically observes performance drops of these models in heterophilic settings [ref]41 [ref]47.
