      "content": "Paper Title: Nearly Tight Lower Bounds for Succinct Range Minimum Query\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe richness technique and the round-elimination are two major techniques used to prove data structure lower bounds.\nBoth of the two techniques are derived from  . The richness technique was improved by Pǎtraşcu and Thorup  (direct-sum for richness) and by Panigrahy, Talwar and Wieder  (cell-sampling).\nThe cell-sampling technique was applied to static data structures   [ref]24  2, dynamic data structures   , streaming [ref]25, and succinct data structures .111Notably, before the cell-sampling technique was refined and named in , it was applied in proving lower bounds for some special data structure problems  .\nThe cell-sampling technique requires a property that a few obliviously random queries reveal a lot of information about the database, whereas it does not hold for RMQ problem as we discussed earlier. The round-elimination technique was improved and refined for several times.\nIt has application to data structures with polynomial space usage  5  , data structures with near-linear space usage  , as well as succinct data structures  .\nWe compare our technique with the ones in   in next subsection. Golynski  developed a different technique to prove lower bound for succinct data structures, and proved lower bounds for three problems.\nThe technique requires a pair of opposite queries (the “forward query” and the “inverse query”) which can “verify” each other, for example π​(i)=j𝜋𝑖𝑗\\pi(i)=j and π−1​(j)=isuperscript𝜋1𝑗𝑖\\pi^{-1}(j)=i for some permutation π𝜋\\pi. Recently, Viola 9 proposed a new technique to prove lower bounds for both samplers and succinct data structures.\nViola’s technique does not require encoding arguments.\nFurthermore, Viola presented a new proof of r=n/wO​(t)𝑟𝑛superscript𝑤𝑂𝑡r=n/w^{O(t)} lower bounds for the rank problem  as well as the colored-multi-predecessor problem 9.\nWe emphasize that Viola’s technique only works for data structure problems whose datapoints are “evenly” spread, such as the rank problem and the colored-multi-predecessor problem.\nHowever the input for the RMQ problem in the worst case is far from being “even”, which is precisely the nature of the difficulty prevents us from proving higher lower bound for the RMQ problem.\nHence Viola’s contribution is totally orthogonal to ours.\nWe elaborate this at the end of Section 2.2.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: technique was improved by Pǎtraşcu and Thorup  (direct-sum for richness) and by Panigrahy, Talwar and Wieder  (cell-sampling).\nThe cell-sampling technique was applied to static data structures   [ref]24  2, dynamic data structures   , streaming [ref]25, and succinct data structures .111Notably, before the cell-sampling technique was refined and named in , it was applied in proving lower\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
