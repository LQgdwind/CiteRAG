      "content": "Paper Title: An Algorithm-Hardware Co-Optimized Framework for Accelerating N:M Sparse Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe third benchmark set is used to evaluate performance when deploying various Transformer-based models on STAs. Firstly, we study the inference speedup of STAs by contrast with CPUs, GPUs, and the prior dedicated accelerators.\nThe selected models to be deployed are composed of TinyBERT , Dino , the classic Transformer model .\nHere we consider single-batch processing time in all the MHA and FFN ResBlocks of these Transformer-based models.\nFor cross-platform comparison, the hardware setup is as follows to execute the Transformer inference tasks.\nThe CPU results are measured using an ARM Cortex A57 and an Intel i9-9900X.\nThe former commonly appeared in mobile devices for edge applications, while the latter is a high-end CPU product for deploying cloud applications.\nThe GPU results are measured using an NVIDIA Jeston Nano, an embedded GPU product for edge applications, an NVIDIA RTX 2080Ti, and an NVIDIA RTX 3090 capable of 2:4 sparse acceleration.\nFollowing the comparison method in , we apply [ref]10 as baselines on FPGA platforms by scaling the size of its computing engine.\nTwo existing sparse accelerators for Transformers, OPTIMUS  and EdgeBERT , are evaluated as well for a more comprehensive comparison of STA.\nFig. 15 shows the idealized performance speedup of different hardware platforms, where edge and cloud platforms normalized to the ARM Cortex A57 and Intel i9-9900X, respectively. As shown in Fig. 15 (a), among all edge platforms, STA-Tiny achieves a geometric mean increase of 32.96×32.96\\times, 2.69×2.69\\times, and 5.38×5.38\\times over CPU, GPU, and the FPGA baseline, respectively.\nFig. 15 (b) presents the performance comparison between various cloud platforms.\n\nFor fair comparison, Baseline-Small (red), EdgeBERT (purple), OPTIMUS (brown), and 2:8 STA-Small (pink) in Fig. 15 (b) are evaluated under the same number of MAC units and clock frequency.\n\n STA v.s. Baseline-Small [ref]10:\n2:8 STA-Small achieves 2.89×2.89\\times speedup on average over Baseline-Small, which enables dense Transformer acceleration using a large 2D systolic array.\nIt suffers low utilization of MAC units due to inflexible mapping scheme and large skew latency for systolic-arranged data.\nSTA achieves significant performance improvement by: 1) innovation of DMME from the architectural aspects, and 2) reduction on MAC operations of N:M sparse Transformers from the algorithmic aspects.\nWe further present a performance breakdown of STA compared to Baseline-Small.\nAs shown in Fig. 16, the architectural innovation for DMME can achieve 1.08×1.08\\times better performance improvement, and there is 2.68×2.68\\times speedup on top of the architectural innovation by efficiently enabling 2:8 sparse acceleration. STA v.s. EdgeBERT :\n2:8 STA-Small achieves 2.33×2.33\\times speedup on average over EdgeBERT-32, which is an energy-optimized Transformer accelerator exploiting unstructured sparsity.\nWhen performing sparse MAC operations, processing units of EdgeBERT skip the zero input value through a gating strategy, which can significantly reduce energy consumption, but offer little benefit to latency.\nCompared to EdgeBERT, STA performs N:M sparse MAC operations by choosing non-zero inputs, which can both reduce energy and optimize latency. STA v.s. OPTIMUS :\n2:8 STA-Small has a 1.20×1.20\\times better performance on average over OPTIMUS, which is a high performance sparse accelerator for Transformers exploiting unstructured sparsity in weight parameters.\nWhen performing sparse MAC operations, OPTIMUS can hardly achieve high MAC utilization due to load imbalance and input load miss.\nSTA can effectively overcome these two problem suffered by OPTIMUS.\nSTA gets rid of load imbalance by arranging each MAC in DMME to perform operations in a balanced N:M group.\nIn addition, STA loads a series of input N:M groups at each cycle, and utilizes these elements multiple times in a systolic manner, which effectively addresses input load miss compared to OPTIMUS. Finally, we compare STA with other previous FPGA-based works and commercial CPU and GPU products.\nTable V presents a fair performance comparison without batching on various platforms.\nPrior FPGA-based works for accelerating Transformers, include [ref]10, [ref]29, and [ref]33.\nThe dedicated accelerator in [ref]10, equipped with a large 2D systolic array for dense operation, is the pioneer work for Transformer acceleration.\nFTRANS [ref]29, is another recent specialized accelerator for Transformers, which exploits the speedup potential of block-circulant weight representations.\nIn [ref]33, the proposed accelerator utilizes coarse-grained block-based sparsity to speedup Transformer inference.\nThe shallow Transformer used in [ref]29 and [ref]33 is applied as a benchmark for a fair evaluation.\nThe comparison is benchmarked on CPU, GPUs, prior cutting-edge FPGA solutions, and STA on various FPGA platforms.\nWe evaluate these designs in terms of latency, throughput, power, energy efficiency, and MAC efficiency.\nAll of them are key metrics for a computing system.\n As shown in Table V, STA-Tiny far outperforms the embedded GPU, Jetson Nano, and the high-end CPU, i9-9900X, in all evaluated metrics.\nSTA-Small surpasses the CPU and GPU platforms in all metrics.\nMoreover, STA-Small is close to [ref]10 and [ref]33 in terms of latency and throughput, while using a relatively small number of MACs compared to them.\nThe energy efficiency and MAC efficiency of STA-Small are also superior to all previous FPGA-based works.\nCompared to previous FPGA solutions, STA-Large achieves 2.00∼19.47×2.00\\sim 19.47\\times throughput improvement, achieves 1.26∼16.47×1.26\\sim 16.47\\times energy efficiency improvement, and 1.80∼36.00×1.80\\sim 36.00\\times MAC efficiency gain, respectively.\nThe performance gain of STA comes from optimizations from two levels.\nAt the algorithm level, we carefully exploit the potential of N:M sparsity pattern, which can significantly reduce the computational cost of Transformer-based models.\nAt the hardware level, STA can efficiently handle N:M sparse parameters, which significantly improves the utilization of computing units.\nIn addition, our deployment framework, taking STA-Tiny, STA-Small, and STA-Large as examples, can realize flexible hardware generation for Transformers.\nThe proposed framework can flexibly and efficiently meet the requirements for deploying Transformer-based models on various FPGA devices.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: an NVIDIA Jeston Nano, an embedded GPU product for edge applications, an NVIDIA RTX 2080Ti, and an NVIDIA RTX 3090 capable of 2:4 sparse acceleration.\nFollowing the comparison method in , we apply [ref]10 as baselines on FPGA platforms by scaling the size of its computing engine.\nTwo existing sparse accelerators for Transformers, OPTIMUS  and EdgeBERT , are evaluated as well for a more\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
