Motoyama et al.  analyzed social network dynamics from leaks of 6 underground forums. In particular, they generate social network relationships based on ‘friend’ requests, private messages, and thread discussions. They evaluated how the social degree of these relations impacts their trading. Garg et al.  employed social network analysis (SNA) to determine sub-communities inside forums, the correlation between centrality metrics for members, and the impact on the network structure of banned members. Pastrana et al.  employed SNA, logistic regression, and clustering to identify members that interact with known criminals and predict their likelihood of being involved in future criminal activities. Almukaynizi et al.  employed social network metrics as features to predict the exploitation of vulnerabilities discussed in forums. SNA is extensively used to identify key actors in underground forums   .\nOur centrality metric approach is similar to Pete et al. , who constructed undirected graphs of six underground forums based on 6 months of observation, computed network statistics, and analyzed the network structure. Using centrality metrics they identified important members in the network and performed a qualitative analysis of the topics covered. In contrast to our work, their focus is on insights into the structures of different small forum snapshots. We instead propose a methodology to identify relevant samples for training ML classifiers based on the characteristics of the population of the entire forum, which can span several years of observation. Analysis of social network is also extended to a multilayer network to capture the importance of members over different communication mediums. For example, Ficara et al.  created a network with three layers named ‘Meetings’, ‘Phone Calls’, and ‘Crimes’ to describe interactions of Sicilian Mafia members and identify key actors over different layers. \n\nSocial Network Analysis in underground forums is mainly focused on identifying key actors and field experts and how the social relations influence the criminal activities in these forums. Prior works ignored social network characteristics, like centrality, to select representative posts from the population.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: Several works investigate the properties of online social networks to identify influential actors and analyze topics of interests   [ref]22  .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
