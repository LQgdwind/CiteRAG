      "content": "Paper Title: How Powerful are 𝐾-hop Message Passing Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of KP-GNN. Specifically, we 1) empirically verify the expressive power of KP-GNN on 3 simulation datasets and demonstrate the benefits of KP-GNN compared to normal K𝐾K-hop message passing GNNs; 2) demonstrate the effectiveness of KP-GNN on identifying various node properties, graph properties, and substructures with 3 simulation datasets; 3) show that the KP-GNN can achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple real-world datasets; 4) analyze the running time of KP-GNN. The detail of each variant of KP-GNN is described in Appendix I and the detailed experimental setting is described in Appendix J. We implement the KP-GNN with PyTorch Geometric package . Our code is available at https://github.com/JiaruiFeng/KP-GNN. Datasets: To evaluate the expressive power of KP-GNN, we choose: 1) EXP dataset , which contains 600 pairs of non-isomorphic graphs (1-WL failed). The goal is to map these graphs to two different classes. 2) SR25 dataset , which contains 15 non-isomorphic strongly regular graphs (3-WL failed) with each graph of 25 nodes. The dataset is translated to a 15-way classification problem with the goal of mapping each graph into different classes. 3) CSL dataset , which contains 150 4-regular graphs (1-WL failed) divided into 10 isomorphism classes. The goal of the task is to classify them into corresponding isomorphism classes. To demonstrate the capacity of KP-GNN on counting node/graph properties and substructures, we pick 1) Graph property regression (connectedness, diameter, radius) and node property regression (single source shortest path, eccentricity, Laplacian feature) task on random graph dataset [ref]41. 2) Graph substructure counting (triangle, tailed triangle, star, and 4-cycle) tasks on random graph dataset . To evaluate the performance of KP-GNN on real-world datasets, we select 1) MUTAG , D&D , PROTEINS , PTC-MR , and IMDB-B  from TU database. 2) QM9   and ZINC  for molecular properties prediction. The detailed statistics of the datasets are described in Appendix L. Without further highlighting, all error bars in the result tables are the standard deviations of multiple runs. Empirical evaluation of the expressive power:\nFor empirical evaluation of the expressive power, we conduct the ablation study on hop K𝐾K for both normal K𝐾K-hop GNNs and KP-GNN. For K𝐾K-hop GNNs, we implement K-GIN which uses GIN [ref]7 as the base encoder. For KP-GNN, we implement KP-GIN. The results are shown in Table 1. Based on the results, we have the following conclusions: 1) K𝐾K-hop GNNs with both two kernels have expressive power higher than the 1-WL test as it shows the perfect performance on the EXP dataset and performance better than a random guess on the CSL dataset. 2) Increasing K𝐾K can improve the expressive for both two kernels. 3) K𝐾K-hop GNNs cannot distinguish any strong regular graphs in SR25 dataset, which is aligned with Theorem 2. 4) KP-GNN has much higher expressive power than normal K𝐾K-hop GNNs by showing better performance on every dataset given the same K𝐾K. Further, it achieves perfect results on the SR25 dataset even with K=1𝐾1K=1, which demonstrates its ability on distinguishing distance regular graphs. Effectiveness on node/graph properties and substructure prediction: To evaluate the effectiveness of KP-GNN on node/graph properties and substructure prediction, we compare it with several existing models. For the baseline model, we use GIN [ref]7, which has the same expressive power as the 1-WL test. For more powerful baselines, we use GIN-AK+ [ref]27, PNA [ref]41, and PPGN . For normal K𝐾K-hop GNNs, we implement K-GIN+, and for KP-GNN, we implement KP-GIN+. The results are shown in Table 2. Baseline results are taken from [ref]27 and [ref]41. We can see KP-GIN+ achieve SOTA on a majority of tasks. Meanwhile, K-GIN+ also gets great performance on node/graph properties prediction. These results demonstrate the capability of KP-GNN to identify various properties and substructures. We leave the detailed results on counting substructures in Appendix K Evaluation on TU datasets: For baseline models, we select: 1) graph kernel-based method: WL subtree kernel ; 2) vanilla GNN methods: GIN [ref]7 and DGCNN ; 3) advanced GNN methods: GraphSNN  and GIN-AK+ [ref]27. For the proposed KP-GNN, we implement GCN , GraphSAGE , and GIN [ref]7 using the KP-GNN framework, denoted as KP-GCN, KP-GraphSAGE, and KP-GIN respectively. The results are shown in Table 3. For a more fair and comprehensive comparison, we report the results from two different evaluation settings. The first setting follows Xu et al. [ref]7 and the second setting follows Wijesinghe and Wang . We denote the second setting with ∗ in the table. We can see KP-GNN achieves SOTA performance on most of datasets under the second setting and still comparable performance to other baselines under the first setting. Evaluation on molecular prediction tasks: For QM9 dataset, we report baseline results of DTNN and MPNN from . We further select Deep LRP , PPGN , and Nested 1-2-3-GNN  as baseline models. For the ZINC dataset, we report results of MPNN 8 and PNA [ref]41 from 7. We further pick Graphormer 7, GSN , GIN-AK+ [ref]27, and CIN . For KP-GNN, we choose KP-GIN+ and KP-GIN′. The results of the QM9 dataset are shown in Table 4. We can see KP-GNN achieves SOTA performance on most of the targets. The results of the ZINC dataset are shown in Table 5. Although KP-GNN does not achieve the best result, it is still comparable to other methods. Running time comparison: In this section, we compare the running time of KP-GNN to 1-hop message passing GNN and K𝐾K-hop message passing GNN. We use GIN [ref]7 as the base model. We also include the KP-GIN+. All models use the same number of layers and hidden dimensions for a fair comparison. The results are shown in Table 6. We set K=4𝐾4K=4 for all datasets. We can see the computational overhead is almost linear to K𝐾K. This is reasonable as practical graphs are sparse and the number of K𝐾K-hop neighbors is far less than n𝑛n when using a small K𝐾K.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: we pick 1) Graph property regression (connectedness, diameter, radius) and node property regression (single source shortest path, eccentricity, Laplacian feature) task on random graph dataset [ref]41. 2) Graph substructure counting (triangle, tailed triangle, star, and 4-cycle) tasks on random graph dataset .
