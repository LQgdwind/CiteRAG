      "content": "Paper Title: DisCo-CLIP: A Distributed Contrastive Loss for Memory Efficient CLIP Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVision-language representation learning from massive image-text pairs has recently attracted tremendous attention for its great potential in many applications such as zero-shot classification and text-image retrieval. Representative works include CLIP [ref]27, ALIGN , Florence [ref]47, CoCa , and BASIC [ref]26, which all leverage hundreds of millions or even billions of image-text pairs collected from the Web to learn a semantic-rich and language-aligned visual representation . As the web-collected data inevitably contain noises, CLIP [ref]27 for the first time applies contrastive learning on 400M image-text pairs, which implies a weak but more proper assumption about the data: the relevance between paired image and text is greater than that between unpaired image and text. For its demonstrated performance in CLIP, contrastive learning has been widely adopted in subsequent works. Accordingly, several image-text data sets with increasingly larger scales have also been developed and made publicly available, such as Conceptual 12M , YFCC 100M 8, WIT 37.6M 7, LAION-400M 5, and LAION-5B 4. The goal of contrastive learning in CLIP is to learn an alignment between image and text via two encoders. That is, it encourages paired image and text (called a positive pair) to be similar and meanwhile enforces unpaired image and text (called a negative pair) to be dissimilar. For any positive image-text pair, as there are normally unlimited number (up to the total number of images or texts in a data set) of negative image-text pairs, it is crucial to include a sufficiently large number of negative pairs in a contrastive loss to make the representation learning effective, as validated in all related works such as CLIP [ref]27, Florence [ref]47, OpenCLIP , and BASIC [ref]26. Specifically, BASIC shows that larger batch size, plus larger data set and larger model,\ntheoretically lead to a better generalization performance. However, a fundamental technical challenge in training a CLIP-like model is how to enlarge its batch size under the constraint of limited GPU memory. For instance, when the batch size is 65,536, the similarity matrix for all image-text pairs in the batch will cost about 16GB using Float32.\nAs the backbone part also consumes a significant portion of GPU memory, especially for large backbones such as ViT-Large or ViT-Huge , scaling up batch size presents a great challenge, usually requiring hundreds of V100 or A100 GPUs [ref]27 [ref]47 , which are inaccessible for most research scientists. In this work, we develop a distributed solution called DisCo-CLIP for constrastive loss computation, which can save a large amount of memory for contrastive loss and make CLIP training more memory-efficient. Our method starts from a decomposition of the original contrastive loss. Based on this decomposition, we divide the contrastive loss into two parts, one to calculate the intra-GPU loss and gradients, and the other one to calculate the inter-GPU loss and gradients. For a mini-batch on the n𝑛n-th GPU (hereinafter called its hosting GPU), its intra-GPU gradients are calculated on its hosting GPU, and its inter-GPU gradients are collected from other GPUs. DisCo is an exact solution, mathematically equivalent to the original non-distributed contrastive loss, but more memory- and computation-efficient.\nIt can decrease the memory cost of contrastive loss from 𝒪​(B2)𝒪superscript𝐵2\\mathcal{O}(B^{2}) to 𝒪​(B2N)𝒪superscript𝐵2𝑁\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{B^{2}}{N}), where B𝐵B and N𝑁N are the batch size and the number of GPUs. When N𝑁N equals to 64, it means around 97% (see Sec. 4.1 for details) of the memory, and similarly the computational cost, in contrastive loss can be saved. Thus, using DisCo in CLIP, we can enable contrastive training with a larger batch size. Using 8 Nvidia A100 40GB GPUs, DisCo-CLIP can enable contrastive training of a ViT-B/32 model with a batch size of 32,768. Using 64 A100 40GB GPUs, DisCo-CLIP can train the same model with a larger batch size of 196K. We summarize our contributions in twofold. We propose a novel distributed contrastive loss solution called DisCo for memory efficient CLIP training, which can significantly reduce the memory consumption of the contrastive loss computation. Such a solution enables a larger batch size for contrastive training using the same computing resource without sacrificing any computation accuracy. We further validate that training with a larger batch size can further improve the performance of contrastive learning models.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: image-text pairs has recently attracted tremendous attention for its great potential in many applications such as zero-shot classification and text-image retrieval.
