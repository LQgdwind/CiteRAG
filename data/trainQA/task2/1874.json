      "content": "Paper Title: Image Manipulation Detection by Multi-View Multi-Scale Supervision\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets. For the ease of a head-to-head comparison with the state-of-the-art, we adopt CASIAv2  for training and COVER , Columbia , NIST16  and CASIAv1  for testing. Meanwhile, we notice DEFACTO [ref]19, a recently released large-scale dataset, containing 149k images sampled from MS-COCO [ref]17 and auto-manipulated by copy-move, splicing and inpainting. Considering the challenging nature of DEFACTO, we choose to perform our ablation study on this new set. As the set has no authentic images, we construct a training set termed DEFACTO-84k, by randomly sampling 64k positive images from DEFACTO and 20k negative images from MS-COCO. In a similar manner, we build a test set termed DEFACTO-12k, by randomly sampling 6k positive images from the remaining part of DEFACTO and 6k negatives from MS-COCO. Note that to avoid any data leakage, for manipulated images used for training (test), their source images are not included in the test (training) set. In total, our experiments use two training sets and five test sets, see Table 2. Evaluation Criteria.\nFor pixel-level manipulation detection, following previous works   , we compute pixel-level precision and recall, and report their F1. For image-level manipulation detection, in order to measure the miss detection rate and false alarm rate, we report sensitivity, specificity and their F1. AUC, as a decision-threshold-free metric, is also reported.\nAuthentic images per test set are only used for image-level evaluation. For both pixel-level and image-level F1 computation, the default threshold is 0.50.50.5, unless otherwise stated. The overall performance is measured by Com-F1, defined as the harmonic mean of pixel-level and image-level F1. Com-F1 is sensitive to the lowest value of pixel-F1 and image-F1. In\nparticular, it scores 0 when either pixel-F1 or image-F1 is 0, which does not hold for the arithmetic mean. Implementation. MVSS-Net¬†is implemented in PyTorch and trained on an NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. The input size is 512√ó512512512512\\times 512. The two ResNet-50 used in ESB and NSB are initialized with ImageNet-pretrained counterparts. We use an Adam  optimizer with a learning rate periodically decays from 10‚àí4superscript10410^{-4} to 10‚àí7superscript10710^{-7}. We set the two weights in the combined loss as Œ±=0.16ùõº0.16\\alpha=0.16 and Œ≤=0.04ùõΩ0.04\\beta=0.04, according to the model performance on a held-out validation set from DEFACTO.\nWe apply regular data augmentation for training, including flipping, blurring, compression and naive manipulations either by cropping and pasting a squared area or using built-in OpenCV inpainting functions [ref]22 .\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: Datasets.
