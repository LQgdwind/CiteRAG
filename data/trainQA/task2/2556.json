      "content": "Paper Title: Towards real-world navigation with deep differentiable planners\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince the learnable functions (P^^𝑃\\widehat{P}, A^^𝐴\\widehat{A} and R^^𝑅\\widehat{R}) in our proposed method (and other VIN-based methods) are 2D CNNs, their natural input is a 2D grid of m𝑚m-dimensional embeddings, denoted et​i​j∈ℝmsubscript𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑗superscriptℝ𝑚e_{tij}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m}, for time t𝑡t and discrete world-space coordinates (i,j)𝑖𝑗(i,j). This can be interpreted as a spatio-temporal map tensor. We then wish to project and aggregate useful semantic information from an image Itsubscript𝐼𝑡I_{t}, extracted by a CNN ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi, into this tensor. This requires both knowledge of the camera position ctsubscript𝑐𝑡c_{t} and rotation matrix Rtsubscript𝑅𝑡R_{t}, which we assume following previous work [ref]13 [ref]27  (and which can be estimated from monocular vision ). Spatial projection also requires knowing (or estimating) the depths dt​(p)subscript𝑑𝑡𝑝d_{t}(p) of each pixel p𝑝p in Itsubscript𝐼𝑡I_{t} (either with a RGBD camera as in our experiments, or monocular depth estimation ). We can then write the homogenous 3D coordinates of each pixel p𝑝p in the absolute reference frame using projective geometry [ref]17: where K𝐾K is the camera’s intrinsics matrix. Given these absolute coordinates of pixel p𝑝p, we can calculate the closest map embedding et​i​jsubscript𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑗e_{tij} to it, and thus aggregate the CNN embeddings ϕ​(It)italic-ϕsubscript𝐼𝑡\\phi\\left(I_{t}\\right) associated with all pixels close to a map cell. Inspired by PointNet , we choose mean-pooling for aggregation. Since we have spatial aggregation, we can easily extend this framework to work spatio-temporally, aggregating information from past frames t′≤tsuperscript𝑡′𝑡t^{\\prime}\\leq t. More formally: where τ𝜏\\tau is the absolute size of each square grid cell,\navg averages the elements of a set,\nand ϕp​(It′)subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑝subscript𝐼superscript𝑡′\\phi_{p}\\left(I_{t^{\\prime}}\\right) retrieves the CNN embedding of image It′subscript𝐼superscript𝑡′I_{t^{\\prime}} for pixel p𝑝p. Due to the similarity between Eq. 10 and a PointNet embedded on a 2D lattice, we named it Lattice PointNet (LPN). Other than the lattice embedding, there are other major differences from the PointNet: we apply it spatio-temporally with a causal constraint (t′≤tsuperscript𝑡′𝑡t^{\\prime}\\leq t), and the downstream predictors that take it as input (P^​(et)^𝑃subscript𝑒𝑡\\widehat{P}(e_{t}), A^​(et)^𝐴subscript𝑒𝑡\\widehat{A}(e_{t}) and R^​(et)^𝑅subscript𝑒𝑡\\widehat{R}(e_{t})) are 2D CNNs that can reason spatially in the lattice, as opposed to the PointNet’s unstructured multi-layer perceptrons . A related proposal for SLAM used spatial max-pooling but more complex LSTMs/GRUs for temporal aggregation  . Another related work on end-to-end trainable spatial embeddings uses egospherical memory .\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: by a CNN ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi, into this tensor.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
