      "content": "Paper Title: Curvature Graph Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph Neural Network. We can classify graph neural networks into two categories: spectral GNNs and spatial GNNs . Spectral GNNs define convolution through the eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian matrix in the Fourier domain. Bruna et al. explored the generalization of CNNs to graph-structured data by the decomposition of the graph Laplacian matrix [ref]26. Although the matrix decomposition requires lots of computational resources, it does not filter the local information. This work attempts to reduce computation and make convolution spatially localized through a Graph Estimation procedure . Defferrard et al. approximate convolution with truncated Chebyshev polynomials, avoiding the computation of the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix . Kipf et al. proposed Graph Convolution Network (GCN) , which further simplifies convolution by setting the order of the truncated Chebyshev polynomials to 1 and a renormalization trick. GCN can still be simplified to a linear model [ref]16 through successively removing nonlinear activation function and collapsing weight matrices between consecutive layers, which fits large-scale datasets and improves interpretability. Since the spectrum is inherently graph-specific, a serious problem for spectral GNNs is that the trained model cannot be generalized to other datasets. Spatial GNNs directly define convolution on the local structure of the graph to improve the generalization. The key of Spatial GNNs is how to handle neighbors of different sizes and maintain the local invariance of convolution. A straightforward idea is to use different weight matrices for neighbors with different degrees [ref]11, but this approach cannot be applied to large-scale graphs with rich node degrees. Monti et al. proposed MoNet , which directly generalizes CNNs to graphs and can automatically extract local, stationary, and compositional node representations. And some work   exploited Gate mechanisms such as GRU  and LSTM  to improve the ability to capture long-range structural information. To aggregate the features of neighbors, Hamilton et al. proposed GraphSAGE , which introduced a fixed-size neighbor sampling method and three different ways to aggregate neighbors. GAT  introduced a self-attention mechanism into GNNs that implicitly assigns weights to neighbors. CurvGN  used the Ricci curvature as additional structural knowledge and implicitly assigned specific weights to channels of neighboring node features by MLP. Recently, some work has attempted to map node features from Euclidean space into hyperbolic space , spherical space , and constant curvature space , in order to adapt to complex and variable real-world datasets. Inspired by self-supervised learning, there has also been a great deal of interest in how to facilitate GNNs through diverse and valuable graph information    . Discrete Ricci Curvature. The Ricci curvature is defined on the manifold through the geodesics, so it can be generalized to the discrete setting. Many works have been devoted to extending the Ricci curvature on graphs, such as the Ollivier’s Ricci curvature based on optimal transport theory   and the Forman curvature based on the graph Laplacian . Forman curvature is widely used in large-scale network analysis  and image processing . The Ollivier’s Ricci curvature precisely measures the sparsity/denseness of connections on local structure, it is widely applied to detecting network backbone and congestion  , studying financial market fragility , and detecting the community structure of network  . Although Ollivier’s Ricci curvature is harder to compute, it is more geometric than the Forman curvature. Therefore, we select the Ollivier’s Ricci curvature as the advanced graph information to improve the adaptive locality ability of GNN. Ni et al. systematically compares and analyzes the difference between these two types of Ricci curvature . Note that CurvGN has introduced Ricci curvature into GNNs, but the way it is introduced erases the unique property of the Ricci curvature, and is completely different from ours.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian matrix in the Fourier domain.
