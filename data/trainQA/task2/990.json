      "content": "Paper Title: Adaptive Aggregation Networks for Class-Incremental Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAI systems are expected to work in an incremental manner when the amount of knowledge increases over time. They should be capable of learning new concepts while maintaining the ability to recognize previous ones.\nHowever, deep-neural-network-based systems often suffer from serious forgetting problems (called “catastrophic forgetting”) when they are continuously updated using new coming data. This is due to two facts: (i) the updates can override the knowledge acquired from the previous data     , and (ii) the model can not replay the entire previous data to regain the old knowledge. To encourage solving these problems, [ref]34 defined a class-incremental learning (CIL) protocol for image classification where the training data of different classes gradually come phase-by-phase.\nIn each phase, the classifier is re-trained on new class data, and then evaluated on the test data of both old and new classes.\nTo prevent trivial algorithms such as storing all old data for replaying,\nthere is a strict memory budget due to which a tiny set of exemplars of old classes can be saved in the memory.\nThis memory constraint causes a serious data imbalance problem between old and new classes, and indirectly causes the main problem of CIL – the stability-plasticity dilemma .\nIn particular, higher plasticity results in the forgetting of old classes ,\nwhile higher stability weakens the model from learning the data of new classes (that contain a large number of samples).\nExisting CIL works try to balance stability and plasticity using data strategies. For example, as illustrated in Figure 1 (a) and (b), some early methods train their models on the imbalanced dataset where there is only a small set of exemplars for old classes [ref]34 , and recent methods include a fine-tuning step using a balanced subset of exemplars sampled from all classes   [ref]11.\nHowever, these data strategies are still limited in terms of effectiveness.\nFor example, when using the models trained after 252525 phases, LUCIR  and Mnemonics [ref]25 “forget” the initial 505050 classes by 30%percent3030\\% and 20%percent2020\\%, respectively, on the ImageNet dataset . In this paper, we address the stability-plasticity dilemma by introducing a novel network architecture called Adaptive Aggregation Networks (AANets). Taking the ResNet  as an example of baseline architectures, we explicitly build two residual blocks (at each residual level) in AANets: one for maintaining the knowledge of old classes (i.e., the stability) and the other for learning new classes (i.e., the plasticity), as shown in Figure 1 (c).\nWe achieve these by allowing these two blocks to have different levels of learnability, i.e., less learnable parameters in the stable block but more in the plastic one.\nWe apply aggregation weights to the output feature maps of these blocks, sum them up, and pass the result maps to the next residual level.\nIn this way, we are able to dynamically balance the usage of these blocks by updating their aggregation weights. To achieve auto-updating, we take the weights as hyperparameters and optimize them in an end-to-end manner  8 [ref]25. Technically,\nthe overall optimization of AANets is bilevel. Level-1 is to learn the network parameters for two types of residual blocks, and level-2 is to adapt their aggregation weights.\nMore specifically, level-1 is the standard optimization of network parameters, for which we use all the data available in the phase.\nLevel-2 aims to balance the usage of the two types of blocks, for which we optimize the aggregation weights using a balanced subset (by downsampling the data of new classes), as illustrated in Figure 1 (c).\nWe formulate these two levels in a bilevel optimization program (BOP) 1 that solves two optimization problems alternatively, i.e., update network parameters with aggregation weights fixed, and then switch.\nFor evaluation, we conduct CIL experiments on three widely-used benchmarks, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet. We find that many existing CIL methods, e.g., iCaRL [ref]34, LUCIR , Mnemonics Training [ref]25, and PODNet [ref]11, can be directly incorporated in the architecture of AANets, yielding consistent performance improvements. We observe that a straightforward plug-in causes memory overheads, e.g., 26%percent2626\\% and 15%percent1515\\% respectively for CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-Subset. For a fair comparison, we conduct additional experiments under the settings of zero overhead (e.g., by reducing the number of old exemplars for training AANets), and validate that our approach still achieves top performance across all datasets. Our contribution is three-fold:\n1) a novel and generic network architecture called AANets specially designed for tackling the stability-plasticity dilemma in CIL tasks;\n2) a BOP-based formulation and an end-to-end training solution for optimizing AANets;\nand 3) extensive experiments on three CIL benchmarks by incorporating four baseline methods in the architecture of AANets.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: updates can override the knowledge acquired from the previous data     , and (ii) the model can not replay the entire previous data to regain the old knowledge.
