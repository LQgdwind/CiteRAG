      "content": "Paper Title: Unconditional proofs of quantumness between small-space machines\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIt is hoped that sufficiently advanced quantum computers will be able to solve problems that are impossible for classical computers employing comparable amounts of resources. This brings up interesting questions about how such a claim of “quantum advantage” can be verified by a classical machine: How can a device check the correctness of a claimed solution for a problem that is too difficult for it to solve on its own? Furthermore, even if the “weak” device can verify that the problem has been solved correctly, is this sufficient to conclude that the “strong” device is indeed a quantum computer, rather than a classical one implementing a fast algorithm unknown to the verifying party? All approaches to providing “proofs of quantumness” listed by Brakerski et al. \ndepend on unproven assumptions about a particular task being difficult for computational machines of a particular model. As an example, in one such approach, a “strong” computer can factorize a given composite number, the verifier can quickly check that the factors are correct, and then “conclude” that it is faced with a computer that has run an efficient quantum algorithm like ,\nbased on the belief that polynomial/time factorization is impossible for classical machines. More recently, Zhan  and Girish et al. \nhave focused on proofs between logarithmic/space bounded machines. They have shown that, for any language in the class 𝖡𝖰𝖫𝖡𝖰𝖫\\mathsf{BQL}, such a quantum machine can prove its work (on deciding about the membership of the common input string in the language) to a classical logspace verifier by transmitting a “proof string” of polynomial length. Considered as a framework for proofs of quantumness, this approach is also based on the (as yet unproven) assumption that 𝖡𝖰𝖫𝖡𝖰𝖫\\mathsf{BQL} is a proper superset of 𝖡𝖯𝖫𝖡𝖯𝖫\\mathsf{BPL}, the corresponding class for classical logspace machines. In this paper, we present the first framework for proofs of quantumness where the conclusion of the verifier is not conditional on an unproven presupposition about a weakness of a family of machines, by studying the case where both interacting computers have drastically small (o​(log⁡log⁡n)𝑜𝑛\\mathit{o}\\left\\lparen\\log\\log n\\right\\rparen) memory budgets. It is known   that certain separation problems are impossible for\nprobabilistic Turing machines (ptmptm\\mathrm{ptm}’s) using o​(log⁡log⁡n)𝑜𝑛\\mathit{o}\\left\\lparen\\log\\log n\\right\\rparen space, even if they are allowed to employ uncomputable numbers as their transition probabilities. On the other hand,\ntwo/way finite automata with quantum and classical states (2​q​c​f​a2qcfa\\mathrm{2qcfa}’s), which are, essentially, constant/space Turing machines which have been augmented with a fixed/size quantum register, are known [ref]1  0 \nto be able to perform some language recognition tasks that are beyond the capabilities of classical small-space machines. We combine these facts with techniques stemming from the study of interactive proof systems with finite/state verifiers  2    and quantum finite automata   to construct setups where a polynomial/time interaction between the two space/bounded automata ends with the verifier accepting with very high probability only if it is faced with a genuinely quantum machine obeying the communication protocol. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the building blocks to be used to construct our framework. The small/space Turing machine models that represent the classical and quantum computers which take part in the tests of quantumness are defined. We allow our classical machines to use the largest realistic set of transition probabilities, namely, computable reals between 00 and 111, and naturally impose the same computability restriction on the transition amplitudes of the quantum machines.111The 2​q​c​f​a2qcfa\\mathrm{2qcfa} algorithms we will use are known [ref]1 to rely on the highly precise manipulation of a small number of qubits. This requirement is mitigated by our imposition of polynomial limits on their runtimes, noting that a polynomial/time quantum computation can be carried out within constant accuracy if the transition amplitudes are specified to logarithmically many bits of precision . Our definitions allow the descriptions of classical machines that take part in our protocols to specify transition probabilities with the same precision as the quantum ones.\nA list of tasks that are known or presumed to be difficult for small/space ptmptm\\mathrm{ptm}’s, but are solvable by 2​q​c​f​a2qcfa\\mathrm{2qcfa} algorithms, is given in Section 2.1. Section 2.2 describes how we pair a classical verifier with a (quantum or classical) “prover” in our protocols, and presents a method by which a constant/space prover can convince a similarly bounded verifier about the membership of their common input string in any language recognized by two/way deterministic two/head finite automata possessing a property that we define. To our knowledge, this is the first step in the characterization of the power of interactive proof systems with such severely constrained provers. We give a formal definition of what we mean by “checking a proof of quantumness” in Section 3. Intuitively, one describes a verifier V𝑉V which accepts with high probability if it is faced with a genuinely quantum prover PQsuperscript𝑃𝑄P^{Q} that can convince V𝑉V that it is able to solve any given instance of a computational problem 𝐏𝐏\\mathbf{P}, and every classical prover PCsuperscript𝑃𝐶P^{C} that attempts to convince V𝑉V is guaranteed to be less successful than PQsuperscript𝑃𝑄P^{Q} on an infinite set of common input strings WPCsubscript𝑊superscript𝑃𝐶W_{P^{C}}. Constructing such a verifier therefore requires identifying a problem 𝐏𝐏\\mathbf{P} that has the following properties: 𝐏𝐏\\mathbf{P} should be solvable for a polynomial/time qtmqtm\\mathrm{qtm}. 𝐏𝐏\\mathbf{P} should be provably impossible to solve for a ptmptm\\mathrm{ptm} within the same time and space bounds. The solution of each instance of 𝐏𝐏\\mathbf{P} should be “provable” by a qtmqtm\\mathrm{qtm} to a ptmptm\\mathrm{ptm}, both operating within the same time and space bounds, through a polynomial/time interaction where only classical messages are exchanged. As noted above, we are able to identify problems that satisfy all these properties where the common space bound is very small. In Section 4, we present a specific family of such problems and describe a template for proof/of/quantumness protocols for each member of that family. In Section 5, we give another protocol based on a problem that seems to be beyond the capability of the provers described in Section 4. That verifier, which employs a version of Freivalds’ celebrated (exponential/time) probabilistic finite/state algorithm  for recognizing a nonregular language, can be considered to be checking a proof of quantumness on the condition that the underlying problem is classically difficult. Section 6 lists several remaining open questions. The Appendix presents a generalization of a theorem by Dwork and Stockmeyer  that may provide a starting point for future proof/of/quantumness protocols.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: with quantum and classical states (2​q​c​f​a2qcfa\\mathrm{2qcfa}’s), which are, essentially, constant/space Turing machines which have been augmented with a fixed/size quantum register, are known [ref]1  0 \nto be able to perform some language recognition tasks that are beyond the capabilities of classical small-space machines.
