      "content": "Paper Title: LaRa: Latents and Rays for Multi-Camera Bird’s-Eye-View Semantic Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nModels for BEV segmentation are typically structured in two parts. They first extract features of each camera and then project them into a common top-view grid, called the\nbird’s-eye-view. There are different strategies for this projection, which can be grouped into the following categories. IPM-based.\nInverse perspective mapping (IPM) defines the correspondence between the camera and the ground planes as a homography matrix.\nIPM makes strong assumptions that the world is planar and\nthe cameras’ horizontal axes are parallel to the ground.\nEarly works\n  \napply it directly to raw camera pixels or features.\nThis approach suffers from blurring and stretching artifacts for distant objects (as they have fewer pixels in the camera view) and objects with a height (as they violate the planar world assumption).\nTo alleviate these shortcomings, a generative adversarial network  or training a BEV decoder with synthetic ground-truth  has been used to refine the IPM projection. ‘Lift-splat’-based: guiding with depth.\nUsing depth information to lift features from 2D to 3D and then ‘splatting’ them in BEV space recently gained popularity for its effectiveness and sound geometric definition.\nAmong the formulations of depth estimation for BEV projection   [ref]5 1 2, estimating depth probabilities along camera rays appears to perform the best  [ref]5.\nHowever, such a strategy, depth being the most influential factor 3, is subject to compounding errors.\nInaccuracies in depth prediction will propagate into the BEV features, which themselves can be erroneous. Implicitly learned with dense networks.\nAn alternative to explicit geometric projection is to learn the mapping from data.\nFor instance, VPN 4 uses an MLP to make a dense correspondence between pixels in the camera views and BEV.\nThese methods rely on such expensive operations and do not use readily available spatial information given by the calibrated camera rig capturing the images.\nThe BEV projection\nmust be entirely learned, and as it is determined by training data, it can hardly apply to new settings with slightly different camera calibrations.\nAlternatively, PON [ref]16 builds on the observation that a column in the camera image contains all the information of the corresponding ray in BEV: it first encodes each column into a feature vector, which is then decoded into a ray along the depth dimension.\nHowever this relies on two implicit assumptions: (i) the camera follows a pinhole projective model, and (ii) it is horizontally aligned with the ground plane. Implicitly learned with transformer architectures.\nThe attention system at the core of transformer architectures 5 6 7 8 allows learning of long-range dependencies and correspondences explicitly. These architectures have recently been employed for the BEV semantic segmentation task, yielding among the best-performing methods  9 .\nNonetheless, a direct cross-attention 5 between camera images and the BEV grid is computationally\nexpensive.\nBEVFormer 9 alleviates this issue by only cross-attending BEV pixels with cameras in which the BEV pixel is visible and by replacing the heavier multi-head attention 5 with deformable attention .\nCVT  keeps the vanilla multi-head cross-attention 5 but applies it between low-resolution camera feature maps and a small BEV grid which is then upsampled to reach the final resolution.\nGitNet  restrains the cross-attentions to column-ray pairs making the same original implicit assumptions as PON [ref]16.\nOur proposed model LaRa belongs to this category as it learns the BEV representation with a transformer architecture. On the other hand, our attention scheme does not impose strong geometric assumptions while still being efficient enough to attend to a full-resolution BEV grid.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: from 2D to 3D and then ‘splatting’ them in BEV space recently gained popularity for its effectiveness and sound geometric definition.\nAmong the formulations of depth estimation for BEV projection   [ref]5 1 2, estimating depth probabilities along camera rays appears to perform the best  [ref]5.\nHowever, such a strategy, depth being the most influential factor 3, is subject to compounding\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
