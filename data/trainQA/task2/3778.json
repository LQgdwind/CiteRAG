      "content": "Paper Title: Controllable Video Generation through Global and Local Motion Dynamics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate GLASS on 3 datasets. For synthetic data we use W-Sprites. For real data we use: 1) the Tennis Dataset and 2) the BAIR Robot Pushing Dataset. The Tennis Dataset was introduced in  and contains around 900900900 videos extracted from 222 Tennis matches from YouTube at 96×2569625696\\times 256 pixel resolution. The videos are cropped to contain only one half of the court, so that only one player is visible. The BAIR Robot Pushing Dataset  contains around 44K clips of a robot arm pushing toys on a flat square table at 256×256256256256\\times 256 pixel resolution.\nBaselines.\nWe compare to CADDY , since it allows frame-level playable control, and to Huang et al. [ref]22. However, we do not explicitly compare to the non-parametric control model [ref]22, since it requires a prior knowledge of the future agent masks and also it lacks the ability to control the agent through discrete actions (playability).\nWe also report the metrics on other conditional video generation models such as MoCoGAN [ref]41, SAVP [ref]29 and their large scale versions from .\nQuantitative analysis.\nFollowing  we evaluate GLASS on the video reconstruction task. Given a test video, we use GMA to predict the global shifts and LMA to estimate the discrete actions performed along the video. Further, the agent is segmented using the masking network and the foreground is animated and pasted back to the shifted background using both global and local actions to reconstruct the whole sequence from the first frame.\nWe report FID, FVD and LPIPS scores on the generated videos. On the Tennis dataset we additionally report the Average Detection Distance (ADD) and the Missing Detection Rate (MDR) suggested in . Those metrics are supposed to assess the action space quality by detecting the tennis player with a pretrained human detector and by comparing the locations of the detected agents in the ground truth and generated sequences. On BAIR (see Table 4) our model performs almost 40% better in terms of frame-level quality, but lacks in FVD compared to [ref]22. However, it is still slightly better than CADDY. On the Tennis dataset (see Table 5) GLASS is around 50% better than the closest competitor in LPIPS, almost 30% better in FID, but loses in FVD. However, GLASS provides finer control over the agent according to ADD and MDR.\nQualitative analysis.\nA trained GLASS allows a detailed control of the agent. On W-Sprites, we find that the LMA discovers such actions as turn right, turn left, turn front, spellcast and slash. Note that despite the difference between the discovered set of actions and the ground truth, all videos in the training set can be generated with this reduced set of actions\n(see Fig. 6). On Tennis we found that the local actions mostly correspond to some leg movements. On BAIR the LMA component discovers some small local deformations such as the state of the manipulator (closed or open). In Fig. 7, we provide visual examples of the GLASS global action space. Given two different starting foregrounds from the BAIR and Tennis datasets (shown in the green channel), we show the generated foregrounds (in the red channel) after applying the right, left, down, up and no motion global shifts.\nWe can also see that global actions apply consistently across different initial foregrounds. To show that the learned action space is consistent across different agents also in their fine-grained dynamics we use GLASS to transfer (both global and local) motion from one video to another. We first extract the sequence of actions in the first video using the GMA and LMA components of GLASS and then sequentially apply these actions to the first frame of the second video. In Fig. 5, we demonstrate it on the Tennis dataset. Finally, in Fig. 8 we provide some sample outputs from our GMA module on test images from all three datasets. Given an input image, we can see that the segmentation network learns to extract accurate masks with which one can obtain high quality foreground images. These are necessary to model local dynamics. The inpainting of the background is sufficiently accurate to separate the two layers. For more visual examples, please see the supplementary material.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: of a robot arm pushing toys on a flat square table at 256×256256256256\\times 256 pixel resolution.\nBaselines.\nWe compare to CADDY , since it allows frame-level playable control, and to Huang et al. [ref]22.
