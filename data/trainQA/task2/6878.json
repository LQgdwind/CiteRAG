Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

ESPCN. We replace the sub-pixel convolution with a nearest neighbor resize convolution (NNRC), which has been shown to reduce checkerboard artifacts during training  and can be efficiently executed during inference [ref]8.\nAll other layer configurations remain the same as proposed in [ref]39.\nWe use the Adam optimizer  to fine-tune all models for 100 epochs in batches of 16 images using a weight decay of 1e-4.\nWe use an initial learning rate of 1e-4 that is reduced by a factor of 0.98 every epoch. UNet. We use only 3 encoders and decoders to create a smaller architecture than originally proposed by [ref]36.\nWe replace transposed convolutions with NNRCs, which are known to be functionally equivalent during inference [ref]8, but have more favorable behavior during training .\nWe replace all concatenations with additions and reduce the input channels accordingly.\nWe use the Adam optimizer to fine-tune all models for 200 epochs in batches of 16 using a weight decay of 1e-4.\nWe use an initial learning rate of 1e-3 that is reduced by a factor of 0.3 every 50 epochs.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: We train ESPCN [ref]39 and UNet [ref]36 to upscale single images by a factor of 3x using the BSD300 dataset .\nAgain, we closely follow the network architectures originally proposed by the respective authors, but\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
