      "content": "Paper Title: Information-theoretic regularization for Multi-source Domain Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlthough a large number of studies have demonstrated the ability of deep learning to solve challenging tasks, the problems are mostly confined to a similar type or a single domain. One remaining challenge is the problem known as domain shift [ref]16, where a direct transfer of information gleaned from a single source domain to unseen target domains may lead to significant performance impairment. Domain adaptation (DA) approaches aim to mitigate this problem by learning to map data of both domains onto a common feature space. Whereas several theoretical results   and algorithms for DA    have focused on the case in which only a single-source domain dataset is given, we consider a more challenging and generalized problem of knowledge transfer, referred to as Multi-source unsupervised DA (MDA). Following a seminal theoretical result on MDA , many deep MDA approaches have been proposed, mainly depend on the adversarial framework. Most of existing adversarial MDA works [ref]54      have focused on approximating all combinations of pairwise domain discrepancy between each source and the target, which inevitably necessitates training of multiple binary domain discriminators. While substantial technical advances have been made in this regard, the pitfalls of using multiple domain discriminators have not been fully studied. This paper focuses on the potential adverse effects of using multiple domain discriminators on MDA in terms of both quantity and quality. First, the domain-discriminative information is inevitably distributed across multiple discriminators. For example, such discriminators primarily focus on domain shift between each source and the target, while the discrepancies between the source domains are neglected. Moreover, the multiple source-target discriminator setting often makes it difficult to approximate the combined ‚Ñã‚Ñã\\mathcal{H}-divergence between mixture of sources and the target domain because each discriminator is deemed to utilize the samples only from the corresponding source and target domain as inputs. Compared to a bound using combined divergence, a bound based on pairwise divergence is not sufficiently flexible to accommodate domain structures . Second, the computational load of the multiple domain discriminator setting rapidly increases with the number of source domains (ùí™‚Äã(N)ùí™ùëÅ\\mathcal{O}(N)), which significantly limits scalability. Third, it could undermine the stability of training, as earlier works solve multiple adversarial min-max problems. To overcome such limitations, instead of relying on multiple pairwise domain discrepancy, we constrain the mutual information between latent representations and domain labels. The contribution of this study is summarized as follows. First, we show that such mutual information regularization is closely related to the explicit optimization of the ‚Ñã‚Ñã\\cal{H}-divergence between the source and target domains. This affords the theoretical insight that the conventional adversarial DA can be translated into an information-theoretic regularization problem. Second, from these theoretical findings we derive a new optimization problem for MDA: minimizing adversarial loss over multiple domains with a single domain discriminator. The algorithmic solution to this problem is called Multi-source Information regularized Adaptation Networks (MIAN). Third, we show that our single domain discriminator setting serves to penalize every pairwise combined domain discrepancy between the given domain and the mixture of the others. Moreover, by analyzing existing studies in terms of information regularization, we found another negative effect of the multiple discriminators setting: significant increase in the variance of the stochastic gradients. Despite its structural simplicity, we demonstrated that MIAN works efficiently across a wide variety of MDA scenarios, including the DIGITS-Five 7, Office-31 9, and Office-Home datasets . Intriguingly, MIAN reliably and significantly outperformed several state-of-the-art methods, including ones that employ a domain discriminator separately for each source domain [ref]54 and that align the moments of deep feature distribution for every pairwise domain 7.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: the ability of deep learning to solve challenging tasks, the problems are mostly confined to a similar type or a single domain.
