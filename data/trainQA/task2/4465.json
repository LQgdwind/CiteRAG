      "content": "Paper Title: Cross-Attention of Disentangled Modalities for 3D Human Mesh Recovery with Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n3D human pose and shape estimation models aim to estimate 3D coordinates of human body joints and mesh vertices.\nThese models can be deployed in a wide range of applications that require human behavior understanding, e.g., human motion analysis and human-computer interaction.\nTo utilize such models for practical use,\nmonocular methods  [ref]17  2  1    3  5 6 estimate the 3D joints and vertices without using 3D scanners or stereo cameras.\nThis task is essentially challenging due to complex human body articulation, and becomes more difficult by occlusions and depth ambiguity in monocular settings. To deal with such challenges, state-of-the-art methods 5 6 exploit non-local relations among human body joints and mesh vertices via transformer encoder architectures.\nThis leads to impressive improvements in accuracy by consuming a substantial number of parameters and expensive computations as trade-offs; efficiency is less taken into account,\nalthough it is crucial in practice. In this paper, we propose FastMETRO which employs a novel transformer encoder-decoder architecture for\n3D human pose and shape estimation from an input image.\nCompared with the transformer encoders 5 6, FastMETRO is more practical because it\nachieves competitive results with much fewer parameters and faster inference speed, as shown in Figure 1.\nOur architecture is motivated by the observation that the encoder-based methods overlook the importance of the token design which is a key-factor in accuracy and efficiency. The encoder-based transformers 5 6 share similar transformer encoder architectures.\nThey take K𝐾K joint and N𝑁N vertex tokens as input for the estimation of 3D human body joints and mesh vertices, where K𝐾K and N𝑁N denote the number of joints and vertices in a 3D human mesh, respectively.\nEach token is constructed by the concatenation of a global image feature vector 𝐱∈ℝC𝐱superscriptℝ𝐶\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{C}\nand 3D coordinates of a joint or vertex in the human mesh.\nThis results in the input tokens of dimension ℝ(K+N)×(C+3)superscriptℝ𝐾𝑁𝐶3\\mathbb{R}^{(K+N)\\times(C+3)} which are fed as input to the transformer encoders.111\nFor simplicity, we discuss the input tokens mainly based on METRO 5.\nMesh Graphormer 6 has subtle differences,\nbut the essence of the bottleneck is shared.\n\nThis token design introduces the same sources of the performance bottleneck: 1) spatial information is lost in the global image feature 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x}, and 2) the same image feature 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} is used in an overly-duplicated way.\nThe former is caused by the average pooling operation to obtain the global image feature 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x}.\nThe latter leads to considerable inefficiency, since expensive computations are required to process mostly duplicated information, where distinctively informative signals are only in 0.15%percent0.150.15\\% of the input tokens.222\n333-dimensional coordinates out of (C+3)𝐶3(C+3)-dimensional input tokens, where C=2048𝐶2048C=2048.\n\nFurthermore, the computational complexity of each transformer layer is quadratic as O​(L2​C+L​C2)𝑂superscript𝐿2𝐶𝐿superscript𝐶2O(L^{2}C+LC^{2}), where L≥K+N𝐿𝐾𝑁L\\geq K+N.\nOnce either L𝐿L or C𝐶C is dominantly larger, it results in unfavorable efficiency.\nBoth methods 5 6 are such undesirable cases. In contrast, our FastMETRO does not concatenate an image feature vector for the construction of input tokens.\nAs illustrated in Figure 2,\nwe disentangle the image encoding part and mesh estimation part via an encoder-decoder architecture.\nOur joint and vertex tokens focus on certain image regions through cross-attention modules in the transformer decoder.\nIn this way, the proposed method efficiently estimates the 3D coordinates of human body joints and mesh vertices from a 2D image.\nTo effectively capture non-local joint-vertex relations and local vertex-vertex relations,\nwe mask self-attentions of non-adjacent vertices according to the topology of human triangle mesh.\nTo avoid the redundancy caused by the spatial locality of human mesh vertices,\nwe perform coarse-to-fine mesh upsampling as in 3 5 6.\nBy leveraging the prior knowledge of human body’s morphological relationship,\nwe substantially reduce optimization difficulty.\nThis leads to faster convergence with higher accuracy. We present the proposed method with model-size variants by changing the number of transformer layers: FastMETRO-S, FastMETRO-M, FastMETRO-L.\nCompared with the encoder-based transformers 5 6,\nFastMETRO-S requires only about 9% of the parameters in the transformer architecture, but shows competitive results with much faster inference speed.\nIn addition, the large variant (FastMETRO-L) achieves the state of the art on the Human3.6M  and 3DPW  datasets among image-based methods, which also demands fewer parameters and shorter inference time compared with the encoder-based methods.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by conducting extensive experiments,\nand validate its generalizability by showing 3D hand mesh reconstruction results on the FreiHAND  dataset. Our contributions are summarized as follows: We propose FastMETRO which employs a novel transformer encoder-decoder architecture for 3D human mesh recovery from a single image.\nOur method resolves the performance bottleneck in the encoder-based transformers, and improves the Pareto-front of accuracy and efficiency. The proposed model converges much faster by reducing optimization difficulty.\nOur FastMETRO leverages the prior knowledge of human body’s morphological relationship,\ne.g., masking attentions\naccording to the human mesh topology. We present model-size variants of our FastMETRO.\nThe small variant shows competitive results\nwith much fewer parameters and faster inference speed.\nThe large variant clearly outperforms existing image-based methods on the Human3.6M and 3DPW datasets, which is also more lightweight and faster.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: in a wide range of applications that require human behavior understanding, e.g., human motion analysis and human-computer interaction.\nTo utilize such models for practical use,\nmonocular methods  [ref]17  2  1    3  5 6 estimate the 3D joints and vertices without using 3D scanners or stereo cameras.\nThis task is essentially challenging due to complex human body articulation, and becomes more\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
