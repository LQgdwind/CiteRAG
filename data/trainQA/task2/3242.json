      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey on Interpretable Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn RL, the usual approach to describe the task to be learned or performed by an agent consists in defining suitable rewards, which is often a hard problem to solve for the system designer.\nThe difficulty of reward specification has been recognized early .\nIndeed, careless reward engineering can lead to undesired learned behavior  and to value misalignment .\nDifferent approaches have been proposed to circumvent or tackle this difficulty:\nimitation learning (or behavior cloning)  , inverse reinforcement learning  ,\nlearning from human advice  , or\npreference elicitation  .\nTable 5 summarizes the related work for interpretable preference models.\nAs a side note, some of the previous approaches for learning a transition model apply here as well (e.g., ). Closer to interpretable RL,  extends inverse RL to relational RL, while\n learns from demonstrations in relational domains by active learning.\nIn , more interpretable rewards are learned using deep decision trees [ref]164. Recent work has started to investigate the use of temporal logic (or variants) to specify an RL task [ref]154 [ref]155  .\nRelated to this direction,  investigates the problem of learning from demonstration\nan interpretable description of an RL task under the form of linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications. Another related work  proposes to specify and represent a reward function as a finite-state machine, called reward machine, which clarifies the reward function structure.\nReward machines can be specified using inputs in a formal language, such as linear temporal logic  .\nReward machines can also be learned by local search  or with various automata learning techniques  . Using a different approach,  shows how a Boolean task algebra, if such structure holds for a problem, can be exploited to generate solutions for new tasks by task composition .\nSuch approach can arguably provide interpretability of the solutions thus obtained.\n\nReference markers found: [164]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]164: RL,  extends inverse RL to relational RL, while\n learns from demonstrations in relational domains by active learning.\nIn , more interpretable rewards are learned using deep decision trees [ref]164. Recent work has started to investigate the use of temporal logic (or variants) to specify an RL task [ref]154 [ref]155  .\nRelated to this direction,  investigates the problem of learning\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
