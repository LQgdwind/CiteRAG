      "content": "Paper Title: Is FFT Fast Enough for Beyond 5G Communications? A Throughput- Complexity Analysis for OFDM Signals\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDFT algorithms face two particular issues in the context multicarrier\nwaveforms such as OFDM. The first comes from a mismatch between the\nunit of processing of DFT algorithms and the other algorithms along the\nprocessing block diagram. Although blocks such as “signal mapping” and\n“cyclic prefix insertion” process a total of N𝑁N signal samples,\nthey can process them in a sample-by-sample basis. Thus, the processing of\na particular sample does not depend on the value of other samples in\nthose blocks. By contrast, DFT algorithms cannot start running\nbefore all N𝑁N samples are loaded in the input. Hence, the unit of processing\nof DFT algorithms is N𝑁N times higher than their preceding and succeeding\nprocessing blocks. As N𝑁N grows, such mismatch turns a DFT algorithm\nto become a bottleneck along the OFDM block diagram. This problem has been\ndescribed by the digital radio design literature as a runtime deadline to\nbe met by signal processing algorithms , , , , .\nBy formalizing the problem as an asymptotic trade-off between sampling and computational overhead,\nwe can calculate the required asymptotic complexity to meet the sampling interval. Second, DFT algorithms are responsible to feed\nthe DAC in a classic OFDM transmitter. To avoid signal aliasing at the\nreceiver, the transmitter must sample the time-domain signals produced\nby the IDFT algorithm within a specific time interval. This interval\nis calculated from the Nyquist sampling theorem which states that\nthe largest time interval between two equally spaced (time-domain) samples of a\nsignal band-limited to W𝑊W Hz must be TN​Y​Q=1/(2​W)subscript𝑇𝑁𝑌𝑄12𝑊T_{NYQ}=1/(2W) seconds. In the case\nof complex IQ modulators where the real and imaginary dimensions of the signal\nare independently and simultaneously sampled by two parallel samplers,\nTN​Y​Q=1/Wsubscript𝑇𝑁𝑌𝑄1𝑊T_{NYQ}=1/W seconds. In IQ systems, at least W𝑊W samples must feed the\nDAC every second – which is known as the Nyquist sampling rate – otherwise\nthe signal frequency can suffer from aliasing thereby preventing its\ncorrect identification at the receiver.\nFor an inter-subcarrier space of Δ​fΔ𝑓\\Delta f Hz, the width of an\nN𝑁N-subcarrier OFDM signal is WO​F​D​M=N​Δ​fsubscript𝑊𝑂𝐹𝐷𝑀𝑁Δ𝑓W_{OFDM}=N\\Delta f, so a complex time-domain\nOFDM sample must feed the DAC every, Based on Eq. 12, we relate the asymptotic complexity\nof DFT algorithms with the Nyquist interval. As result, we introduce the\nsampling-complexity (Nyquist-Fourier) trade-Off in Def. 2. In OFDM radios with Δ​fΔ𝑓\\Delta f Hz of inter-subcarrier space,\nthe N𝑁N-point DFT computational complexity TD​F​T​(N)subscript𝑇𝐷𝐹𝑇𝑁T_{DFT}(N) increases\nas the Nyquist period 1/(N​Δ​f)1𝑁Δ𝑓1/(N\\Delta f) decreases to improve symbol throughput. The sequence of discrete time samples output by the\nIDFT algorithm corresponds to the time-domain version of\nthe OFDM symbol that lasts TS​Y​M=1/Δ​fsubscript𝑇𝑆𝑌𝑀1Δ𝑓T_{SYM}=1/\\Delta f seconds. In\nthe design of a real-time OFDM radio the entire digital signal\nprocessing must take no more TS​Y​Msubscript𝑇𝑆𝑌𝑀T_{SYM}, otherwise the system either\nsuffers from sample losses or misses the real-time communication\ncapability , , ,\n .\nWe capture this condition in terms of asymptotic complexity\nin Lemma 2. The computational complexity upper bound required to solve the\nDFT problem under the Nyquist interval constraint on radios with finite\nprocessing capabilities is O​(1)𝑂1O(1). Considering that a DFT algorithm is the asymptotically most complex\nprocedure of the basic OFDM waveform, its complexity must satisfy Assuming that the throughput improvement is achieved by\nenlarging N𝑁N and that the symbol duration does not grow on N𝑁N\n(e.g., IEEE 802.11ac ), it follows that ∎ Note that one can relax the complexity lower bound predicted\nby Lemma 2 if the radio digital\nbaseband processing capabilities can grow arbitrarily on\nthe number of subcarriers. However, with the end of the\nso-called “Moore’s law” , higher\nprocessing capability translates into higher manufacturing\ncost, power consumption and hardware area, bringing doubts to\nthe feasibility of portable multicarrier Terahertz radios. The Corollary 2 follows from Lemma 2. Given that the minimum possible lower bound complexity of the\nDFT problem is Ω​(N)Ω𝑁\\Omega(N)  and the\nNyquist interval imposes an upper bound of O​(1)𝑂1O(1) (Lemma 2),\nno DFT algorithm can meet the Nyquist interval as N𝑁N grows. To face the result of the Corollary 2,\none may relax the Nyquist constraint which results in the\ncompressive sensing systems [ref]30.\nHowever, high accuracy signal frequency prediction in such systems\nhas been proved to be a NP-hard problem \nwhich turns out to much more complex systems because only exponential\ntime algorithms are known for that class of problems. Note that the sampling-complexity trade-off does not\nrestrict to multicarrier waveforms such as OFDM and its variants\nbut also to single carrier signals that rely on DFT to\nmitigate the peak-to-average power ratio of uplink transmissions in\nwireless cellular networks . Of course, the\ntrade-off is more critical to waveforms designed for\nbroadband traffic services that target wider spectrum.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: (Lemma 2),\nno DFT algorithm can meet the Nyquist interval as N𝑁N grows.
