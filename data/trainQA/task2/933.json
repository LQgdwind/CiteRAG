      "content": "Paper Title: End-to-End Training of CNN Ensembles for Person Re-Identification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section we first compare the proposed approach with the state-of-the-art methods on three widely used benchmark datasets, namely Market-1501 [ref]42, DukeMTMC-reid , CUHK03 . Then we make comparisons on the more recent MSMT17 dataset  separately. Table 1 gives the details of these datasets. In Table 2, the comparison of the proposed method with the state-of-the-art methods on Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reid and CUHK03 datasets are given. On Market-1501 dataset, our method achieves the best mAP score while PCB+RPP [ref]24 has slightly better score than ours in terms of Rank-1 accuracy. One can observe that our method perform better than multi-loss models such as part-based [ref]24  and attention-based . The closest method to our approach in terms of mAP is the multi-part model PCB+RPP[ref]24, which is mainly improved by the inclusion of refined part pooling, a ReID specific technique to enhance within-part consistency. On DukeMTMC-reid dataset, the proposed method outperforms the above mentioned multi-loss systems significantly. Specifically, we improve the best published mAP score by 3% and 4% in Euclidean and Hamming distances, respectively. Our method also improves the Rank-1 accuracy of the best published score from 84.0% to 86.2%. Similar to the Market-1501, the performance in Hamming distance is noticeable also on this dataset and our method produce even a higher mAP score than Euclidean distance on real-valued feature vectors. On CUHK03 dataset, our method outperforms the previous methods by a large margin both on labeled and auto-detected bounding boxes. Specifically, for the labeled set, our method improves the best published Rank-1 and mAP scores by 5%. For the auto-detected set there is 4% and 2% increase in Rank-1 accuracy and mAP score, respectively. The overfitting problem is likely to emerge on the CUHK03 dataset due to its relatively modest number of training images. Since we designed our system especially for the overfitting problem, our system performs better on such datasets, as expected. Hamming space is usually preferred in information retrieval systems, where it is important to compare feature vectors in an efficient manner. It is also crucial for the ReID systems to adapt such efficient feature representations, because the feature vector of each query image is compared with a large number of gallery images. The problem becomes even more serious for our system because our feature vectors are very large (8192 in length). Information loss due to quantization is one of the problems of this space. However, our method is robust against this problem as shown by Table 2. Our method works very well in Hamming space: it outperforms most of the state-of-the-art approaches while being more efficient in feature comparison. MSMT17: This is a very recent dataset and is more challenging due to large variance in imaging conditions. It includes complex scenes, backgrounds, and severe lighting changes, which is closer to the real life scenarios. Since it is a recent dataset, there are only a few studies which report results on this dataset. The scores of   and  are reported by the authors of the dataset while [ref]52 is a very recent study. We compare our approach with the available methods in Table 3. Our method outperforms the previous studies and performs comparably with the DG-Net [ref]52, which incorporates GANs to augment training data with high-quality cross-id composed images. These results indicate that our method carocessing has failed to process your source. The 5 most common mistakes causing this are:\nn produce competitive results on such challenging datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: In this section we first compare the proposed approach with the state-of-the-art methods on three widely used benchmark datasets, namely Market-1501 [ref]42, DukeMTMC-reid , CUHK03 .
