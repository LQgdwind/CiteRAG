      "content": "Paper Title: CausalStock: Deep End-to-end Causal Discovery for News-driven Stock Movement Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe financial services industry has maintained a leading position in embracing data science methodologies to inform investment determinations. Within this domain, quantitative trading has garnered substantial attention from both academia and industry. Researchers have consistently worked on exploring different approaches to predict the stock movement (rise or fall of stock price) for many years, such as uni-stock movement prediction , multi-stock movement prediction  , news-driven stock movement prediction   and so on, which have shown significant success. These methods usually model the stock movement prediction task as a time series classification problem. In this paper, we focus on the news-driven multi-stock movement prediction task. A prevalent model paradigm for this task often takes the historical price features and the stock-related news of multiple stocks as inputs and then leverages the well-designed neural networks to make stock movement predictions. There are two key modeling points for tackling this task: modeling the stock relations to enhance the prediction accuracy, and building the text mining module to extract effective information from news data that benefits stock movement prediction. Although previous work has made significant progress, there are still some issues that require further attention. We will elaborate on them in the following. For stock relation modeling, many existing works are commonly attention-based [ref]15   or graph-based [ref]34 . These methods aim to model the correlation relation between stocks. However, the company relations are often unidirectional,\nsuch as the “investing” and “member of,” leading to the unidirectional relations of their stocks. Thus, causal relations are\nmore appropriate for depicting the impact between stocks, as they identify the direction of information flow and are more informative than correlations. With the development of causal science, many researchers have started to use deep end-to-end networks for\ncausal relations discovery of panel data or temporal data   [ref]14, in which the causal relations are defined as directed acyclic graphs, i.e., causal graphs, and the Functional Causal Models (FCMs) are often utilized to optimize the causal graph by simulating the data generation mechanism. This provides a solid theoretical foundation for causal discovery for stocks. In recent years, an extrinsic text mining module has emerged as a plausible avenue through the alignment of financial news and social media posts, thereby elucidating intricate market insights that extend well beyond mere considerations of price dynamics, trading volumes, or financial indicators    . Conventional text representations obtained by using GRU  or LSTM [ref]15 exhibit many limitations. Specifically, news text data are often characterized by substantial noise because of the presence of irrelevant or ambiguous information   . The effective information for stock movement prediction gets intertwined with this noise, presenting a considerable challenge for these modules to discern meaningful signals accurately. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) have unique advantages in this situation due to their advanced knowledge and reasoning abilities. Besides, LLMs can identify meaningful information within noisy environments  . Motivated by these requirements, we propose an innovative news-driven multi-stock movement prediction model named CausalStock. In CausalStock, we design a Denoised News Encoder, which leverages LLMs to score every news text from multiple perspectives. Then the evaluation scores are taken as denoised text representations. To discover the causal relations between stocks, we propose a Lag-dependent temporal causal discovery module, from which we obtain the causal graph distribution.\nBased on the input market information and learned causal graph distribution, CausalStock employs an FCM [ref]14 to make predictions. We summarize the contributions of our paper as follows: We propose a novel news-driven multi-stock movement prediction method named CausalStock, which could discover the causal relations among stocks and make accurate movement predictions simultaneously. Different from the past lag-independent causal discovery method , CausalStock involves a lag-dependent temporal causal discovery module, which intuitively links the temporal causal relations according to the time lag, making it more suitable for temporal stock data. To extract useful information from the massive noisy news text data, an LLM-based Denoised News Encoder is proposed by taking advantage of the evaluation ability of LLM, which outputs the denoised news representation for better information utilization. Experiments on 666 public benchmarks show the performance of CausalStock as a news-driven multi-stock movement prediction method. Moreover, we conduct extensive analytical experiments to show the explainability of our key modules.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: progress, there are still some issues that require further attention.
