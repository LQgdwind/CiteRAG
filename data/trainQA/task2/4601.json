Its general objective is to learn effective data representations by pulling closer positive pairs and pushing apart negative pairs in the feature space using contrastive losses, which are often designed based on certain auxiliary tasks (e.g.,formulae-sequenceùëíùëîe.g., similarity metrics learning). For example,\nWu et al. [ref]32 devise an instance-level discrimination method in the form of exemplar task  to perform image contrastive learning with noise-contrastive estimation loss (NCE) . In [ref]33, contrastive predictive coding (CPC) based on a probabilistic contrastive loss (InfoNCE) is proposed to learn general representations for different domains. To optimize representation learning (e.g.,formulae-sequenceùëíùëîe.g., consistency) in memory bank based contrastive methods   , some recent end-to-end works    utilize all samples of the current mini-batch to generate negative instance features, while the momentum-based approach  further explores the use of momentum-updated encoder and queue dictionary to improve consistency of both encoder and instance features.\nThe latest PCL  integrates both contrastive learning and clustering into an expectation-maximization (EM) framework, which is highly efficient on unsupervised visual representation learning and inspires our work for 3D skeletons. Our work differs from previous studies in following aspects. The proposed skeleton prototype contrastive learning scheme is devised to mine most representative and discriminative skeleton features (i.e.,formulae-sequenceùëñùëíi.e., skeleton prototypes) from unlabeled multi-level skeleton graph representations of 3D skeleton sequences (i.e.,formulae-sequenceùëñùëíi.e., skeleton instances). In this scheme, the skeleton instances and generated skeleton prototypes are exploited as the contrasting instances, which fundamentally differs from existing works   [ref]34  that use augmented samples of images as instances.\nThe goal of skeleton prototype contrastive learning scheme is to maximize skeleton instances‚Äô similarity with their prototypes and dissimilarity to other prototypes using the proposed clustering-contrasting strategy, which does not require any extra memory or sampling mechanism   and can directly learn effective skeleton representations for the person re-ID task without introducing any ground-truth label from source data domains.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: Contrastive learning has recently achieved great success in many self-supervised and unsupervised learning tasks  [ref]32 [ref]33 [ref]34   .
