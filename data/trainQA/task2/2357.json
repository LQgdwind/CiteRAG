FOSSIL [ref]2- a classical markov-based model, which captures personalized dynamics. GRU4Rec  - a representative RNN-based method for session-based recommendation, it stacks multiple GRU layers for session-parallel mini-batch training. NARM [ref]18 - a hybrid encoder with attention mechanism to model sequential behaviors in the current session. SASRec  - a self attention-based sequential recommender, which utilizes relatively few actions and considers long-range dependencies. STAMP  - a short term behavior priority attention-based method. SRGNN  - a graph-based recommender modeling session to learn item representations. GC-SAN  - an improved version of SRGNN, which uses a GNN and multi-layered self-attention mechanism to compute the sequence level embeddings. FGNN  - a graph-based method, which uses a weight attention network to compute the graph level embeddings. LESSR  - a session-based recommender with GNN, which innovatively utilizes auxiliary graph to generate item representation. HCGR - our approach with novel attentive information aggregation, which utilize contrastive loss to optimize the model by considering the distance between positive and negative samples in hyperbolic space. In this experiment, we set the maximum length of session to be 505050, and the embedding dimension to be dùëëd=128 for all datasets, the initial learning rate is uniformly set to 0.001 ,the linear schedule decay rate of 0.5 of every 3 epochs and L2subscriptùêø2L_{2} penalty is 3‚Äãe‚àí33ùëí33e-3.
