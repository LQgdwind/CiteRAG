A Novel Dataset and Experiments\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe majority of work in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) and Educational Recommendation Systems (EduRecSys) revolve around using learner context   to predict learner engagement. Although the connection between learner engagement and learning gains have been explored by many  0 8, public datasets in this realm are hard to come by. Many MOOC platforms such as edX 3 and Khan Academy 9 harvest valuable data created in an in-the-wild setting, yet this data is gated within course owners and consortia1 (or heavily anonymised) due to its proprietary nature. However, with the boom of online education, understanding features of contents leading to context-agnostic (population-based) engagement, an under researched knowledge area, has become a critical area to explore. This work marks a significant step in this direction by publishing a large dataset that the community can use to push the research frontiers. Other public datasets relating to educational question generation [ref]11 , argument strength  and essay scoring  serve different objectives and tasks. Study of context-agnostic engagement of video lectures so far has been mainly qualitative, deriving guidelines such as keeping videos short and in parts 3 and using conversational language . These guidelines are only useful at the content creation stage and have no use in moderating the mammoth of materials already circulating in the Internet.\nOur work, proposes to model context-agnostic engagement using features associated with the educational resource itself, which is useful for scalable quality assurance and recommendation of existing (and newly created) materials.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: marks a significant step in this direction by publishing a large dataset that the community can use to push the research frontiers. Other public datasets relating to educational question generation [ref]11 , argument strength  and essay scoring  serve different objectives and tasks. Study of context-agnostic engagement of video lectures so far has been mainly qualitative, deriving guidelines\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
