      "content": "Paper Title: Building Trust in Autonomous Vehicles: Role of Virtual Reality Driving Simulators in HMI Design\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBased on the principles discussed in Section II-A, an in-vehicle user interface should continuously provide feedback addressing, whenever possible multiple senses, highlighting “why” information that explains the vehicle’s choices, and adopting a pleasant and effective communication style that presents the system as a skilled/reputable driver. These elements, while important in general, are particularly relevant in the initial learning phase, where the user is still unfamiliar with the AD system and needs to form an appropriate mental model of its inner mechanisms . As it will be illustrated in more detail in Section IV, subjects who participated in our study were never exposed to a real AD system. An AR-HUD was therefore designed, as it was found in the literature to be the most effective interface under the considered conditions. It was deemed as important to ensure that visual cues displayed by the AR-HUD are consistent with information conveyed by commercial DA products, as users are mostly familiar with it. However, it was regarded as crucial to provide also information that illustrate the vehicle’s sensory capabilities and hence, improve the user’s situational awareness. Finally, given this work’s focus on L4 and L5 AD systems, information about the vehicle’s planning functionalities needed to be delivered as well. Design was based on the features reported in Table I. The HUD is capable to display information about all the relevant elements in the surrounding environment, including both static objects (trees, lighting poles, parked cars, traffic lights, road signs, etc.) and dynamic objects (pedestrians, animals or other cars). These elements are provided together with distance information in meters from the vehicle, absolute speed when available, and a visual warning status indicator. Lane keeping and navigation cues for the user’s vehicle and other cars (assuming that they are connected) are also considered. The color of each car is randomly assigned by GENIVI. Objects of interests are identified by means of a bounding box. This metaphor, previously validated in the literature , is adopted by commercial players such as Waymo and NVIDIA. In our implementation, each bounding box has a white outline and is associated with a label and an icon identifying the detected object, thus satisfying the usability principle which suggests that the adopted representation must be simple and intuitively understandable by the user ; the use of familiar cues, such as icons, also reduces the cognitive load in the presence of a large amount of information . Bounding boxes are automatically generated in VR knowing the position, size and pose of all objects in the scene. Technically, this was implemented in Unity by associating to all objects with a Collider component a visible colored material. The Colliders are not visible by default in the rendering step because just define the bounding volume of an object for the purposes of identifying physical collisions through the physics engine. Labels always face the vehicle and are, therefore, readable by the user. In order to determine which situations constitute a potential danger, we relied on the definition from the ISO 15623 standard on “Forward vehicle collision warning systems” , counting on a previous study by Sebastian et al . A mathematical model is used to determine potential collisions based on the trajectory, speed and acceleration of the vehicle, as well as that of potential obstacles (e.g., the preceding car). Once the possibility of a collision has been established, a safety distance is calculated, which depends on the speed of the vehicle and the reaction time of the driver, which was estimated based on the study in . The distance between the vehicle and the estimated collision point is therefore measured: if this distance is less than the safety distance, the passenger needs to be warned of the potential danger. We therefore defined a hazard index, ranging from 0 to 1 and calculated as the ratio between the distance from the obstacle and the warning distance defined in . The objects’ warning status is presented through both visual and auditory cues. In the literature, the AR-based DA system in [ref]37 adopted an intuitive color code in which the severity of the danger of an obstacle detected on the road is shown by means of a color code that starts from the green (safety) and extends up to the red (maximum state of danger). This color coding is consistent with systems reviewed in Section II-A. Therefore, we decided to color-code the hazard index with a green to red gradient and use it to visually represent the warning status of the detected object by controlling the transparency color of the bounding box. The color-code value is computed using a perception-based equation, where the hazard index is used as exponential factor. To signal potential dangers, the label associated with the bounding box flashes as well, so as to direct the user’s attention towards the obstacle. Flashing is used in DA systems by various vendors [ref]38 . It is important to underline that, through the flashing information, the vehicle communicates to the user why it is about to perform a specific action . The flashing visual cue, at a lower frequency, is also used to notify the user of a road sign or traffic light. Flashing occurs when a traffic light changes or when a new road sign is recognized. The lower frequency reduces the sense of alarm and, hence, allows the user to distinguish normal driving operations from high-risk situations. An immediate danger is also marked by a sound alert  . This is consistent with current DA systems, which produce audible warnings, e.g., in emergency braking conditions . A more pleasant sound is played when road signs are detected, to capture the user’s attention in an unalarming way. Two variants of the HUD were designed, which in the following are referred to as omni-comprehensive (OMN) and selective (SEL).\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: the distance from the obstacle and the warning distance defined in .
