      "content": "Paper Title: Attention-based Neural Cellular Automata\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCellular Automata are algorithmic processes motivated by the biological behaviours of cellular growth and, as such, are capable of producing complex emergent (global) dynamics from the iterative application of comparatively simple (localized) rules . Neural Cellular Automata present a more general CA formulation, where the evolving cell states are represented as (typically low-dimensional) vectors and the update rule dictating their evolution is a differentiable function whose parameters are learned through backpropagation from a loss, rather than a handcrafted set of rules  [ref]35 .\nNeural net-based formulations of CAs in the NeurIPS community can be traced back to the early work of , where only small and simple models were examined. Recent formulations of NCAs have shown that when leveraging the power of deep learning techniques enabled by advances in hardware capabilities—namely highly-parallelizable differentiable operations implemented on GPUs—NCAs can be tuned to learn surprisingly complex desired behaviour, such as semantic segmentation [ref]31; common RL tasks such as cart-pole balancing [ref]22, 3D locomotion , and Atari game playing ; and image synthesis   . Although these recent formulations rely on familiar compositions of convolutions and non-linear functions, it is important to highlight that NCAs are fundamentally not equivalent to “very-deep” CNNs (vs. [ref]35), or any other feedforward architecture (e.g., ResNets ), particularly, in the same way that a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is not equivalent: CNNs and other feedforward architectures induce a directed acyclic computation graph (i.e., a finite impulse response), whereas NCAs (and RNNs) induce a directed cyclic computation graph (i.e., an infinite impulse response), where stateful data can additionally be manipulated using (learned) feedback loops and/or time-delayed controls. As such, NCAs can be viewed as a type of RNN, and both (N)CAs and RNNs are known to be Turing complete    .111In the case of (N)CAs, a Turing complete example is the Rule 110 elementary CA   Vision Transformers  are an adaptation of Transformers  to vision-based tasks like image classification. In contrast to networks built from convolutional layers, ViTs rely on self-attention mechanisms operating on tokenized inputs. Specifically, input images are divided into non-overlapping patches, then fed to a Transformer after undergoing a linear patch projection with an embedding matrix. While ViTs provide competitive image classification performance, the quadratic computational scaling of global self-attention limits their applicability in high-dimensional domains, e.g., per-pixel dense processing. Recent developments have attempted to alleviate such efficiency limitations    , one notable example being Perceiver IO   with its use of cross-attention. We refer interested readers to a comprehensive survey on ViTs .\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: vectors and the update rule dictating their evolution is a differentiable function whose parameters are learned through backpropagation from a loss, rather than a handcrafted set of rules  [ref]35 .\nNeural net-based formulations of CAs in the NeurIPS community can be traced back to the early work of , where only small and simple models were examined.
