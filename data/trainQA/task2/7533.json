      "content": "Paper Title: FedUV: Uniformity and Variance for Heterogeneous Federated Learning 1footnote 11footnote 1To be presented at CVPR 2024\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare FedUV with the state-of-the-art FL algorithms: FedAvg [ref]31, FedProx , and MOON . We also include a method Freeze which freezes the final layer. This is similar to FedBABU [ref]34 without personalization. We use the PyTorch  library and follow the official implementations for all available work. Label-shift Datasets.\nSTL-10  is a dataset with 10 classes with balanced 5,000 training and 8,000 validation samples.\nCIFAR-100 [ref]16 is a dataset with 100 classes with 60,000 training and 10,000 validation samples.\nTiny ImageNet  is a dataset downsampled from the ImageNet  dataset with 200 classes with balanced 100,000 training and 10,000 validation samples.\nBasic data augmentation, random cropping and horizontal flipping, is used consistently throughout all datasets and methods. As with many previous work  [ref]34 , we use the Dirichlet distribution to simulate label-shift non-IID settings. The Œ±ùõº\\alpha term controls the extent of non-IIDness with Œ±=0ùõº0\\alpha=0 being most non-IID and Œ±=‚àûùõº\\alpha=\\infty being IID. We use Œ±‚àà{0.01,1.0}ùõº0.011.0\\alpha\\in\\{0.01,1.0\\}. We split the training datasets into a 90-10 training-validation dataset and use the original validation set as a test set. Feature-shift Dataests. A more recent work  has shown it is important also to focus specifically on feature-shift environments. To simulate feature-shift, we use 3 datasets which includes data from various domains.\nPACS  is a dataset with 7 classes in 9,991 images from four domains: Photo (1,670 images), Art painting (2,048 images), Cartoon (2,344 images), and Sketch (3,929 images). We randomly sampled an equal 280 images per domain (40 images per class in each domain) for our testing dataset (1,120 images in total).\nHAM10000 0 is a dataset with 7 classes in 10,015 images from four domains. The domains are represented by different institutions which collected dermoscopic (skin disease) images. Each domain has 3363, 2259, 439, 3954 images respectively. Due to the imbalance in data, we took roughly 20% from each domain for 1955 images for our testing set.\nOffice-Home 1 is a dataset with 65 classes in 15,588 images from 4 domains: Art (2,427 images), Clipart (4,365 images), Product (4,439 images), and Photo (4,357 images). We randomly sampled an equal 455 images per domain (7 images per class in each domain) for our testing dataset (1,820 images in total). We resize images from these datasets into 96x96x3 images and apply basic data augmentation (random cropping and horizontal flipping). A detailed overview of the distributions of the datasets are provided in Appendix 2. Models. We use 3 different models across the different datasets. Note that we also add a non-linear projector following  due to reduced performance without it. This is simply two fully-connected layers followed by a batch norm and ReLu activation. For STL-10 and PACS, we used a small CNN model (Appendix 3) with a projector with 256 neurons. For CIFAR-100 and PACS, we used a ResNet-18  model, removing the initial max-pooling layer due to the small image size and adding the projector with 512 neurons. For Tiny ImageNet and Office-Home, we used a ResNet-50 model, removing the initial max-pooling layer and adding the projector with 2048 neurons.\nOn all datasets, we report the results of a single aggregated global model. Hyperparameters. Our default testing environment for our ablation is done on STL-10 (Œ±=0.01ùõº0.01\\alpha=0.01) with a small CNN (Appendix 3) and Office-Home with a ResNet-50, local epoch E=10ùê∏10E=10, number of clients Œ∫=10ùúÖ10\\kappa=10 for STL-10 and Œ∫=4ùúÖ4\\kappa=4 for Office-Home (for each of the domains), participation rate œÅ=1.0ùúå1.0\\rho=1.0. The total aggregation rounds is chosen based on performance of the training-validation split on FedAvg. We set total aggregation rounds, RùëÖR, as 100, 60, 40 for STL-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and 60, 60, 40 for PACS, HAM10000, and Office-Home, respectively. All reported accuracy are averaged over 3 runs. Changes from these default settings are mentioned clearly. We use the Cross-entropy loss and SGD with learning rate of 0.01, momentum 0.9, and weight decay of 1e-5. FedProx, MOON, and FedUV are all regularization methods, thus adds an extra parameter to balance the cross-entropy loss and the strength of regularization. We tune this parameter on the CIFAR-10 [ref]16 dataset, since tuning this parameter in every setting of each dataset is not viable option for FL as resources are limited.\nFor FedProx, we use Œº=0.01ùúá0.01\\mu=0.01, for MOON, Œº=1.0ùúá1.0\\mu=1.0. For FedUV, we use fixed hyperparameters Œª=D4ùúÜùê∑4\\lambda=\\frac{D}{4}, where Dùê∑D is the number of classes, and Œº=0.5ùúá0.5\\mu=0.5 for all datasets. We report the hyperparameter tuning results in the appendix (Appendix 4). All experiments were conducted on a single RTX A5000 and one AMD EPYC 7763 processor.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: We compare FedUV with the state-of-the-art FL algorithms: FedAvg [ref]31, FedProx , and MOON .
