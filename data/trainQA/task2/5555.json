      "content": "Paper Title: On the Coherency of Quantitative Evaluation of Visual Explanations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the literature, there are four distinct categories of evaluation methods for visual explanations : Proxy tasks, ground truth-centered, model-centered, and human-centered evaluation. Proxy tasks quantify the effectiveness of explanation methods by their performance in other tasks such as weakly supervised object localisation and weakly supervised object segmentation. Methods that have been introduced are the pointing game [ref]22 and outside-inside relevance ratio [ref]37. These methods follow an assumption that a high performance in a proxy task translates to a high performing explanation. Ground truth-centered methods depend on datasets that have a ground truth mask, i.e., pixel-wise annotations for each image, that indicate the relevant pixels for different labels. The annotations are typically dependent on the human notion of relevance and as such there can be a disconnect between annotated (human-relevant) pixels and the actual model-relevant pixels. This might lead to explanations seemingly failing in an unintuitive way, such as in the case of the Clever Hans phenomenon [ref]38. To combat this, artificial datasets are used where the researcher has absolute control over the relevant features. These datasets come with the drawback that they are typically much less complex than standard datasets depicting more real-world settings. This category includes methods such as the pointing game [ref]22, Relevant Feature Coverage , Relevance Mass / Relevance Rank  and ROC curves . Model-centered methods determine the quality of a saliency map by masking out pixels from the input samples following a distribution based on the saliency map. By measuring the change in prediction score, these methods determine how important the pixels, as indicated by the heatmap, are for the prediction score.\nCommonly used methods are Average drop , deletion and insertion curves  and AOPC values . Human-centered (qualitative) methods are user studies that compare the visual quality of saliency maps generated from different methods. A set of users is asked to grade different aspects of the saliency maps such as localization, discrimination and more. Examples of this type of methods in action are in  .\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: methods by their performance in other tasks such as weakly supervised object localisation and weakly supervised object segmentation.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
