      "content": "Paper Title: Revisiting the Fragility of Influence Functions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDue to the black-box nature of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), explaining the predictions of these models remains a challenging problem. Several techniques for addressing this challenge have been proposed such as saliency maps[ref]1, influence functions , concept activation vectors , and activation atlases [ref]4. These techniques are not without problems. The fragility of these methods have been well studied, but few works have tried to understand where these methods break down  .111Code and Raw output files are available at the following url: https://github.com/jrepifano/xai_is_fragile Influence functions were originally proposed to diagnose and debug linear models by predicting the parameter or loss change due to removing a training instance . Their extension to deep learning models, however, did not occur until recently . Influence functions and their applications have been well studied since their reemergence and have since been adopted as a mainstream tool for the interpretation of deep models in a variety of data modalities    , including high-risk areas such as mortality prediction for patients in the Intensive Care Unit . Due to the diversity of the use cases for influence functions, understanding their limitations is imperative if they are to be used to explain model behavior. Without key validation procedures, we run the risk of providing misleading or incorrect information to the model users. To validate these methods, we must first agree on a metric to rate explanations. Spearman correlation between the approximate and true loss differences has been used as a metric to determine the accuracy of influence estimates. The approximate loss differences are given by the influence functions and the true loss differences are obtained by retraining an already trained network after removing a specific training sample . Recent works have used this metric to study the effects that increases in model and dataset size have on the influence functions. It has been found that influence functions are extremely sensitive to these increases . It is well known that increases in model and dataset size affect the curvature of the loss function    . Convexity of the loss function is a critical assumption of influence functions as they heavily rely on the approximation of the inverse Hessian-vector product. The stochastic estimation algorithm used to compute the inverse Hessian-vector product assumes that the Hessian is positive semidefinite  . Preliminary work has been done to try to remedy these problems via higher-order approximations  and group influences 0, i.e., computing loss differences for more than one training instance at a time. When discussing fragility, we must look at the whole system, not just the method in question. Deep neural networks have been shown to be sensitive to small perturbations via the weight initialization or by the order in which the data is given to the model 1 2. The problem lies in the noisy nature of the gradients. This problem has been linked to poor model convergence as well as explainability and attempts to address it include Gaussian averaging 1, Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) 3 2 and model averaging through Bayesian Inference 4. In this paper, we examine the cases where influence functions seemingly fail, i.e. have low Spearman correlation between approximate and true loss differences. We obtain the operands for the correlation using the retraining procedure introduced in , where the approximate loss differences are computed for the test point with the maximal loss using influence functions. Each training point is removed one at a time and the neural network is retrained from the optimal parameters until convergence in order to obtain the true difference in the loss function values. We determined that this training procedure is not valid for most applications of deep learning and present evidence for these cases.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), explaining the predictions of these models remains a challenging problem.
