      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Play Sequential Games versus Unknown Opponents\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe considered problem (Section 2) can be seen as an instance of adversarial online learning [ref]7 in which an adversary chooses a reward function rt​(⋅)subscript𝑟𝑡⋅r_{t}(\\cdot) in every round t𝑡t, while the learner (without knowing the reward function) selects action xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x_{t} and subsequently receives reward rt​(xt)subscript𝑟𝑡subscript𝑥𝑡r_{t}(x_{t}). To achieve no-regret, the learner needs to maintain a probability distribution over the set 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} of available actions and play randomly according to it. Recall that we consider a finite set of actions 𝒳⊂ℝd𝒳superscriptℝ𝑑\\mathcal{X}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{d} and we let 𝐩tsubscript𝐩𝑡\\mathbf{p}_{t} denote the probability distribution (vector) supported on 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}. At every round, the learner then plays action xt∼𝐩tsimilar-tosubscript𝑥𝑡subscript𝐩𝑡x_{t}\\sim\\mathbf{p}_{t} and subsequently updates its strategy to 𝐩t+1subscript𝐩𝑡1\\mathbf{p}_{t+1}. Multiplicative Weights (MW)  algorithms such as Exp3  and Hedge [ref]11 are popular no-regret methods for updating 𝐩tsubscript𝐩𝑡\\mathbf{p}_{t}, depending on the feedback available to the learner in every round. The former only needs observing reward of the played action rt​(xt)subscript𝑟𝑡subscript𝑥𝑡r_{t}(x_{t}) (bandit feedback), while the latter requires access to the entire reward function rt​(⋅)subscript𝑟𝑡⋅r_{t}(\\cdot) at every t𝑡t (full-information feedback). The considered game setup corresponds (from the learner’s perspective) to the particular online learning problem in which rt​(⋅):=r​(⋅,b​(⋅,θt))assignsubscript𝑟𝑡⋅𝑟⋅𝑏⋅subscript𝜃𝑡r_{t}(\\cdot):=r(\\cdot,b(\\cdot,\\theta_{t})), type θtsubscript𝜃𝑡\\theta_{t} is revealed, and the bandit observation ytsubscript𝑦𝑡y_{t} is observed by the learner. Full-information feedback, however, is not available as b​(⋅,θt)𝑏⋅subscript𝜃𝑡b(\\cdot,\\theta_{t}) is unknown.\nTo alleviate this, similarly to [ref]31, we compute \"optimistic\" reward estimates to emulate the full-information feedback. Based on previously observed data, we establish upper and lower confidence bounds ucbt​(⋅)subscriptucb𝑡⋅\\text{ucb}_{t}(\\cdot) and lcbt​(⋅)subscriptlcb𝑡⋅\\text{lcb}_{t}(\\cdot), of the opponent’s response function (via (4) and Lemma 4, Appendix A). These are then used to estimate the optimistic rewards of the learner for any x∈𝒳𝑥𝒳x\\in\\mathcal{X} at round t𝑡t as: We note that the learner’s reward function is assumed to be known and that can be efficiently optimized for any fixed x𝑥x. The latter assumption is realistic given that in many applications the learner can often choose its own objective (see examples in Section 4). For example, in case r​(x,⋅)𝑟𝑥⋅r(x,\\cdot) is a concave function, the problem in (6) corresponds to concave function maximization subject to convex constraints which can be performed efficiently via standard gradient-based methods.\nOptimistic rewards allow the learner to control the maximum incurred regret, while Lipschitness of r(.)r(.) ensures that learning the opponent’s response function (via  (2) and (3)) translates to more accurate reward estimates. We are now in position to descibe our novel StackelUCB algorithm for the learner (see Algorithm 1). StackelUCB maintains a distribution 𝐩tsubscript𝐩𝑡\\mathbf{p}_{t} over 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}, and samples actions xt∼𝐩tsimilar-tosubscript𝑥𝑡subscript𝐩𝑡x_{t}\\sim\\mathbf{p}_{t} at every round.\nIt maintains confidence bounds of the opponent’s response function b​(⋅,⋅)𝑏⋅⋅b(\\cdot,\\cdot) by using the previously obtained opponent’s responses (via (2)-(3)). For each x∈𝒳𝑥𝒳x\\in\\mathcal{X}, optimistic rewards r~​(x,θt)~𝑟𝑥subscript𝜃𝑡\\tilde{r}(x,\\theta_{t}) are computed via (6) and used to emulate the full-information feedback. Finally, the distribution 𝐩tsubscript𝐩𝑡\\mathbf{p}_{t} is updated by the standard MW update rule: 𝐩t+1​[x]∝𝐩t​[x]⋅exp⁡(η⋅r~t​(x,θt))proportional-tosubscript𝐩𝑡1delimited-[]𝑥⋅subscript𝐩𝑡delimited-[]𝑥⋅𝜂subscript~𝑟𝑡𝑥subscript𝜃𝑡\\mathbf{p}_{t+1}[x]\\propto\\mathbf{p}_{t}[x]\\cdot\\exp\\big{(}\\eta\\cdot\\tilde{r}_{t}(x,\\theta_{t})\\big{)},\nwhere η𝜂\\eta is the learning step set as in the following theorem. Consider the setting with multiple opponent types from ΘΘ\\Theta, and assume the learner’s reward function is Lrsubscript𝐿𝑟L_{r}-Lipschitz continuous. Then for any δ∈(0,1)𝛿01\\delta\\in(0,1), the regret of StackelUCB when used with λ≥1𝜆1\\lambda\\geq 1, βt=σ​λ−1​2​log⁡(1δ)+log⁡(det(It+Kt/λ))+λ−1/2​Bsubscript𝛽𝑡𝜎superscript𝜆121𝛿subscript𝐼𝑡subscript𝐾𝑡𝜆superscript𝜆12𝐵\\beta_{t}=\\sigma\\lambda^{-1}\\sqrt{2\\log{(\\tfrac{1}{\\delta})}+\\log(\\det(I_{t}+K_{t}/\\lambda))}+\\lambda^{-1/2}B, and learning step η=8​log⁡(|𝒳|)/T𝜂8𝒳𝑇\\eta=\\sqrt{8\\log(|\\mathcal{X}|)/T}, is bounded, with probability at least 1−2​δ12𝛿1-2\\delta, by where B≥‖b‖ℋk𝐵subscriptnorm𝑏subscriptℋ𝑘B\\geq\\|b\\|_{\\mathcal{H}_{k}} and γTsubscript𝛾𝑇\\gamma_{T} is the maximum information gain defined in (5). The obtained regret bound scales sublinearly with T𝑇T, and depends on the regret obtained from playing Hedge (first two terms) and learning of the opponent’s response function (last term in the regret bound). We note that Exp3 attains 𝒪(T​|𝒳|​log|𝒳|)\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T|\\mathcal{X}|\\log|\\mathcal{X}}|) while Hedge attains improved 𝒪​(T​log⁡|𝒳|)𝒪𝑇𝒳\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T\\log|\\mathcal{X}|}) regret bound which scales favourably with the number of available actions |𝒳|𝒳|\\mathcal{X}|. The same holds for our algorithm, but crucially – unlike Hedge – our algorithm uses the bandit feedback only. Next, we consider a special case of a single opponent type, while in Section 3.3, we show how StackelUCB can be used to play unknown repeated Stackelberg games.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: The considered problem (Section 2) can be seen as an instance of adversarial online learning [ref]7 in which an adversary chooses a reward function rt​(⋅)subscript𝑟𝑡⋅r_{t}(\\cdot) in every round t𝑡t, while the learner (without knowing the reward function) selects action xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x_{t} and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
