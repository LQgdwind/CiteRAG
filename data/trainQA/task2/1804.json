      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Acoustic Unit Discovery by Leveraging a Language-Independent Subword Discriminative Feature Representation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe goal of this stage is to learn a frame-level subword-discriminative feature representation.\nThe general framework of the first stage of our proposed approach, based on [ref]23, consists of an 1) APC model, which creates the APC features that are used as input to a 2) DNN acoustic model (AM) together with the frame-level phone labels obtained from 3) an OOD (non-target language) ASR system\n(see Figure 1). After training the DNN AM, BNFs are extracted from the bottleneck layer of the DNN as the desired subword-discriminative representation. APC is a self-supervised learning model without the need of transcriptions for training. It is trained to predict a future speech frame nùëõn steps ahead (named prediction step) based on the current and past frames of an utterance [ref]24. APC is incorporated in [ref]23 to extract APC features as input to the DNN AM (see Figure 1), owing to its ability to make phonetic and speaker information in speech more separable than MFCC.\nIn this study we tackle an extremely low-resource scenario (4.54.54.5 h), however\nour previous work [ref]23 suggests that a larger training dataset (more than 505050 h) is needed to obtain effective APC features, thus we opt for using an APC model trained with a well-resourced OOD language. Note that a recent study  found that self-supervised models trained on one language can be used to represent another language with certain success. In our experiments we compare (1) APC features extracted by an APC model which is trained with an OOD language; and (2) MFCC features (hence bypassing the APC model); as the input to the DNN AM (see Figure 1). The DNN AM in Figure 1\nis trained with target language acoustic data. Frame-level phone labels required for training the DNN AM are obtained using an OOD (non-target) ASR system [ref]23: a target speech utterance is decoded by the OOD ASR system so that every frame is assigned a phone label generated by the OOD ASR.\nBy this means, an OOD language‚Äôs phonetic knowledge is exploited for the target language acoustic modeling.\nBNFs are then extracted from the bottleneck layer of the trained DNN as the desired subword-discriminative representation. The language-independent OOD ASR system leverages multiple phonetically diverse languages‚Äô resources. We use International Phone Alphabet (IPA) symbols [ref]31 to represent the phonemes of the different OOD languages, thus creating a phoneme inventory of the multilingual ASR system that is more language-independent  than that of a monolingual OOD. This also enables acoustic information sharing of the\nsame or similar\nsounds from multiple languages during ASR training. A multilingual ASR system captures a wider phonetic space and has more different phone labels than a monolingual ASR system, thus is expected to provide more refined OOD phone labels for the target speech than a monolingual ASR system. Another modification to the approach in [ref]23 is adding a post-processing step to the OOD ASR based phone labels (see Figure 1). Essentially, the post-processing aims to refine the phone labels from an OOD ASR via re-aligning:\nFirst, we train an HMM with the OOD phone labels and Mboshi acoustic data; second, we generate the HMM phone alignments as the desired frame-level label supervision (rather than the output of an OOD ASR) to train the DNN AM. We experimentally found that the post-processing step consistently improves the AUD performance. Presumably, it refines the OOD phone labels by leveraging contextual information in the Mboshi acoustic data.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: The goal of this stage is to learn a frame-level subword-discriminative feature representation.\nThe general framework of the first stage of our proposed approach, based on [ref]23, consists of an 1) APC model, which creates the APC features that are used as input to a 2) DNN acoustic model (AM) together with the frame-level phone labels obtained from 3) an OOD\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
