      "content": "Paper Title: UniFormaly: Towards Task-Agnostic Unified Framework for Visual Anomaly Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets. Our defect detection experiments primarily utilize the widely-used benchmark MVTecAD¬†[ref]3, which contains 15 sub-datasets with different categories, including 10 objects and 5 textures. In addition, we conduct experiments on Magnetic Tile Defects (MTD)¬†[ref]14, BeanTech Anomaly Detection (BTAD)¬†, and Casting manufacturing Product Defect (CPD) to demonstrate the scalability of UniFormaly to more specialized tasks. For semantic anomaly detection, we perform experiments on CIFAR-10/100¬†, ImageNet-30¬†, and Species-60, the sub-datasets of Species¬†[ref]12. Species is a large-scale and high-resolution dataset of which labels are non-overlapped with ImageNet, comprising over 700,000 images of a thousand subcategories. We randomly select 60 subcategories with more than 500 images and prepare the train-test split following ¬†[ref]12. Implementation details. We obtained patch embeddings from layers L={3,‚Ä¶,10}ùêø3‚Ä¶10L=\\{3,...,10\\} in two self-supervised ViT architectures: DINO ViT-B/8  and iBOT ViT-B/16 . These configurations are denoted as UniFormaly-DINO and UniFormaly-iBOT, respectively. To smooth the attention map in our Back Patch Masking, we utilize the attention scores from the last layer and apply a smoothing kernel with a size of n=7ùëõ7n=7. We maintain a consistent threshold of 0.1 for binary masking across all tasks, as empirical findings have shown its effectiveness across various datasets and tasks. Unless specified otherwise, we set the top kùëòk-ratio to 5% for all tasks. These uniform settings ensure our system operates in a task-agnostic manner. Additionally, we refrain from fine-tuning all methods on the data, adhering to unsupervised settings that assume a lack of abnormal data during training. Evaluation metrics. We use the threshold-independent metric AUROC to evaluate image-level and pixel-level anomaly detection performance. For anomaly clustering, we employ NMI (Normalized Mutual Information) and ARI (Adjusted Random Index), two popular metrics for clustering quality analysis when ground-truth cluster assignments are available for the test set. Furthermore, to address label imbalance, we report the F1 score after matching ground truth and cluster prediction using the Hungarian method¬†.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Datasets.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
