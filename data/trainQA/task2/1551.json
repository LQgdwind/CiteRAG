      "content": "Paper Title: Deep View Synthesis via Self-Consistent Generative Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nView synthesis generates a novel (absent) camera view image from known camera views of the same scene, as shown in Fig. 1.\nIt can be widely applied in video conferencing , virtual reality , and free-viewpoint TV [ref]3, etc.\nIn this paper, we focus on synthesizing a middle view from two different views in real industrial scenarios where the ideal view is hard to obtain due to hardware limitations.\nFor example, in some video conferencing equipment, cameras are positioned symmetrically on each side of the screen with a large baseline (i.e., the distance between two camera views [ref]4).\nMoreover, the baseline between the two cameras is often pre-defined for specific products. The view synthesis task, however, is extremely difficult due to the following challenges: 1) The large distance between two camera views may lead to huge occlusion. The model is hard to synthesize the novel views given limited information. 2) View synthesis is an ill-posed problem. Specifically, there exists an infinite number of middle/novel views that correspond to the same input views . Thus, the space of the possible view synthesis functions can be extremely large, making it hard to find a good solution.\nSeveral recent works    attempt to solve the view synthesis problem by warping with a depth camera. However, depth images are difficult to obtain due to the limitation of the hardware. Therefore, some geometry-based view synthesis methods [ref]9 0 1 2 3 [ref]4 are proposed to synthesize novel views without the depth image. Such approaches add geometry constraints to preserve consistency between input views and the synthesized view. However, when the input views have huge occlusion, these geometry-based methods may learn mismatching corresponding map between the input views, or even fail to learn the correspondences. To overcome the drawbacks of geometry-based methods, some image-content-based methods 4, [ref]9, 5 formulate the view synthesis task as a mapping from input views to the target view without geometry constraints. Despite these attempts, the space of the possible view synthesis functions is still extremely large, which makes it difficult to learn a good model. To address the above issues, we propose a new view synthesis method, called Self-Consistent Generative Network (SCGN), to simultaneously produce photo-realistic novel views and preserve consistency among different views of the same scene.\nSpecifically, to address the challenge brought by the large baseline between cameras, we propose View Synthesis Network (VSN) model that directly learns the mapping from the input side views to the resultant novel/middle view.\nTo reduce the space of possible mapping functions, we design a self-consistency scheme that introduces an additional constraint by decomposing the synthesized novel view back into the original input side views, and propose a View Decomposition Network (VDN) to learn the decomposition mapping.\nTo further improve the photo-realism of the synthesized view, we incorporate an adversarial loss and an image sharpness loss into the training objective to train the proposed model.\nUnlike cycle-consistency 7 that helps minimize the distribution divergence, our self-consistency builds a cycle to improve the pixel-wise prediction. With the self-consistency constraint, we are able to effectively reduce the space of possible mapping functions and thus obtain promising views synthesis performance.\nExtensive experiments on an indoor dataset and an outdoor dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing methods. Our main contributions are summarized as follows. We propose a novel deep View Synthesis Network, called Self-consistent Generative Network (SCGN), which simultaneously synthesizes photo-realistic unseen views and preserves high consistency among different views of the same scene. We propose a View Decomposition Network (VDN) that reconstructs the input views from the synthesized view.\nIn this way, different views are highly correlated with each other and the geometric pre-processing (e.g., rectification) in existing methods becomes not necessary. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.\nIn particular, the proposed method is able to produce visually promising middle views on both the benchmark datasets and the real-world conferencing system111The collected dataset of the real-world conferencing is available at https://zhuomanliu.github.io/datasets/download.html..\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: generates a novel (absent) camera view image from known camera views of the same scene, as shown in Fig. 1.\nIt can be widely applied in video conferencing , virtual reality , and free-viewpoint TV [ref]3, etc.\nIn this paper, we focus on synthesizing a middle view from two different views in real industrial scenarios where the ideal view is hard to obtain due to hardware limitations.\nFor\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
