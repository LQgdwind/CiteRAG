      "content": "Paper Title: Transformed Low-Rank Parameterization Can Help Robust Generalization for Tensor Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent research has shown that GF maximizes the margin of homogeneous networks during standard training, which leads to an implicit bias towards margin maximization [ref]30 [ref]16. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that this implicit bias also extends to adversarial margin maximization during adversarial training of multi-homogeneous fully connected neural networks with exponential loss [ref]29. Our analysis builds on these findings by showing that this implicit bias also holds for adversarial training of t-NNs when the adversarial perturbation is scale invariant [ref]29. First, it is straightforward to see that any t-NN f∈𝔉𝑓𝔉f\\in\\mathfrak{F} is homogeneous as follows for any positive constant a𝑎a. For any t-NN f∈𝔉𝑓𝔉f\\in\\mathfrak{F}, we have By taking derivatives with respect to a𝑎a on both sides of Eq. (24), we obtain which immediately results in Eq. (25).\n∎ In this section, we follow the setting of Ref. [ref]29 where the adversarial perturbation δ¯isubscript¯𝛿𝑖\\underline{\\mathbf{\\delta}}_{i} is scale invariant.\nAs Lemma 7 shows, l2subscript𝑙2l_{2}-FGM , FGSM , l2subscript𝑙2l_{2}-PGD and l∞subscript𝑙l_{\\infty}-PGD  perturbations for the t-NNs are all scale invariant. Note that by taking derivatives with respect to x¯¯x\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}} on both sides of Eq. (24), we have Therefore, any ∂f​(x¯;W¯)∂x¯𝑓¯x¯W¯x{\\frac{\\partial{f(\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}};{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}})}}{\\partial\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}}}} is positive homogeneous. Then, for any non-zero z¯=∂f​(x¯;W¯)∂x¯¯z𝑓¯x¯W¯x\\underline{\\textnormal{{z}}}={\\frac{\\partial{f(\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}};{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}})}}{\\partial\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}}}}, we prove Lemma 7 in the following cases: l2subscript𝑙2l_{2}-FGM perturbtion . The l2subscript𝑙2l_{2}-FGM perturbtion is defined as\nδ¯FGM​(W¯)=ξ​y​ℓ~′​z¯​‖y​ℓ~′​z¯‖F−1=−ξ​y​z¯​‖z¯‖F−1,subscript¯𝛿FGM¯W𝜉𝑦superscript~ℓ′¯zsuperscriptsubscriptnorm𝑦superscript~ℓ′¯zF1𝜉𝑦¯zsuperscriptsubscriptnorm¯zF1\\underline{\\mathbf{\\delta}}_{\\textnormal{FGM}}({\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}})={\\xi y{\\tilde{\\ell}^{\\prime}\\underline{\\textnormal{{z}}}}}{\\left\\|{y\\tilde{\\ell}^{\\prime}\\underline{\\textnormal{{z}}}}\\right\\|_{\\textnormal{F}}^{-1}}=-{\\xi y\\underline{\\textnormal{{z}}}}{\\left\\|{\\underline{\\textnormal{{z}}}}\\right\\|_{\\textnormal{F}}^{-1}},\nbecause ℓ~′≤0superscript~ℓ′0\\tilde{\\ell}^{\\prime}\\leq 0. Using Eq. (26), we have FGSM perturbations .\nThe FGSM perturbtion is taken as\nδ¯FSGM​(W¯)=ξ​​(ξ​y​ℓ~′​z¯).subscript¯𝛿FSGM¯W𝜉𝜉𝑦superscript~ℓ′¯z{\\underline{\\mathbf{\\delta}}_{\\textnormal{FSGM}}({\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}})=\\xi\\textnormal{\\leavevmode\\lstinline{{\\lst@@@set@language\\lst@@@set@numbers\\lst@@@set@frame\\lst@@@set@rulecolor\\lst@@@set@language\\footnotesize\\small{\\@listingGroup{}{}}}}}}(\\xi y{\\tilde{\\ell}^{\\prime}\\underline{\\textnormal{{z}}}}).\nUsing Eq. (26), we have l2subscript𝑙2l_{2}-PGD perturbation .\nThe l2subscript𝑙2l_{2}-PGD perturbtion is taken as where j𝑗j is the attack step, 𝔓𝔹2​(ξ)subscript𝔓subscript𝔹2𝜉\\mathfrak{P}_{\\mathbb{B}_{2}(\\xi)} is the projector onto l2subscript𝑙2l_{2}-norm ball of radius ξ𝜉\\xi, and ρ𝜌\\rho is the learning rate.\nWe prove by induction. For j=0𝑗0j=0, we have If we have δ¯PGDj​(a​W¯)=δ¯PGDj​(W¯)subscriptsuperscript¯𝛿𝑗PGD𝑎¯Wsubscriptsuperscript¯𝛿𝑗PGD¯W\\underline{\\mathbf{\\delta}}^{j}_{\\textnormal{PGD}}(a{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}})=\\underline{\\mathbf{\\delta}}^{j}_{\\textnormal{PGD}}({\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}), then for j+1𝑗1j+1, we have l∞subscript𝑙l_{\\infty}-PGD perturbation . Since the scale invariance of this pertubation can be proved very similarly to that of l2subscript𝑙2l_{2}-PGD perturbations, we just omit it. ∎ For an original example x¯isubscript¯x𝑖\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}}_{i}, the margin for its adversarial example x¯i+δ¯i​(W¯)subscript¯x𝑖subscript¯𝛿𝑖¯W\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}}_{i}+\\underline{\\mathbf{\\delta}}_{i}({\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}) is defined as\nq~i​(W¯):=yi​f​(x¯i+δ¯i​(W¯);W¯)assignsubscript~𝑞𝑖¯Wsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑓subscript¯x𝑖subscript¯𝛿𝑖¯W¯W\\tilde{q}_{i}({\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}):=y_{i}f(\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}}_{i}+\\underline{\\mathbf{\\delta}}_{i}({\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}});{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}); for sample S={(x¯i,yi)}i=1N𝑆superscriptsubscriptsubscript¯x𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖𝑖1𝑁S=\\{(\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}}_{i},y_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{N}, the margin for the N𝑁N corresponding examples is denoted by q~m​(W¯)subscript~𝑞𝑚¯W\\tilde{q}_{m}({\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}) where m∈argminm=1,⋯,Nyif(x¯i+δ¯i(W¯):W¯)m\\in\\mathop{\\operatorname{\\textnormal{argmin}}}_{m=1,\\cdots,N}y_{i}f(\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}}_{i}+\\underline{\\mathbf{\\delta}}_{i}({\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}):{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}). Let ρ=‖W¯‖F𝜌subscriptnorm¯WF\\rho=\\left\\|{{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}}\\right\\|_{\\textnormal{F}} for simplicity. We use the normalized parameter W¯^:=W¯/ρassign^¯W¯W𝜌\\hat{{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}}:={\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}/\\rho to denote the direction of the weights W¯¯W{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}.\nWe introduce the normalized margin of (x¯i,yi)subscript¯x𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖(\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}}_{i},y_{i}) as q^i​(W¯):=q~i​(W¯^)=q~i​(W¯)​ρ−(L+1)assignsubscript^𝑞𝑖¯Wsubscript~𝑞𝑖^¯Wsubscript~𝑞𝑖¯Wsuperscript𝜌𝐿1\\hat{q}_{i}({\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}):=\\tilde{q}_{i}(\\hat{{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}})=\\tilde{q}_{i}({\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}})\\rho^{-(L+1)}, and similarly define the normalized robust margin of the sample S𝑆S as q^m​(W¯):=q~m​(W¯^)=q~m​(W¯)​ρ−(L+1)assignsubscript^𝑞𝑚¯Wsubscript~𝑞𝑚^¯Wsubscript~𝑞𝑚¯Wsuperscript𝜌𝐿1\\hat{q}_{m}({\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}):=\\tilde{q}_{m}(\\hat{{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}})=\\tilde{q}_{m}({\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}})\\rho^{-(L+1)}. Note that the adversarial empirical risk can be written as ℒ^adv=1N​∑i=1Ne−𝔣​(q~i​(W¯))superscript^ℒadv1𝑁superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑁superscript𝑒𝔣subscript~𝑞𝑖¯W\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}^{\\textnormal{adv}}=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}e^{-{\\mathfrak{f}}(\\tilde{q}_{i}({\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}))}.\nMotivated by [ref]30 which uses the LogSumExp function to smoothly approximate the normalized standard margin, we define the smoothed normalized margin γ~~𝛾\\tilde{\\gamma} as follows. For a loss function888\nIn this paper, the loss function satisfying Assumption 2 belongs to the class of\nmargin-based loss function [42, Definition 2.24]. That is, although the loss function ℓ​(f​(x¯),y)ℓ𝑓¯x𝑦\\ell(f(\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}}),y) is a binary function of f​(x¯)𝑓¯xf(\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}}) and y𝑦y, there is a unary function 𝔩​(⋅)𝔩⋅\\mathfrak{l}(\\cdot), such that ℓ​(f​(x¯),y)=𝔩​(y​f​(x¯))ℓ𝑓¯x𝑦𝔩𝑦𝑓¯x\\ell(f(\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}}),y)=\\mathfrak{l}(yf(\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}})). With a slight abuse of notation, we simply use ℓ−1​(⋅)superscriptℓ1⋅\\ell^{-1}(\\cdot) to denote 𝔩−1​(⋅)superscript𝔩1⋅\\mathfrak{l}^{-1}(\\cdot), i.e., if z=ℓ​(f​(x¯),y)𝑧ℓ𝑓¯x𝑦z=\\ell(f(\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}}),y) then we have ℓ−1​(z)=y​f​(x¯)superscriptℓ1𝑧𝑦𝑓¯x\\ell^{-1}(z)=yf(\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}}). ℓℓ\\ell satisfying Assumption 2, the smoothed normalized robust margin is defined as To better understand the relation between the normalized sample robust margin q^msubscript^𝑞𝑚\\hat{q}_{m} and the smoothed normalized robust margin γ~~𝛾\\tilde{\\gamma}, we provide the following lemma.
