      "content": "Paper Title: Online Budgeted Matching with General Bids\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOnline Budgeted Matching (OBM) with general bids is a fundamental online optimization problem that generalizes to many important settings, such as online bipartite matching and Adwords with equal bids . It has applications in various domains, including online advertising, online resource allocation, and revenue management among others   . OBM is defined on a bipartite graph with a set of offline nodes (bidders) and a set of online nodes (queries). The task is to select an available offline node to match with an online query in each round. When an offline node is matched to an online node, a bid value is subtracted from the budget of the offline node, and a reward equal to the consumed budget is obtained. If the remaining budget of an offline node is less than the bid value of an online query, the offline node cannot be matched to the online query. The goal is to maximize the total reward throughout the entire online matching process. OBM is challenging due to the nature of online discrete decisions. Previous works have studied this problem under one of the following two additional assumptions on bids or matching rules:\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†Small bids. The small-bid assumption is a special case of general bids corresponding to the maximum bid-budget ratio Œ∫‚Üí0‚ÜíùúÖ0\\kappa\\to 0. That is,\nwhile the bid values can vary arbitrarily, the size of each individual bid\nis infinitely small compared to each offline node‚Äôs budget, and\nthere is always enough budget for matching. Under this assumption, the first online algorithm was provided by , achieving an optimal competitive ratio of 1‚àí1/e11ùëí1-1/e . This competitive ratio has also been attained by subsequent algorithms based on primal-dual techniques  . However, the small-bid assumption significantly limits these algorithms for broader applications in practice.\nTake the application of matching Virtual Machines (VMs) to physical servers as an example. An online VM request typically takes up a non-negligible fraction of the total computing units in a server.\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†Fractional last match (FLM). Under FLM, if an offline node has an insufficient budget for an online query, the offline node can still be matched to the query, obtaining a partial reward equal to the remaining budget. Given the limitations of small bids, some recent studies   [ref]30 have studied competitive algorithms for OBM with general bids by making the additional assumption of FLM. For example, under FLM, the greedy algorithm (Greedy) achieves a competitive ratio of 1/2121/2, while other studies    [ref]30 aim to achieve a competitive ratio greater than 1/2121/2 under various settings and/or using randomized algorithms. Although FLM allows fractional matching of a query to an offline node with insufficient budgets, it essentially assumes that any bids are potentially divisible. This assumption may not hold in many real applications, e.g., allocating fractional physical resources to a VM can result in significant performance issues that render the allocation unacceptable, and charging a fractional advertising fee may not be allowed in online advertising. Despite its practical relevance and theoretical importance, OBM with general bids has remained a challenging open problem in the absence of the small-bid and FLM assumptions. Specifically, an offline node may have insufficient budget and cannot be matched to a later query with a large value, potentially causing large sub-optimality in the worst case. This issue does not apply to small bids, as the small-bid setting implies that insufficient budgets will never occur. Additionally, this challenge is alleviated in the FLM setting, where fractional matching in cases of insufficient budgets can reduce sub-optimality. Indeed, removing the small-bid and FLM assumptions fundamentally changes and add significant challenges to the problem of OBM [ref]30. To further highlight the intrinsic difficulty of OBM with general bids, we formally prove in Proposition¬†4.1 an upper bound of the competitive ratio, i.e., 1‚àíŒ∫1ùúÖ1-\\kappa, achieved by any deterministic online algorithm, where Œ∫‚àà[ref]0 ùúÖ01\\kappa\\in[ref]0  is the maximum bid-budget ratio. Contributions: In this paper, we address OBM without the small-bid or FLM assumptions and design a meta algorithm called MetaAd, which adapts to different algorithms with provable competitive ratios. To our knowledge, MetaAd is the first provable competitive algorithm for general bids without the FLM assumption. Specifically, MetaAd generates a discounted score for each offline node by a general discounting function, which is then used to select the offline node. The discounting function evaluates the degree of budget insufficiency given a bid-budget ratio Œ∫‚àà[ref]0 ùúÖ01\\kappa\\in[ref]0 , addressing the challenge of infeasible matching due to insufficient budgets.\nGiven different discounting functions, MetaAd yields concrete algorithms, and their competitive ratios are derived from Theorem 4.2, established through a novel proof technique. We show that with small bids (i.e., Œ∫‚Üí0‚ÜíùúÖ0\\kappa\\rightarrow 0), MetaAd recovers the optimal competitive ratio of 1‚àí1e11ùëí1-\\frac{1}{e}. Furthermore, we show that MetaAd, with discounting functions from the exponential and polynomial function classes, achieves a positive competitive ratio for Œ∫‚àà[0,1)ùúÖ01\\kappa\\in[0,1).\nAs an extension, we adapt the design of MetaAd to the FLM setting, resulting in a meta-algorithm with provable competitive ratios for Œ∫‚àà[ref]0 ùúÖ01\\kappa\\in[ref]0  (Theorem 4.3). The framework of MetaAd potentially opens an interesting direction for exploring concrete discounting function designs that yield high competitive ratios for settings both with and without FLM.\nFinally, we apply our competitive analysis to the design of LOBM, a learning-augmented algorithm for OBM, which enhances average performance while still guaranteeing a competitive ratio (Theorem 5.1). We validate the empirical benefits of MetaAd and LOBM through numerical experiments on the applications of an online movie matching an VM placement on physical servers.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: budget for an online query, the offline node can still be matched to the query, obtaining a partial reward equal to the remaining budget.
