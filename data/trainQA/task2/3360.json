      "content": "Paper Title: Scaling Up Knowledge Graph Creation to Large and Heterogeneous Data Sources\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe following setting is configured to assess our research questions. Experiments are executed on datasets from GTFS-Madrid-Bench and SDM-Genomic-Datasets. Thus, our experimental setting can cover a larger spectrum of parameters that affect a KG creation task, i.e., dataset size, mapping assertion type and complexity, selectivity of the results, and types of joins between mapping assertions. Table 2 summarizes the main characteristics of these benchmarks and the covered parameters.\n\nThe GTFS-Madrid-Bench [ref]22 benchmark enables the generation of different configurations of data integration systems whose characteristics impact on the process of KG creation. We generate four logical sources with the scaling factor 1-csv, 5-csv, 10-csv, and 50-csv. The scale value indicates that the comparison between the sizes of the goal KGs. For instance, a KG generated from 5-csv is five times larger than the KG that is created from 1-csv. The logical sources for the 1-csv configuration has in total 4.8 MB. In overall, we consider mapping rules comprised of 13 concept mapping assertions, 55 attribute mapping assertions, 73 single-source role mapping assertions, and 12 multi-source role mapping assertions involving ten data sources.\n\nSDM-Genomic-Datasets  is a benchmark to compare the performance of state-of-the-art RML-compliant engines. SDM-Genomic-Datasets is created by randomly selecting data records from somatic mutation data collected in COSMIC . SDM-Genomic-Datasets includes eight different logical data sources with various sizes including 10k, 100k, 1M, and 10M number of rows. Accordingly, every pair of logical data sources with the same size differ in data duplicate rates, which can be either 25% or 75%. Each duplicate value is repeated 20 times. For example, a 10k logical data source with 25% data duplicate rates has 75% duplicate-free records (i.e., 7,500 rows) and the rest of the 25% of the records (i.e., 2,500 rows) correspond to 125 different records which are duplicated 20 times. The SDM-Genomic-Datasets offers nine mapping assertion configurations. \n\nConf1: Set of two mapping assertions with one concept and one attribute mapping assertions.\n\nConf2: Set of five mapping assertions, including one concept and four attribute mapping assertions.\n\nConf3: Set of four mapping assertions consisting of two concepts, one referenced-source role, and one attribute mapping assertions.\n\nConf4: Set of nine mapping assertions with five concepts and four referenced-source role mapping assertions.\n\nConf5: Set of three mapping assertions comprised of two concepts and one multi-source role mapping assertions.\n\nConf6: Set of nine mapping assertions, including five concepts and four multi-source role mapping assertions.\n\n\nWe group the aforementioned mapping assertions into a set named AllTogether. Furthermore, the benchmark includes three extra configurations to enable the evaluation of the impact of two other influential parameters on the performance of KG creation frameworks .\nConf7 aims at evaluating the impact of defining the same predicates using different mapping assertions. Conf8 provides a mapping rule which is connected to five other mapping rules with different logical sources through join, i.e., this mapping assertion is connected via a five-star join with the other five mapping assertions. The last configuration or Conf9 combines the first two configurations in one testbed. Conf7: Set of four mapping assertions with four concepts and two multi-source role mapping assertions. For each pair of mapping assertions, there is a multi-source role mapping assertion. The data sources of one pair of the mapping assertions are a subset of the other pair. Both pairs of mapping assertions share the same predicate. Conf8: Set of six mapping assertions with six concepts and five multi-source role mapping assertions. In this set, five child mapping assertions are referring to the same parent mapping assertion. Conf9: Set of eight mapping assertions with eight concepts and seven multi-source role mapping assertions. RMLMapper v4.12 , RocketRML v1.11.3 , Morph-KGC v1.4.1 , and\nSDM-RDFizer v3.6 . Recently, SDM-RDFizer v4.0  has been published. According to the tool description, SDM-RDFizer v4.0 implements planning techniques, physical operators for the execution of mapping assertions, and data compression techniques for reducing the size of the main memory structures required to store intermediate results. In order to create a fair evaluation of the performance of the techniques developed in SDM-RDFizer v4.0, we implement an upgraded version of SDM-RDFizer v3.6 which includes the data compression technique developed in SDM-RDFizer v4.0; we call this engine SDM-RDFizer v4.0–. The planning and execution pipeline is implemented in Python 3. The compression techniques implemented in SDM-RDFizer v4.0– encode RDF resources generated during the KG creation process. For each RDF resource R, an identification number i is assigned to it. Thus, RDF triples are built not from RDF resources but the identification number. Moreover, each identification number i is encoded in Base36 to reduce the memory usage further. Base36 is an encoding scheme that transforms a string into a 36 characters representation. The characters used are the letters from A to Z and the numbers from 0 to 9. For example, the number ”95634785” is encoded as ”1KXS9T”. The SDM-RDFizer operators are adapted to consider this compression method, consuming less main memory. We consider two metrics to evaluate the efficiency of our proposed approach. Execution time is defined as the elapsed time required to generate the bushy tree and execute the corresponding physical plan used to create the KG. It is measured as the absolute wall-clock system time, as reported by the time command of the Linux operating system. The leaves of a bushy tree are executed in parallel, and execution of the leaves corresponds to the greatest execution time; execution time also includes the time of merging the results generated during the execution of the tree leaves. Memory consumption is determined as the amount of memory that is consumed during the generation of a KG. The memory usage is measured by using the tracemalloc library from Python . The get_traced_memory() method from tracemalloc returns the amount of memory currently being used. This method presents the memory usage in Kilobytes, for ease of use, it is converted into Megabytes. The timeout is five hours. The experiments are executed in an Intel(R) Xeon(R) equipped with a CPU E5-2603 v3 @ 1.60GHz 20 cores, 64GB memory and with the O.S. Ubuntu 16.04LTS.\nAll the resources used in the reported experimental study are publicly available .\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: selectivity of the results, and types of joins between mapping assertions.
