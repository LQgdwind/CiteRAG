      "content": "Paper Title: Channels of Small Log-Ratio Leakage and Characterization of Two-Party Differentially Private Computation An extended abstract of this work appeared in TCC 2019 [24]\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOblivious transfer protocols are also widely studies in their information theoretic forms  [ref]8   . In this form, and OT is simply a pair of jointly distributed random variable (Vùñ†,Vùñ°)subscriptùëâùñ†subscriptùëâùñ°(V_{\\mathsf{A}},V_{\\mathsf{B}}) (a ‚Äúchannel‚Äù). A pair of unbounded parties (ùñ†,ùñ°)ùñ†ùñ°(\\mathsf{A},\\mathsf{B}), having access to independent samples from this pair (from each sample (vùñ†,vùñ°)subscriptùë£ùñ†subscriptùë£ùñ°(v_{\\mathsf{A}},v_{\\mathsf{B}}), party ùñØùñØ\\mathsf{P} gets the value vùñØsubscriptùë£ùñØv_{\\mathsf{P}}). Interestingly, in the information theoretic form, we do have a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù notion of weak OT, that is complete: such a pair can either be used to construct full-fledged (information theoretically secure) OT, or is trivial‚Äîthere exists a protocol that generates these views. Unfortunately, these reductions are inherently inefficient: the parties wait till an event that might be of arbitrary small probability to occur, and thus, at least not in the most general form, cannot be translated into the computational setting. Amplifying the security of weak primitives into ‚Äúfully secure‚Äù ones is an important paradigm in cryptography as well as other key fields in theoretical computer science. Most notable such works in cryptography are amplification of one-way functions   , key-agreement protocols , and interactive arguments  . Among the above, amplification of key-agreement protocols (KA) is the most similar to the OT amplification we consider in this paper. In particular, we do have a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù (non distributional) notion of weak KA . This is done by reduction to the information theoretic notion of key-agreement. What enables this reduction to go through, is that unlike the case of the information theoretic OT, the amplification of information theoretic KA is efficient, since it only use the designated output of the (weak) KA (and not the parties‚Äô view). An accuracy parameter Œ±ùõº\\alpha is trivial with respect to¬†a given functionality fùëìf and differential privacy parameter œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon, if a protocol computing fùëìf with such accuracy and privacy exists information theoretically (i.e.,¬†with no computational assumptions). The accuracy parameter is called optimal, if it matches the bound achieved in the client-server model.\nGaps between the trivial and optimal accuracy parameters have been shown in the multiparty case for count queries¬†  and in the two-party case for inner product and Hamming distance functionalities¬†4.  showed that the same holds also when a random oracle is available to the parties, implying that non-trivial protocols (achieving non-trivial accuracy) for computing these functionalities cannot be black-box reduced to one-way functions.  initiated the study of Boolean functions, showing a gap between the optimal and trivial accuracy for the XOR or the AND functionalities, and that non-trivial protocols imply one-way functions. 0 showed that non-interactive randomised response is optimal among all the information theoretic protocols. 2 have shown that optimal protocols for computing the XOR or AND, cannot be black-box reduced to key agreement.  showed that an optimal protocol (with best possible parameters) computing the XOR can be viewed as a form of weak OT, which according to Wullschleger  yields full fledged OT. Whereas for our choice of parameters the security guarantee is too weak, and it is essential that we correctly amplify the security. Very recently,  showed that a non-trivial protocol for computing XOR (i.e.,¬†accuracy better than œµ2superscriptitalic-œµ2\\epsilon^{2}) implies infinitely often key-agreement protocols. Their reduction, however, only holds for constant value of œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon, and is non black box.\nFinally,  5 gave a criteria that proved the necessity of OT for computationally secure function evaluation, for a select class of functions.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Oblivious transfer protocols are also widely studies in their information theoretic forms  [ref]8   .
