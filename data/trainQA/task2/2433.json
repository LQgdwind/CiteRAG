      "content": "Paper Title: CREW: Computation Reuse and Efficient Weight Storage for Hardware-accelerated MLPs and RNNs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDNN Optimizations. Popular optimizations for reducing memory footprint and/or numerical precision of DNNs include clustering [ref]41 and quantization [ref]32. TTQ [ref]42, DoReFa  and LQNets  achieve important reductions in the numerical precision (i.e. <8​babsent8𝑏<8b) with small impact in accuracy loss. However, clustering and quantization techniques do not reduce the amount of computations, but storage requirements and/or the cost of the computations. CREW supports these optimizations and efficiently exploits the weight repetition originated from them to improve performance and energy efficiency. Pruning and Sparse Accelerators. Pruning   reduces the model size and the number of computations by removing connections/nodes depending on the weights’ values. The pruned model may loss accuracy but tends to regain it after retraining. On the other hand, the pruned model becomes sparse, requiring specialized hardware to be efficiently executed. Multiple sparse DNN accelerators    have been recently proposed. Some sparse accelerators, such as EIE , utilize clustering to further reduce weight storage, but do no explore ways to reuse computations as we propose in CREW. Note that CREW does not behave as a sparse accelerator since all weights are still processed in the form of small indexes and memoized products. Pruning is orthogonal to this work and could be applied to reduce the number of unique weights, further increasing the benefits of CREW. Computation Reuse. Several recent studies observed the increase in repeated weights and/or inputs and proposed algorithms to reuse computations. UCNN  and  perform factorization of repeated weights in CNNs to reduce computations. However, as discussed in this work, FC layers have different requirements, and the proposed mechanisms do not fully exploit the benefits of computation reuse. Reuse of partial products with repeated weights has been previously proposed in , where the output neurons of a given FC layer are clustered depending on their weights similarity, and the partial products may be reused inside a given cluster of neurons. Note that CREW does not limit the reuse on a given cluster of neurons but can reuse partial products on any output neuron of an FC layer. The work in  proposes RAPIDNN, an In-Memory Processing (PIM) accelerator inspired by memoization and computation reuse techniques. RAPIDNN uses clustering to statically generate a subset of the most representative inputs and weights, and memoizes all the possible partial product combinations. During inference, the inputs and weights are encoded by accessing lookup tables to select which partial products are accumulated for each output. Note that the partial products selected are always an approximation, which may impact the accuracy of the network. Compared to our work, we do not loss any accuracy by performing linear quantization, and we require fewer accesses to lookup tables since the integer accumulation with our dataflow is efficiently performed in a systolic array architecture. On the other hand, a different approach is to exploit the repetition or similarity of input activations. Deep Reuse  and  detect similarities between vectors of inputs in a given CNN layer to approximate computations, while a recent proposal  exploits the similarity between consecutive frames of audio/video to reuse computations of consecutive executions of a given layer. These proposals do not exploit repeated weights and are orthogonal to our work.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: DNN Optimizations.
