      "content": "Paper Title: Not All Fabrics Are Created Equal: Exploring eFPGA Parameters For IP Redaction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor insight into the security offered by using eFPGA-based redaction, we explore SAT-attack resilience of the various fabrics (as described earlier in Section III-C), as this has been used to gauge the security of redaction in prior work  and has proven to be a challenge to overcome for prior IP protection approaches . Previous work suggests that large FPGA bitstream lengths make SAT-based attacks impractical [ref]7 and the evaluation results in   appear to support this claim. As we want to investigate how structural variations of the eFPGA contribute to complexity parameters of SAT-based attacks, we perform a security evaluation by launching a SAT-based attack on the fabrics described in Section III-C.\nIn our analyses, we assume that the designers already know which parts of the design must be protected to stay competitive in the market.\nHence, this paper does not address the selection of the modules to be redacted; we assume that a given fabric is already selected as sufficient for their desired redaction.\nFor worst-case analysis, our threat model overwhelmingly favors the attacker.\nWe assume the attacker has access to the redacted IC’s netlist and to a fully-scanned111For those unfamiliar with Design-for-Test concepts, a fully-scanned design means that all flip-flops have been replaced with scan flip-flops that are connected to each other into a long scan chain, essentially acting as a large shift register. A tester is able to scan-in values and then scan-out the combinational logic outputs a clock cycle later, thus deducing the input/output relationship for the logic in the design. and fully-unlocked design (i.e., access to an Oracle with the bitstream loaded). The adversary has to override three challenges before they can launch a SAT-based attack on eFPGA fabric.\nFirst, they have to isolate the eFPGA fabric from the rest of the IP; this is possible since the regular structure of the fabric is distinguishable from the rest of the design. Second, for the Oracle, the adversary should have complete control over the inputs, outputs and internal flip-flops, excluding configurable flip-flops.\nWe endow the attacker with these capabilities although there are orthogonal efforts to mitigate this Oracle-based threat model .\nThird, the adversary cannot extract the FPGA bitstream [ref]7, i.e., the attacker does not have access to the configuration flip-flops, so cannot simply steal the bitstream directly.\nWhile there are a number of attacks on FPGA security , we consider such attacks orthogonal to this study.\nPhysical attacks (e.g., optical probing [ref]41) are out of scope.\nOur threat model and assumptions are consistent with prior work .\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: redaction in prior work  and has proven to be a challenge to overcome for prior IP protection approaches .
