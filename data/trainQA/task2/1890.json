      "content": "Paper Title: Conditional Variational Capsule Network for Open Set Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOver the past decade, deep learning has become the dominant approach in many computer vision problems, achieving spectacular results on many visual recognition tasks  [ref]27  .\nHowever, most of these results have been obtained in a closed set scenario, where a critical assumption is that all samples should belong to at least one labeled category.\nWhen observing a sample from an unknown category, closed-set approaches are forced to choose a class label from one of the known classes, thus limiting their applicability in dynamic and ever-changing scenarios. To overcome such a limitation, open set recognition has been introduced to enable a classification system to identify all of known categories, while simultaneously detecting unknown test samples  [ref]1.\nIn the open set scenario, samples included/excluded in label space are referred to as knowns/unknowns.\nTherefore, open set classifiers need to use incomplete knowledge learned from a finite set of accessible categories to devise effective representations able to separate knowns from unknowns.\nEarly works have identified this issue, thus proposing methods employing different thresholding strategies for rejection of unknowns  [ref]1. Deep neural networks, despite demonstrating strong capabilities in learning discriminative representations in closed scenarios, show accuracy degradation within open set settings [ref]2.\nAs a naive strategy, modeling a threshold for Softmax outputs has been demonstrated to be a sub-optimal solution for deep neural networks to identify unknowns. Thus the Extreme Value Theory was introduced to better adapt these discriminative models, fully based on supervised learning, for open-set settings. The underpinning idea is to calibrate Softmax scores so to estimate the probability of unknowns  [ref]2. In addition to deep discriminative models, deep generative models focusing on learning efficient latent feature representations by unsupervised leaning, have been widely utilized in open-set recognition tasks, and have gained successes one after the other    .\nIn particular, The Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) is a typical probabilistic generative model ideal for detecting unknowns, due to its ability in learning low-dimensional representations in latent space not only supporting input reconstruction but also approximating a specified prior distribution. On the other hand, the VAE-based models may be not sufficiently effective for identifying known categories as all feature representations only follow one distribution. To this end, we employ a Conditional VAE (CVAE) that uses multiple prior distributions for modeling the known classes, and indirectly the unknown counterpart. Furthermore, we propose to represent the input samples with probabilistic capsules, given their already proved representation power capability  . Capsule Networks (CapsNet)  were proposed as an alternative to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).\nUnlike CNNs’ scalar neurons, capsules ensemble a group of neurons to accept and output vectors. The vector of an activated capsule represents the various properties of a particular object, such as position, size, orientation, texture, etc. In essence, CapsNet can be viewed as an encoder encoding objects by distributed representations, which is exponentially more efficient than encoding them by activating a single neuron in a high-dimensional space. Besides, CapsNet has been successfully used to detect fake images and videos in a task setting similar to open set recognition .\nThis motivated us to design a novel capsule network architecture in combination with CVAE for the open set recognition problem, dubbed CVAECapOSR, that is depicted in Figure 1. The contributions of this paper are three-fold:\ni) We present a novel open set recognition framework based on CapsNet and show its advantages for learning an efficient representation for known classes.\nii) We integrate CapsNet and conditional VAEs. In contrast to general VAEs that encourage the latent representation to approximate a single prior distribution, our model exploits multiple priors (i.e. one for each class), and it forces the latent representation to follow the gaussian prior selected by the class of the input sample.\niii) We conduct extensive experiments on all the standard datasets used for open set recognition, obtaining very competitive results, that in several cases outperform previous state of the art methods by a large margin.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: Over the past decade, deep learning has become the dominant approach in many computer vision problems, achieving spectacular results on many visual recognition tasks  [ref]27  .\nHowever, most of these results have been obtained in a closed set scenario, where a critical assumption is that all samples should belong to at least one labeled category.\nWhen observing a\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
