      "content": "Paper Title: X&Fuse: Fusing Visual Information in Text-to-Image Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nState-of-the-art text-to-image generation models are improving in a rapid pace, mainly as a result of the (i) emergence of new large-scale training datasets  0 , (ii) adaptation of large scale models 0  [ref]30, and (iii) rise of new modeling approaches 0  .\nHowever, those modeling approaches often restrict the model to textual inputs 0    [ref]30. In this work, we focus on the potential of utilizing additional visual inputs, and suggest a general approach, suitable for various text-to-image scenarios that may benefit from such visual cues. Retrieval Augmented Diffusion Models \nSeveral works tried to augment the generation process of diffusion models with retrieved images  . However, unlike our work, they mostly use retrieval to facilitate textless training, or influence the style of an image 2, rather than improving results over text-based training.\nMoreover, these methods use CLIP 8 embeddings to represent the conditioned image. Thus, they are both limited by the bottleneck representation that may lose information, and are processed independently of the text, noised image, and even the task at hand.\nWe, on the other hand, suggest an approach that alleviates those shortcomings, and therefore, are able to improve performance over models that are restricted to textual inputs (see Sec. 3.2 and Tab. 2). Subject-Driven Generation \nRecently,  4 introduced the task of subject-driven generation, and used textual inversion  4 to tackle the task. Roughly speaking, in textual inversion, an embedding vector that represents a specific object is learned. Then, the learned vector is used to generate new images with properties derived from the set of images.\nWhile  4 presented impressive qualitative results, textual inversion requires learning the new subject at inference time, which may take more than fifteen minutes for a single subject.\nOn the other hand, we pretrain our model on the task at hand, and therefore require only a few seconds to generate a new subject image. Scene-Based Generation \nScene-based generation was first introduced by , as a text-to-image scenario that additionally enables the user to specify the scene (layout and objects) of the generated image, and therefore, offers much more fine-grained control over the generated image.\nUnlike previous work, we condition our model on an RGB image of the scene, and showcase the applicability of X&Fuse as a general approach that can be used to condition on different types of visual information.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: text-to-image generation models are improving in a rapid pace, mainly as a result of the (i) emergence of new large-scale training datasets  0 , (ii) adaptation of large scale models 0  [ref]30, and (iii) rise of new modeling approaches 0  .\nHowever, those modeling approaches often restrict the model to textual inputs 0    [ref]30.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
