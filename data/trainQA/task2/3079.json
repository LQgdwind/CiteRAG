      "content": "Paper Title: Calibrated Diffusion Tensor Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe propose a two-branch deep neural network to compute the diffusion tensor and estimation uncertainty in a single framework (Figure 1). The main branch is a fully convolutional network (FCN) with an encoder-decoder architecture. Compared with a standard UNet, this architecture has additional dense connections between different stages of the encoder section. The exact network architecture is not the focus of this study. The main point is that for accurate tensor estimation we would like a model that can learn spatial correlations. Our experiments have shown that a model that works on a single voxel or a very small patch has significantly lower estimation accuracy than a model that works on large input patches. Our network takes 483superscript48348^{3}-voxel patches as input and computes the diffusion tensor for all voxels in that patch. The uncertainty estimation branch, on the other hand, consists of a series of convolutions with a kernel size of one. In other words, this branch only uses 1D convolutions. This is to ensure that the uncertainty estimated for each voxel depends on the signal in that voxel alone, because we want this branch to estimate data-dependent/aleatoric uncertainty. The network details are shown in Figure 1. The idea of training a neural network to estimate both a signal mean and signal variance is old [ref]38. Recent DL works have also used similar techniques for classification and regression applications  . However, those works have employed a single network backbone with a final network section that splits into two heads to estimate the target variable and uncertainty. Our model, on the other hand, has two separate branches as justified above. Given an input dMRI patch x∈I​Rn,n,n,m𝑥IsuperscriptR𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑚x\\in{\\rm I\\!R}^{n,n,n,m}, the network predicts the tensor and voxel-wise estimation uncertainty, respectively y∈I​Rn,n,n,6𝑦IsuperscriptR𝑛𝑛𝑛6y\\in{\\rm I\\!R}^{n,n,n,6} and u∈I​Rn,n,n𝑢IsuperscriptR𝑛𝑛𝑛u\\in{\\rm I\\!R}^{n,n,n}, for that patch. We train the network to jointly estimate both the tensor values and the estimation uncertainty using the following loss function: Indices i𝑖i and j𝑗j refer to voxels and tensor elements, respectively. Moreover, θ𝜃\\theta denotes the network parameters, ygsubscript𝑦𝑔y_{g} denotes the ground truth tensor, and λ𝜆\\lambda is the regularization constant, which was set to empirically-selected value of 1 in all our experiments. This loss function is similar to both the learned loss attenuation   and prediction interval-based loss functions [ref]19 proposed in prior works. The intuition behind this loss function is to allow the model to incur a smaller estimation error loss for less certain voxels at the cost of an uncertainty penalty. A similar loss can be derived based on data log-likelihood, assuming a Gaussian noise distribution  . Compared with the loss functions based on prediction intervals [ref]19 , the first and the second terms in Eq. (5) are related to PICP and MPIW, respectively. Note that u𝑢u estimated above can only represent the data-dependent (aleatoric) uncertainty. To compute the model/epistemic uncertainty, we use Monte-Carlo dropout  . We train the main branch of the network using a dropout rate of 0.90 (chosen empirically) in all layers. On a test dMRI volume, we compute 100 different tensor values by generating random dropout masks. From these 100 tensor estimates, we compute the cone of uncertainty as the 95 percentile of the variation in the orientation of the major tensor eigenvector , which we denote as θ95DLsuperscriptsubscript𝜃95DL\\theta_{95}^{\\text{DL}}. As commonly done in bootstrap methods  as well as in prior DTI estimation studies  , we compute the standard deviation in the FA and MD values of the 100 tensors as a measure of uncertainty in these parameters. We denote these as σDL​(FA)superscript𝜎DLFA\\sigma^{\\text{DL}}(\\text{FA}) and σDL​(MD)superscript𝜎DLMD\\sigma^{\\text{DL}}(\\text{MD}), respectively. To quantify subject/scan-level uncertainty, we compute the average over the entire brain volume.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: branch to estimate data-dependent/aleatoric uncertainty.
