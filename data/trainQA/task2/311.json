      "content": "Paper Title: Explainable Image Classification with Evidence Counterfactual\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLIME [ref]22 and the model-agnostic implementation of SHAP  are two comparable methods that can be used to generate instance-level explanations for image classification.\nFor both methods, an image of interest is segmented, a number of perturbed samples are created by switching off segments, and these samples are predicted by the original classification model.\nIn LIME, the predictions of this artificial data set are then used as labels to train an interpretable linear model.\nThe samples are weighted according to the proximity to the instance of relevance.\nIn SHAP, Shapley values of the segments are approximated, which reflect their contribution to the prediction.\nThe interpretable (linear) model around the prediction (LIME) or the Shapley values (SHAP) can be translated into a segment importance ranking.\nFinally, a visual explanation can be obtained by showing the most (and least) important segments of the image.\nThe model-agnostic approach of these methods offers a high flexibility regarding data and model types.\nHowever, an important issue for these approaches is that the resulting explanations are found to be unstable.\nSmall perturbations of an image with little or no impact on the model prediction, can lead to considerably different explanations .\nAnother source of instability is the random sampling process to generate image perturbations.\nThis can lead to different explanations for a given image and a given model, which is clearly undesirable. Another strategy to create instance-level explanations is calculating the importance of the individual input pixels for a certain class.\nThese can be translated into visual explanations by creating heat maps.\nOne approach is the local perturbation of images and the direct measurement of the influence on prediction scores.\nZeiler and Fergus [ref]28 measure the impact of graying out squared segments in an image to identify the most important pixels supporting a certain class.\nA comparable method is used by Zintgraf et al.  who replace squared segments by using conditional sampling, instead of graying them out.\nA second approach is taken by Bach et al.  who introduce Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) as a model-specific method to create instance-level explanations for neural networks.\nThe importance of individual input pixels for a certain class is calculated by redistributing the prediction scores backwards through the network.\nCompared to the first approach where every perturbation must be evaluated by the model, LRP is computationally more efficient because only one forward and one backward pass are needed for an image.\nA disadvantage of these pixel-wise heat map methods is the low abstraction level of the explanations [ref]7.\nSince individual pixels are typically meaningless for humans, it is not always straightforward to derive interpretable concepts from it. Common to the methods outlined above is that they generate explanations in the form of a feature importance for the prediction of interest.\nThe features can be either individual pixels or pixel segments.\nAs argued by Fernandez et al. , a disadvantage of such rankings is that they do not reveal what is minimally needed to alter a prediction.\nThis relates to the fact that the size of an explanation (number of pixels or segments) is not optimized, since only a relative importance ordering is provided.\nA second drawback is that these rankings do not account for features being dependent on each other for the prediction .\nFor instance, it is possible that a certain segment is only important due to the presence of another segment (that is possibly lower-ranked).\nThese dynamics cannot be derived solely from the ordered features.\nAs a third drawback we refer to the fact that importance rankings relate to one prediction class, which is insufficient when one wants to know why a class is chosen over another in case of multiclass classification.\nThey give an idea of evidence for or against this class, without making a direct link with other possible classes.\nAlthough it is possible to create rankings for different prediction classes, it is not always straightforward to delineate the discriminative features (which we illustrate in Section 4).\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: LIME [ref]22 and the model-agnostic implementation of SHAP  are two comparable methods that can be used to generate instance-level explanations for image classification.\nFor both methods, an image of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
