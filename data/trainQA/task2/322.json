      "content": "Paper Title: Network-Aware Optimization of Distributed Learning for Fog Computing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn classical distributed learning, “workers” each compute a parameter value from their local data. These results are aggregated at a central server, and updated parameter values are sent to the workers for the next round of local computations. Several works have considered how network topologies can affect ML training.\nSpecifically,  optimizes decentralized training of linear models when workers exchange parameters with their neighbors instead of a central server, while [ref]14 studied D2D (device-to-device) message passing that emulates global communications with a server, and [ref]15 optimizes performance when communications can fail.\nIn fog networks, devices may not have the resources to send updates to a server at every time period , so we focus on the newer federated learning methodology for distributed model training. Devices in federated learning perform a series of local updates between aggregations, and send their resulting model updates to the server [ref]16  . This framework preserves user privacy by keeping data at local devices  and reduces the amount of communication between devices and the central server. Since its proposition in , federated learning has generated significant research interest; see  for a comprehensive survey. Compared to traditional distributed learning, federated learning introduces two new challenges: firstly, data may not be identically and independently distributed as devices locally generate the samples they process; and secondly, in fog/edge networks, devices may have limited ability to perform and communicate local updates due to resource constraints. Many works have attempted to address the first challenge; for instance,  trains user-specific models within a multi-task learning framework, while  showed that sharing small subsets of user data can significantly increase the accuracy of a single model. Recent efforts have also considered optimizing the frequency of parameter aggregations according to a fixed budget of network and computing resources , or adopting a peer-to-peer decentralized learning framework . Our work is more related to the second challenge of resource heterogeneity. Existing works have focused on minimizing the communication costs between the workers and the server. Specifically,  proposes to reduce uplink costs by restricting and compressing the parameter space prior to transmission.  proposes a method for thresholding updates for transmission, while the method in  only communicates the most important individual gradient results, which  extends to compress both downlink and uplink communication. To reduce the number of uplink transfers,   aggregate subsets of the network. For wireless networks in particular,  proposes methods to minimize power consumption and training time. Unlike these works, we focus on the network topology between nodes to optimize the tradeoffs among communication, computation, and model performance in federated learning. Specifically, our work leverages D2D communications for offloading data from resource-constrained to resource-rich nodes, as is present in new 5G and IoT network technologies . In integrating D2D offloading with federated learning, we derive novel results on optimizing the distribution of data processing over a fog computing system to train ML models.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: network topologies can affect ML training.\nSpecifically,  optimizes decentralized training of linear models when workers exchange parameters with their neighbors instead of a central server, while [ref]14 studied D2D (device-to-device) message passing that emulates global communications with a server, and [ref]15 optimizes performance when communications can fail.\nIn fog networks, devices may\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
