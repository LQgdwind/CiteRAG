      "content": "Paper Title: Convolutional Complex Knowledge Graph Embeddings\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe selected the hyperparameters of ConEx based on the MRR score obtained on the validation set of WN18RR. Hence, we evaluated the link prediction performance of ConEx on FB15K-237, YAGO3-10, WN18 and FB15K by using the best hyperparameter configuration found on WN18RR. This decision stems from the fact that we aim to reduce the impact of extensive hyperparameter optimization on the reported results and the C‚ÄãO2ùê∂subscriptùëÇ2CO_{2} emission caused through relying on the findings of previously works¬†. Strubell et al.¬†[ref]30 highlighted the substantial energy consumption of performing extensive hyperparameter optimization. Moreover, Ruffinelli et al.¬† showed that model configurations can be found by exploring relatively few random samples from a large hyperparameter space. With these considerations, we determined the ranges of hyperparameters for the grid search algorithm optimizer based on their best hyperparameter setting for ConvE (see Table 8 in¬†). Specifically, the ranges of the hyperparameters were defined as follows: dùëëd: {100,200}100200\\{100,200\\}; dropout rate:{.3,.4}.3.4\\{.3,.4\\} for the input; dropout rate: {.4,.5}.4.5\\{.4,.5\\} for the feature map; label smoothing: {.1}.1\\{.1\\} and the number of output channels in the convolution operation: {16,32}1632\\{16,32\\}; the batch size: {1024}1024\\{1024\\}; the learning rate: {.001}.001\\{.001\\}. After determining the best hyperparameters based on the MRR on the validation dataset; we retrained ConEx with these hyperparameters on the combination of train and valid sets as applied in¬†[ref]17. Motivated by the experimental setups for ResNet¬† and AlexNet¬†[ref]19, we were interested in quantifying the impact of ensemble learning on the link prediction performances. Ensemble learning refers to learning a weighted combination of learning algorithms. In our case, we generated ensembles of models by averaging the predictions of said models.444Ergo, the weights for models were set to 1 (see the section 16.6 in¬† for more details.) To this end, we re-evaluated state-of-the-art models, including TucKER, DistMult and ComplEx on the combination of train and validation sets of benchmark datasets. Therewith, we were also able to quantify the impact of training state-of-the-art models on the combination of train and validation sets. Moreover, we noticed that link prediction performances of DistMult and ComplEx, on the YAGO3-10 dataset were reported without employing new training strategies (KvsAll, the reciprocal data augmentation, the batch normalization, and the ADAM optimizer). Hence, we trained DistMult, ComplEx on YAGO3-10 with these strategies.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: the impact of extensive hyperparameter optimization on the reported results and the C‚ÄãO2ùê∂subscriptùëÇ2CO_{2} emission caused through relying on the findings of previously works¬†.
