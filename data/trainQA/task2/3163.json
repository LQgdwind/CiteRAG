      "content": "Paper Title: Phase Transition of the 3-Majority Dynamics with Uniform Communication Noise\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe study of the 3-Majority dynamics arises on the ground of the results obtained for the Median dynamics in . The Median dynamics considers a totally ordered opinion set, in which each agent pulls two neighbor opinions i,j𝑖𝑗i,j u.a.r. and then updates its opinion k𝑘k to the median between i,j𝑖𝑗i,j, and k𝑘k. The dynamics turns out to be a fault-taulerant, efficient dynamics for the majority consensus problem. However, as pointed out in , the Median dynamics may not guarantee with high probability convergence to a valid opinion in case of the presence of an adversary, which is needed for the consensus problem. Moreover, the opinion set must have an ordering, property that might not be met by applicative scenarios such as biological systems . These facts naturally lead researchers to look for efficient dynamics that satisfy the above requirements. To the best of our knowledge,  is the first work analyzing the hℎh-Majority dynamics. In detail, in the hℎh-Majority dynamics we have n𝑛n nodes and, at every round, every node pulls the opinion from hℎh random neighbors and sets his new opinion to the majority one (ties are broken arbitrarily).\nMore extensive characterizations of the 3-Majority dynamics over the complete graph are given in [ref]7 0  . In [ref]7\nit is shown that the 3-Majority dynamics is a fast, fault-tolerant protocol for (valid) majority consensus in the case of k≥2𝑘2k\\geq 2 colors, provided that there is an initial bias towards some majority opinion. Furthermore, [ref]7 shows an exponential time-gap between the 3-Majority consensus process and the median process in , thus establishing its efficiency.\nIn , the analysis is extended to any (even balanced) initial configuration in the many-color case, in the presence of an different kind of bounded adversaries. The authors of  emphasize how the absence of an initial majority opinion considerably complicates the analysis, in that it must be proved that the process breaks the initial symmetry despite the presence of the adversary. Indeed, before the symmetry breaking, the adversary is more likely to cause undesired behaviors.\nThe strongest result about the convergence of the 3-Majority is that in . The authors show that in the case of k𝑘k opinions, the process converges in time O​(k​log⁡n)𝑂𝑘𝑛O(k\\log n) rounds, and it is tight when k=O​(n)𝑘𝑂𝑛k=O(\\sqrt{n}).\nThe 3-Majority dynamics is also studied in different topologies:  analyzes the 3-Majority process in graphs of minimum degree nαsuperscript𝑛𝛼n^{\\alpha}, with α=Ω​((log⁡log⁡n)−1)𝛼Ωsuperscript𝑛1\\alpha=\\Omega\\left((\\log\\log n)^{-1}\\right), starting from random biased binary configurations.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: from hℎh random neighbors and sets his new opinion to the majority one (ties are broken arbitrarily).\nMore extensive characterizations of the 3-Majority dynamics over the complete graph are given in [ref]7 0  .
