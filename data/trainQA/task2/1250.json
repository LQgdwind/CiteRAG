      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Characterize Matching Experts\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe propose feature encoding of a human matcher, Φ:𝒟→I​R:Φ→𝒟IR\\Phi:\\cal{D}\\rightarrow{\\rm I\\!R}d that maps a pair of decision history H𝐻H and movement map G𝐺G (see Section II-A) into a d𝑑d dimensional feature vector. In what follows we suggest feature sets that serve at enhancing the ability to predict each of the four decision measures, grounding them in the relevant research areas. When designing the features, we make extensive use of the matching matrix (final decisions), the decision history (decision paths), and movement map (movement patterns). We note that some features may be predictive of more than one decision measure. Figure 7 summarizes the proposed feature sets and full details are given in our repository.555https://github.com/shraga89/MED/blob/master/Featuresets.md Precision Features: Matching predictors were suggested for match evaluation when a reference match is unavailable . A matching predictor is a function that quantifies the quality of a match (given as a matching matrix). For example, a dominants predictor measures the proportion of dominant element pairs, i.e., having highest value in their respective row and column. Matching predictors study yield observations regarding their varying usability towards precision or recall. Recently, matching predictors were suggested as features in learning to rerank schema matches (LRSM) . We use the matching matrix (computed from the history H𝐻H, see Section II-A2) to generate matching predictors features, denoted as ΦL​R​S​M​(H)subscriptΦ𝐿𝑅𝑆𝑀𝐻\\Phi_{LRSM}(H). We rely on Sagi et al.  when choosing precision-oriented predictors. Thoroughness Features: Similarly to precision features, we use matching predictors to encode thoroughness features, focusing on predictors that were shown in the literature to lean towards higher recall. Specifically, predictors that capture negative characteristics such as uncertainty, diversity, and variability were shown to correlate with recall (and negatively correlate with precision). For example, matrix norm predictors  are used to quantify the amount of error in the matching matrix, which can be attributed to uncertainty. Correlation Features: Match consistency quantifies the extent to which a human matcher produces consistent matches , highlighting human biases in the matching process. We create correlation features based on two consistency dimensions, namely, temporal and consensuality, which were shown to be predictive in terms of confidence and quality. The temporal dimension measures matching time and consensuality assesses the agreement among matchers. The predictive power of consistency analysis concerning confidence makes it effective for correlation features. Calibration Features: Calibration aims at qualifying matchers as experts by observing the dynamics of their matching. Therefore, calibration features naturally relate to the decision history H𝐻H and movement map M𝑀M. Calibration features are grouped into three feature groups, as follows. Aggregated features are extracted from the matching decision history (ΦB​e​h​(H)subscriptΦ𝐵𝑒ℎ𝐻\\Phi_{Beh}(H)) and the movement map (ΦM​o​u​(G)subscriptΦ𝑀𝑜𝑢𝐺\\Phi_{Mou}(G)). ΦB​e​h​(H)subscriptΦ𝐵𝑒ℎ𝐻\\Phi_{Beh}(H) contains aggregations over confidence, decision times, and the number of changed matching decisions. For ΦM​o​u​(G)subscriptΦ𝑀𝑜𝑢𝐺\\Phi_{Mou}(G), we follow  [ref]44 9 to extact features. Sequential features (ΦS​e​q​(H)subscriptΦ𝑆𝑒𝑞𝐻\\Phi_{Seq}(H)) examine the sequential decision making of a matcher through her declared confidence levels, the time spent until reaching a decision, and the extent of agreement with other matchers. Sequential processing of the matching process aims to capture development (decline) in the matchers behavior. Spatial features (ΦS​p​a​(G)subscriptΦ𝑆𝑝𝑎𝐺\\Phi_{Spa}(G)) capture human matcher movement using its movement map G𝐺G.666ΦS​e​q​(H)subscriptΦ𝑆𝑒𝑞𝐻\\Phi_{Seq}(H) and ΦS​p​a​(G)subscriptΦ𝑆𝑝𝑎𝐺\\Phi_{Spa}(G) are described in more details in the context of the algorithm in the next section.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: ΦB​e​h​(H)subscriptΦ𝐵𝑒ℎ𝐻\\Phi_{Beh}(H) contains aggregations over confidence, decision times, and the number of changed matching decisions.
