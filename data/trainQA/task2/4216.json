      "content": "Paper Title: pyKT: A Python Library to Benchmark Deep Learning based Knowledge Tracing Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo carefully assess the progress of DLKT model-wise and application-wise, we surveyed existing DLKT related publications in top AI/ML venues333Venues include NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI, IJCAI, KDD, WWW, SIGIR, MM, WSDM, ICDM, CIKM. from 2015-2021444The very first deep knowledge tracing model is proposed by Piech et al. at NIPS 2015 [ref]25. and collected all the baselines compared in these research works and selected the most frequently mentioned DLKT baselines as our representative DLKT methods555The comprehensive DLKT baseline frequency summary is listed in Appendix A.1.. In addition, we include some recently proposed approaches to cover a very wide range of DLKT models with different design focus. Please note that there are a few newly developed DLKT focusing on either utilizing more auxiliary information such as LPKT that utilizes time spent on questions , or solving data isolation problems in KT via federated learning . The generalization of these approaches are limited to specific datasets and are out of scope in this paper. These representative DLKT methods666We also include detailed model explanation in the pyKT library docs at https://pykt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models.html. can be categorized as follows: Deep sequential models: the chronologically ordered interaction sequence is captured by deep sequential models such as LSTM and GRU  2     [ref]25  5. Selected approaches are DKT [ref]25, DKT+ 5, DKT-F , and KQN . DKT: leverages an LSTM layer to encode the student knowledge state to predict the students’ response performances [ref]25. DKT+: an improved version of DKT to solve the reconstruction and non-consistent prediction problems 5. DKT-F: an extension of DKT that model the students’ forgetting behaviors . KQN: uses student knowledge state encoder and skill encoder to predict the student response performance via the dot product . Memory augmented models: the latent relations between KCs are explicitly modeled by an external memory that is updated iteratively   6. Selected approach is DKVMN 6. DKVMN: designs a static key matrix to store the relations between the different KCs and a dynamic value matrix to update the students’ knowledge state 6. Adversarial based models: the adversarial training techniques such as adversarial perturbations are applied into the original student interaction sequence to reduce the risk of DLKT overfitting and limited generalization problem 2. Selected approach is ATKT 2. ATKT: performs adversarial perturbations into student interaction sequence to improve DLKT model’s generalization ability 2. Graph based models: the response interactions between students and questions and the knowledge associations between questions and KCs form a tripartite graph and graph based techniques are applied to aggregate such relations   4. Selected approach is GKT . GKT: utilizes the graph structure to predict the student response performance . Attention based models: dependence between interactions is captured by the attention mechanism and its variants 0   7. Selected approaches are AKT 0, SAKT  and SAINT . AKT: leverages an attention mechanism to characterize the time distance between questions and the past interaction of students 0. SAKT: utilizes a self-attention mechanism to capture relations between exercises and the student responses . SAINT: uses the Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture to capture students’ exercise and response sequences . Please note that the above categorizations are not exclusive and related techniques can be combined. For example, Ghodai and Qing proposed a sequential key-value memory network to unify the strengths of recurrent modeling capacity and memory capacity .\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: venues333Venues include NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI, IJCAI, KDD, WWW, SIGIR, MM, WSDM, ICDM, CIKM. from 2015-2021444The very first deep knowledge tracing model is proposed by Piech et al. at NIPS 2015 [ref]25. and collected all the baselines compared in these research works and selected the most frequently mentioned DLKT baselines as our representative DLKT methods555The comprehensive DLKT\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
