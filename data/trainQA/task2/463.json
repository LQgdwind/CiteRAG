Work supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) under grant no. PR1266/4-1, Conflict resolution and causal inference with integrated socio-technical models.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are three versions of HP (original 2001, updated 2005, modified 2015 ) . We use the latest because it solves issues with the previous versions, and reduces the complexity . To the best of our knowledge, no previous work tackled the implementation of the (modified) HP. Still, we discuss the implementations of previous versions. Previous work has proposed simplified adaptations of the definition for various applications. First, in the domain of databases [ref]28  , (updated) HP was utilized to explain conjunctive query results. The approaches heavily depend on the correspondence between causes and domain-specific concepts such as lineage, database repairs, and denial constraints. The simplification in that line of work is the limitation to a single-equation causal model based on the lineage of the query in [ref]28, or no-equation model in  , in addition to the elimination of preemption treatment.\nSimilar simplification has been made for Boolean circuits in . Second, in the context of software and hardware verification, (updated) HP is used to explain counterexamples returned by a model checker . The authors also restricted the definition to singleton causes and no-equation models. Third, in  , the authors adapted HP to debug models of safety-critical systems.\nSimilar to our approach, all the papers above use acyclic binary models. However, they depend heavily on the correspondence between causes and domain-specific concepts. Also, for efficiency, they relax the definition by restricting the model, i.e., one equation[ref]28, no-equations   ,\nor by restricting the cause, i.e., singleton¬† ; the complexity is then relaxed, because AC2 is straightforward (no W‚Üí‚Üíùëä\\vec{W}) or AC3 is not needed. While such limitations are sufficient for the particular use-case, we argue that they cannot be used outside their respective domains, e.g., for accountability. In contrast, our approach is a general method to automate HP. We focus on the minimality, which, to the best of our knowledge, no previous work has tackled. We employ optimization solving, which was not utilized before in this context. Alternatively, previous work used SAT directly [ref]18, indirectly , or answer set programming .\nSharing our generality, Hopkins proposed methods to check (original) HP using search-based algorithms¬†. Our approach scales to thousands of variables, while the results presented in the search-based approaches showed a limit of 30 variables. Fault tree analysis (FTA) is an established design-time method to analyze safety risks of a system [ref]32. FTA‚Äôs primary analysis is the computation of minimal cut sets MCSs of a fault tee; a CS is a set of events that, together, cause the top-level event.\nApproaches to determine MCS use Boolean manipulation, or Binary decision diagrams [ref]32. These methods are similar to our computations; however, the conceptual difference is the definition of a cause. While a cause covers two notions: sufficiency and necessity, a CS presents a sufficient cause only. The occurrence of the events in the cut leads to the occurrence of the top-level event. This roughly corresponds to AC1, while the minimality of the cut set corresponds to AC3. The difference lies in the necessity of the cause (AC2). An MCS computation does not include this step, which is the core of actual causality computation. Cut sets are all the enumerations that make the effect true. Similarly, model-based diagnosis (MBD) aims to detect faulty components to explain anomalies in system behavior . The model is a set of logical expressions over a set of components. MBD requires a set of observations that correspond to the context U‚Üí‚Üíùëà\\vec{U}; using logical inference, MBD outputs a set of hypotheses for how the system differs from its model, i.e., diagnoses. While MBD can be considered as an approach to infer causality, it does not require counterfactuality of the cause. Although MBD uses a notion of intervention (setting some components to abnormal), this is not counterfactual reasoning. Instead, it is a sufficiency check since MBD uses a behavioral model, i.e., a representation of the correct behavior. Like FTA, diagnoses are sufficient causes, but not actual causes.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: HP.
