      "content": "Paper Title: Algebraic Language Theory with Effects\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nProbabilistic finite automata (PFAs)  extend classical finite automata\nby probabilistic effects, and thus serve as a natural model of state-based computations that involve uncertainty or randomization. These arise in many application domains  , as witnessed, e.g., by the wide range and success of probabilistic model checkers  . On the theoretical side, PFAs share some remarkable similarities with finite automata; in particular, machine-independent characterizations of PFA-computable languages in terms of probabilistic regular expressions [ref]19  and probabilistic monadic second-order logic  are known. However, there is one fundamental perspective on finite automata that so far has withstood a probabilistic generalization: that of algebraic language theory. The algebraic approach to finite automata rests on the observation that regular languages (the languages accepted by finite automata) coincide with the languages recognized by finite monoids via monoid morphisms. This provides the basis for investigating complex properties of languages with algebraic, e.g. semigroup-theoretic, methods. A prime example is the celebrated result by McNaughton, Papert, and Schützenberger   that a regular language is definable in first-order logic over finite words iff its syntactic monoid (the minimal monoid recognizing the language) is aperiodic. Since the latter property is easy to verify, this implies decidability of first-order definability. Similar characterizations and decidability results are known for numerous subclasses of regular languages   . Moreover, the automata/monoid correspondence has been generalized beyond regular languages, including to ω𝜔\\omega-regular languages  , languages of words over linear orders  [ref]11, data languages , tree languages    , cost functions  and weighted languages over commutative rings . In this paper, we develop a corresponding algebraic approach to probabilistic finite automata and their languages. For that purpose, we introduce two different modes of probabilistic algebraic recognition, both of which are natural probabilistic generalizations of classical recognition by finite monoids: recognition by finite monoids via probabilistic monoid morphisms; recognition by convex monoids based on finitely generated convex sets. The first mode emphasizes the effectful nature of probabilistic languages, while the second one relies on traditional universal algebra. Both modes are shown to be equivalent, which leads to two different algebraic characterizations of PFA-computable languages (Theorems 3.10 and 3.17). In fact, we will demonstrate that the above equivalence can be established, and is best understood, at the far more general level of automata with generic computational effects given by a monad 𝕋𝕋\\mathbb{T}  . This class of automata forms a common generalization of a wide range of automata models: besides PFAs (corresponding to choosing 𝕋𝕋\\mathbb{T} as the finite distribution monad) it also covers, e.g., nondeterministic probabilistic automata [ref]32, weighted automata , and even pushdown automata and Turing machines . In Section 4 we investigate analogues of the above two modes of recognition for 𝕋𝕋\\mathbb{T}-effectful languages, where probabilistic monoid morphisms in (1) are generalized to 𝕋𝕋\\mathbb{T}-effectful monoid morphisms, and convex monoids in (2) to (𝕋,ℳ)𝕋ℳ(\\mathbb{T},\\mathcal{M})-bialgebras and 𝕋𝕋\\mathbb{T}-monoids. We subsequently identify the structural properties of the monad 𝕋𝕋\\mathbb{T} ensuring that (1) and (2) capture precisely the languages computed by finite 𝕋𝕋\\mathbb{T}-automata; this yields an effectful automata/monoid correspondence (Theorems 4.11 and 4.21). Our results fundamentally exploit the double role played by monads in computation, namely as abstractions of both computational effects and algebraic theories. The general theory of effectful algebraic recognition not only explains the probabilistic case at an appropriate conceptual level, but also gives rise to novel algebraic characterizations of further automata models, notably nondeterministic probabilistic automata and weighted automata over arbitrary semirings. For the latter, a weighted automata/monoid correspondence was previously only known for weights from a commutative ring ; the extension to semirings allows us to capture additional important types of weighted automata such as min-plus and max-plus automata [48, Ch. 5] and transducers [48, Ch. 3].\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: side, PFAs share some remarkable similarities with finite automata; in particular, machine-independent characterizations of PFA-computable languages in terms of probabilistic regular expressions [ref]19  and probabilistic monadic second-order logic  are known.
