      "content": "Paper Title: Generalization Analysis for Contrastive Representation Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor convenience we introduce the following sequence of function spaces To prove Proposition 5.5, we need to introduce several lemmas.\nThe following lemma shows how the supremum over a matrix can be transferred to a supremum over a vector. It is an extension of Lemma 1 in Golowich et al.  from d=1𝑑1d=1 to d∈ℕ𝑑ℕd\\in\\mathbb{N}, and can be proved exactly by the arguments in Golowich et al. . Let σ:ℝ↦ℝ:𝜎maps-toℝℝ\\sigma:\\mathbb{R}\\mapsto\\mathbb{R} be a 111-Lipschitz continuous, positive-homogeneous activation function which is applied elementwise. Then for any vector-valued function class ℱ~~ℱ\\widetilde{\\mathcal{F}} Let 𝐯1⊤,…,𝐯h⊤superscriptsubscript𝐯1top…superscriptsubscript𝐯ℎtop\\mathbf{v}_{1}^{\\top},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{h}^{\\top} be rows of matrix V𝑉V, i.e., V⊤=(𝐯1,…,𝐯h)superscript𝑉topsubscript𝐯1…subscript𝐯ℎV^{\\top}=\\big{(}\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{h}\\big{)}. Then by the positive-homogeneous property of activation function we have The proof is completed.\n∎ The following lemma gives a general contraction lemma for Rademacher complexities. It allows us to remove a nonlinear function ψ𝜓\\psi, which is very useful for us to handle the activation function in DNNs. Let τ~:ℝ+↦ℝ+:~𝜏maps-tosubscriptℝsubscriptℝ\\tilde{\\tau}:\\mathbb{R}_{+}\\mapsto\\mathbb{R}_{+} be convex and nondecreasing. Suppose ψ:ℝ↦ℝ:𝜓maps-toℝℝ\\psi:\\mathbb{R}\\mapsto\\mathbb{R} is contractive in the sense |ψ​(t)−ψ​(t~)|≤|t−t~|𝜓𝑡𝜓~𝑡𝑡~𝑡|\\psi(t)-\\psi(\\tilde{t})|\\leq|t-\\tilde{t}| and ψ​(0)=0𝜓00\\psi(0)=0. Then the following inequality holds for any ℱ~~ℱ\\widetilde{\\mathcal{F}} The following lemma gives bounds of moment generation functions for a random variable Z=∑1≤i<j≤nϵi​ϵj​ai​j𝑍subscript1𝑖𝑗𝑛subscriptitalic-ϵ𝑖subscriptitalic-ϵ𝑗subscript𝑎𝑖𝑗Z=\\sum_{1\\leq i<j\\leq n}\\epsilon_{i}\\epsilon_{j}a_{ij}, which is called a Rademacher chaos variable   [ref]44. Let ϵi,i∈[n]subscriptitalic-ϵ𝑖𝑖delimited-[]𝑛\\epsilon_{i},i\\in[n] be independent Rademacher variables. Let ai,j∈ℝ,i,j∈[n]formulae-sequencesubscript𝑎𝑖𝑗ℝ𝑖𝑗delimited-[]𝑛a_{i,j}\\in\\mathbb{R},i,j\\in[n].\nThen for Z=∑1≤i<j≤nϵi​ϵj​ai​j𝑍subscript1𝑖𝑗𝑛subscriptitalic-ϵ𝑖subscriptitalic-ϵ𝑗subscript𝑎𝑖𝑗Z=\\sum_{1\\leq i<j\\leq n}\\epsilon_{i}\\epsilon_{j}a_{ij} we have The dual norm of ∥⋅∥F\\|\\cdot\\|_{F} is ∥⋅∥F\\|\\cdot\\|_{F}. Therefore, according to Lemma 5.1 we know where we have used Lemma D.3 in the second inequality.\nLet λ≥0𝜆0\\lambda\\geq 0 and τ​(x)=exp⁡(λ​x2)𝜏𝑥𝜆superscript𝑥2\\tau(x)=\\exp(\\lambda x^{2}). It is clear that τ𝜏\\tau is convex and increasing in the interval [0,∞)0[0,\\infty).\nIt then follows from the Jensen’s inequality that where we have used the independency between ϵt=(ϵt,j)j∈[n],t∈[d]formulae-sequencesubscriptitalic-ϵ𝑡subscriptsubscriptitalic-ϵ𝑡𝑗𝑗delimited-[]𝑛𝑡delimited-[]𝑑\\epsilon_{t}=(\\epsilon_{t,j})_{j\\in[n]},t\\in[d]. Let τ~:ℝ+↦ℝ+:~𝜏maps-tosubscriptℝsubscriptℝ\\tilde{\\tau}:\\mathbb{R}_{+}\\mapsto\\mathbb{R}_{+} be defined as τ~​(x)=exp⁡(d​λ​Λ2​BL2​x2)~𝜏𝑥𝑑𝜆superscriptΛ2superscriptsubscript𝐵𝐿2superscript𝑥2\\tilde{\\tau}(x)=\\exp(d\\lambda\\Lambda^{2}B_{L}^{2}x^{2}). Then we have where we have used Lemma D.4 and the contraction property of σ𝜎\\sigma in the last inequality. According to Lemma D.3, we know It then follows that We can apply the above inequality recursively and derive Furthermore, by Eq. (D.4) we know where the last identity follows from the definition of τ~~𝜏\\tilde{\\tau}.\nLet λ0=d​λ​Λ2​BL2​BL−12​⋯​B12subscript𝜆0𝑑𝜆superscriptΛ2superscriptsubscript𝐵𝐿2subscriptsuperscript𝐵2𝐿1⋯superscriptsubscript𝐵12\\lambda_{0}=d\\lambda\\Lambda^{2}B_{L}^{2}B^{2}_{L-1}\\cdots B_{1}^{2}. Then We choose λ=18​e​s​d​Λ2​BL2​BL−12​⋯​B12𝜆18𝑒𝑠𝑑superscriptΛ2superscriptsubscript𝐵𝐿2subscriptsuperscript𝐵2𝐿1⋯superscriptsubscript𝐵12\\lambda=\\frac{1}{8esd\\Lambda^{2}B_{L}^{2}B^{2}_{L-1}\\cdots B_{1}^{2}}, where\ns=(∑1≤i<j≤n(𝐱i⊤​𝐱j)2)12.𝑠superscriptsubscript1𝑖𝑗𝑛superscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝐱𝑖topsubscript𝐱𝑗212s=\\big{(}\\sum_{1\\leq i<j\\leq n}(\\mathbf{x}_{i}^{\\top}\\mathbf{x}_{j})^{2}\\big{)}^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\nThen it is clear\nλ0=18​e​ssubscript𝜆018𝑒𝑠\\lambda_{0}=\\frac{1}{8es}. We can apply Lemma D.5 to derive that and therefore We know τ−1​(x)=λ−1​log⁡xsuperscript𝜏1𝑥superscript𝜆1𝑥\\tau^{-1}(x)=\\sqrt{\\lambda^{-1}\\log x}. It then follows that The proof is completed by noting 8​e​(log⁡2)≤168𝑒2168e(\\log 2)\\leq 16.\n∎ Our proof of Proposition 5.5 is motivated by the arguments in Golowich et al. , which studies Rademacher complexity bounds for DNNs with d=1𝑑1d=1. Our analysis requires to introduce techniques to handle the difficulty of considering d𝑑d features simultaneously. Indeed, we control the Rademacher complexity for learning with d𝑑d features by If d=1𝑑1d=1, this becomes and the arguments in Golowich et al.  apply. There are two difficulties in applying the arguments in Golowich et al.  to handle general d∈ℕ𝑑ℕd\\in\\mathbb{N}. First, the term ∑t∈[d]|∑j∈[n]ϵt,j​σ​(𝐯~⊤​f~​(𝐱j))|subscript𝑡delimited-[]𝑑subscript𝑗delimited-[]𝑛subscriptitalic-ϵ𝑡𝑗𝜎superscript~𝐯top~𝑓subscript𝐱𝑗\\sum_{t\\in[d]}\\Big{|}\\sum_{j\\in[n]}\\epsilon_{t,j}\\sigma(\\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}^{\\top}\\tilde{f}(\\mathbf{x}_{j}))\\Big{|} cannot be written as a Rademacher complexity due to the summation over t∈[d]𝑡delimited-[]𝑑t\\in[d]. Second, there is a square function of the term |∑j∈[n]ϵt,j​σ​(𝐯~⊤​f~​(𝐱j))|subscript𝑗delimited-[]𝑛subscriptitalic-ϵ𝑡𝑗𝜎superscript~𝐯top~𝑓subscript𝐱𝑗\\Big{|}\\sum_{j\\in[n]}\\epsilon_{t,j}\\sigma(\\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}^{\\top}\\tilde{f}(\\mathbf{x}_{j}))\\Big{|}. To handle this difficulty, we introduce the function τ​(x)=exp⁡(λ​x2)𝜏𝑥𝜆superscript𝑥2\\tau(x)=\\exp(\\lambda x^{2}) instead of the function τ​(x)=exp⁡(λ​x)𝜏𝑥𝜆𝑥\\tau(x)=\\exp(\\lambda x) in Golowich et al. . To this aim, we need to handle the moment generation function of a Rademacher chaos variable ∑1≤i<j≤jϵi​ϵj​(𝐱i⊤​𝐱j)2subscript1𝑖𝑗𝑗subscriptitalic-ϵ𝑖subscriptitalic-ϵ𝑗superscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝐱𝑖topsubscript𝐱𝑗2\\sum_{1\\leq i<j\\leq j}\\epsilon_{i}\\epsilon_{j}(\\mathbf{x}_{i}^{\\top}\\mathbf{x}_{j})^{2}, which is not a sub-Gaussian variable. As a comparison, the analysis in Golowich et al.  considers the moment generation function for a sub-Gaussian variable. One can also use the following inequality the latter of which can then be further controlled by the arguments in Golowich et al. . This, however, incurs a bound with a linear dependency on d𝑑d. As a comparison, our analysis gives a bound with a square-root dependency on d𝑑d.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: variable Z=∑1≤i<j≤nϵi​ϵj​ai​j𝑍subscript1𝑖𝑗𝑛subscriptitalic-ϵ𝑖subscriptitalic-ϵ𝑗subscript𝑎𝑖𝑗Z=\\sum_{1\\leq i<j\\leq n}\\epsilon_{i}\\epsilon_{j}a_{ij}, which is called a Rademacher chaos variable   [ref]44.
