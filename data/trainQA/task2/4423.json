      "content": "Paper Title: A general-purpose method for applying Explainable AI for Anomaly Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImagine you are a technician that maintains a system with thousands of networked devices. Chances are high that at any given time, somewhere in the fleet there are faulty devices that require your attention. As a technician, you would like an anomaly detector to provide a rich explanation about the symptoms, allowing you to detect, diagnose, prioritize and fix faulty devices. This paper is motivated by the unmet need to provide the technician explained anomalies. We combine insights from the cognitive sciences with explainable AI (XAI), and propose a general-purpose approach to aid the technician in detecting the anomaly and understanding the fault behind the anomaly. We show comparative results with sensor failure on a Variable Air Volume (VAV) device, and a fuel pressure failure on a general aviation aircraft engine. Anomaly Detection (AD) is the machine learning task of detecting observations that do not conform to expected or normal behavior , , , [ref]28. AD is susceptible to both false positive and false negative errors [ref]2. Adjudicating false positive errors is often time consuming and may even make an AD solution ineffective. A nondescript anomaly score provides little insight to understanding what caused the anomaly and choosing the best treatment. We hypothesize that integrating XAI techniques with AD can reduce the human workload in processing a stream of anomalies. Relatively little about explainable AD has been published. An explainable AD method was developed by combining an autoencoder with the SHAP explainability method . DIFFI  is an explainability technique for Isolation Forest (IF) [ref]16 that generates attributions based on dimensions that contribute significantly to isolating anomalous points and causing data imbalances by random data splits. MADI 5 combines a neural network classifier that distinguishes between observed and randomized samples, and uses Integrated Gradients (IG) 7. The One-Class Deep Taylor Decomposition (OC-DTD), uses a One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) to train (“neuralize”) a feed-forward neural network [ref]28. Then, it applies Deep Taylor Decomposition  that yields variable attributions for anomalies . Explaining anomalies in image data, FCDD , applies a convolutional upsampling technique to create an heatmap of anomalous regions detected by a neural network variant of OC-SVM. This work makes the following contributions to the field of explainable AD: a. creates a clear distinction between explainability and interpretability; b. proposes a methodology that leads to meaningful anomaly explanations combining the cognitive sciences with XAI methods; and c. defines Attribution Error and provides two real-world datasets for evaluating anomaly explanations.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: a fuel pressure failure on a general aviation aircraft engine.
