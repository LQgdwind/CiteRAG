      "content": "Paper Title: Root Repulsion and Faster Solving for Very Sparse Polynomials Over 𝑝-adic Fields\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSolving polynomial equations over the p𝑝p-adic rational numbers ℚpsubscriptℚ𝑝\\mathbb{Q}_{p}\nunderlies many important computational questions in number theory\n(see, e.g.,    )\nand is close to\n\napplications in coding theory (see, e.g., ).\nFurthermore, the complexity of\nsolving structured\n\n\nequations — such as those with a fixed number of\nmonomial terms or invariance with respect to\n\n\na group action — arises naturally in many computational\ngeometric applications and is closely\nrelated to a deeper understanding of circuit\ncomplexity (see, e.g., [ref]35).\nSo we will study how sparsity affects the complexity of separating and\napproximating roots in ℚpsubscriptℚ𝑝\\mathbb{Q}_{p}. Unless stated otherwise, all\nO𝑂O-constants and ΩΩ\\Omega-constants are effective and absolute. Recall that thanks to 17th century work of Descartes, and 20th century\nwork of Lenstra  and Poonen ,\nit is known that univariate polynomials with exactly t𝑡t monomial\nterms have at most tO​(1)superscript𝑡𝑂1t^{O(1)} roots in a fixed field K𝐾K only\nwhen K𝐾K is ℝℝ\\mathbb{R} or a finite algebraic extension of ℚpsubscriptℚ𝑝\\mathbb{Q}_{p} for some prime\np∈ℕ𝑝ℕp\\!\\in\\!\\mathbb{N}.\nWe’ll use |⋅|p|\\cdot|_{p} (resp. |⋅||\\cdot|) for the absolute value on the\np𝑝p-adic complex numbers ℂpsubscriptℂ𝑝\\mathbb{C}_{p} normalized so that |p|p=1psubscript𝑝𝑝1𝑝|p|_{p}\\!=\\!\\frac{1}{p}\n(resp. the standard absolute value on ℂℂ\\mathbb{C}). Recall also that for any function\nf𝑓f analytic on K𝐾K, the\ncorresponding Newton endomorphism is Nf​(z):=z−f​(z)f′​(z)assignsubscript𝑁𝑓𝑧𝑧𝑓𝑧superscript𝑓′𝑧N_{f}(z):=z-\\frac{f(z)}{f^{\\prime}(z)},\nand the corresponding sequence of Newton iterates of a start-point\nz0∈Ksubscript𝑧0𝐾z_{0}\\!\\in\\!K is the sequence (zi)i=0∞subscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑧𝑖𝑖0(z_{i})^{\\infty}_{i=0} where\nzi+1:=Nf​(zi)assignsubscript𝑧𝑖1subscript𝑁𝑓subscript𝑧𝑖z_{i+1}\\!:=\\!N_{f}(z_{i}) for all i≥0𝑖0i\\!\\geq\\!0. Our first main result is that we can efficiently count the roots of\nunivariate trinomials in ℚpsubscriptℚ𝑝\\mathbb{Q}_{p}, and find succinct start-points in ℚℚ\\mathbb{Q}\nunder which Newton iteration converges quickly to all the roots in ℚpsubscriptℚ𝑝\\mathbb{Q}_{p}.\nWe use #​S#𝑆\\#S for the cardinality of a set S𝑆S.

We prove Theorem 1.1 in Section 6.3\nvia Algorithm 6.12 there. The dependence on p𝑝p can\nbe lowered significantly in certain natural settings, e.g., restricting to\nroots of the form pj+O​(pj+1)superscript𝑝𝑗𝑂superscript𝑝𝑗1p^{j}+O(p^{j+1}), making mild assumptions on the gcd\nof the exponents, or assuming\nthe presence of degenerate roots in ℂp∗subscriptsuperscriptℂ𝑝\\mathbb{C}^{*}_{p}: See Corollaries\n1.4, 1.7, and 6.16\nbelow. An analogue of Theorem 1.1 also holds for K=ℝ𝐾ℝK\\!=\\!\\mathbb{R}\nand will be presented in a sequel to this paper. We call a z0∈ℚpsubscript𝑧0subscriptℚ𝑝z_{0}\\!\\in\\!\\mathbb{Q}_{p}\nsatisfying the convergence condition from Theorem 1.1 an\napproximate root of f𝑓f (in the sense of Smale111This\nterminology has only been applied over ℂℂ\\mathbb{C} so far , so we take\nthe opportunity here to extend it to the p𝑝p-adic rationals. Note that\nwe do not restrict ζ𝜁\\zeta to be non-degenerate.),\nwith associated true root ζ𝜁\\zeta. This type\nof convergence provides an efficient encoding of an approximation that\ncan be quickly tuned to any desired accuracy.

We’ll see in Sections 5 and\n6 how our speed-up depends on p𝑝p-adic Diophantine\napproximation  .
