      "content": "Paper Title: AA-TransUNet: Attention Augmented TransUNet For Nowcasting Tasks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAccurate prediction of weather conditions impacts human life and it has a direct effect on many sectors including for instance economic, agriculture, business, transport and logistics among others. In particular, precipitation nowcasting, i.e. short-term forecasts of up to 6 hours, is becoming an increasingly popular research topic due to its high impact in supporting the socioeconomic needs of the above-mentioned industrial sectors . In addition, precipitation nowcasting plays an important role in water-related risk management. Often warning systems also rely on nowcasts in order to generate warnings . Traditional nowcasting methods are based on Numerical weather prediction (NWP) . However, their spatial and temporal resolution is often too low for precipitation nowcasting. In addition, NWP based models demand a substantial amount of computing power as they generate predictions by simulating the underlying physics of the atmosphere and ocean [ref]4 [ref]5. Therefore, recent years have witnessed the development of new data driven models to overcome the shortcomings of the NWP based models. They often do not rely on the underlying physics of the atmosphere and ocean but instead concentrate solely on learning from the historical data . In particular, models with deep neural network architecture have shown to outperform traditional data driven models in several application domains    [ref]4 0 1 2 3  4 5. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based models such as AlexNet 6, ResNet 7, Convolutional Autoencoders (CAEs) 8 and their variants are among the most used neural networks architectures in computer vision tasks. Following the idea of CAEs, the authors in 9 introduced the well-known UNet model, which uses the classic encoder (down-sampling) and decoder (up-sampling) with skip connection structure 9. UNet was initially used for medical image segmentation, but it gradually began to shine in many other computer vision tasks. Inspired by the success of UNet model, several other architectures have been developed in the literature which continues to adhere to the core concept of UNet, albeit incorporating new modules or other techniques. Another impactful model is the Transformer architecture 0 which has revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP).\nThis sequence to sequence architecture which is equipped with attention mechanism is designed to handle sequential input data. Compared to traditional models used for sequence-to-sequence learning, Transformer has produced better results 0. With the transformer model dominating the domain of NLP, many researchers began to investigate its applicability in computer vision tasks. For instance, Google researchers released the Vision Transformer model 1 which divides the image into small blocks of fixed size, linearly embeds each small block, adds position embedding and feeds the resulting vector sequence into a standard Transformer encoder. Although the Transformer based model has great potential in the computer vision field, it also faces some significant challenges such as the high demand for data 2. Likewise, the UNet structure that has consistently held a dominant position in the field of image segmentation also poses some limitations such as the inability to capture the long-term dependence 3.\nConsequently, combining the transformer and the UNet model has become a new research direction. Based on this, the authors in 3 proposed the TransUNet, which is an image segmentation model that fully utilizes the advantages of UNet and Transformer. The TransUNet model has been shown to perform well in medical image segmentation, but it has not been widely used in other fields. In this paper, we propose a new model called Attention Augmented TransUNet (AA-TransUNet). Here, the TransUNet is used as core model and it is further equipped with Convolutional Block Attention Module(CBAM) 4 and Depthwise-separable Convolutions (DSC) 5. Thanks to the incorporation of these new elements in the core TransUNet model, the number of trainable parameters is significantly reduced without degrading the accuracy of the model. We seek the application of the proposed AA-TransUNet on precipitation nowcasting tasks. In particular, here we use the same datasets as those used in [ref]5, i.e precipitation map dataset and cloud cover dataset. As in [ref]5, in the case of the precipitation map dataset, the model input consists of 60 minutes of precipitation maps collected from the cartographic radar and the model output is another sequence of precipitation maps predicted for the next 30 minutes. We also run related experiments on the cloud cover dataset to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model. This paper is organized as follows. A brief overview of the related research works is given in Section II. Section III introduces the proposed AA-TransUNet model. The experimental settings and description of the used datasets are given in Section IV. The obtained results are discussed in Section V and the conclusion is drawn in Section VI.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: precipitation nowcasting.
