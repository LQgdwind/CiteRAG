      "content": "Paper Title: Batch-Size Independent Regret Bounds for Combinatorial Semi-Bandits with Probabilistically Triggered Arms or Independent Arms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we show how various applications satisfy our new TPVM, TPVM< or VM smoothness condition and their corresponding (Bv,B1,λ)subscript𝐵𝑣subscript𝐵1𝜆(B_{v},B_{1},\\lambda) coefficients with non-trivial Bvsubscript𝐵𝑣B_{v}, i.e., Bv=o​(B1​K)subscript𝐵𝑣𝑜subscript𝐵1𝐾B_{v}=o(B_{1}\\sqrt{K}), which in turn improves the regret bounds over the batch-size dependence of K𝐾K. The combinatorial cascading bandits , the multi-layered network exploration , the influence maximization problems [ref]29 and the probabilistic maximum coverage problem [ref]23 satisfy the TPVM (TPVM< or VM) conditions with coefficients (Bv,B1,λ)subscript𝐵𝑣subscript𝐵1𝜆(B_{v},B_{1},\\lambda), resulting regret bounds and improvements shown in Table 3. Note that the first four applications in Table 3 applies Theorem 1, while the last application applies Theorem 2.\nMore specifically, the first two applications we consider are disjunctive and conjunctive cascading bandits , where m𝑚m base arms represent web pages and routing edges in online advertising and network routing, respectively. Batch-size K𝐾K is the maximum size of the ordered sequence S∈𝒮𝑆𝒮S\\in\\mathcal{S} to be selected in each round, which will trigger web pages/routing edge one by one until certain stopping condition is satisfied, i.e., a click or a routing edge being broken. The reward is 111 if any web page is clicked (or if all routing edges are live) and 00 otherwise. Compared with [ref]29, we achieve an improvement O​(K/(log⁡K​log⁡KΔmin))𝑂𝐾𝐾𝐾subscriptΔO(K/(\\log K\\log\\frac{K}{\\Delta_{\\min}})) for the conjunctive case and an improvement O​(K/log⁡K)𝑂𝐾𝐾O(K/\\log K) for the disjunctive case, due to the same Bv,B1=1subscript𝐵𝑣subscript𝐵11B_{v},B_{1}=1 but different orders λ𝜆\\lambda. The third application is the mutli-layered network exploration (MuLaNE) problem ,\nand the MuLaNE task is to allocate B𝐵B budgets into n𝑛n layers to explore target nodes V𝑉V. In MuLaNE, the base arms form a set 𝒜={(i,u,b):i∈[n],u∈[V],b∈[B]}𝒜conditional-set𝑖𝑢𝑏formulae-sequence𝑖delimited-[]𝑛formulae-sequence𝑢delimited-[]𝑉𝑏delimited-[]𝐵\\mathcal{A}=\\{(i,u,b):i\\in[n],u\\in[V],b\\in[B]\\}, the batch-size K=(n+1)​|V|𝐾𝑛1𝑉K=(n+1)|V| and the reward is defined as the total reward give by the first visit of any target nodes. MuLaNE fits into our study, and compared with , the regret bound is improved by a factor of O​(n/log⁡K)𝑂𝑛𝐾O(n/\\log K). Our fourth application is the online influence maximization (OIM) problems direct acyclic graphs (DAG).\nFor this application, the goal is to select at most k𝑘k seed nodes to influence as many target nodes V𝑉V as possible, where the influence process follows the independent cascade (IC) model [ref]29 (see Appendix E for more details). The base arms are the edges with unknown edge probabilities and the batch-size K𝐾K is the total number of edges that could be triggered by any set of k𝑘k seed nodes, denoted as |E|𝐸|E|.\nThe improvements here are significant, improving the existing results [ref]23 by a factor of O​(|E|/(L​log⁡|E|​log⁡|E|Δmin))𝑂𝐸𝐿𝐸𝐸subscriptΔO(|E|/(L\\log|E|\\log\\frac{|E|}{\\Delta_{\\min}})). For the PMC problem [ref]23, we consider a complete bipartite graph with L𝐿L source nodes on the left and |V|𝑉|V| target nodes V𝑉V on the right. The goal is to select k𝑘k seed nodes from L𝐿L nodes trying to influence as many as target nodes, so the edges E𝐸E are independent base arms and the batch-size is k​|V|𝑘𝑉k|V|.\nBy using the computational efficient version of Algorithm 2 and applying Theorem 2, we achieve O​(log2⁡k)𝑂superscript2𝑘O(\\log^{2}k) improvement compared with [ref]23 while maintaining good computational efficiency. ∗ This row is for the application in Section 4 and the rest of rows are for Section 3.1; † |V|,|E|,n,k,L𝑉𝐸𝑛𝑘𝐿|V|,|E|,n,k,L denotes the number of target nodes, the number of edges that can be triggered by the set of seed nodes, the number of layers, the number of seed nodes and the length of the longest directed path, respectively.\n For all above applications (except for the OIM on DAG), our proof involves the use of telescoping series to decompose the reward difference, together with a smart use of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality aided by the variance terms. For disjunctive cascading bandits, for example, the reward difference |r​(S;𝝁¯)−r​(S;𝝁)|=∏i=1K(1−μi)−∏i=1K(1−μ¯i)𝑟𝑆¯𝝁𝑟𝑆𝝁superscriptsubscriptproduct𝑖1𝐾1subscript𝜇𝑖superscriptsubscriptproduct𝑖1𝐾1subscript¯𝜇𝑖\\left|r(S;\\bar{\\bm{\\mu}})-r(S;\\bm{\\mu})\\right|=\\prod_{i=1}^{K}(1-\\mu_{i})-\\prod_{i=1}^{K}(1-\\bar{\\mu}_{i}) can be telescoped as ∑i∈[K](μ¯i−μi)​(∏j=1i−1(1−μj)⋅∏j=i+1K(1−μ¯j))subscript𝑖delimited-[]𝐾subscript¯𝜇𝑖subscript𝜇𝑖superscriptsubscriptproduct𝑗1𝑖1⋅1subscript𝜇𝑗superscriptsubscriptproduct𝑗𝑖1𝐾1subscript¯𝜇𝑗\\sum_{i\\in[K]}(\\bar{\\mu}_{i}-\\mu_{i})\\left(\\prod_{j=1}^{i-1}(1-\\mu_{j})\\cdot\\prod_{j=i+1}^{K}(1-\\bar{\\mu}_{j})\\right). After this decomposition, we replace certain terms with piD,Ssuperscriptsubscript𝑝𝑖𝐷𝑆p_{i}^{D,S} and bound above by ∑i∈[K]ζi​piD,S​∏j=i+1K(1−μj)+∑i∈[K]ηi​piD,Ssubscript𝑖delimited-[]𝐾subscript𝜁𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑖𝐷𝑆superscriptsubscriptproduct𝑗𝑖1𝐾1subscript𝜇𝑗subscript𝑖delimited-[]𝐾subscript𝜂𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑖𝐷𝑆\\sum_{i\\in[K]}\\zeta_{i}p_{i}^{D,S}\\sqrt{\\prod_{j=i+1}^{K}(1-\\mu_{j})}+\\sum_{i\\in[K]}\\eta_{i}p_{i}^{D,S}. Then we simultaneously multiply and divide the variance term (1−μi)​μi1subscript𝜇𝑖subscript𝜇𝑖\\sqrt{(1-\\mu_{i})\\mu_{i}} on the first term and apply the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality to move the summation over K𝐾K into the square root, concluding the satisfaction of Condition 3 with Bv=∑i∈[K](1−μi)​μi​∏j=i+1K(1−μj)≤1subscript𝐵𝑣subscript𝑖delimited-[]𝐾1subscript𝜇𝑖subscript𝜇𝑖superscriptsubscriptproduct𝑗𝑖1𝐾1subscript𝜇𝑗1B_{v}=\\sqrt{\\sum_{i\\in[K]}(1-\\mu_{i})\\mu_{i}\\prod_{j=i+1}^{K}(1-\\mu_{j})}\\leq 1. As for the OIM on DAG, since reward function have no closed-form solutions , the analysis is more involved with the need of advanced techniques such as the coupling technique [ref]20, see Appendix E for details.\n∎\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: which in turn improves the regret bounds over the batch-size dependence of K𝐾K.
