      "content": "Paper Title: Non-conflicting no-where zero 𝑍₂×𝑍₂ flows in cubic graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraphs considered in this paper are finite and undirected. They do not contain loops, though they may contain parallel edges. We also consider pseudo-graphs, which may contain both loops and parallel edges, and simple graphs, which contain neither loops nor parallel edges. As usual, a loop contributes to the degree of a vertex by two. For a graph G𝐺G, V=V​(G)𝑉𝑉𝐺V=V(G) and E=E​(G)𝐸𝐸𝐺E=E(G) will denote the sets of vertices and edges of G𝐺G, respectively. A matching in a graph G𝐺G is a subset F𝐹F of edges such that no two edges of F𝐹F share a vertex. A matching F𝐹F is perfect if every vertex of the graph is incident to an edge from F𝐹F. For k≥1𝑘1k\\geq 1, a k𝑘k-factor of a graph G𝐺G is a spanning k𝑘k-regular subgraph of G𝐺G. Note that if K𝐾K is a 1-factor of G𝐺G, then E​(K)𝐸𝐾E(K) is a perfect matching in G𝐺G. A graph G𝐺G is k𝑘k-regular if every vertex of G𝐺G is of degree k𝑘k. A graph is cubic if it is 3-regular. Note that if G𝐺G is a cubic graph then F𝐹F is a perfect matching in G𝐺G if and only if G−F𝐺𝐹G-F is a 2-factor in G𝐺G. This 2-factor will be called a complementary 2-factor of F𝐹F in G𝐺G. For a perfect matching F𝐹F of a cubic graph G𝐺G, its complementary 2-factor will be denoted by F¯¯𝐹\\overline{F}. For a graph G𝐺G and a vertex v𝑣v let ∂G(v)subscript𝐺𝑣\\partial_{G}(v) be the set of edges of G𝐺G that are incident to v𝑣v in G𝐺G. If G𝐺G is a graph then its girth is the length of the shortest cycle in G𝐺G. For n≥1𝑛1n\\geq 1 let Knsubscript𝐾𝑛K_{n} denote the unique graph on n𝑛n vertices where every pair of vertices is an edge in it. Such graph is called complete and usually is denoted by Knsubscript𝐾𝑛K_{n} (Figure 6). A graph G𝐺G is bipartite, if V​(G)𝑉𝐺V(G) can be partitioned into two sets V1subscript𝑉1V_{1} and V2subscript𝑉2V_{2}, such that every edge of G𝐺G joins a vertex from V1subscript𝑉1V_{1} to V2subscript𝑉2V_{2}. A bipartite graph is called complete if every vertex of V1subscript𝑉1V_{1} is joined to every vertex of V2subscript𝑉2V_{2}. When G𝐺G is a complete bipartite graph with |V1|=msubscript𝑉1𝑚|V_{1}|=m and |V2|=nsubscript𝑉2𝑛|V_{2}|=n, then it will be denoted by Km,nsubscript𝐾𝑚𝑛K_{m,n}. For k≥1𝑘1k\\geq 1 a graph G𝐺G is called cyclically k𝑘k-edge-connected, if we have to delete at least k𝑘k edges of G𝐺G so that the resulting graph contains at least two components containing a cycle. A simple path of a graph G𝐺G is called Hamiltonian if all vertices of G𝐺G lie on it. Similarly, a simple cycle of a graph G𝐺G is called Hamiltonian if all vertices of G𝐺G lie on it. A graph G𝐺G is called Hamiltonian if it contains a Hamiltonian cycle. A k𝑘k-edge-coloring of a graph G𝐺G is an assignment of colors {1,…,k}1…𝑘\\{1,...,k\\} to edges of G𝐺G, such that adjacent edges receive different colors . The smallest k𝑘k for which G𝐺G admits a k𝑘k-edge-coloring, is called the chromatic index and is denoted by χ′​(G)superscript𝜒′𝐺\\chi^{\\prime}(G). Vizing’s classical theorem in the area states that if G𝐺G is a simple graph, then Δ​(G)≤χ′​(G)≤Δ​(G)+1Δ𝐺superscript𝜒′𝐺Δ𝐺1\\Delta(G)\\leq\\chi^{\\prime}(G)\\leq\\Delta(G)+1 . Here Δ​(G)Δ𝐺\\Delta(G) denotes the maximum degree of a vertex in G𝐺G. Note that for cubic graphs this becomes to 3≤χ′​(G)≤43superscript𝜒′𝐺43\\leq\\chi^{\\prime}(G)\\leq 4. Holyer’s theorem states that the problem of testing a given cubic graph for χ′​(G)=3superscript𝜒′𝐺3\\chi^{\\prime}(G)=3 is an NP-complete problem . Let G𝐺G and H𝐻H be two cubic graphs. If there is a mapping ϕ:E​(G)→E​(H):italic-ϕ→𝐸𝐺𝐸𝐻\\phi:E(G)\\rightarrow E(H), such that for each v∈V​(G)𝑣𝑉𝐺v\\in V(G) there is w∈V​(H)𝑤𝑉𝐻w\\in V(H) such that ϕ​(∂G(v))=∂H(w)italic-ϕsubscript𝐺𝑣subscript𝐻𝑤\\phi(\\partial_{G}(v))=\\partial_{H}(w), then ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi is called an H𝐻H-coloring of G𝐺G. If G𝐺G admits an H𝐻H-coloring, then we will write H≺Gprecedes𝐻𝐺H\\prec G. It can be easily seen that if H≺Gprecedes𝐻𝐺H\\prec G and K≺Hprecedes𝐾𝐻K\\prec H, then K≺Gprecedes𝐾𝐺K\\prec G. In other words, ≺precedes\\prec is a transitive relation defined on the set of cubic graphs. If G𝐺G is the complete bipartite graph K3,3subscript𝐾33K_{3,3} and H𝐻H is the complete graph K4subscript𝐾4K_{4}, then Figure 1 shows an example of an H𝐻H-coloring of G𝐺G. Here V​(H)={1,2,3,4}𝑉𝐻1234V(H)=\\{1,2,3,4\\} and E​(H)={a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6}𝐸𝐻subscript𝑎1subscript𝑎2subscript𝑎3subscript𝑎4subscript𝑎5subscript𝑎6E(H)=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},a_{4},a_{5},a_{6}\\}. Figure 1 shows the colors of edges of G𝐺G with the edges of H𝐻H, and the labels of vertices of G𝐺G are the vertices of K4subscript𝐾4K_{4} that this vertex is mapped by the H𝐻H-coloring of G𝐺G. Let P10subscript𝑃10P_{10} be the well-known Petersen graph (Figure 2). The main topic of this paper is the Petersen Coloring Conjecture of Jaeger. It is a striking conjecture in graph theory that asserts that the edge-set of every bridgeless cubic graph G𝐺G can be colored by using as set of colors the edge-set of the Petersen graph P10subscript𝑃10P_{10} in such a way that adjacent edges of G𝐺G receive as colors adjacent edges of P10subscript𝑃10P_{10}. (Jaeger, 1988 ) For any bridgeless cubic\ngraph G𝐺G, one has P10≺Gprecedessubscript𝑃10𝐺P_{10}\\prec G. The conjecture is well-known and it is largely considered hard to prove since it implies some other classical conjectures in the field such as Berge-Fulkerson Conjecture (Conjecture 2 below), Cycle Double Cover Conjecture, (5, 2)-cycle-cover conjecture (Conjecture 3 below) and the Shortest Cycle Cover Conjecture (see   ). (Berge-Fulkerson, 1972  ) Any bridgeless\ncubic graph G𝐺G contains six (not necessarily distinct) perfect matchings\nF1,…,F6subscript𝐹1…subscript𝐹6F_{1},\\ldots,F_{6} such that any edge of G𝐺G belongs to exactly two of them. ((5, 2)-cycle-cover conjecture,  9) Any bridgeless\ngraph G𝐺G (not necessarily cubic) contains five even subgraphs such that any\nedge of G𝐺G belongs to exactly\ntwo of them. It can be shown that the Petersen graph is the only 2-edge-connected cubic graph that can color all bridgeless cubic graphs 6. Note that 0 proves that Conjecture 2 is equivalent to proving that the edge-set of all bridgeless cubic graphs can be covered with five perfect matchings. Moreover, see the recent paper , which shows that every bridgeless cubic graph G𝐺G has a pair of perfect matchings F1subscript𝐹1F_{1} and F2subscript𝐹2F_{2}, such that G−(F1∪F2)𝐺subscript𝐹1subscript𝐹2G-(F_{1}\\cup F_{2}) is bipartite. Note that this statement is a corollary of Conjecture 2, which was conjectured by Mazzuoccolo in 2. More conjectures similar to Conjecture 1 can be found in [ref]8 6.  5 present some new results about H𝐻H-colorings when the graphs under consideration are regular, and not necessarily are cubic. Jaeger, in , introduced an equivalent formulation of Conjecture 1. Let c𝑐c be an edge-coloring of G𝐺G. For a vertex v𝑣v of G𝐺G, let Sc​(v)subscript𝑆𝑐𝑣S_{c}(v) be the set of colors that edges incident to v𝑣v receive. If u​v𝑢𝑣uv is an edge of a cubic graph G𝐺G, then note that 3≤|Sc​(u)∪Sc​(v)|≤53subscript𝑆𝑐𝑢subscript𝑆𝑐𝑣53\\leq|S_{c}(u)\\cup S_{c}(v)|\\leq 5. Suppose a​b𝑎𝑏ab is an edge of a cubic graph G𝐺G, and c𝑐c is an edge-coloring of G𝐺G. Then: a​b𝑎𝑏ab is called poor with respect to c𝑐c, if |Sc​(a)∪Sc​(b)|=3subscript𝑆𝑐𝑎subscript𝑆𝑐𝑏3|S_{c}(a)\\cup S_{c}(b)|=3, a​b𝑎𝑏ab is called abnormal with respect to c𝑐c, if |Sc​(a)∪Sc​(b)|=4subscript𝑆𝑐𝑎subscript𝑆𝑐𝑏4|S_{c}(a)\\cup S_{c}(b)|=4, a​b𝑎𝑏ab is called rich with respect to c𝑐c, if |Sc​(a)∪Sc​(b)|=5subscript𝑆𝑐𝑎subscript𝑆𝑐𝑏5|S_{c}(a)\\cup S_{c}(b)|=5. Edge-colorings having only poor edges are trivially 333-edge-colorings of G𝐺G. Also edge-colorings having only rich edges have been considered in the last years, and they are called strong edge-colorings. In , Jaeger focused on the case when all edges must be either poor or rich. An edge-coloring c𝑐c of a cubic graph is normal, if G𝐺G does not contain abnormal edges with respect to c𝑐c. In other words, any edge is rich or poor with respect to c𝑐c. It is straightforward that an edge coloring which assigns a different color to every edge of a simple cubic graph is normal since all edges are rich. Hence, we can define the normal chromatic index of a simple cubic graph G𝐺G, denoted by χN′​(G)subscriptsuperscript𝜒′𝑁𝐺\\chi^{\\prime}_{N}(G), as the smallest k𝑘k, for which G𝐺G admits a normal k𝑘k-edge-coloring. Figure 3 provides an example of a normal 7-edge-coloring of a cubic graph. All edges of this graph are rich in this coloring except the unique bridge which is poor. 4 shows that χN​(G)=7subscript𝜒𝑁𝐺7\\chi_{N}(G)=7 if G𝐺G is the graph from Figure 3. Moreover, 4 argues that any cubic graph having a subgraph that is isomorphic to the complete graph K4subscript𝐾4K_{4} with one edge subdivided has χN​(G)=7subscript𝜒𝑁𝐺7\\chi_{N}(G)=7. Note that not all cubic graphs admit a normal k𝑘k-edge-coloring for some k≥1𝑘1k\\geq 1. Consider a cubic multi-graph containing a triangle in which one edge is of multiplicity two (see Figure 4). It can be easily seen that such a cubic graph cannot have a normal k𝑘k-edge-coloring, as an edge of multiplicity two is going to be abnormal in any edge-coloring. Using the notion of normal edge-colorings, in , Jaeger has shown that: (Jaeger, ) If G𝐺G is a cubic graph, then P10≺Gprecedessubscript𝑃10𝐺P_{10}\\prec G, if and only if G𝐺G admits a normal 555-edge-coloring. This implies that Conjecture 1 can be stated as follows: For any bridgeless cubic graph G𝐺G, χN′​(G)≤5subscriptsuperscript𝜒′𝑁𝐺5\\chi^{\\prime}_{N}(G)\\leq 5. In this terms, Petersen Coloring Conjecture is equivalent to saying that every bridgeless cubic graph has normal chromatic index at most 5. Observe that Conjecture 4 is trivial for 333-edge-colorable cubic graphs. This is true because in any 333-edge-coloring c𝑐c of a cubic graph G𝐺G any edge e𝑒e is poor, hence c𝑐c is a normal edge-coloring of G𝐺G. Thus non-333-edge-colorable cubic graphs are the main obstacle for Conjecture 4. Structural properties of non-3-edge-colorable bridgeless cubic graphs, sometimes called snarks, are investigated in  . Note that Conjecture 4 is verified for some non-333-edge-colorable bridgeless cubic graphs in    . Finally, let us note that in  the percentage of edges of a bridgeless cubic graph, which can be made poor or rich in a 5-edge-coloring, is investigated. See for a recent paper about the percent of normal edges (that is, not abnormal edges) in 5-edge-colored cubic graphs in . Other recent results in this direction are obtained in 3 and 8. If we consider the larger class of simple cubic graphs, without any assumption on connectivity, some interesting questions naturally arise. Indeed, examples of simple cubic graphs with χN′​(G)>5subscriptsuperscript𝜒′𝑁𝐺5\\chi^{\\prime}_{N}(G)>5 can be constructed in this class (Figure 3). Hence it is natural to ask for a possible upper bound for this parameter. Let us remark that any strong edge-coloring is a normal edge-coloring. Andersen has shown in  that any simple cubic graph admits a strong edge-coloring with ten colors. Hence ten is also an upper-bound for the normal chromatic index. The result was improved, following the approach of Andersen, in , where it is shown that any simple cubic graph admits a normal edge-coloring with nine colors. In 4, it is proved that if G𝐺G is any simple cubic graph, then χN′​(G)≤7subscriptsuperscript𝜒′𝑁𝐺7\\chi^{\\prime}_{N}(G)\\leq 7. This result is complemented with an infinite family of simple cubic graphs in which χN′​(G)=7subscriptsuperscript𝜒′𝑁𝐺7\\chi^{\\prime}_{N}(G)=7 4. Thus, the upper bound seven is (asymptotically) best-possible. Once the upper bound seven for all simple cubic graphs is established, one may wonder in improving it for some interesting graph classes. Of course, the first class that comes ones mind is the class of bridgeless cubic graphs. Conjecture 4 predicts an upper bound five, which is difficult to prove. Thus, the following intermediate conjecture could be an excellent step in this direction. (R. Šámal, ) For any bridgeless cubic graph G𝐺G, χN′​(G)≤6subscriptsuperscript𝜒′𝑁𝐺6\\chi^{\\prime}_{N}(G)\\leq 6. In this paper, we focus on Conjecture 5. For a given perfect matching F𝐹F of a bridgeless cubic graph G𝐺G, we introduce the notion of a non-conflicting no-where zero Z2×Z2subscript𝑍2subscript𝑍2Z_{2}\\times Z_{2} flow of G/F¯𝐺¯𝐹G/\\overline{F} (Definition 3). We demonstrate the usefulness of this concept by showing that if a bridgeless cubic graph G𝐺G has such a perfect matching, then it admits a normal 6-edge-coloring (Lemma 1). Moreover, we relate non-conflicting no-where zero Z2×Z2subscript𝑍2subscript𝑍2Z_{2}\\times Z_{2} flows in cubic graphs to a recent conjecture of Thomassen about the existence of a pair of edge-disjoint perfect matchings in highly edge-connected regular graphs 1 (see Lemma 2). Then we obtain the main results of the paper. The first one states that claw-free bridgeless cubic graphs G𝐺G have a perfect matching F𝐹F with respect to which G/F¯𝐺¯𝐹G/\\overline{F} admits a non-conflicting no-where zero Z2×Z2subscript𝑍2subscript𝑍2Z_{2}\\times Z_{2} flow (see Theorem 3). Moreover, one can find such a perfect matching in bridgeless cubic graphs which have a 2-factor that contains at most two cycles if G𝐺G is not the Petersen graph (see Theorem 4). In the end of the paper, we construct infinitely many 2-edge-connected cubic graphs G𝐺G that do not admit a non-conflicting no-where zero Z2×Z2subscript𝑍2subscript𝑍2Z_{2}\\times Z_{2} flow with respect to F¯¯𝐹\\overline{F} for any perfect matching F𝐹F of G𝐺G (see Proposition 5 and Theorem 5). We conclude the paper in Section 3, where we summarize the paper and present some questions that could be a direction of future research.
