      "content": "Paper Title: A Graph-based Stratified Sampling Methodology for the Analysis of (Underground) Forums\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSeveral works analyze underground forums to study specific areas of cybercrime. Common approaches rely on NLP and supervised ML using random samples for training and testing. In the context of the classification of posts, Portnoff et al.  proposed an automated classification of post type (buy, sell, and exchange currency), product offered/requested, and price. They also evaluated the performance of the supervised classifier by training and testing over eight forums. They observed that the tool performance significantly drops if used across forums. Similarly, Caines et al.  evaluated the performance of different statistical models and heuristics on labeling post type, author intent, and addressee in Hack Forums (HF). Van Wegberg et al.  trained a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to identify the type of listings (e.g. cash-out, malware, remote access tools (RATs), accounts, etc.) discussed in eight marketplaces and determine their associated revenue. Atondo Siu et al.  trained a supervised ML systems to classify posts in HF into a class of crime (Non-criminal, Access to system, Bots & Malware, eWhoring, Currency Exchange, DDoS, Identify Theft, Spam, Trading credentials, VPN) and analyzed the digital currency utilized in each class. They observed that there was a massive shift to Bitcoin after Liberty Reserve was taken down, and there was a demand for exchanging PayPal. In the context of cybercrime-as-a-service (CaaS), Akyazi et al.  measured the typology of CaaS services in HF via a supervised ML classifier and observed only a few CaaS categories discussed extensively (botnet, reputation escalation, and traffic-as-a-service). Sun et al.  investigated Concession-Abuse-as-a-Service, analysing the techniques employed in four underground forums. Bhalerao et al.  analyzed business-to-business interactions in two underground forums (HF and Antichat). They trained supervised ML classifiers to determine the product offered and the reply class (buying, selling, or other). From this classification, they built an interaction graph between members to determine the presence of supply chains in the criminal markets. Several studies focus on predicting criminal activities based on forum discussions. Pastrana et al.  developed a SVM to classify posts of key actors in HF and predict which actors might be of interest to law enforcement. Van Wegberg et al.  investigated vendors and product characteristics to predict products success via regression analysis. They observed a positive correlation with features like presence of refund policy, customer support, and use of vendor names. Sun et al.  studied the differences between private and public messages in underground forums and developed ML classifiers to predict presence of private interactions from public features. Yuan et al.  developed a tool to automatically identify new dark jargons in underground forum posts using NLP. The availability of forum discussions over several years allows researchers to investigate the evolution of these ecosystems. Soska and Christin  performed a longitudinal analysis of 16 online marketplaces for two years to estimate the sales volume and the type of products exchanged. They observed significant gross income for big marketplaces like Silk Road in the order of hundreds of thousands of dollars per day. Furthermore, they observed that the volume of sales was not significantly impacted by the law enforcement take-downs.\nPastrana et al. [ref]22 investigated eWhoring activities on underground forums for more than ten years. They trained a ML classifier to identify threads offering ‘packs’ and then determine the origins of the images, the main actors actively engaged in this activity, and their profits. They built a social network graph of members active in eWhoring discussions and identified the key actors using the h-index and eigenvector centrality.\nThey observed how the interest of these users moves from gaming and hacking to market-related topics after the interation in eWhoring threads.\nAllodi [ref]23 investigated exploits traded in a Russian black market and their likelihood of exploitation in the wild. Similarly, Campobasso and Allodi  measured the market trade volume of user-profiles and attackers’ purchasing preferences in an underground forum. Vu et al.  performed a longitudinal analysis of the trading activities in HF and their evolution over different ‘eras’. They observed how currency exchange and payments account for the majority of the contracts and payments are performed using Bitcoin and PayPal. Table I summarize the papers by the sampling techniques employed to train classifiers.\n\n\nCurrent approaches for supervised ML training rely on a sample obtained through random sampling from interesting discussions and do not employ information of the ”population” of the social network.\n\nWe instead propose a methodology to generate stratified samples employing centrality metrics from the forum structure. Stratified Random sampling\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: Road in the order of hundreds of thousands of dollars per day. Furthermore, they observed that the volume of sales was not significantly impacted by the law enforcement take-downs.\nPastrana et al. [ref]22 investigated eWhoring activities on underground forums for more than ten years. They trained a ML classifier to identify threads offering ‘packs’ and then determine the origins of the images,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
