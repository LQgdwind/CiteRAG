      "content": "Paper Title: Stable Matchings with Restricted Preferences: Structure and Complexity\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the last 60 years, the stable marriage problem and its variants have emerged as central topics in economics, computer science, and mathematics. The basic problem is phrased as follows. Let M𝑀M and W𝑊W be two disjoint sets of n𝑛n agents, traditionally referred to as men and women, respectively. Each agent has a preference list that ranks (all or some) members of the opposite sex. The goal is to find a matching μ𝜇\\mu between M𝑀M and W𝑊W such that no m∈M𝑚𝑀m\\in M and w∈W𝑤𝑊w\\in W mutually prefer each other to their partners in μ𝜇\\mu. Such a matching is called stable. In their seminal work, Gale and Shapley  proved that a stable matching μ𝜇\\mu always exists and provided an O​(n2)𝑂superscript𝑛2O(n^{2}) time algorithm for finding one. This run-time has been shown to be optimal in a variety of computational models 8 . While a stable matching instance of size n𝑛n may have 2Θ​(n)superscript2Θ𝑛2^{\\Theta(n)} stable matchings 1 , the Gale-Shapley algorithm outputs only two kinds of stable matchings—the man-optimal/woman-pessimal and the woman-optimal/man-pessimal stable matchings. That is, these stable matchings are the best for one group of agents but the worst for the other group. To address this inequity, researchers investigated various notions of “fair” stable matchings 1       [ref]7     and studied the problem of counting and sampling stable matchings uniformly at random    . For all of these problems, crucial insights are gained by understanding the combinatorial structure of the set of stable matchings. Irving and Leather  showed that every stable matching instance I𝐼I has an associated rotation poset ℛ​(I)ℛ𝐼\\mathcal{R}(I) that determines the structure of the set of stable matchings for I𝐼I. In particular, they proved that the stable matchings of I𝐼I are in one-to-one correspondence with the downsets of ℛ​(I)ℛ𝐼\\mathcal{R}(I) and that ℛ​(I)ℛ𝐼\\mathcal{R}(I) can be computed efficiently. Furthermore, given any finite poset 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P}, there is a stable matching instance I=I​(𝒫)𝐼𝐼𝒫I=I(\\mathcal{P}) whose rotation poset is isomorphic to 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P}, and I𝐼I can be computed efficiently as well. We say that such an instance I𝐼I realizes 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P}. Many problems related to finding a fair stable matching are NP-hard. They include computing a median stable matching   [ref]7, a balanced stable matching  or a sex-equal stable matching  . A natural approach then is to consider stable matching instances whose preference lists are restricted but nevertheless model situations that arise in practice. Below, we consider three such models from the work of Bhatnagar et al. . In the k𝑘k-attribute model, each agent has an associated k𝑘k-dimensional profile and their preference lists are determined by applying a linear function to the profiles of their potential partners. The model is motivated by online dating sites. In this context, participants are frequently asked an extensive set of questions. Some answers are used to create a participant’s profile while other answers are used to formulate a function that ranks possible dates according to the others’ profiles. In the k𝑘k-range model, there is an objective ranking for each set of agents. Each person ranks agents from the other group to within k𝑘k of their objective ranks. This model captures the scenario when participants make use of “official rankings” to create their preference lists. Students, for instance, might use their state’s ranking of nearby high schools to guide their choices, while the schools might base their preferences according to the students’ test scores. The participants do not have to copy the official rankings exactly; but they cannot deviate that much from the objective ranks when they make their choices. In the k𝑘k-list model, each set of agents can be partitioned into k𝑘k groups such that agents within each group have identical preference lists. The model applies to situations when students who aspire to be engineers all have the same preferences, students who plan to pursue a business-related major have the same preferences, etc. Similarly, high schools with a STEM focus may rank students the same way while high schools with a focus on the arts may have their own rankings. Bhatnagar et al.  studied the problem of sampling of stable matchings using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. For general instances, however, the method can take exponential time to converge to equilibrium. Such worst-case behavior occurs, for example, when the rotation poset of the instance has d𝑑d bottom elements b1,b2,…,bdsubscript𝑏1subscript𝑏2…subscript𝑏𝑑b_{1},b_{2},\\ldots,b_{d}, d𝑑d top elements t1,t2,…,tdsubscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2…subscript𝑡𝑑t_{1},t_{2},\\ldots,t_{d} and a single element that c𝑐c such that bi≺c≺tjprecedessubscript𝑏𝑖𝑐precedessubscript𝑡𝑗b_{i}\\prec c\\prec t_{j} for all i,j∈{1,2,…,d}𝑖𝑗12…𝑑i,j\\in\\{1,2,\\ldots,d\\} with d=θ​(n)𝑑𝜃𝑛d=\\theta(n). We refer to this poset as the star poset 𝒫dsubscript𝒫𝑑\\mathcal{P}_{d}. When the preference lists of the agents are restricted, we expect the rotation posets of the instances to be restricted as well. Yet Bhatnagar et al. showed that there are instances from each of the three models described above that have 𝒫dsubscript𝒫𝑑\\mathcal{P}_{d} as a rotation poset even when the parameter k𝑘k is a small constant (i.e., k=2𝑘2k=2 in the k𝑘k-attribute model, k=5𝑘5k=5 in the k𝑘k-range model and k=4𝑘4k=4 in the k𝑘k-list model). That is, even under narrow conditions, MCMC is not a feasible method for sampling stable matchings. Following , Chebolu et al.  considered the problem of counting the number of stable matchings (#​SM#SM\\mathrm{\\#SM}) for instances in the k𝑘k-attribute model and a related k𝑘k-Euclidean model (introduced by Bogomolnaia and Laslier ). They showed that #​SM#SM\\mathrm{\\#SM} is #​BIS#BIS\\mathrm{\\#BIS}-complete even when the preference lists are restricted to the 333-attribute and 222-Euclidean models. Thus, under a widely believed conjecture of Dyer et al. 2, #​SM#SM\\mathrm{\\#SM} does not admit a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS). Chebolu et al. established their result for the 333-attribute model by showing that for any bipartite graph G𝐺G, there is a 333-attribute stable matching instance whose rotation poset’s Hasse diagram is isomorphic to G𝐺G.111The intent is for the independent sets of G𝐺G to be in one-to-one correspondence with the downsets of the rotation poset. Bhatnagar et al.  and Chebolu et al.  established their hardness results by constructing stable matching instances with restricted preference lists that realized certain families of rotation posets. Our goal is to go a step further: to characterize the family of rotation posets realized by restricted families of stable matching instances.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: these stable matchings are the best for one group of agents but the worst for the other group.
