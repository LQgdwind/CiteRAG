      "content": "Paper Title: Hierarchical learning, forecasting coherent spatio-temporal individual and aggregated building loads\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis takes us to our third and last approach, crystallizing the intention and concepts behind the contributions of our work, namely, hierarchical forecasting, see (1c) of Fig. 5. This technique builds on the aforementioned multi-task forecasting model while extending it with the inclusion of a coherency-informed learning process thanks to a custom loss function employing established coherency taxonomy from the literature.\nThe coherency loss function is formulated as the difference between the predicted values ùíö^^ùíö\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} and its reconciled counterpart ùíö~~ùíö\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{y}}, following the reconciliation constraint of Eq. (12).\nThe coherency loss function ‚Ñícsuperscript‚Ñíùëê\\mathcal{L}^{c} can consequently be expressed as To combine both accuracy and coherency in the learning process of the regressor, the coherency loss is added to the hierarchical loss function defined in Eq. (33) forming the hierarchical-coherent loss function ‚Ñíh‚Äãcsuperscript‚Ñí‚Ñéùëê\\mathcal{L}^{hc}, where Œ±‚àà ùõº01\\alpha\\in  weights the hierarchical loss against the coherency loss. This avoids the over-adjustment of weights during the training of the regressor due to the addition of the coherency loss to the loss function. We typically set Œ±ùõº\\alpha to 0.75 for hierarchical forecasting to favor accuracy learning of produced predictions over coherency, yet this parameter should commonly be tuned by hyper-parameter optimization in the validation process of the model development, see Sec. 4.3.4 for implementation details. The method regroups numerous key advantages of machine learning-based forecasts. With large and rich multi-dimensional data to learn from the regressor effectively makes use of all the information provided by the most detailed layer of the hierarchy, i.e., the tree leaves, all the while incorporating hierarchical structure information as a soft-constrained learning mechanism.\nLoss function augmentation via regularization and penalty methods has grown to become the most popular way of introducing constraints in deep learning [ref]37  [ref]39. Although the approach comes at the price of sacrificing hard constraints, it has been shown that soft-constrained penalty methods perform well in practice and often exceed hard constraint methods [ref]40 .\nIn addition, machine learning approaches are powerful at capturing non-linear relationships in the targeted predicted values. In particular, deep-learning methods are known for effective and automatic feature extraction from the data, thus reducing the need for guesswork and heuristics, which could provide a much-needed solution to the problem of non-identifiability of the covariance matrix. Its disadvantages are similar to those of hierarchical forecasting approaches. By relying on a unique model, architecture considerations become paramount for the accurate performance of the regressor and consequently require careful, tailored tuning, e.g. with hyper-parameter grid-search.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: as a soft-constrained learning mechanism.\nLoss function augmentation via regularization and penalty methods has grown to become the most popular way of introducing constraints in deep learning [ref]37  [ref]39.
