Square convolutional and pooling kernels are often used to solve visual task such as VQA, visual scene classification and object recognition    .\n[ref]47   [ref]47   have successfully used visually motivated CNN with square filters to solve audio related tasks.\nTime-frequency representations of audio signals are however structured very differently than visual representations.\n  explore the performance of different structures of convolutive kernels when working with music signals classification. They propose the use of 1D convolution kernels to capture time-specific or frequency-specific features. They demonstrate that similar accuracy can be reached using a combination of 1D convolutions instead of 2D convolutions by combining 1D time and 1D frequency filters while using much fewer parameters. They also explore rectangular kernels which capture both time and frequency features at different scales. The impact of such strategies for music classification is still an open question in the context of auditory scene analysis. Coordinate maps initially proposed in¬† by¬† have proven successful for processing visual data in the context of VQA. The method consists in augmenting the visual input with matrices containing numbers in the range -1 to 1 which vary either in the xùë•x or in the yùë¶y-dimension. With MALiMo¬†, the same strategy is used to indicate the simultaneous relative positions of features in frequency and time.\n  proposed Frequency-Aware convolutions which are equivalent to concatenating coordinate maps only in the frequency axis.\nThe effectiveness of coordinate maps on the time dimension for audio signals have not been studied to the best of our knowledge. In this study we first evaluate the performance of a network initially designed for the VQA task (Visual FiLM)  on the AQA task, using the CLEAR2 data set.\nThen we introduce the NAAQA architecture to leverage specific properties of acoustic inputs.\nFor this architecture, we analyze the influence of separate time and frequency coordinate maps.\nWe then study the impact of adding a MALiMo block into our architecture.\nFinally, we evaluate our model on the DAQA‚Ä≤ dataset.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: networks (CNN) have dominated the visual domain in recent years.\nMore recently, they have also been applied to a number of problems in the acoustic domains such as acoustic scene classification  [ref]47 [ref]48 , music genre classification [ref]50 [ref]48, instrument classification  , sound event classification and localization  and speech recognition [ref]48.\nSome authors¬†[ref]50    use\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
