      "content": "Paper Title: EmoDubber: Towards High Quality and Emotion Controllable Movie Dubbing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMovie Dubbing, also known as Visual Voice Cloning (V2C), aims to convert a script into speech with the voice characteristics specified by the reference audio, while aligning lip-sync with the silent video (see Figure 1 (a)).\nV2C is far more challenging than conventional text-to-speech (TTS), but has a host of applications, not least in repurposing the vast volumes of existing video to be reproduced by movie creators or enthusiasts. Existing dubbing methods broadly fall into two groups.\nThe first focuses primarily on learning and applying effective speaker style representations.\nFor example, V2C-Net [ref]3 and VDTTS  utilize a pre-trained GE2E  to obtain unique and normalized utterance embedding.\nStyleDubber [ref]6 applies multi-scale learning to apply style cues to the embeddings extracted by GE2E, while Speak2Dub [ref]50 adopts pre-training strategy on TTS corpus to improve expressiveness.\nBecause these methods rely on simple MSE-based loss [ref]50 [ref]3 and overall scaling [ref]6, their capacity to establish accurate correspondence between lip motion and speech is limited.\nThe second group of methods aim to generate proper prosody by incorporating visual information from the provided video    [ref]6.\nFor example, HPMDubbing [ref]6 applies visual information to speech prosody through hierarchical modeling of lips, face, and scene.\nRecently, MCDubber  operates at the level of context sequence with previous and following facial information to enhance generated speech prosody.\nThese methods work at the video-frame and mel-spectrogram levels, however, which means they ignore the role of phoneme-level pronunciations, and thus often generate seemingly mumbled articulation. Except for the above shorts, most current dubbing models suffer from rigid emotional expression due to lacking controllability.\nSome studies  suggest that the emotional intensity in dubbing can affect the listener’s emotions and psychological perception of the film.\nSince the film’s post-production can make up for the deficiencies of previous recordings, especially in emotional expression, the actors need to re-record in studio according to the director’s instructions until they meet the requirements. Unlike previous methods, our model not only satisfies the basic function (lip-sync and clear pronunciation), but also learns to control the attribute and intensity of emotions to meet customized needs, as shown in Figure 1 (b). In this paper, we propose a novel movie dubbing architecture named EmoDubber, which achieves emotion synthesis with controllable intensity while maintaining audio-visual alignment and clear pronunciation.\nSpecifically, we first design a Lip-related Prosody Aligning (LPA) module that controls speech speed by duration level contrastive learning between lip motion and phoneme prosody sequence, which helps the model to reason the correct audio-visual aligning.\nSecond, we propose the Pronunciation Enhancing (PE) strategy, which focuses on expanding video-level phoneme sequences by monotonic alignment search and fusing it with the output of LPA by an efficient conformer to improve pronunciation.\nNext, the speaker identity adapting module is used to absorbs the fused sequence from PE and injects style embedding from the reference speaker to target acoustics prior information.\nFinally, the proposed Flow-based User Emotion Controlling (FUEC) aims to generate waveform by optimal-transport conditional flow matching based on acoustic priors while rendering the user-specified emotion.\nIt is worth noting that we propose positive and negative guidance mechanisms (PNGM) in FUEC to allow user control emotional intensity flexibly, which\ndetermines the gradient direction of emotion generation and adjusts the dual guidance scale based on the user’s emotion prompt, amplifying the target emotion and suppressing others. The contributions of this paper are summarized below: We propose EmoDubber, a controllable emotion dubbing architecture to help users specify the emotion they need\nwhile satisfying high-quality lip sync and pronunciation. We design a FUEC with positive and negative guidance to dynamically adjust the flow-matching vector field prediction process to achieve intensity control flexibly. We simultaneously achieve high-quality lip sync and clear pronunciation by aligning duration-level contrastive learning and phoneme-enhancing strategy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the proposed Emodubber performs favourablly against state-of-the-art models on three benchmark datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: creators or enthusiasts.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
