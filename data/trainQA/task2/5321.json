      "content": "Paper Title: 3DSGrasp: 3D Shape-Completion for Robotic Grasp\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRobotic grasping has recently gained increasing attention because of its essential role in many real-world applications, such as domestic and collaborative robotics. The seminal work of Pas et al. [ref]1 uses 3D Point Cloud Data (PCD) to generate grasp poses directly on the available 3D object structure. However, in real practical scenarios we often have to rely on incomplete geometric information acquired from single or few viewpoints, which leads to drastic reduction of grasping success rate. Researchers bypassed this problem by acquiring complete 3D object scans  but this requires a feasible camera path\naround the object, which is time consuming to obtain and not always feasible.\nAnother strategy is to place additional sensors around the object of interest [ref]3, but this is not cost-effective and it requires careful calibration. Instead, this paper aims at improving single-view grasping by predicting the missing geometrical structure from a partial PCD. 3D shape completion is an inherently ambiguous problem but recent learning-based approaches have provided encouraging results on different classes of objects.\nInitial shape completion solutions [ref]4  converted the 3D point cloud to a voxel grid with the rendering of additional data that increases processing time and memory requirements. More efficient networks   were inspired by the PointNet  architecture that directly processes unordered PCDs. However, most of these methods have been evaluated on synthetic, noise-free datasets, far from real-world scenarios. Differently, this work proposes a new model for 3D point completion that can operate in a realistic scenario for robot grasping with arbitrary object classes. Our method adopts a transformer-based network  and it proposes a modification of an Offset-Attention layer   with the introduction of skip connections that is able to complete the partial PCD as extracted from just a single depth camera frame. By completing the point cloud, the computation of the grasp poses can leverage the additional information of a full PCD. Our proposed grasping pipeline is shown in Figure 1. With the calibrated camera equipped on the robotic arm, we first acquire the PCD and segment the background information using PointNet++ . The segmented partial PCD of the object is then normalised, i.e. scaled and centered, and fed to the PCD completion network to predict the missing geometry of the object. We then map back the predicted point cloud in the real-world scene reference in order to merge the predicted missing PCD with the observed partial input. Furthermore, we generate the grasp pose on the top of virtually completed point cloud using the method proposed in Grasp Pose Detection in Point Clouds (GPD) . Finally, we utilise Moveit!  to plan the arm trajectory that moves the gripper to the pose estimated by GPD. We first evaluate our PCD completion method on a PCD completion benchmark dataset [ref]4 that has been generated on the top of YCB dataset , by training all the state-of-the-art methods (from scratch) using the same dataset (and split), and outperform the reconstruction error of the best state-of-the-art methods. Then, we test the proposed grasping pipeline in a real scenario using a Kinova arm, our completion network, and GPD. Our method provides accurate completions for successful grasp poses, which enclose the self-occluded parts of the object. Thus, the set of promising grasp hypothesis is larger, which improves the overall success rate score. To summarise, these are our main contributions: We propose a novel partial PCD completion network based on the Offset-Attention encoder-decoder Transformer, that achieves state-of-the-art PCD completion performance when evaluated on the partial version of the YCB dataset proposed in [ref]4. We integrate and test our grasping pipeline with a Kinova arm, showing a significant improvement in robotic grasping success rate. We present extensive ablation studies on the architecture of our proposed completion network to best justify our design choices.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Robotic grasping has recently gained increasing attention because of its essential role in many real-world applications, such as domestic and collaborative robotics.
