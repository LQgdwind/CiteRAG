      "content": "Paper Title: Data-Independent Structured Pruning of Neural Networks via Coresets\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNeural networks today are the most popular and effective instrument of machine learning with numerous applications in different domains. Since¬† used a model with 60M parameters to win the ImageNet competition in 2012, network architectures have been growing wider and deeper. The vast overparametrization of neural networks offers better convergence¬† and better generalization¬†. The downside of the overparametrization is its high memory and computational costs, which prevent the use of these networks in small devices, e.g., smartphones. Fortunately, it was observed that a trained network could be reduced to smaller sizes without much accuracy loss. Following this observation, many approaches to compress existing models have been proposed (see¬† for a recent review on network sparsification, and¬†0   1  0  for structured pruning). Network compression is composed of two parts: 1) finding a more compact architecture (reducing the size of the layers or reducing the number of non-zero weights) and 2) updating the network parameters to approximate the original model.\nMost of the model compression methods search for a smaller architecture and weight approximation simultaneously¬†0  . A different approach is to decouple architecture search from the network approximation (e.g.¬†[ref]33 ). A lot of work has been done in neural architecture search¬†. One can follow this route for finding a smaller architecture¬†.\nThe second step of determining the weights of the small model can be done in several ways: Train the small architecture from scratch ‚Äì the experiments in  showed that this could reach accuracy similar to the original large network. Retain KùêæK most important weights/filters (KùêæK is defined by the small architecture) and fine-tune the network (e.g.¬†[ref]33). Find the weights of the small architecture that approximate the output of the original network and then fine-tune the weights (e.g.,¬†1 ). Even though many approaches show comparable results in terms of accuracy of the compressed model and its size, there are other important aspects that a practitioner should consider. For example, if the algorithm is tuned to a specific data (as in¬†0  4   ), the compressed network would fail to approximate the output of the original network on less typical unseen examples. In contrast, the accuracy of data-independent method (e.g.¬†[ref]33 0) is guaranteed for any input. Another important aspect of a compression framework is its construction time. Specifically, one-shot compression¬†[ref]33 is much faster than an iterative approach (e.g.¬†). Additionally, a well approximated model would require shorter fine-tuning time than a less accurate counterpart or training the compressed architecture from scratch. Obviously, the approximation of the original model is a function of the compression rate. However, previous works generally lack strong provable guarantees on the trade-off between the compression rate and the approximation error. The absence of worst-case performance analysis can potentially be a glaring problem depending on the application. Finally, there is a choice between model sparcification¬†  vs. structured pruning¬†4   . The former, leads to an irregular network structure, which needs a special treatment to deal with sparse representations, making it hard to achieve actual computational savings. Structured pruning simply reduces the size of the tensors, providing very simple implementation and much higher computational savings. Thus structured pruning is much more practical. Form the above discussion, we can derive the following requirements for the model compression framework: 1) it should provide provable guarantees on the trade-off between the compression rate and the approximation error, 2) it should be data-independent, 3) it shout yield high compression rates, 4) it should be computationally efficient. To address these goals, we propose an efficient framework with provable guarantees for structured pruning, which is based on the existing theory of coresets¬†. Coresets decrease massive inputs to smaller instances while maintaining a good provable approximation of the original set with respect to a given function. While most of previous work used coreset to reduce large volumes of data, here we apply it to reduce model parameters in neural networks by treating neurons as inputs in a coreset framework. Namely, we reduce the number of neurons in layer iùëñi by constructing a coreset of neurons in this layer that provably approximates the output of neurons in layer i+1ùëñ1i+1 and discarding the rest. The coreset algorithm provides us with the choice of neurons in layer iùëñi and with the new weights connecting these neurons to layer i+1ùëñ1i+1. We apply similar concept to derive a filter pruning algorithm for the convolutional layers. The coreset algorithm is applied layer-wise from the bottom to the top of the network, resulting in a unified framework for approximating the entire network. Our framework satisfies the aforementioned requirements: Provable guarantees: The size of the coreset, and consequently the number of remaining neurons in layer iùëñi, is provably related to the approximation error of the output for every neuron in layer i+1ùëñ1i+1. Thus, we can theoretically derive the trade-off between the compression rate and the approximation error of any layer in the neural network. We implement the direction, in which we construct a coreset of a predefined size (the size is specified by the target small architecture).111The other direction, in which the size of the coreset is determined given the approximation error is theoretically possible, but is more complicated to implement. and provably derive the approximation error, which holds for any input. Most previous work lack such guarantees, and thus shows abnormal behaviour on some of the inputs. It was shown in¬†3 that pruning via recent methods affects generalization of a network at a class and exemplar level. Full and pruned models have comparable average accuracy, but they diverge considerably\nin behavior on specific sub-sets of input distribution. Our framework does not suffer such a degradation as it provably holds for any input. Data-independent compression:\nThe coreset approximation of neurons provably holds for any input, in particular, it holds for the input layer; thus the proposed framework will provably hold for any input data, termed data-independent compression. Fast construction:\nOur framework performs one-shot structured pruning that seeks for the best approximation of the original network given the architecture of the small network. Thus it requires much shorter fine-tuning than heuristic-based approximation with no guarantees or training from scratch. High Compression Rates:\nThe proposed theory shows the existence of a small neural coreset. Our empirical results on LeNet-300-100 for MNIST¬† and VGG-16¬†6 for CIFAR-10¬†6 demonstrate that our framework based on coresets of neurons outperforms sampling-based coresets by improving compression without sacrificing the accuracy. The results on VGG-19, ResNet56  for CIFAR-10 and ResNet50 for ImageNet  demonstrate that our channel pruning method shows comparable results to the state-of-the-art methods of channel pruning, but is more efficient in terms of model construction.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: model compression methods search for a smaller architecture and weight approximation simultaneously¬†0  .
