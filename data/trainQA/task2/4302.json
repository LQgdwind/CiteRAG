      "content": "Paper Title: 𝐿₂BN: Enhancing Batch Normalization by Equalizing the 𝐿₂ Norms of Features\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBatch Normalization (BN)  is a milestone in improving deep neural networks.\nNonetheless, BN has some disadvantages.\nOne of them is that BN does not perform well with a small batch size 5.\nAnother disadvantage is that BN is not suitable for sequence models [ref]2, such as RNN , LSTM , GRU , and Transformer 4.\nThe information leakage 6 is also a shortcoming of BN, which means that the models may exploit mini-batch information rather than learn representations that generalize to individual samples .\nFrom the robustness perspective, BN may increase adversarial vulnerability and decrease adversarial transferability . As these drawbacks have been identified, there have been many approaches to address them to varying degrees 7  [ref]2 6. In this paper, we find that BN has other overlooked shortcomings.\nFirst, BN does not enlarge the discrepancy of inter-class features to the maximum possible extent.\nTaking Figure 2 (b) and (c) as an example, after the BN, the minimum angle between pairwise class centers increases from 24.77∘ to 35.81∘. However, the minimum angle can reach 120∘ theoretically. Second, BN makes the intra-class features less compact.\nTaking Figure 5 (a) as an example,\nthe intra-class features are similar in orientation originally.\nAfter the transformation of BN, they are separated in direction.\nThrough the forward pass of multiple layers, this intra-class separation may be magnified.\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are the first to discover the disadvantages of BN from the perspective of\ndiscriminability. To address these issues of BN, we propose a simple and intuitive approach.\nAs shown in Figure 3, we just make the l2subscript𝑙2l_{2} norms of features identical before feeding them into BN.\nSince our method combines the l2subscript𝑙2l_{2} normalization and batch normalization, we call it L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}BN.\nThere are several advantages of L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}BN:\n(a) It can continuously broaden the minimum angle between pairwise class centers, as shown in Figure 4. Therefore, the L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}BN can enlarge the discrepancy of inter-class features.\n(b) The L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}BN can eliminate the intra-class separation caused by the difference in l2subscript𝑙2l_{2} norms of sample features, as shown in Figure 5 (b).\n(c) The L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}BN is easy to implement without any extra parameters and hyper-parameters. To verify the effect of L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}BN, we adopt the measures of intra-class compactness and inter-class discrepancy used in ArcFace .\nThe intra-class compactness is measured by intra-angle, which is defined as the mean of angles across features w.r.t. their respective class feature centers.\nThe inter-class discrepancy is measured by inter-angle, which is defined as the mean of minimum angles between each class feature center and the others.\nWe plot the intra-angle and the inter-angle of training data in Figure 1 (a) and (b) respectively, taking the ResNet-110  model trained on CIFAR100  as an example.\nDuring the whole training process, the L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}BN model achieves a smaller intra-angle than the BN model consistently, indicating that the L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}BN obtains more compact intra-class features.\nFurthermore, the L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}BN model gradually gets a larger inter-angle than the BN model, indicating that the L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}BN obtains more distinguished inter-class features.\nOverall, the L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}BN is able to enhance the intra-class compactness and inter-class discrepancy simultaneously, and therefore the feature discrimination and generalization capability are strengthened. In practice, the implementation of L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}BN is very simple and requires only a few lines of code.\nTo exhibit the effectiveness and generality of L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}BN, we conduct extensive experiments with various classical convolutional neural networks on tasks of image classification and acoustic scene classification.\nFor both tasks, we replace each BN layer in models with an L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}BN layer.\nExperimental results show that the L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}BN can generally improve the classification accuracy, decrease the intra-angle, and increase the inter-angle, which demonstrates that the L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}BN can enhance the generalizability and the discriminability of neural networks.\nThese experiments show that the L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}BN is generally useful and can be used as an improved alternative to batch normalization in designing neural networks.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: neural networks.\nNonetheless, BN has some disadvantages.\nOne of them is that BN does not perform well with a small batch size 5.\nAnother disadvantage is that BN is not suitable for sequence models [ref]2, such as RNN , LSTM , GRU , and Transformer 4.\nThe information leakage 6 is also a shortcoming of BN, which means that the models may exploit mini-batch information rather than learn\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
