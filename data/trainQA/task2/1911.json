      "content": "Paper Title: Link Prediction on N-ary Relational Data Based on Relatedness Evaluation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince Google announced Knowledge Graph (KG) in 2012, KG has been increasingly popular in these years. And link prediction on KG has caught much attention for a long time, to complete KG and further promote KG based applications. Usually, a KG is represented as a set of triples in the form of (head entity, relation, tail entity), where n-ary relational facts are decomposed into multiple triples via introducing virtual entities, such as the Compound Value Type (CVT) entities in Freebase . Actually, n-ary relational facts are not in the minority. As an example, in Freebase, more than 1/3131/3 of its entities are involved in n-ary relational facts [ref]2. Based on the public KGs of the above binary form, researchers have developed numerous methods for link prediction  [ref]4 , including the tasks of head entity prediction, relation prediction, and tail entity prediction. However, manipulating n-ary relational facts into triples has some deficiencies. Firstly, it makes link prediction on n-ary relational data need to consider many triples. Since existing link prediction methods on triples, like the above methods, usually model triples one by one individually and correspondingly conduct link prediction on only a single triple each time, it is intricate to carry out link prediction involving more than one triple. Secondly, there is a loss of structure information in some of the conversions from n-ary relational facts to triples [ref]2, which may lead to inaccurate prediction. Thirdly, the added virtual entities, along with the corresponding triples, bring in more parameters to be learned, and there is a data sparsity problem. With these considerations in mind, in this paper, each n-ary relational fact is represented as a set of its role and role-value pairs, denoted as r:v pairs for short, instead of being converted into multiple triples. Hence, no additional entities and triples are introduced, and all the structure information is retained. Then, we propose a method to handle link prediction on n-ary relational data. Specifically, link prediction on n-ary relational data is to predict the missing role/role-value of an n-ary relational fact. Recently, there are also a few studies for link prediction on n-ary relational data. In m-TransH [ref]2, an n-ary relation is defined by the mappings from a sequence of roles to their role-values. Each specific mapping is an n-ary relational fact. Then, a translation based method is proposed to model these facts. RAE  improves m-TransH with the modeling of the likelihood that two role-values co-participate in a common n-ary relational fact. Although RAE achieves favorable performance, it does not consider the roles explicitly when evaluating the above likelihood. Actually, under different sequences of roles (corresponding to different relations), the relatedness of two role-values is greatly different. For example, under the role sequence (p​e​r​s​o​n,a​w​a​r​d,p​o​i​n​t​i​n​t​i​m​e,t​o​g​e​t​h​e​r​w​i​t​h)𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑑𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑡𝑜𝑔𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ(person,award,point\\ in\\ time,together\\ with) (in this paper, the examples are all derived from Wikidata111https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page), M​a​r​i​e𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑒Marie C​u​r​i​e𝐶𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑒Curie and H​e​n​r​i​B​e​c​q​u​e​r​e​l𝐻𝑒𝑛𝑟𝑖𝐵𝑒𝑐𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑙Henri\\ Becquerel are more related than under the role sequence (person,spouse,starttime,endtime,(person,spouse,start\\ time,end\\ time, placeofmarriage)place\\ of\\ marriage), since they won N​o​b​e​l​P​r​i​z​e​i​n𝑁𝑜𝑏𝑒𝑙𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑖𝑛Nobel\\ Prize\\ in P​h​y​s​i​c​s𝑃ℎ𝑦𝑠𝑖𝑐𝑠Physics in 1903 together. To address these problems, our method explicitly models the relatedness of the r:v pairs involved in an n-ary relational fact. The above example also elucidates its necessity. Some newly proposed methods [ref]7   0 further apply position-specific convolution [ref]7, tensor decomposition techniques , or structure-aware methods  0. They do not consider any type constraint. Since for a valid n-ary relational fact, the expected type of the role-value in the view of the role should be compatible with the actual type of the role-value in each r:v pair, we combine these signals without explicit external supervision from a type catalog. Thus, NaLP is extended to tNaLP (type-NaLP). Furthermore, we equip NaLP and tNaLP with a more reasonable negative sampling mechanism and thus extend them to NaLP+ and tNaLP+, respectively. In general, the main contributions of this paper are: We advocate a representation form for n-ary relational facts, which represents each n-ary relational fact as a set of its r:v pairs. We propose a link prediction method NaLP on n-ary relational data, which captures the relatedness of all the r:v pairs in an n-ary relational fact explicitly. We further introduce type constraints of roles and role-values in an unsupervised manner, and propose a more reasonable negative sampling mechanism. Thus, NaLP is extended to tNaLP, NaLP+, and then tNaLP+, respectively. Experimental results and analyses testify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methods. In addition, as publicly available n-ary relational datasets are limited, we build a practical one, WikiPeople, based on Wikidata 1. We further derive some new ones, WikiPeople-n, WikiPeople-0bi, WikiPeople-50bi, and WikiPeople-100bi, from WikiPeople with different percentages of binary relational facts. They have been available on github222https://github.com/gsp2014/WikiPeople for further research. We have also opened our source codes of the proposed methods333https://github.com/gsp2014/NaLP.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Type (CVT) entities in Freebase .
