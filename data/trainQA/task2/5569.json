      "content": "Paper Title: Emotion Prediction Oriented method with Multiple Supervisions for Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe purpose of sentiment analysis   [ref]3   is to classify a given text into positive, negative, neutral or more fine-grained categories, which usually plays an important role in decision-making and human behavior analysis. Recently, more and more studies   [ref]8 have focused not only on the emotional polarity of a text but also on the reasons behind this emotion. This promotes the proposal of the emotion-cause extraction task (ECE) and the emotion-cause pair extraction task (ECPE). Emotion cause analysis has attracted lots of attention due to the promising application prospects. Generally, the emotion clause appears in text with an emotional word, such as ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù and ‚Äúsadness‚Äù, and the cause clause is expressed as an event or a kind of behavior. The cause provides more details about how emotions are stimulated and generated. Extracting emotion causes help to understand what emotions are expressed in the text and why these emotions are perceived. The emotion cause analysis can be applied in many fields, such as improving service quality  0 1, controlling public opinion trends 2 3 4 5 and assisting the empathetic response generation 6 7. Particularly, emotion cause extraction (ECE) aims to determine which clauses contain the causes for the given emotion 8 9 0. 1 points out that the ECE task neglects the mutual indications between the emotion and cause and requires the annotated emotion in advance, which limits its application scope. To solve these shortcomings, 1 define a new emotion-cause pair extraction (ECPE) task, which aims to extract all the potential pairs of emotions and the corresponding causes from an unannotated emotion text. As shown in the following example, an emotion clause c2subscriptùëê2c_{2} containing the emotion word ‚Äúhappily‚Äù and the corresponding cause clause c1subscriptùëê1c_{1} constitute an emotion-cause pair (c2,c1)subscriptùëê2subscriptùëê1(c_{2},c_{1}): He received a call to be hired (c1subscriptùëê1c_{1}), jumped up happily (c2subscriptùëê2c_{2}), and told his parents this good news (c3subscriptùëê3c_{3}). For the ECPE task, 1 firstly proposed a two-step method, where the first step aims to extract emotions and cause clauses separately. The second step is to train a binary classifier to determine whether a candidate pair is an emotion-cause pair. Obviously, this two-step setting will cause the errors in the first step to propagate to the second step. To address this problem, some works proposed end-to-end architectures to solve the ECPE task. Some works 2 4 3 learned the representation of candidate pair and made classification on the pair representation to identify the emotion-cause pairs in a unified fashion. Some works 3 4 constructed the networks from the perspectives of emotion and cause and extracted the corresponding cause clause/emotion clause based on the assumption that each clause in the document can be regarded as an emotion clause/cause clause. Furthermore, some works 5 6 7 [ref]8 regarded the ECPE as a sequence labeling problem. 5 considered the relative distance between the emotion clause and cause clause into tags. 6 added the emotional type to labeling tag. 7 designed content and pairing parts for emotion/cause identification and clause pairing, respectively, and propose a unified target-oriented sequence-to-sequence model to capture the mutual effects among the target clause, global context, and former decoded label. [ref]8 proposed a multi-task sequence tagging framework and used the output of both auxiliary tasks to induce the tag distribution for benefiting emotion-cause pair extraction. Determining the emotion clause is essential for emotion-cause pair extraction 1 4 3. However, how to effectively construct and utilize the high-quality emotion clause candidates to improve the performance of emotion-cause pair extraction still lack sufficient exploration. Actually, when solving ECPE, the emotion clauses are usually easier to be detected in comparison with the cause clauses. Suppose we can preliminarily determine the possible emotion clauses and find the probable cause clauses for each likely emotion clause. In that case, we can obtain a candidate set containing the pairs with a high possibility of becoming emotion-cause pairs. The extracted emotion clause can provide clues to assist cause clause extraction, which reduces extraction difficulties as we can extract real emotion-cause pairs from these candidate pairs with a higher chance. Motivated by this idea, we propose an end-to-end framework oriented toward emotion prediction (EPO-ECPE) to extract the emotion-cause pairs, which centers around the emotion prediction to guide the subsequent emotion-cause pair extraction. Obviously, the performance of emotion-cause pair extraction is impacted by the quality of the candidate emotion clause. That is, the low precision and low recall of emotion prediction will damage the performance of emotion-cause pair extraction, and the high performance of emotion prediction is conducive to constructing a higher-quality emotion-cause pair candidate set. We equip EPO-ECPE with a synchronization mechanism to exploit the potential of emotion prediction in assisting emotion-cause pair extraction. This ensures that the knowledge learned from the emotion prediction and emotion-cause pair extraction can be synchronized to promote each other. Different candidate pairs have different probabilities of being emotion-cause pairs. Based on this observation, we divide all pairs into pairs that are more likely to be emotion-cause pairs, i.e., genuine pairs, and pairs that are less likely to be emotion-cause pairs, i.e., fake pairs.\nMeanwhile, we set the genuine and fake pair supervisions to learn from the genuine and fake pairs, respectively. The two supervisions update the pair representations in the pairing stage in different ways and then share the learned representations with the emotion prediction to improve a new round of emotion prediction. Note that the new round of emotion prediction can further assist the emotion-cause pair extraction.\nThe main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: We propose an end-to-end emotion-cause extraction approach oriented toward emotion prediction (EPO-ECPE). To our knowledge, it is the first ECPE framework centered on emotion prediction to guide subsequent emotion-cause pair extraction. We propose a synchronization mechanism to share the learned clause representation between emotion prediction and emotion cause pair extraction in multiple training rounds. To reduce the difficulty of pair extraction, we divide all candidate pairs into genuine pairs and fake pairs and set the genuine pair supervision and fake pair supervision to gather information from the genuine pairs and fake pairs, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed EPO-ECPE outperforms all existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on emotion-cause pair extraction. Especially, EPO-ECPE greatly improves when extracting multiple emotion-cause pairs from one document 111https://github.com/LeMei/EPO-ECPE.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: The purpose of sentiment analysis   [ref]3   is to classify a given text into positive, negative, neutral or more fine-grained categories, which usually plays an important role in decision-making and human behavior analysis.
