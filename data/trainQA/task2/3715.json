Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1.

In¬†, [k]‚àílimit-fromdelimited-[]ùëò[k]-Roman domination was shown to be solvable in linear time on graphs of bounded clique-width by modeling it as a locally checkable problem with a color-counting check function, as follows: Colors={0,‚Ä¶,k+1}Colors0‚Ä¶ùëò1\\textsc{Colors}=\\left\\{0,\\ldots,k+1\\right\\}, (Weights,‚™Ø,‚äï)=(‚Ñï‚à™{+‚àû},‚â§,+)Weightsprecedes-or-equalsdirect-sum‚Ñï(\\textsc{Weights},\\preceq,\\oplus)=(\\mathbb{N}\\cup\\{+\\infty\\},\\leq,+), w‚Äã(v,a,‚Ñì0,‚Ä¶,‚Ñìk+1)=awùë£ùëésubscript‚Ñì0‚Ä¶subscript‚Ñìùëò1ùëé\\textsc{w}(v,a,\\ell_{0},\\ldots,\\ell_{k+1})=a for all v‚ààV‚Äã(G)ùë£ùëâùê∫v\\in V(G), a‚ààColorsùëéColorsa\\in\\textsc{Colors} and ‚Ñì0,‚Ä¶,‚Ñìk+1‚àà‚Ñïsubscript‚Ñì0‚Ä¶subscript‚Ñìùëò1‚Ñï\\ell_{0},\\ldots,\\ell_{k+1}\\in\\mathbb{N}, c‚Äãh‚Äãe‚Äãc‚Äãk‚Äã(v,a,‚Ñì0,‚Ä¶,‚Ñìk+1)=(a+‚àëj=0k+1j‚Äã‚Ñìj‚â•k+‚àëj=1k+1‚Ñìj)ùëê‚Ñéùëíùëêùëòùë£ùëésubscript‚Ñì0‚Ä¶subscript‚Ñìùëò1ùëésuperscriptsubscriptùëó0ùëò1ùëósubscript‚Ñìùëóùëòsuperscriptsubscriptùëó1ùëò1subscript‚Ñìùëócheck(v,a,\\ell_{0},\\ldots,\\ell_{k+1})=\\left(a+\\sum_{j=0}^{k+1}j\\ell_{j}\\geq k+\\sum_{j=1}^{k+1}\\ell_{j}\\right) for all v‚ààV‚Äã(G)ùë£ùëâùê∫v\\in V(G), a‚ààColorsùëéColorsa\\in\\textsc{Colors} and ‚Ñì0,‚Ä¶,‚Ñìk+1‚àà‚Ñïsubscript‚Ñì0‚Ä¶subscript‚Ñìùëò1‚Ñï\\ell_{0},\\ldots,\\ell_{k+1}\\in\\mathbb{N}. Notice that w is 1-stable and c‚Äãh‚Äãe‚Äãc‚Äãkùëê‚Ñéùëíùëêùëòcheck is kùëòk-stable, so this model also suffices our purposes.\nFurthermore, as mentioned in¬†0, by making slight changes in the model (that do not affect the kùëòk-stability of the functions or the number of colors by more than a constant factor) we can also express several other variants of Roman domination, such as perfect¬†, independent¬†, outer independent¬†, total¬† and maximal¬†0.\nFor the signed¬† and\nsigned total¬† Roman domination, notice that they are color-counting, therefore FPT parameterized by clique-width¬†, however they are not dùëëd-stable for any¬†dùëëd.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: This problem was first defined in¬†[ref]3 as a generalization of Roman domination and double Roman domination¬† .\nLet kùëòk be a positive integer.\nA [k]delimited-[]ùëò[k]-Roman dominating function on a graph Gùê∫G is a function\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
