      "content": "Paper Title: Cognition-Mode Aware Variational Representation Learning Framework for Knowledge Tracing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKnowledge Tracing. Numerous attempts have been made in KT field over the decades, including probabilistic models , logistic models  , and deep models 3  6 . Among the existing methods, most of them revolve around improving the model architecture for modeling students’ practice sequences. For example, Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT)  uses the Hidden Markova Model (HMM) to trace students’ knowledge states. Additive Factor Model (AFM)  and Performance Factor Analysis (PFA) 4 represent students’ practices by constructing a practice factor. Inspired of the success of deep learning, Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) 3 novelly introduces the long short-term memory network (LSTM)  into KT to represent students’ knowledge states with the hidden units. Later, Dynamic Key-Value Memory model (DKVMN)  extends DKT by utilizing a key-value memory network to update students’ knowledge states. To better capture long-term practices, SAKT 6 introduces the self-attention mechanism into KT field. Convolutional Knowledge Tracing (CKT)  applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) [ref]14 to model students’ learning rates. Moreover, there are some works exploring students’ sequences in a more granular way. DKT+ 0 extends DKT to consider forgetting by incorporating multiple types of information related to forgetting. AKT  novelly extends both IRT  and SAKT 6 to enhance the interpretability and simulate students’ forgetting behaviors. IEKT  estimates the students’ cognition and assesses knowledge acquisition sensitivity for each record. LPKT  monitors students’ knowledge states through directly modeling students’ learning gains and forgetting. LFBKT  introduces the difficulty factor, and models the students’ learning and forgetting behavior according to various influencing factors. DIMKT 0 measures the question difficulty effect and improves KT performance by establishing the relationship between student knowledge states and question difficulty level. However, most of the above methods require enough samples to train model parameters to achieve excellent performance. In reality, the data-sparsity problem is serious since most students practice few times. Although KTM and CL4KT [ref]13 respectively introduce attribute features and data augmentation methods into the KT field, they still cannot well model the uncertainty of infrequent students. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a general framework CMVF for the KT task to learn robust student representations. Variational Inference. The Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE)  efficiently performs inference and learning by optimizing a latent model using any common estimator. This enables very efficient approximate posterior inference through simple ancestral sampling, allowing for efficient learning of the model parameters without requiring expensive iterative inference schemes (such as MCMC) per datapoint. The learned approximate posterior inference model can be applied in various research fields, including Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and recommendation systems. Despite its success in other fields, VAE has not been utilized in KT to model the uncertainty of infrequent students. Dynamic Routing Algorithm. It is proposed in the Capsule Network 9, in which a capsule denotes a group of neurons assembled to output a vector. Dynamic routing algorithm is used to learn the weights on the connections between capsules where parameters are optimized by Expectation-Maximization algorithm to overcome several deficiencies and achieves better accuracy. The capsule and dynamic routing mechanism make the capsule network achieve better performance than conventional deep neural network and achieves advanced performance in multiple research fields   1 8.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: states.
