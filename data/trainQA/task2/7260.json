      "content": "Paper Title: DTMM: Deploying TinyML Models on Extremely Weak IoT Devices with Pruning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCurrent Internet of Things (IoT) systems make wide use of resource-constrained devices such as microcontroller units (MCUs) for data acquisition in various sensor network applications in industry¬†, healthcare¬† , agriculture¬†, and smart city¬†, because MCUs have ultra-low power consumption, in milliwatts or microwatts¬† , which are suitable for sustainable and widespread deployment. Recent studies find that running machine learning (ML) models on such end devices can further provide useful device-side data processing to avoid frequent data transmissions (thereby reducing energy consumption), preserve data privacy and enable new application scenarios¬†. Therefore, an emerging field of tiny machine learning (TinyML)¬† [ref]9 8 has appeared recently, focusing on adopting ML models on embedded IoT devices to expand their reach for ubiquitous intelligence. However, the size and computation cost of ML models are usually not small, e.g., on the order of MB¬†[ref]16 2, which contradicts to the extremely limited resource on MCUs. For example, a typical MCU (such as NUCLEO-F446RE) has only 512 KB of static random-access memory (SRAM) for temporary runtime data storage, 1 MB of on-chip embedded flash (eFlash) memory for program storage, and 180 MHz CPU frequency for task processing. Computation offloading is recently used to facilitate the deployment of ML models on MCUs to bypass their resource constraints¬†. However, offloading relies on additional infrastructure, such as edge for support, which is not conducive to large-scale deployment. To achieve fully autonomous operation and local inference, we revisit model compression and find that weight pruning¬†8  is still a viable but underexploited solution. Commercial ML frameworks, such as Tensorflow Lite Micro¬†[ref]9 and CMSIS-NN¬†, already supports structured pruning¬†8 9 4, which treats each filter (or other structures (¬ßVI)) as an atomic unit to remove all weights of selected filters to reduce the amount of model weights (Figure¬†1(b)). Structured pruning is easy to implement, but the pruned filters may still contain many useful weights, leading to coarse-grained pruning. The model accuracy drop significantly when high compression ratios are required on the MCU. To improve pruning granularity, another solution called unstructured pruning¬† is proposed to prune arbitrary weights (Figure¬†1(c)). It achieves high accuracy by identifying and removing less important weights, but introduces two unique challenges on MCUs. First, due to the removal of arbitrary weights, each unpruned weight needs an index to record its existence, which incurs significant additional storage costs and lacks an efficient storage mechanism to fit the MCU‚Äôs tight memory. Second, more importantly, the format of the remaining weights, indicated by their index values, is incompatible with commercial ML frameworks. It requires non-trivial overhead to convert these weights prior to inference¬†2, which can significantly slow down model inference with low-end MCU processors (see ¬ßIII-B for details). To overcome these problems, we are inspired by recent attempts¬†9 4 to group weights to form new pruning units with a granularity between entire filters and individual weights (¬ßVI). We choose to group an entire line of weights at the same position across all channels in the filter as an atomic pruning unit for the MCU and name it filterlet. Figure¬†1(d) shows that two and three filterlets (blue ones) are to be removed from Filter 111 and kùëòk, respectively. Removing weights in the granularity of filterlets allows more flexible and finer-grained results than pruning filters, which thus can achieve higher compression ratio yet with little compromise of accuracy. However, if we only change the pruning unit to filterlets, similar limitations to unstructured pruning still exist. The main reason we use this new unit is because we observe that weights in each filterlet are stored contiguously on the MCU (¬ßIII). This local memory continuity can be used to design a new data structure to efficiently store pruned models and a novel operator to significantly speed up model inference, based on which we can also devise a specialized scheduler for deriving the optimal pruning strategy given resource constraints before actual pruning, resulting in a systematic and practical solution to deploy TinyML models on MCUs. In this paper, we enable all these designs in DTMM, a full-stack library that fills in the important but missing pieces of post-execution low-cost storage, runtime inference acceleration and pre-execution pruning optimization to efficiently deploy TinyML models on MCUs through pruning. Pruning using filterlets in DTMM is essentially a hybrid of the two types of pruning described above to leverage the advantages of both, but pruning is not the only step in deploying a model, and DTMM further avoids the respective shortcomings, making the pruned model finally usable and running on the real device. We develop a prototype of DTMM, integrate it into TensorFlow Lite Micro¬†[ref]9 and evaluate its performance on Arm Corstone-300 of the Cortex-M55 processor¬† using various models, including VGG-11¬†2, ResNet-12¬†[ref]16 and YOLO¬†9 on three datasets: CIFAR-10¬†5, Visual Wake Words (VWW)¬†, and Face Detection Dataset Benchmark (FDDB)¬†2. We compare DTMM with state-of-the-art structured and unstructured methods, CHIP¬†4 and PatDNN¬†7. Overall, DTMM outperforms the structured method CHIP by reducing model size and inference latency up to 42.8% and 27.7%, respectively, without compromising accuracy. Compared to the unstructured method PatDNN, DTMM achieves up to 33.7% and 74.6% reduction on model size and inference latency, respectively, without compromising accuracy. In summary, this paper makes the following contributions: We propose a novel library called DTMM for deploying TinyML models on weak IoT devices to achieve high compression ratio, high accuracy and small overhead. We choose a suitable pruning unit and design a set of new techniques for model storage, operator acceleration and optimization to realize the design of DTMM, which is compatible to commercial ML frameworks. We develop a prototype of DTMM and extensively evaluate its performance using different ML models and rich datasets, showing remarkable performance gains.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: avoid frequent data transmissions (thereby reducing energy consumption), preserve data privacy and enable new application scenarios¬†.
