      "content": "Paper Title: No Train Still Gain. Unleash Mathematical Reasoning of Large Language Models with Monte Carlo Tree Search Guided by Energy Function\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLarge language models (LLMs) have achieved almost best performance on various multi-step reasoning tasks including coding [ref]1   and math   [ref]6   . The integration of complex reasoning capabilities       empowers LLMs to solve more complex tasks such as  and .  recently propose to apply Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)  to accomplish these complex task with balance between exploration and exploitation.  0 propose a discriminator-guided multistep decoding methods that training a step or path scoring model to guide the decoding process. On the other hand, [ref]6 1 design a specific data augmentation technique to generate more supervised finetuning data and close-sourced-model-based process scoring to employ reinforcement learning (RL). Those methods boost the mathematical reasoning abilities by a large margin compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, those methods needs to design a specific scoring function including path contrastive learning or using closed-sourced models restricting the adaptability and generalizability of LLMs in practical scenarios. Can we unlock the mathematical reasoning capability of pretrained language models (LLMs) without the need for task-specific expert knowledge and data augmentation during the re-training process? Is it possible to adapt LLMs and utilize their reasoning ability solely during inference time? Inspired by [ref]6 1, We propose a novel framework to improve the Mathematical Reasoning ability with a given LLMs. The core idea is to reformulate a LLMs to a Residual Energy-based Model 2. The main intuition is to modify the distribution with a energy function to make it closer to desired target distribution 2. Unlike [ref]6 1, energy function can be served as a path scoring function with a strong theoretical guarantee. However, training energy function is hard due to the intractable partition function3 using Maximum log-likelihood Estimation (MLE). Usually, we optimize energy function using Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) 4. NCE needs samples from data distribution as positive sample and noise samples from noise distribution. The LLMs can be served as noise distribution to generate noise samples as much as possible. This enlighten us to apply energy function to guide the MCTS for solving mathematical problems. We conduct several experiments on GSM8k 5 and AQUA-RAT 6. Our method boost the pass@1 accuracy for supervised fine-tuning(SFT) LLM from 41.9 to 52.23 surpassing RFT [ref]6 which using more data to finetune a LLM. It also achieves comparable performance compared to SOTA 1 without complicated data generation and reinforcement learning procedure. Given the released model provided by [ref]6, our method can further improve the performance by a large margin and surpass the WizardMath 1 by a large margin. The main contributions of this work are as followings: We propose the use of Residual EBM to reformulate the initial LLMs in order to achieve a desired target distribution. Furthermore, we integrate the energy function as the scoring mechanism for the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to guide the decoding process. We propose rejection sampling and suboutput sampling as methods for generating noise samples from Language Models (LLMs). These approaches eliminate the requirement for task-specific expert knowledge, making them highly versatile for various problems and datasets. We utilize a combination of generated noise samples and the training dataset to optimize the energy function using Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE). This approach enhances the model’s ability to distinguish between real and generated data. Additionally, we employ Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), guided by the energy function, to further improve the pass@1 accuracy from 41.9 to 52.23 compared to the initial Latent Language Models (LLMs) on GSM8k. MCTS guided by an energy function significantly improves the pass@1 accuracy of released models, as demonstrated in the study by RFT [ref]6. The pass@1 accuracy for the RFT-7B model has been boosted from 50.3% to 56.78%, while the RFT-13B model has witnessed a remarkable increase from 55.4% to 61.4%. This improvement is substantial and highlights the efficacy of employing MCTS with an energy function to enhance the accuracy of these models.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved almost best performance on various multi-step reasoning tasks including coding [ref]1   and math   [ref]6   .
