      "content": "Paper Title: ALGAN: Time Series Anomaly Detection with Adjusted-LSTM GAN\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the increasing reliance on networked sensors and actuators in various contexts, such as smart buildings, factories, power plants, and data centres, have led to the generation of large quantities of time series data. By continuously monitoring the functioning of these systems, anomalies or behaviour patterns in time steps that deviate from what is considered normal , can be detected . Anomaly detection allows for proactive intervention to address underlying issues before they result in potentially catastrophic outcomes  , particularly in some environments that are mission-critical. It is important to note that the ability to accurately identify anomalies is crucial in several domains. It can prevent disruptions in service and ensure the safe and efficient operation of these systems . Due to the lack of label information, anomaly detection in time series data is often approached as an unsupervised machine learning problem [ref]6 [ref]7 . Most traditional unsupervised anomaly detection methods utilise linear projection and transformation techniques  0. However, these methods are not well-suited for handling non-linear interactions inherent in time series data. Another class of methods compares the system state value at the current time step with a predicted normal range to identify anomalies . However, these methods are often ineffective in practice because many systems are highly dynamic and it can be difficult to define a normal range of measurements. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are gaining popularity as a framework for learning generative models through adversarial training 1. GANs have been successful in generating realistic images 1 2 3 and synthetic data 4 5, and have been used to model the complex, high-dimensional distribution of normal time series data in the real world 4. An emerging trend in anomaly detection is to combine GANs with latent space mapping to identify anomalies in the data  [ref]7 [ref]6 4. However, it is yet to be seen how the internal network of GANs can impact the accuracy of detection in time series data. In this paper, we propose a novel model called Adjusted-LSTM GAN (ALGAN) for detecting anomalies in time series data. It uses an Adjusted-LSTM (ALstm) where the output of the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network is adjusted using attention on top of inputs and hidden states to enhance the temporal dependencies among the\ninputs and the hidden states. This reduces the information loss during long-sequence information propagation through LSTM and, hence, improves anomaly detection in both univariate and multivariate time series data in an unsupervised setting. To detect anomalies in time series data using GANs, it is necessary to model the normal behaviour of the data using adversarial training, and then use an anomaly score to identify points that deviate significantly from this normal behaviour [ref]7 6 [ref]6. To learn this anomaly score, we map the given time series data to a latent space and then reconstruct the data from this latent space. The anomaly score is calculated as the loss between the given data (i.e. real) and the reconstructed (i.e. fake) data. We evaluated the performance of ALGAN on 47 real-world datasets originating from various domains, 46 of which are univariate time series datasets from the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB) collection 7 8, each containing a small number of data points ranging from one thousand to 22 thousand. The remaining dataset is a large multivariate dataset from the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) system 9, containing over 946K data points. We compared the performance of ALGAN to that of traditional models, neural network models and other GAN-based methods. Empirical analysis shows that ALGAN significantly outperformed these models. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of ALGAN and the use of ALstm in ALGAN for anomaly detection, as compared to existing GANs. The main contributions of this paper are: The introduction of ALGAN, a novel method based on Adjusted-LSTM, for detecting anomalies in both univariate and multivariate time series datasets. The development of a novel model, Adjusted-LSTM, for adjusting the output of LSTM networks for reducing information loss and enhancing the temporal dependencies among the inputs and the hidden states. An extensive evaluation of ALGAN on a diverse range of 47 univariate and multivariate time series datasets from multiple domains. Results demonstrate that ALGAN, which utilises Adjusted-LSTM, outperforms traditional, neural network-based, existing LSTM-based GANs and other GAN-based approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first GAN-based work that adjusts the output of LSTM networks for detecting anomalies in long sequences. Examining the feasibility of using ALstm and GAN for anomaly detection in time series data will enable the application of ALstm and GAN feasible in many domains. We show the generalisation ability of our ALstm and GAN framework on various datasets with different characteristics. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 summarises related work in the field, Section 4 presents the proposed ALGAN method, Section 5 provides an empirical evaluation of the proposed model, and Section 6 includes the paper conclusion.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: ensure the safe and efficient operation of these systems .
