      "content": "Paper Title: Scene Consistency Representation Learning for Video Scene Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDataset.\nMovieNet  consists of 1,100 movies with a large amount of multi-modal data and annotations, and the total duration of all movies is about 3000 hours, it is the\nlargest dataset for movie understanding analysis by far. Besides, MovieNet  is split into a training set with 660 movies, a validation set with 220 movies and a testing set with 220 movies.\nCurrently, for the task of Video Scene Segmentation, 190, 64 and 64 videos are labeled with scene boundaries for the training, validation and test sets, respectively. More importantly, movies in the MovieScene  are all included in MovieNet. It is worth noting that there are two versions of annotation about Video Scene Segmentation task associated with MovieNet, one with only 150 annotations (called MovieScenes in  [ref]1, used in earlier methods  but it is no longer available), and one with a total of 318 annotations (abbreviated as MovieScenes-318 in this work). Since the small scale of of BBC [ref]10 and OVSD  datasets and unavailability of AdCuepoints [ref]1 dataset, we instead adopt MovieNet  dataset to evaluate the related approaches, more details are in the Supplementary Materials. Our implementations based on official public codebase,2 while DP (Dynamic Programming) isn‚Äôt public available. Our implementations. Representation Learning Stage.\nFor visual modality, each shot consists of 3 keyframes and ResNet50  is chosen as the default backbone to learn the shot representations. The audio backbone used in  is applied for audio modality, more details about the backbone encoders can be found in Supplementary Materials. For pretraining data, (i) training set (660 movies) in MovieNet  is used to learn the shot representations, while we also conduct experiments with (ii) all data (1,100 movies) [ref]1 for a fair comparison. In particular, although test data without the scene boundary labels are used for representation learning in setting (ii), it is not recommended to use all the data for pretraining because we usually have no prior access to test data in real scenarios. Moreover, for the most of Self-Supervised benchmarks    [ref]14    , representation learning is performed only on the training set, rather than all of the data. Video Scene Segmentation Stage.\nFor existing Self-Supervised methods on images and videos, a simple downstream model is frequently used to evaluate the representation quality of the frozen encoders. For instance, a linear fully-connected layer is widely used for evaluation.\nHowever, for the Video Scene Segmentation task, we cannot determine whether the ending position of a single shot is the scene boundary or not. Consequently, a boundary-based non-temporal model (MLP-based protocol, followed by [ref]1) and a boundary-free temporal model (Bi-LSTM -based protocol, proposed by us) are employed to evaluate the capability of the encoder for local-to-global modeling. Metrics. We use the mean of Average Precision (AP)  [ref]1 specified to ground truth scene boundaries of each movie, as well as F1-score for the evaluation. Implementation Details.\nDuring the learning stage of Self-Supervised representation, the batch size is set to 1,024 (shots), initial learning rate is set to 0.03 and the training epoch is 100. The parameters of the visual and audio encoders are randomly initialized. Besides, we perform naive K-Means algorithm   for online clustering and the cluster number #‚Äãc‚Äãl‚Äãa‚Äãs‚Äãs#ùëêùëôùëéùë†ùë†\\#class is set to 24, while the clip length, i.e. œÅùúå\\rho of Scene Agnostic Clip Shuffling is set to 16.\nMoCov2 [ref]14 with the queue size of 65,536, momentum value of 0.999, temperature of 0.07 and cosine learning rate decay, are used as our SSL framework setting.\nFor the Video Scene Segmentation task, n‚Äãu‚Äãmùëõùë¢ùëönum-o‚Äãfùëúùëìof-s‚Äãh‚Äão‚Äãtùë†‚Ñéùëúùë°shot [ref]1 is set to 4 and 40 for the MLP [ref]1 and Bi-LSTM protocols, respectively.\nEach pretraining trial is conducted on the server with 8 NVIDIA V100 GPUs for approximate 24 hours in visual modality and 10 hours in audio modality.\nThe dimensions of visual and audio features used for both pretraining and evaluation are 2,048 and 512, respectively.\nMore details, e.g., the choice of hyperparameter, are presented in Supplementary Materials.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: included in MovieNet.
