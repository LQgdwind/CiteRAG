      "content": "Paper Title: A Novel Nuanced Conversation Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models in Mental Health\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile lots of effort has been allocated to evaluate different types of LLMs for topics ranging from logical reasoning [ref]22 to trustworthiness [ref]23, we explore relevant existing works that study conversation performance research. We see papers in this domain tend to include partial discussions on this topic rather than focus an entire paper on it, such as in . While this paper provides an effective combination of human and automatic evaluation methods, the automated evaluation metrics are limited and are popular general ones used for LLMs, such as ROUGE . Because of this, they lack the depth that applied conversation metrics would offer. The work also lacks a human baseline, which would provide an insightful perspective to compare performance. We see works that dedicate themselves to addressing this need by proposing complete automatic evaluation frameworks for this [ref]26. However, the metrics used in this paper [ref]26 are grammar, context, and relevance. These are limited in terms of the number and depth provided by the analysis. It also tells us about the specific response from the LLM but less about the interaction between the LLM and the person. There also exist papers that push the whole field of analysing LLM dialogue forward by providing general large-scale conversation data . These works provide high-quality data and explore the types of discussions that occur between LLMs and people. However, they don’t study the interaction at a finer level to understand aspects such as how the LLM crafts the response and balances emotion. We have attached a table from  summarising the key existing benchmarks used for LLM evaluation. Of all the benchmarks mentioned, only one, EmotionBench , attempts to assess nuanced conversation skills at the level of interaction between LLM and person. In this case, it studies explicitly the affective nature of responses. A limitation of this study is that it tends to focus on self-reporting for emotion analysis, which introduces self-reporting bias. A better approach would be to analyse and identify the emotion present within the text. Additionally, it focuses on assessing how LLMs may come up with and suggest appropriate emotions to given imagined situations. This differs from determining how they might naturally generate emotions in conversation. While this paper is a good start and provides some information regarding LLMs’ nuanced affective conversation ability, it must be more comprehensive. Based on the existing work we analysed, we have identified a gap regarding LLM’s natural nuanced conversation abilities. While some related literature that discusses evaluation exists, the work needs more depth and applied metrics. Additionally, the existing work focuses more on question-answering performance than linguistic conversational abilities.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: While lots of effort has been allocated to evaluate different types of LLMs for topics ranging from logical reasoning [ref]22 to trustworthiness [ref]23, we explore relevant existing works that study conversation performance research.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
