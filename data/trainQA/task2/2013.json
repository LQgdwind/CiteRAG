      "content": "Paper Title: Continual World: A Robotic Benchmark For Continual Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe now sketch 777 CL methods evaluated on our benchmark. Some of them were developed for RL, while others were meant for the supervised learning context and required non-trivial adaptation.\nWe aimed to cover different families of methods; following [ref]13, we consider three classes: regularization-based, parameter isolation and replay methods. An extended description and discussion of these methods are provided in Appendix B. Regularization-based Methods This family builds on the observation that one can reduce forgetting by protecting parameters that are important for the previous tasks. The most basic approach often dubbed L2¬† simply adds a L2subscriptùêø2L_{2} penalty, which regularizes the network not to stray away from the previously learned weights. In this approach, each parameter is equally important. Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)¬† uses the Fisher information matrix to approximate the importance of each weight.\nMemory-Aware Synapses (MAS)  also utilizes a weighted penalty, but the importance is obtained by approximating the impact each parameter has on the output of the network. Variational Continual Learning (VCL), follows a similar path but uses variational inference to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the current distribution of parameters (posterior) and the distribution for the previous tasks (prior). Parameter Isolation Methods This family (also called modularity-based) forbids any changes to parameters that are important for the previous tasks. It may be considered as a ‚Äúhard‚Äù equivalent of regularization-based methods. PackNet¬† ‚Äúpacks‚Äù multiple tasks into a single network by iteratively pruning, freezing, and retraining parts of the network at task change. PackNet is closely related to progressive neural networks 3, developed in the RL context. Replay Methods Methods of this family keep some samples from the previous tasks and use them for training or as constraints to reduce forgetting. We use a Perfect Memory baseline, a modification of our setting which remembers all the samples from the past (i.e., without resetting the buffer at the task change). We also implemented Averaged Gradient Episodic Memory (A-GEM) [ref]12, which projects gradients from new samples as to not interfere with previous tasks. We find that A-GEM does not perform well on our benchmark. Multi-task learning In multi-task learning, a field closely related to CL, tasks are trained simultaneously. By its design, it does not suffer from forgetting, however, it is considered to be hard as multiple tasks ‚Äúcompete for the attention of a single learning system‚Äù, see  4. We find that using reward normalization as in PopArt  is essential to achieve good performance. See Appendix¬†H.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: Some of them were developed for RL, while others were meant for the supervised learning context and required non-trivial adaptation.\nWe aimed to cover different families of methods; following [ref]13, we consider three classes: regularization-based, parameter isolation and replay methods. An extended description and discussion of these methods are provided in Appendix B.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
