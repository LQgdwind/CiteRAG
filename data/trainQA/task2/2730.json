Such tools often offer a rich set of features, from one-to-one messaging to rich media content exchange , which ultimately contributed to engage billions of worldwide users in online activities . It is thus of great importance to study user behavior on such platforms to be able to monitor events in the real world\n[ref]5. A topic that has attracted large interest in recent years is the study of misinformation dissemination, especially in social media applications   [ref]7. Indeed, it has been argued that such applications are widely used as tools for misinformation campaigns , with important negative impact on the real world during election campaigns  , humanitarian crisis , pandemics 0 and other social events 1. Thus, the study of misinformation spread is not only a concern but more of a necessity to both understanding the phenomenon and developing methods to mitigate its negative effects  2. In such context, WhatsApp emerged as an important platform for information spread, reaching more than 2 billion users worldwide in 2020111https://www.whatsapp.com/about/.\nWhatsApp is a messaging application that connects users in one-to-one as well as group conversations. Though originally designed for exchanging messages, WhatsApp has been shown to enable the formation of rich underlying networks with structural properties similar to those observed in other popular online social networks . These networks are fostered especially by the so called WhatsApp groups, which, though limited to only 256 simultaneous members, are linked to each other by common members which may act as bridges through which information can propagate beyond group boundaries  3. Not surprisingly, WhatsApp has reportedly been abused to spread misinformation 4, mainly via group conversations, which raised major\nconcerns in many countries 5. The great popularity of WhatsApp motivated a number of recent studies on different aspects of its dynamics\n [ref]7 2 6 7.\nIn common, these prior efforts focused on the content properties and general propagation dynamics of pieces of information (notably misinformation).\nOrthogonally, we have recently shown that WhatsApp group members do organize themselves into communities that extrapolate the boundaries of particular groups, suggesting that such boundaries offer little constraint to information spread and that the underlying network indeed conveys an important means to accelerate it 3. However, we analyzed information dissemination in general, with no particular focus on misinformation spread nor on how different components of this network are linked to such spread. Thus, the role that such network (and its components)\nplays in misinformation spread remains an open issue. In this article, we take a step towards filling this gap by offering an analysis of misinformation dissemination in publicly accessible WhatsApp groups focusing on the users involved in the process. Specifically, we offer a hierarchical network-oriented characterization of user engagement in misinformation spread from three perspectives, representing three levels of aggregation: individual users, WhatsApp groups and user communities. As in 3, we define a community as a grouping of users who shared the same content disproportionately frequently, that is, more often that could be expected by random chance. As such, just like individual users and formally established WhatsApp groups, these communities, which emerge naturally from the co-sharing patterns and potentially cover users from multiple groups, are essential components for understanding the information spread on the platform. Therefore, our study is driven by the goal of\noffering valuable insights into how WhatsApp users leverage the underlying network connecting different groups to gain large reach in the spread of misinformation in the platform. Towards that goal, we rely on a dataset containing messages shared in 155 publicly accessible WhatsApp groups during\n6 weeks encompassing the 2018 general elections in Brazil. This was a period of great social mobilization in the country, for which there is already great amount of evidence of WhatsApp being abused for misinformation campaigns. In particular, borrowing results from  [ref]7 6, the presence of misinformation is detected in textual, image and audio messages by using a dataset of “fake facts” previously checked by multiple Brazilian fact-checking sites. We then create a media co-sharing network model by representing users as nodes and\nconnecting those who shared similar content with edges. Such networks, one for each week, can be seen as representations of potential channels for information propagation in WhatsApp. Thus, we investigate the role of individual users, groups and communities in misinformation spread mostly from the perspective of their participation in these networks. Specifically, towards identifying communities of users engaged in misinformation dissemination, we focus on the backbones of the media co-sharing networks, which includes only edges connecting users who consistently and disproportionately often shared the same content 3.\nThus, the communities we analyze, extracted from those backbones, represent groupings of users who shared similar content more often than expected by random chance, driven by intentional behavior (i.e., by orchestration), by coincidence (as side eﬀect of the general information diﬀusion process) or by a mix of both. Beyond the network backbones, we also look into the network periphery, built from the remaining nodes and edges, which do not exhibit clear evidence of strong co-sharing patterns but still may contribute as sources of misinformation in the platform. Our main findings can be summarized as follows: A few users, groups and communities concentrate the top sources of misinformation spread on the platform. Indeed, the 10 users most often engaged in misinformation spread are responsible for a large fraction (8-26%) of all misinformation shared in a week, and also introduce a great fraction of fresh content in the platform (11.5%). Similarly, a fraction of all groups and communities often concentrate most messages with misinformation. These groups and communities tend to have more members, thus offering a bigger potential audience for those messages. The media co-sharing network has an important role in misinformation spread. At individual, group and community levels, those more often engaged in misinformation spread tend to occupy more central positions in the network, which ultimately may favor the scale of spread. The network backbones often include top misinformation sources in the network, which establish a large number of strong co-sharing connections among themselves. On the other hand, the network periphery, which includes the largest part of the network, also includes a large fraction of users engaged in misinformation, though to a lesser degree. The individual users mostly engaged in misinformation spread change drastically over time. Yet, they are frequently members of the same groups. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related work while Section 3 describes the main steps of our methodology of analysis. Section 4 presents our characterization results, followed by our main conclusions and possible directions for future work in Section 5.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: contributed to engage billions of worldwide users in online activities .
