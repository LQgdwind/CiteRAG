      "content": "Paper Title: VectorFusion: Text-to-SVG by Abstracting Pixel-Based Diffusion Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDiffusion models are a flexible class of likelihood-based generative models that learn a distribution by denoising. A diffusion model generates data by learning to gradually map samples from a known prior like a Gaussian toward the data distribution. During training, a diffusion model optimizes a variational bound on the likelihood of real data samples , similar to a variational autoencoder . This bound reduces to a weighted mixture of denoising objectives [ref]9: where 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} is a real data sample and t∈{1,2,…​T}𝑡12…𝑇t\\in\\{1,2,\\ldots T\\} is a uniformly sampled timestep scalar that indexes noise schedules αt,σtsubscript𝛼𝑡subscript𝜎𝑡\\alpha_{t},\\sigma_{t} . ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon is noise of the same dimension as the image sampled from the known Gaussian prior. Noise is added by interpolation to preserve variance. ϵϕsubscriptitalic-ϵitalic-ϕ\\epsilon_{\\phi} is a learned denoising autoencoder that predicts the noise content of its input. For images, ϵϕsubscriptitalic-ϵitalic-ϕ\\epsilon_{\\phi} is commonly a U-Net [ref]32 [ref]9, and the weighting function w​(t)=1𝑤𝑡1w(t)=1 [ref]9. Denoising diffusion models can be trained to predict any linear combination of 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} and ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon, such as the clean, denoised image 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x}, though an ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon parameterization is simple and stable. At test time, a sampler starts with a draw from the prior 𝐱T∼𝒩​(0,1)similar-tosubscript𝐱𝑇𝒩01\\mathbf{x}_{T}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,1), then iteratively applies the denoiser to update the sample while decaying the noise level t𝑡t to 0. For example, DDIM [ref]38 samples with the update: For text-to-image generation, the U-Net is conditioned on the caption y𝑦y, ϵϕ​(𝐱,y)subscriptitalic-ϵitalic-ϕ𝐱𝑦\\epsilon_{\\phi}(\\mathbf{x},y), usually via cross-attention layers and pooling of the features of a language model . However, conditional diffusion models can produce results incoherent with the caption since datasets are weakly labeled and likelihood-based models try to explain all possible images. To increase the usage of a label or caption, classifier-free guidance  superconditions the model by scaling up conditional model outputs and guiding away from a generic unconditional prior that drops y𝑦y: CFG significantly improves coherence with a caption at the cost of an additional unconditional forward pass per step. High resolution image synthesis is expensive. Latent diffusion models  train on a reduced spatial resolution by compressing 512×512512512512\\times 512 images into a relatively compact 64×64646464\\times 64, 4-channel latent space with a VQGAN-like autoencoder (E,D)𝐸𝐷(E,D) . The diffusion model ϵϕsubscriptitalic-ϵitalic-ϕ\\epsilon_{\\phi} is trained to model the latent space, and the decoder D𝐷D maps back to a high resolution raster image. We use Stable Diffusion, a popular open-source text-to-image model based on latent diffusion.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: a diffusion model optimizes a variational bound on the likelihood of real data samples , similar to a variational autoencoder .
