      "content": "Paper Title: Computationally Bounded Robust Compilation and Universally Composable Security\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne obvious question this generalization raises is: how do these generalized notions of 𝑅𝐶𝑅𝐶\\mathit{RC} correspond to 𝖴𝖢𝖴𝖢\\mathsf{UC} security?\nRecall that the definitional structure of 𝖴𝖢𝖴𝖢\\mathsf{UC} security is extremely similar to the structure of LABEL:cr:\\rhclabel (and LABEL:cr:\\comprhclabel and LABEL:cr:\\predrhclabel).\n𝖴𝖢𝖴𝖢\\mathsf{UC} security explicit demands environments that distinguish between executions while LABEL:cr:\\predrhclabel allows arbitrary\nequivalence relations over behaviors, but otherwise they are nearly identical.\nBecause the equivalence relation is arbitrary, we can consider the class of equivalences that consider\ndifferences in behaviors between the source and target program for each environment separately, as we did in Section III. Taking this view, the predicates Q𝑄\\mathit{\\color[rgb]{0,0.5,1}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0,0.5,1}\\pgfsys@color@cmyk@stroke{1}{0.50}{0}{0}\\pgfsys@color@cmyk@fill{1}{0.50}{0}{0}Q} and 𝐐𝐐\\mathbf{\\color[rgb]{1,0.23,0.13}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{1,0.23,0.13}\\pgfsys@color@cmyk@stroke{0}{0.77}{0.87}{0}\\pgfsys@color@cmyk@fill{0}{0.77}{0.87}{0}Q} represent restrictions on the behavior\nof the protocols, ideal functionalities, attackers, and simulators,\nand the equivalence ≡\\equiv must specify any restrictions on environments as well as how similar the behaviors must be.\nSetting the predicates to 𝖳𝗋𝗎𝖾𝖳𝗋𝗎𝖾\\mathsf{True} and ≡\\equiv to ==, as we did above,\nyields that requirement that behaviors must be identical, with no restriction on protocols, functionalities, attackers, simulators, or environments.\nThat definition corresponds precisely to perfect 𝖴𝖢𝖴𝖢\\mathsf{UC} security (1).\nSince we have already shown the same assignments produce the definition of LABEL:cr:\\rhclabel,\nthis correspondence immediately re-proves the result of Patrignani et al. [ref]43. Similarly, if we use 𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑦𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑦\\mathit{\\color[rgb]{0,0.5,1}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0,0.5,1}\\pgfsys@color@cmyk@stroke{1}{0.50}{0}{0}\\pgfsys@color@cmyk@fill{1}{0.50}{0}{0}poly} and 𝐩𝐨𝐥𝐲𝐩𝐨𝐥𝐲\\mathbf{\\color[rgb]{1,0.23,0.13}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{1,0.23,0.13}\\pgfsys@color@cmyk@stroke{0}{0.77}{0.87}{0}\\pgfsys@color@cmyk@fill{0}{0.77}{0.87}{0}poly} as predicates and computational indistinguishability,\nwe recover a definition of computational 𝖴𝖢𝖴𝖢\\mathsf{UC} security (3),\nand immediately recover Theorem 2. We are not, however, limited to these two cases.\nFor instance, consider using the trivial predicate 𝖳𝗋𝗎𝖾𝖳𝗋𝗎𝖾\\mathsf{True} to leave protocols and attackers unrestricted,\nand instantiating ≡\\equiv with ≅\\cong, which leaves environments unrestricted but demands only indistinguishable behaviors.\nThat is, The result is not perfect 𝖴𝖢𝖴𝖢\\mathsf{UC} security, as the behaviors may differ, but it is also not computational,\nas there is no restriction on the complexity of any component of the system.\nInstead, LABEL:cr:\\predrhclabel​(≅,𝖳𝗋𝗎𝖾,𝖳𝗋𝗎𝖾)LABEL:cr:\\predrhclabel𝖳𝗋𝗎𝖾𝖳𝗋𝗎𝖾\\lx@cref{creftypecap~refnum}{cr:\\predrhclabel}(\\cong,\\mathsf{True},\\mathsf{True}) corresponds to a third version of 𝖴𝖢𝖴𝖢\\mathsf{UC} security:\nstatistical 𝖴𝖢𝖴𝖢\\mathsf{UC} security, where the distributions of behaviors must be statistically close, but not identical. There are also other indistinguishability notions that appear in both the cryptography and language-based security literatures,\nand this result can connect them to each other.\nExamples from the cryptographic domain include\nRényi divergence ,\nwhich is often used in lattice-based cryptography as it\nprovides a definition for when a search problem is computationally difficult,\nKullback-Leibler divergence ,\nwhich has been used to to simplify proofs\nrelating to fundamental definitions like adversarial advantage,\nand more [e.g. 5]. In language-based security, properties like noninterference \nand observational determinism   are often defined\nusing an equivalence that erases certain (secret) parts of the trace and\ndemands the remaining (public) portion be identical   .\nDifferent variations of these equivalences define different notions of noninterference\n(e.g., termination-sensitive or insensitive, timing sensitive, or constant time),\nor generalize to programs that include explicit declassifications or endorsements   .\nEven other equivalence notions, like differential privacy , may be possible,\nparticularly in combination with existing language-based results   . By inserting these equivalences into our framework, we immediately obtain a formal definition for the security they define\nfrom both a robust compilation and a 𝖴𝖢𝖴𝖢\\mathsf{UC} standpoint.\nThe result is a meaningful way to relate more cryptographic security to secure compilation and more language-based security to cryptography.\nMoreover, it provides the language needed to combine the two.\nFor example, some existing work combines noninterference-style definitions with computational hardness  ,\nand our work gives a way to situate those equivalences more broadly points to ways to extend and expand them. Finally, the relation ≡\\equiv does not need to be an equivalence relation.\nOur proofs demand only that it is reflexive and transitive (i.e., a preorder), not symmetric.\nIndeed, instantiating ≡\\equiv with ⊆\\subseteq produces a notion of behavioral refinement.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: 𝖴𝖢𝖴𝖢\\mathsf{UC} security (1).\nSince we have already shown the same assignments produce the definition of LABEL:cr:\\rhclabel,\nthis correspondence immediately re-proves the result of Patrignani et al.
