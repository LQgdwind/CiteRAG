      "content": "Paper Title: Representation Sharing for Fast Object Detector Search and Beyond\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nObject detection is a fundamental task in computer vision  [ref]25 8   [ref]24   , but it remains challenging due to the large variation in object scales.\nTo handle the scale variation, a straightforward method is to utilize multi-scale image inputs  , which usually lacks efficiency. A line of more efficient methods is to tackle the scale variation on the intermediate features [ref]25 8. For example, Feature\nPyramid Networks (FPN) 8 is a representative work that implements the detection of objects with different scales in multiple levels of feature pyramids.\nOn the other hand, recent works also attempt to improve the detectors from the perspective of receptive fields (RFs) [ref]24 . They enhance the scale-awareness of the detectors by having multi-branch transformations with different combinations of kernel sizes and/or dilation rates. Then the features of different RFs are aggregated to enrich the information of different scales at each spatial location. An object detector often has a backbone network followed by the detection-specific sub-networks (i.e. heads), which play an important role in object detection. The sub-networks compute the deep features which are used to directly predict the object category, localization and size.\nUnlike two-stage detectors in which the sub-networks operate on the fixed-size feature maps computed from each object proposal, generated by a region proposal network with ROI-pooling , the sub-networks in one-stage detectors should be capable of ‘looking for’ objects of arbitrary sizes directly.\nIt becomes more challenging for an anchor-free detector. Because the multi-scale anchor boxes can be considered as a way to explicitly handle various sizes and shapes of objects,\nwhereas an anchor-free detector only predicts a single object at each spatial location, without any prior information about the object size.\nTherefore, for one-stage detectors, especially the anchor-free ones, the capability of the sub-networks for capturing the objects with large scale variation becomes the key.\nIn this work, we aim to enhance the power of the sub-networks in one-stage detectors, by searching for the optimal combination of the RFs and convolutions in a learning-based manner. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has gained increasing attention.\nIt transfers the task of neural networks design from a heuristics-guided process to an optimization problem.\nRecently, it has been shown that NAS can achieve prominent results on object detection      .\nIn most of the work, the operations in the search space are directly extended from those used for image classification   with limited variation on dilation rates. Therefore, their search spaces with respect to transformations are relatively limited, as listed in Table 1.\nApart from the combination of RFs, we also investigate the importance of the diversity of the transformations in NAS search space for object detection.\nHowever, searching through such a large number of candidate transformations can be computationally expensive,\nespecially for the RL-based   and EA-based  approaches.\nAdditionally, this problem can be more significant for object detection than image classification, due to the more complicated pipelines with larger input images. To this end, we propose a computation-friendly method, named Fast And Diverse (FAD), to search for the task-specific sub-networks in one-stage object detectors.\nFAD consists of a designed search space and an efficient search algorithm.\nWe first design a rich set of diverse transformations tailored for object detection, covering multiple RFs and various convolution types. To learn the optimal combinations more efficiently, a search method via representation sharing (RepShare) is proposed accordingly.\nBy sharing intermediate representations, the proposed RepShare significantly reduces the searching time and memory cost for the architecture search.\nFurthermore, we propose an efficient method to reduce the interference between the transformations sharing the same representations, and at the same time, alleviate the degradation of search quality caused by RepShare. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we redesign the sub-networks for modern one-stage object detectors and propose a searchable module for replacement.\nThe architecture search for the module is extremely efficient using our FAD,\nwhich is more than 25×25\\times faster than the fastest NAS approach for object detectors so far, while achieving a comparable AP improvement (see Table 1).\nWith ResNeXt-101  as the backbone, our FAD detector achieves 46.446.446.4 AP on the MS-COCO  test-dev set using a single model under single-scale testing, without using any additional regularization or modules (e.g. deformable conv ).\nMoreover, we show that FAD can also benefit more challenging tasks, such as instance segmentation.\nThe contributions of this work are summarized as: We present a novel method, named Fast And Diverse (FAD), to search meaningful transformations in the task-specific sub-networks for one-stage object detection.\nThe search space is designed specifically for object detection, and we empirically investigate the importance of the RFs coverage and convolution types for object detection. We propose an efficient search method with a novel representation sharing (RepShare) algorithm, which can significantly reduce the search cost in both time and memory usage, e.g. being more than 25×25\\times faster than all previous methods.\nTo ensure the search quality, a new method is introduced to decouple the transformation selection from the shared representations. To evaluate our methods, we design a searchable module for one-stage object detection and instance segmentation. Extensive experiments show that our FAD detector obtains consistent performance improvements on different detection frameworks with various backbones, and even has fewer parameters.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision  [ref]25 8   [ref]24   , but it remains challenging due to the large variation in object scales.\nTo handle the scale variation, a straightforward method is to utilize multi-scale image inputs  , which\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
