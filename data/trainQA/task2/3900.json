We let T​(C∗)⊆A​⊗​B𝑇superscript𝐶𝐴tensor-product𝐵T(C^{*})\\subseteq A{\\mathord{\\otimes}}B\ndenote its image, and similarly for permuted statements. A tensor T𝑇T is A𝐴A-concise if\nthe map TAsubscript𝑇𝐴T_{A} is injective, i.e., if it requires all basis vectors in A𝐴A to\nwrite down T𝑇T in any basis, and T𝑇T is concise if it is A𝐴A, B𝐵B, and C𝐶C concise. A tensor T∈ℂ𝕒​⊗​ℂm​⊗​ℂm𝑇superscriptℂ𝕒tensor-productsuperscriptℂ𝑚tensor-productsuperscriptℂ𝑚T\\in\\mathbb{C}^{\\mathbb{a}}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{m}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{m} is 1Asubscript1𝐴1_{A}-generic if T​(A∗)⊆B​⊗​C𝑇superscript𝐴𝐵tensor-product𝐶T(A^{*})\\subseteq B{\\mathord{\\otimes}}C contains an element of\nrank m𝑚m and when 𝕒=m𝕒𝑚{\\mathbb{a}}=m, T𝑇T is 111-generic if it is 1Asubscript1𝐴1_{A}, 1Bsubscript1𝐵1_{B}, and 1Csubscript1𝐶1_{C} generic.\nDefine a tensor T∈ℂm​⊗​ℂm​⊗​ℂm𝑇superscriptℂ𝑚tensor-productsuperscriptℂ𝑚tensor-productsuperscriptℂ𝑚T\\in\\mathbb{C}^{m}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{m}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{m} to be\n1∗subscript11_{*}-generic if it is at least one of 1Asubscript1𝐴1_{A}, 1Bsubscript1𝐵1_{B}, or 1Csubscript1𝐶1_{C}-generic, and binding\nif it is at least two of 1Asubscript1𝐴1_{A}, 1Bsubscript1𝐵1_{B}, or 1Csubscript1𝐶1_{C}-generic.\nWe say T𝑇T is 111-degenerate if it is not 1∗subscript11_{*}-generic.\nNote that if T𝑇T is 1Asubscript1𝐴1_{A} generic, it is both B𝐵B and C𝐶C concise. In particular,\nbinding tensors are concise. Two classical sets of equations on tensors that vanish on concise tensors of minimal border rank\nare Strassen’s equations and the End-closed equations. These are discussed in §2.1.\nThese equations are sufficient for m≤4𝑚4m\\leq 4, [27, Prop. 22],\n . In [13, Thm 1.3] the following polynomials for minimal border rank were introduced:\nLet T∈A​⊗​B​⊗​C=ℂm​⊗​ℂm​⊗​ℂm𝑇𝐴tensor-product𝐵tensor-product𝐶superscriptℂ𝑚tensor-productsuperscriptℂ𝑚tensor-productsuperscriptℂ𝑚T\\in A{\\mathord{\\otimes}}B{\\mathord{\\otimes}}C=\\mathbb{C}^{m}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{m}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{m}.\nConsider the map that sends (T1,T2,T3)subscript𝑇1subscript𝑇2subscript𝑇3(T_{1},T_{2},T_{3}) to (T1−T2,T2−T3)subscript𝑇1subscript𝑇2subscript𝑇2subscript𝑇3(T_{1}-T_{2},T_{2}-T_{3}),\nwhere the A𝐴A, B𝐵B, C𝐶C factors of tensors are understood to be in\nthe correct positions, for example\nT​(A∗)​⊗​A𝑇superscript𝐴tensor-product𝐴T(A^{*}){\\mathord{\\otimes}}A is more precisely written as A​⊗​T​(A∗)𝐴tensor-product𝑇superscript𝐴A{\\mathord{\\otimes}}T(A^{*}).\nIf T𝑇T has border rank at most m𝑚m, then the rank of the above map is\nat most 3​m2−m3superscript𝑚2𝑚3m^{2}-m. The resulting equations are called the 111-equations. Consider the space We call this space\nthe triple intersection or the 111-space.\nWe\nsay that T𝑇T is 111-abundant if the inequality holds. If equality holds, we say T𝑇T is 111-sharp.\nWhen T𝑇T is concise, 111-abundance is equivalent to requiring that\nthe equations of [13, Thm 1.3] are satisfied, i.e., the map (1.1) has rank at most 3​m2−m3superscript𝑚2𝑚3m^{2}-m. For T=a1​⊗​b1​⊗​c2+a1​⊗​b2​⊗​c1+a2​⊗​b1​⊗​c1∈ℂ2​⊗​ℂ2​⊗​ℂ2𝑇subscript𝑎1tensor-productsubscript𝑏1tensor-productsubscript𝑐2subscript𝑎1tensor-productsubscript𝑏2tensor-productsubscript𝑐1subscript𝑎2tensor-productsubscript𝑏1tensor-productsubscript𝑐1superscriptℂ2tensor-productsuperscriptℂ2tensor-productsuperscriptℂ2T=a_{1}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}b_{1}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}c_{2}+a_{1}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}b_{2}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}c_{1}+a_{2}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}b_{1}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}c_{1}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{2}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{2}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{2},\na tangent vector to the Segre variety, also called the W𝑊W-state in the quantum literature, the triple intersection\nis\n⟨T,a1​⊗​b1​⊗​c1⟩𝑇subscript𝑎1tensor-productsubscript𝑏1tensor-productsubscript𝑐1\\langle T,a_{1}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}b_{1}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}c_{1}\\rangle. We show that for concise tensors, the 111-equations imply both Strassen’s equations and the End-closed equations: Let T∈ℂm​⊗​ℂm​⊗​ℂm𝑇superscriptℂ𝑚tensor-productsuperscriptℂ𝑚tensor-productsuperscriptℂ𝑚T\\in\\mathbb{C}^{m}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{m}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{m} be concise.\nIf T𝑇T satisfies the 111-equations then it also satisfies Strassen’s equations and the End-closed\nequations. If T𝑇T is 1Asubscript1𝐴1_{A} generic, then it satisfies the 111-equations\nif and only if it satisfies the A𝐴A-Strassen equations and the A𝐴A-End-closed\nequations. The first assertion is proved in §3.3. The second assertion is Proposition 3.2. In , and more explicitly in [ref]40, equations generalizing Strassen’s\nequations for minimal border rank, called p=1𝑝1p=1 Koszul flattenings were introduced. (At the time it was not\nclear they were a generalization, see  for a discussion.).\nThe p=1𝑝1p=1 Koszul flattenings of type 210 are equations that are\nthe size m​(m−1)+1𝑚𝑚11m(m-1)+1 minors of the map TA∧1:A​⊗​B∗→Λ2​A​⊗​C:superscriptsubscript𝑇𝐴1→𝐴tensor-productsuperscript𝐵superscriptΛ2𝐴tensor-product𝐶T_{A}^{\\wedge 1}:A{\\mathord{\\otimes}}B^{*}\\rightarrow\\Lambda^{2}A{\\mathord{\\otimes}}C given\nby a​⊗​β↦∑Ti​j​k​β​(bj)​a∧ai​⊗​ckmaps-to𝑎tensor-product𝛽superscript𝑇𝑖𝑗𝑘𝛽subscript𝑏𝑗𝑎subscript𝑎𝑖tensor-productsubscript𝑐𝑘a{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\beta\\mapsto\\sum T^{ijk}\\beta(b_{j})a\\wedge a_{i}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}c_{k}.\nType 201, 120, etc. are defined by permuting A𝐴A, B𝐵B and C𝐶C. Together\nthey are called p=1𝑝1p=1 Koszul flattenings.\nThese equations reappear in border apolarity as the 210210210-equations, see . The p=1𝑝1p=1 Koszul flattenings for minimal border rank and the 111111111-equations\nare independent, in the sense that neither implies the other, even for\nconcise tensors in ℂm​⊗​ℂm​⊗​ℂmsuperscriptℂ𝑚tensor-productsuperscriptℂ𝑚tensor-productsuperscriptℂ𝑚\\mathbb{C}^{m}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{m}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{m}. Proposition 1.3 follows from Example 3.5 where\nthe 111-equations are nonzero and the p=1𝑝1p=1 Koszul flattenings are zero and\nExample 5.9 where the reverse situation holds. We extend the characterization of minimal border rank\ntensors under the hypothesis of 1∗subscript11_{*}-genericity to dimension m=6𝑚6m=6, giving two different characterizations: Let m≤6𝑚6m\\leq 6 and consider the set of\ntensors in ℂm​⊗​ℂm​⊗​ℂmsuperscriptℂ𝑚tensor-productsuperscriptℂ𝑚tensor-productsuperscriptℂ𝑚\\mathbb{C}^{m}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{m}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{m} which are 1∗subscript11_{*}-generic and\nconcise. The following subsets coincide the zero set of Strassen’s equations and the End-closed\nequations, 111-abundant tensors, 111-sharp tensors, minimal border rank tensors. More precisely, in (1), if the tensor is 1Asubscript1𝐴1_{A}-generic, only the A𝐴A-Strassen and A𝐴A-End-closed conditions\nare required. The equivalence of\n(1), (2), (3) in Theorem 1.4 is proved by Proposition 3.2.\nThe equivalence of (1) and (4) is proved in §8. For 1Asubscript1𝐴1_{A}-generic tensors, the p=1𝑝1p=1 Koszul flattenings of type 210\nor 201 are\nequivalent to the A𝐴A-Strassen equations, hence they are implied by the\n111-equations in this case. However, the other types are not implied, see\nExample 5.9. The result fails for m≥7𝑚7m\\geq 7 by [37, Prop. 5.3], see\nExample 5.9. This is due to\nthe existence of additional components in the Quot scheme, which we briefly\ndiscuss here. The proof of Theorem 1.4 introduces new algebraic tools by\nreducing the study of 1Asubscript1𝐴1_{A}-generic\ntensors satisfying the A𝐴A-Strassen equations to deformation theory in the Quot\nscheme (a generalization of the Hilbert scheme,\nsee ) in two steps. First one reduces to the study of commuting matrices,\nwhich implicitly appeared\nalready in , and was later spelled out in\nin , see §2. Then one uses the ADHM construction as in .\nFrom this perspective, the tensors satisfying\n(1)-(3)\ncorrespond to points of the Quot scheme, while tensors\nsatisfying (4) correspond to points in the principal component\nof the Quot scheme, see §8.1 for explanations; the heart of the theorem is that\nwhen m≤6𝑚6m\\leq 6 there is only the principal component.\nWe expect deformation theory to play an important\nrole in future work on tensors. As discussed in , at this time deformation theory is the only proposed\npath to\novercoming the lower bound barriers of  .\nAs another byproduct of this structure, we obtain the following proposition: A 111-generic tensor in ℂm​⊗​ℂm​⊗​ℂmsuperscriptℂ𝑚tensor-productsuperscriptℂ𝑚tensor-productsuperscriptℂ𝑚\\mathbb{C}^{m}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{m}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{m} with m≤13𝑚13m\\leq 13 satisfying the A𝐴A-Strassen equations\nhas minimal border rank. A 1Asubscript1𝐴1_{A} and 1Bsubscript1𝐵1_{B}-generic tensor in ℂm​⊗​ℂm​⊗​ℂmsuperscriptℂ𝑚tensor-productsuperscriptℂ𝑚tensor-productsuperscriptℂ𝑚\\mathbb{C}^{m}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{m}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{m} with m≤7𝑚7m\\leq 7 satisfying the A𝐴A-Strassen equations has minimal\nborder rank. Proposition 1.5\nis sharp: the first assertion does not hold for higher\nm𝑚m by [31, Lem. 6.21] and the second by . Previously it was known (although not explicitly stated in the literature)\nthat the A𝐴A-Strassen\nequations combined with the A𝐴A-End-closed conditions imply minimal border\nrank for 111-generic tensors when m≤13𝑚13m\\leq 13 and binding tensors when\nm≤7𝑚7m\\leq 7. This can be extracted\nfrom the discussion in [35, §5.6]. While Strassen’s equations and the End-closed equations are nearly useless\nfor 111-degenerate tensors, this does not occur for the 111-equations,\nas the following result illustrates: When m≤5𝑚5m\\leq 5, the set of concise\nminimal border rank tensors in\nℂm​⊗​ℂm​⊗​ℂmsuperscriptℂ𝑚tensor-productsuperscriptℂ𝑚tensor-productsuperscriptℂ𝑚\\mathbb{C}^{m}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{m}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{m}\nis the zero set of the\n111111111-equations. We emphasize that no other equations, such as Strassen’s equations, are necessary.\nMoreover Strassen’s equations, or even their\ngeneralization to the p=1𝑝1p=1 Koszul flattenings, and the End-closed equations are not enough\nto characterize concise\nminimal border rank tensors in ℂ5​⊗​ℂ5​⊗​ℂ5superscriptℂ5tensor-productsuperscriptℂ5tensor-productsuperscriptℂ5\\mathbb{C}^{5}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{5}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{5}, see\nExample 3.5 and §1.4.3. By Theorem 1.4, to prove Theorem 1.6 it remains to prove the 111-degenerate\ncase, which is done in §7.\nThe key difficulty here is the above-mentioned lack of structure. We overcome\nthis problem by providing a new normal form, which follows from the\n111-equations, that strengthens Friedland’s normal form for corank one\n1Asubscript1𝐴1_{A}-degenerate tensors satisfying Strassen’s equations [24, Thm.\n3.1], see Proposition 3.3. It is possible that Theorem 1.6 also holds for m=6𝑚6m=6; this\nwill be subject to future work. It is false for m=7𝑚7m=7, as already\nTheorem 1.4 fails when m=7𝑚7m=7.

Among these tensors, T𝒪58subscript𝑇subscript𝒪58T_{{\\mathcal{O}}_{58}} is (after a change of basis) the unique symmetric\ntensor on the list (see Example 4.6 for its symmetric\nversion).\nThe subgroup of\nGL⁡(A)×GL⁡(B)×GL⁡(C)GL𝐴GL𝐵GL𝐶\\operatorname{GL}(A)\\times\\operatorname{GL}(B)\\times\\operatorname{GL}(C) preserving T𝒪58subscript𝑇subscript𝒪58T_{{\\mathcal{O}}_{58}} contains a copy of GL2⁡ℂsubscriptGL2ℂ\\operatorname{GL}_{2}\\mathbb{C} while\nall other stabilizers are solvable. The smoothable rank of a tensor T∈A​⊗​B​⊗​C𝑇𝐴tensor-product𝐵tensor-product𝐶T\\in A{\\mathord{\\otimes}}B{\\mathord{\\otimes}}C is the minimal degree of a\nsmoothable zero dimensional scheme Spec⁡(R)⊆ℙ​A×ℙ​B×ℙ​CSpec𝑅ℙ𝐴ℙ𝐵ℙ𝐶\\operatorname{Spec}(R)\\ \\subseteq\\mathbb{P}A\\times\\mathbb{P}B\\times\\mathbb{P}C which satisfies the condition T∈⟨Spec⁡(R)⟩𝑇delimited-⟨⟩Spec𝑅T\\in\\langle\\operatorname{Spec}(R)\\rangle.\nSee, e.g.,   for basic definitions regarding zero dimensional schemes. The smoothable rank of a polynomial with respect to the Veronese variety was introduced in \nand generalized to points with respect to arbitrary projective varieties in . It arises because the span of the (scheme theoretic) limit of points\nmay be smaller than the limit of the spans. The smoothable rank lies between rank\nand border rank. Tensors (or polynomials) whose smoothable rank is larger than\ntheir border rank are called wild in .\nThe first example of a wild tensor occurs in ℂ3​⊗​ℂ3​⊗​ℂ3superscriptℂ3tensor-productsuperscriptℂ3tensor-productsuperscriptℂ3\\mathbb{C}^{3}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{3}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{3}, see [11, §2.3] and it has minimal border rank.\nWe characterize\nwild minimal border rank tensors: The concise minimal border rank tensors that are wild are precisely the\nconcise minimal border rank 111-degenerate tensors.
