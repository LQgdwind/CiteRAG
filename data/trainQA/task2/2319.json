      "content": "Paper Title: An Evaluation of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models for Drought Prediction using Weather Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are extremely successful for two-dimensional data, but they can also be used for sequential data. In 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN), the convolutional kernel moves in one direction, instead of two directions. While recurrent neural networks are designed for sequential data, they are not as efficient as convolutional neural networks, which can be trained in parallel. Besides, many design ideas for two-dimensional CNN are transferred to 1D CNN, e.g., Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)  without using fully connected layers, Residual Neural Network (ResNet)  and Residual Convolutional Neural Network (ResCNN)  with the shortcut connection, InceptionTime  inspired by the Inception structure, and XceptionTime  inspired by the Xception structure. As improvements over the normal 1D CNN, causal convolution and dilated convolution are proposed and used in Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) [ref]34. Causal convolution is proposed for dealing with sequences. Given the input sequence 𝐗=(x1,x2,⋯,xt)𝐗subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2⋯subscript𝑥𝑡\\mathbf{X}=(x_{1},x_{2},\\cdots,x_{t}) and the convolution filter (or kernel) 𝐅=(f1,f2,⋯,fK)𝐅subscript𝑓1subscript𝑓2⋯subscript𝑓𝐾\\mathbf{F}=(f_{1},f_{2},\\cdots,f_{K}) with size K𝐾K in a hidden layer, the target is to predict the output sequence 𝐘=(y1,y2,⋯,yt)𝐘subscript𝑦1subscript𝑦2⋯subscript𝑦𝑡\\mathbf{Y}=(y_{1},y_{2},\\cdots,y_{t}). Then the causal convolution for xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x_{t} is where only xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} with i≤t𝑖𝑡i\\leq t is used to avoid future information usage. With more hidden layers, each output element depends on a longer history of the input sequence. Take a step further, one can add the dilatation rate d𝑑d in the convolution operation as follows: where a larger d𝑑d would increase the receptive field. In practice, d𝑑d is exponentially increased in different hidden layers, as shown in a specific example of dilated causal convolution in Figure 4, where d=1,2,4𝑑124d=1,2,4. Furthermore, two recent 1D CNN variants are also Incorporated in this study, namely, Omni-Scale 1D-CNN (OS-CNN)  and XCM [ref]38. OS-CNN can capture the proper kernel size during the model learning period, while XCM, an eXplainable Convolutional neural network for Multivariate time series classification, enables a good generalization ability and explainability.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: XceptionTime  inspired by the Xception structure.
