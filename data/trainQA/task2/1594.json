      "content": "Paper Title: Bounded Memory Active Learning through Enriched Queries\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nToday’s learning landscape is dominated mostly by data-hungry algorithms, each requiring a massive supply of labeled training samples in order to reach state of the art accuracy. Such algorithms are excellent when labeled data is cheap and plentiful, but in many important scenarios acquiring labels requires the use of human experts, making popular supervised methods like deep learning infeasible both in time and cost. In recent years, a framework meant to address this issue called active learning has gained traction in both theory and practice. Active learning posits that not all labeled samples are equal: some may be particularly informative, others useless. While a standard supervised (passive) learning algorithm receives a stream or pool of labeled training data, an active learner instead receives unlabeled data along with the ability to query an expert labeling oracle. By choosing only to query the most informative examples, the hope is that an active learner can achieve state of the art accuracy using only a small fraction of the labels required by passive techniques. While active learning saw initial success with simple classifiers such as thresholds in one-dimension, it quickly became clear that inherent structural barriers barred it from improving substantially over the passive case even for very basic examples such as halfspaces in two-dimensions or axis-aligned rectangles . A number of modifications to the model have been proposed to remedy this issue. One such strategy that has gained increasing traction in the past few years is empowering the learner to ask questions beyond simple label queries. One might ask the oracle, for instace, to compare two pieces of data rather than simply label them—the idea being that such additional information might break down the structural barriers inherent in standard lower bounds. Indeed, in 2017, Kane, Lovett, Moran, and Zhang (KLMZ)  showed not only how this was true for halfspaces,111We note their work requires structural assumptions on the data to work beyond two dimensions. but introduced a combinatorial complexity parameter called inference dimension to characterize exactly when a family of classifiers is efficiently actively learnable with respect to some set of enriched queries. The model proposed by KLMZ , however, is not without its downsides. One issue is that the model is pool-based, meaning the algorithm receives a large pool of unlabeled samples ahead of time, and can query or otherwise access any part of the sample at any time. This type of model can be infeasible in practice due to its unrealistic memory requirements—the learner is assumed to always have the full training data in storage. In this work, we aim to resolve this issue by studying when a family of classifiers can be efficiently active learned in bounded memory, meaning the amount of memory used by the algorithm should remain constant regardless of the desired accuracy. Such algorithms open up potential applications of active learning to scenarios where storage is severely limited, e.g. to smartphones and other mobile devices. To this end, we introduce a new streaming variant of active learning with enriched queries in which the learner has access to a stream of unlabeled data and chooses one-by-one whether to store or forget points from the stream. Instead of having query access to the full training set at any time, our algorithm is then restricted to querying only points it has stored in memory. Along with this model, we introduce a natural strengthening of Littlestone and Warmuth’s [ref]38 sample compression, a standard learning technique for Valiant’s Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)   model, called lossless sample compression, and show that any class with such a scheme may be learned query-optimally and with constant memory. In doing so, we make the first non-trivial advance towards answering an open question posed by KLMZ  regarding the existence of a combinatorial characterization for bounded-memory active learning. Further, we show that lossless compression schemes imply learnability not only in the standard PAC-model, but also in a much stronger sense known as Reliable and Probably Useful Learning [ref]48. This model, which carries strong connections to the active learning paradigm  , demands that the learner be perfect (makes no errors) with the caveat that it may abstain from classifying a small fraction of examples. Finally, we conclude by showing that a number of classifier families fundamental to machine learning exhibit small lossless compression schemes with respect to natural enriched queries. We focus in particular on three such classes: axis-aligned rectangles, decision trees, and halfspaces in two dimensions. In each of these three cases our lossless compression scheme is efficiently computable, resulting in computationally efficient as well as query-optimal and bounded memory learners. All three classes provide powerful examples of how natural enriched queries can turn fundamental learning problems from prohibitively expensive to surprisingly feasible.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: training set at any time, our algorithm is then restricted to querying only points it has stored in memory.
