      "content": "Paper Title: Geometric Graph Representation with Learnable Graph Structure and Adaptive AU Constraint for Micro-Expression Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFacial expressions can reflect people’s emotions, and representitive categories include macro-expressions and micro-expressions. Different from macro-expressions, micro-expressions (MEs) can reflect genuine emotion when people try to hide their emotions. According to the studies    [ref]4 in psychology, MEs are human expressions with rapid, involuntary and low intensity facial movements. Considering that ME can imply the true human emotions and help reveal psychological activities  , recognizing ME gains increasing attention [ref]5  [ref]7   0 and has valuable potential applications, e.g. medical diagnosis [ref]4, emotion interfaces , security , and lie detection  . However, micro-expression recognition (MER), which aims at inferring the category of MEs from ME video clips, is very challenging due to the subtle facial muscle movements and fleeting duration. A lot of works 1 2 3 4 5 [ref]5 6 extracted discriminative features based on RGB images/videos through machine learning models, e.g., LBP-TOP with SVM 7 8 or deep neural networks 3. Though promising results are achieved, there is still a big space to improve in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Due to the suppressed property of MEs, only small parts of facial region will be activated in a ME instance. Thus, huge efforts are wasted to deal with redundant information of a whole image/video. Even worse, the ME-related features are prone to be submerged in irrelevant information, thereby making MER more difficult. To solve this problem, this work proposes to extracts discriminative geometric features only from facial landmarks. In fact, when facial muscle moves, facial landmarks will move accordingly. Thus, facial muscle movements in ME can be captured by geometric features in facial landmarks 9. At the same time, we argue that the extremely compact geometric information is good enough to get comparable even may superior performance, compared to the redundant feature information based on image sequences.\nFurthermore, time and computational costs regarding landmark-based methods are greatly less than that of image-based methods, which is more desirable for practical applications like in mobile devices. Currently, few works 0 1 [ref]7 considered facial landmark information to improve the performance of image-based appearance features, getting promising performance. However, these works did not focus on studying the contribution of geometric features from facial landmarks to MER. Thus, in this paper, we make the first step to study the discriminability of facial landmarks for MER and employ only landmarks as input, for exploring its advantages compared to image-based input. The graph-based methods2 have been verified to process the facial landmarks lying in the non-Euclidean space. Lately, some existing works 1 3 [ref]7 4 employed the graph-based models to recognize MEs. However, these works adopt a fixed graph structure designed manually according to certain principles (e.g. the conditional probability of different nodes 3 5). Namely, the fixed adjacency matrix is defined to represent the fixed relationship between nodes. The manual way to set a fixed graph structure cannot comprehensively and effectively model the correlation between landmark-based nodes, which is sub-optimal. For overcoming this problem, this paper introduces a learnable adjacency matrix to learn a more reasonable and flexible graph structure based on a pre-defined graph structure. Action Unit (AU) 6 encodes the local movement of facial muscles and have a strong correlation with MEs. Recently, some works 6 4 took AU features as input to recognize MEs and used deep learning models to build the relationship between AU features and ME categories. However, these methods need an auxiliary model to extract AU features before inputting AU features into the main model, which increases the model complexity and computational cost. To overcome this defect, our work uses the AU labels as a constraint to learn the geometric features related to AUs from facial landmarks.\nFurthermore, considering the AU losses in different layers may have different contribution, this paper proposes an adaptive AU loss to automatically learn the constraint intensity of AU loss in different layers. In this way, the multi-scale geometric features are constrained adaptively to have a synchronized pattern with AUs, thereby rationalizing the introduction of facial action units (AUs) information. Corresponding to the above problems, the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: This work studies and explores the contribution of facial landmarks for MER. The graph-based models are employed to extract discriminative geometric movement features with spatial-temporal information only from facial landmarks. The results demonstrate that facial landmarks are discriminative for MER with a largely reduced computational cost. To comprehensively explore geometric movement features from facial landmark, a Geometric Two-Streams Graph Network (GTS-GN) is proposed to aggregate the low-order and higher-order geometric information from facial landmarks. To overcome the shortcoming of the fixed adjacency matrix, this paper proposes a Learnable Adjacency Matrix (LAM) to learn a reasonable and flexible graph structure. As a result, LAM can automatically model the discriminative relationship between facial landmarks for MER. Based on the strong correlations between AUs and MEs, an Adaptive AU (AAU) loss is proposed to automatically explore a more reasonable and efficient way to introduce AU information. AAU loss can adaptively constrain the geometric features in a multi-scale fashion and emphasize the contributions of AU information at different semantic levels. The experimental results demonstrate that jointing the regular ME loss and AAU loss can build the relationship between facial landmarks, AUs and MEs, improving the performance of MER.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: macro-expressions and micro-expressions.
