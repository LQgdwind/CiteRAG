      "content": "Paper Title: MTCAE-DFER: Multi-Task Cascaded Autoencoder for Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDFER is the key part of dynamic emotion recognition, which focuses on the analysis and computation of facial emotions in visual data. At present, most DFER models use spatiotemporal attention as their core and built on the ViT  architecture, to capture contextual global features related to dynamic facial expressions and improve recognition accuracy. Examples include models like LOGO-Former [ref]15 and MAE-DFER . The LOGO-Former [ref]15 architecture introduces the global-local feature interaction mechanism, which interacts global and local features from the spatio-temporal level, enhancing the separability of different data attributes in feature space. Additionally, the MAE-DFER  architecture is one of SOTA models in DFER. It employs the VideoMAE  self-supervised learning method to address data scarcity in deep learning, thereby producing the pre-trained model with strong feature extraction capabilities. In this work, we will adopt global-local feature interaction concept and inherit this VideoMAE  encoder pre-trained model. This approach will extract global feature of dynamic facial expressions, while strengthening the separability of local key feature from different related tasks level.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: their core and built on the ViT  architecture, to capture contextual global features related to dynamic facial expressions and improve recognition accuracy.
