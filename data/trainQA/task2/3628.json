Unlike traditional evolutionary systems, in coevolutionary settings individuals are compared based on the outcome of their interaction with other members of the population(s) rather than only comparing each individual w.r.t. a fixed fitness function. As a result, coevolutionary search is a stochastic or non-stationary process . Coevolution is also at the heart of an approach for discovering tree-based policies and constructing feature extractors that with minimal model complexity compete with deep-learning based solutions to play the 49 games in the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) [ref]28. Beyond simply highly skilled solutions, Kelly and Heywood discovered reusable subtrees across multiple games inside the coevolved policies [ref]28. Blondie 24, a single-population coevolutionary setup, taught itself to play checkers competitively by evolving the weights of a fixed-architecture ANN and evaluating performance based on how well each agent plays against a set of opponents drawn from the current population . In two-player competitive games, self-play and coevolution intersect when policies compete against each other to supply data that informs the future trajectory of search . In a GAN the game-theoretic approach of having a generator and discriminator that compete against each other in a zero-sum game shows one scenario where the gradient information is determined by interactions between a competitive population of two . The challenge for solving problems with self-play or coevolution lies in finding the Nash equilibrium such that the distributions of each population are equally aligned. However, the subjective nature of the competition between members of the population(s) can lead to instability as search in coevolutionary systems is dependent on interactions between individuals in the population .\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: Called generative adversarial training by Goodfellow et al.  and self-play in modern approaches in reinforcement learning [ref]19[ref]24, cooperative and competitive co-evolution are at the heart of many high-profile algorithmic achievements .
