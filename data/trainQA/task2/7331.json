The key idea of TokenGT [ref]24 is to assign two Laplacian eigenvectors to the initial node features, which enables graph transformers to identify and exploit subgraphs surrounding nodes.\nFormally, for a node visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} and an edge ei​jsubscript𝑒𝑖𝑗e_{ij} connecting two nodes visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} and vjsubscript𝑣𝑗v_{j}, TokenGT augment initial node and edge features, as: where λisubscript𝜆𝑖\\lambda_{i} and λjsubscript𝜆𝑗\\lambda_{j} refer to Laplacian eigenvectors of visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} and vjsubscript𝑣𝑗v_{j}, respectively.\nTheoretically, adding multiple Laplacian Eigenvectors into node features could grant the power of TokenGT as expressive as the power of 2-d WL isomorphism testing. Accordingly, several graph transformers, e.g., UGT  and EGT , use Laplacian eigenvectors as additional features for representing the positional information of nodes in graphs.\nGPS [ref]15 provides a set of structural features and adds them to initial node features.\nBesides the Laplacian eigenvectors, GPS introduces several straightforward and simple methods that enable the model to identify the node position in graphs, such as the gradient of eigenvectors or SignNet . Although Laplacian eigenvectors could represent the global position of nodes well, they are limited by symmetries, forcing graph transformers to learn the sign invariance .\nThis is because there can be 2dsuperscript2𝑑2^{d} possible sign flips of the Laplacian eigenvectors in the graph, where d𝑑d is the dimension of eigenvectors [ref]15.\nThus, several graph transformers, e.g., SAN  and LSPR , make the positional encodings learnable, which can be more adapt to learn the structural information.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: GT  [ref]5 is one of the early studies that used Laplacian eigenvectors as node positional encoding.\nThese eigenvectors form nodes into coordinate space while preserving their global locations in the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
