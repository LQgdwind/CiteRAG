Early video generation was primarily based on text-to-video approaches            . Most of the work is based on diffusion models 7 [ref]14 6  , with some being transformer-based  . They all rely on extensive video-text or image-text datasets to train scalable models. However, considering that using only text can make it challenging to intuitively depict the video scenes users want to generate, image-to-video has started to gain popularity in the video generation community. Seer  introduced an approach for I2V tasks that combines the conditional image latent with a noisy latent, utilizing causal attention within the temporal component of a 3D U-Net 3.\nVideoComposer  concatenated image embedding with image style embedding to preserve the initial image information.\nRecently, VideoCrafter  encoded the image prompt through a lightweight image encoder and fed it into the cross-attention layer.\nSimilarly, I2VGen-XL 8 not only merges the image latent with the noisy latent at the input layer but also employs a global encoder that extracts the image CLIP feature into the video latent diffusion model (VLDM).\nStable video diffusion  is an extension of a pretrained image-based diffusion model 2. It is trained through three stages: text-to-image pretraining, video pretraining, and high-quality video fine-tuning.\nEmu Video  identified critical design decisions, such as adjusted noise schedules for diffusion and multi-stage training, which enabled the generation of high-quality videos without requiring a deep cascade of models as in prior work.\nBeyond academic research, the video generation results from industry players like Pika 8 and Gen2  are also quite impressive. All of these I2V algorithms are based on video diffusion models, and the majority leverage the parameter priors from image diffusion models to aid in the convergence of video models. To evaluate state-of-the-art I2V models, we have reviewed three open-source works in this paper: VideoCrafter , I2VGen-XL 8, and Stable Video Diffusion , as well as two closed-source industry efforts, Pika 8 and Gen2 . These currently represent the five most influential works in the video generation community, and we will briefly introduce their experimental parameters in Section 5.1.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: Thanks to the development of diffusion models  7 [ref]14 6  and multimodal techniques , video generation algorithms are becoming increasingly sophisticated.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
