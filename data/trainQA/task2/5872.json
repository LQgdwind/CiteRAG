      "content": "Paper Title: Language-Guided Audio-Visual Source Separation via Trimodal Consistency\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur everyday audiovisual world is composed of many visible sound sources, often with multiple sources layering on top of one another. For example, consider the video of the guitar and cello musicians playing together in Fig. 1. The two instruments have distinct timbres, and the musicians play non-unison, but complementary melodies. Despite hearing both instruments simultaneously, humans have an innate ability to\nidentify and isolate the melody of a single source object.\nIn this paper, we define the corresponding machine task as follows: given a natural language query that selects a sounding object, such as “person playing a guitar”, separate its sound source from the input audio waveform and localize it in the input video, without any supervision.\n This task is challenging. First, there is no approach for associating the linguistic description of a sound-emitting object to its visual features and the corresponding components of the audio waveform without access to annotations during training. Existing audio-visual methods    do not generalize to natural language queries due to their dependence on discrete object class labels. Second, an ideal solution would jointly identify and localize sound-emitting objects in videos as well as separate the corresponding components in the audio waveform without strong supervision. Although prior audio-visual work has demonstrated the benefits of aligning relevant object regions in the video with their corresponding sounds  , these approaches require strong supervision including object label and bounding box annotations (see Fig. 1 top). Overcoming these challenges would enable important downstream applications including holistic video understanding , embodied AI , and bidirectional audio-to-video retrieval . To address these challenges, we make the following contributions. First, we propose Video-Audio Separation through Text (VAST), a self-supervised approach that leverages large vision-language “foundation” models  [ref]21 to provide pseudo-supervision for learning the alignment between the three modalities: audio, video and natural language.\nOur key insight is to learn a strong transitive relation from audio to natural language using vision as an intermediary modality, while preserving the alignment between the visual and natural language modalities embodied by the foundation models. However, just using the visual representations of these foundation models in existing AV separation approaches does not preserve the transitive relationships between the three modalities (Sec. 4.1). Our second contribution introduces two novel multimodal alignment objectives that encourage the learnt audio representations to encode the semantics of captions and infer the latent transitive relation between the three modalities. While natural language can express a large and varied range of visual concepts for audio separation in videos, the absence of captions in unlabeled videos during training poses a significant challenge in our self-supervised formulation. To learn the transitive alignment, we adapt a foundation model to extract latent captions from unlabeled videos.\nIntuitively, the latent captions are representations that express the visual concepts present in the videos. Third, we introduce a Multiple Instance Learning formulation to learn to perform audio separation at the video region level since we do not have prior information on relevant objects or their locations in the videos during training. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed VAST approach through extensive evaluations on the audio source separation task on the SOLOS [ref]25, MUSIC , and AudioSet [ref]16 datasets. We show that our self-supervised approach outperforms strongly-supervised state-of-the-art approaches without using labels during training by leveraging the capability of vision-language foundation models. More importantly, we demonstrate that VAST learns to use language queries for audio separation despite not training with ground-truth language supervision.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: challenges, we make the following contributions.
