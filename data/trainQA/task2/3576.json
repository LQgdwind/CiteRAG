Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: KPE: Keypoint Pose Encoding for Transformer-based Image Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo evaluate the realism of the images, we use the perceptually trained Inception Score (IS) [ref]41 and FID [ref]42, in line with literature image generative models [ref]24. However, as suggested by , IS sub-optimal, and we found that it is not good at measuring people-centric errors such as missing or extra limbs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new evaluation metric People Count Error (PCE) to measure the unrealism of the people. Given an image of people x𝑥x, g​t​()𝑔𝑡gt() indicates the ground truth function that returns the labelled number of people in the image, and h​()ℎh() is the function that returns the number of people detected by the pose estimation algorithm e.g. OpenPose . Therefore, PCE is defined as: PCE makes use of the rich body anatomy knowledge embodied in OpenPose. If a person in a erroneous generated image has three arms, OpenPose know human only has two arms, and therefore it will assume the third arm belong to another person, hence adding the person count. This discrepancy in people count is flagged by PCE as 1 (contain error). Visual examples of PCE are shown in the results in Fig 4 and further discussed in Section 5.2. Moreover, unlike IS/FID which requires a large amount of data, PCE applies to a single image, making it usable to find an error in an individual image.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: To evaluate the realism of the images, we use the perceptually trained Inception Score (IS) [ref]41 and FID [ref]42, in line with literature image generative models [ref]24.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
