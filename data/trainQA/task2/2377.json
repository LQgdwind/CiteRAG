Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Their method recovers IF if l‚Äã(x,y;Œ∏)ùëôùë•ùë¶ùúÉl(x,y;\\theta) is negative log-likelihood.\nSpecific to neural networks, Yeh et¬†al.  decompose the (pre-activation) prediction for a test point into a linear combination of activations for training points, using a modified representer theorem.\nThe resulting training point weights correspond to a point‚Äôs importance with respect to flosssubscriptùëìlossf_{\\text{loss}}.\nBhatt et¬†al.  assign training point importance based on how much loss is incurred when finding a set of alternative parameters Œ∏‚Ä≤superscriptùúÉ‚Ä≤\\theta^{\\prime} that classify a specific point xùë•x differently from Œ∏^^ùúÉ\\hat{\\theta} but that perform similarly on the training data. Their setup is a special case of IF¬†[ref]31.\nThe methods discussed thus far are model-specific and depend on a specified fùëìf.\nAnother line of work has searched for prototypes, which are representative points that summarize a dataset independent of model parameters¬† .\nKim et¬†al. [ref]30 use maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to find prototypes but do not assign importance scores to the selected points.\nA large MMD implies that the samples are likely from different distributions¬†[ref]19. Since prototypes are model-agnostic, we omit them from our evaluation, as we are interested in finding diverse training points important to a model.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: parameters Œ∏‚Ä≤superscriptùúÉ‚Ä≤\\theta^{\\prime} that classify a specific point xùë•x differently from Œ∏^^ùúÉ\\hat{\\theta} but that perform similarly on the training data.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
