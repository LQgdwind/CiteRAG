      "content": "Paper Title: State estimation of timed automata under partial observation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the area of discrete event systems (DES), a large body of literature considers logical DES, where time is abstracted and only the order of occurrences of the events is taken into account. The problem of state estimation has received a lot of attention considering different observation structures in different formalisms, in particular automata  and Petri nets .\nThe notion of observer  contains all the information to reconstruct the set of current states consistent with an observation and allows to move most of the burdensome parts of the computations offline and can be used for online state estimation.\nIn addition, an observer is fundamental to address problems of feedback control , diagnosis and diagnosability , , in addition to characterizing a large set of dynamical properties, such as detectability , opacity [ref]8 and resilience to cyber-attack . Significant contributions have also been provided in the framework of timed DES.\nAs an example, in 0, observers are designed for a particular class of weighted automata, where the time information of transition firability is given to weights.\nReferences 1, 2, 3, and 4 address the problem of state estimation of a class of timed automata under a rather restrictive scenario where the endowed single clock is reset to zero after each event occurrence.\nThe state estimation of timed DES has also been considered in 5 and 6, but no general approach concerning the construction of an observer for a general class of timed DES exists. Another active area of research is that of hybrid systems (HS) 7 8,\ncharacterized by the interplay between discrete event and time-driven dynamics.\nThese systems can be modeled by hybrid automata, and in particular by timed automata 9 concerning time elapsing as time-driven dynamics.\nState estimation of timed automata has also been studied.\nIn 9, the reachability of locations can be analysed by searching the finite quotient of a timed automaton with respect to the region equivalence defined over the set of all clock interpretations.\nHowever, the reachability is analyzed regardless of any observations.\nTripakis proposes an online diagnoser in 0 that keeps track of all the possible discrete states.\nThereby, state estimation problem is theoretically solvable.\nIn 1 and 2, timed markings are used for representing the closure under silent transitions.\nObserve that in 0 1 2, only online estimators have been proposed, and no general approach concerning the construction of an observer is known.\nIn particular the model we consider in this paper, that we call timed finite automaton can be either seen as a finite state automaton endowed with a clock or as a timed automaton 9 whose edges are labeled. A related problem in a decentralized setting is studied in 3, where the asynchronous polling of distributed sub-systems is called synchronization.\nConcerning timed automata, references 4, 5, and 6 discuss how to define concurrent composition for timed automata, which can be used to construct complex models. This paper considers a partially observable timed finite automaton (TFA) endowed with a single clock.\nThe logical structure specifies the sequences of events that the TFA can generate and the observations they produce.\nThe timed structure specifies the set of clock values that allow an event to occur and how the clock is reset upon the event occurrence.\nA timed state of a TFA consists of a discrete state associated with the logical structure and the clock value.\nOur objective is that of estimating the current discrete state of the automaton as a function of the current observation and of the current time.\nThe notion of TùëáT-reachability is proposed taking into account which discrete states can be reached with an evolution that produces a given observation and has a duration equal to TùëáT.\nWe prove that the problem of TùëáT-reachability for a TFA is reduced to the reachability analysis of the associated zone automaton.\nWe assume that the firing of observable transitions resets the clock to a set that is a finite union of zones, and present a formal approach that allows one to construct offline an observer, i.e., a finite structure that describes the state estimation for all possible evolutions.\nDuring the online phase to estimate the current discrete state, one just has to determine which is the state of the observer reached by the current observation and check to which interval (among a finite number of time intervals) the time elapsed between the last observed event occurrence belongs.\nWe believe that the proposed approach has a major advantage over existing online approaches for state estimation: it paves the way to address a vast range of fundamental properties (detectability, opacity, etc.) that have so far mostly been studied in the context of logical DES. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.\nSection II introduces the background of DES, timed automata and time semantics.\nSection III formally state the problem of state estimation.\nSection IV illustrates the approaches to compute zones and to construct the\nzone automaton.\nSection\nV provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the reachability of a state of the timed automaton in terms of reachability analysis in the zone automaton.\nSection VI solves the problem of updating the state estimation according to the latest received timed observation.\nFinally, Section VII concludes this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: observer is fundamental to address problems of feedback control , diagnosis and diagnosability , , in addition to characterizing a large set of dynamical properties, such as detectability , opacity [ref]8 and resilience to cyber-attack .
