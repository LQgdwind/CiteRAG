      "content": "Paper Title: Towards More Generalizable One-shot Visual Imitation Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe conduct experiments with the dataset described in Section V-A to answer the following questions: How does our method compare with prior baselines under the original single-task one-shot imitation learning setup. How well does our method perform across multiple tasks, after trained on the same set of tasks. How well does our trained multi-task model perform given a completely new task: can it 1) directly perform one-shot imitation at test time; 2) be fine-tuned to quickly adapt to the new task requiring fewer amount of data. Which component(s) in our contrastive module are key to its effectiveness at representation learning. The ablation experiment results are provided in Appendix due to space limitation. We report and compare performance to the following baseline methods: DAML [ref]45: We train a policy model with MAML [ref]10 loss and behaviour cloning loss. We replace the model architecture used in the original paper with a wider and deeper network of comparable parameter counts as ours, and use the same action distribution parametrization for policy learning. T-OSIL :\nModel architecture proposed by  which also uses non-local block [ref]42 in self-attention module and is trained with end-effector point prediction as auxiliary loss. Our method utilizes a more computationally efficient attention operation, see Figure 12 for an illustrated comparison. LSTM: We replace the self-attention module in our model architecture with linear projectors followed by an LSTM   architecture of a comparable parameter count. The rest of the policy model architecture is kept the same as in our main method. MLP: We replace the self-attention module in our model architecture with a simple MLP layer to process stacked visual features from the demonstration into “task context vectors”, which is then concatenated with observation features and used for action predictions. For all experiments (including baselines), we keep the first three convolutional residual blocks in ResNet-18 as the feature extractor, and apply the same data augmentation strategy to prevent over-fitting and improve model robustness. For evaluation, we take 3 different converged model checkpoints, and for each variation of each task, we gather each policy’s rollout performance across 10 episodes with different random seeds. For both the single and multi-task models, we report the mean and standard deviation of success rates in each task separately. Details on network architecture and hyper-parameters can be found in the Appendix. Single-task One-shot Imitation We first evaluate performance on the single-task setup as done in prior methods. Specifically, the model is trained with demonstrations from multiple variations of one task and then tested on unseen instances of the same task (e.g. different initial poses). We report the success rate of all methods on each task in the rows named “single” of Table I, with a clear out-performance of our method over baselines on every task. We remark that DAML [ref]45 also experimented with a pick-and-place task in their original paper, but collected “hundreds of” objects for training and 12 held-out objects for testing. Without access to further details, we hypothesize that this visual diversity in training dataset was crucial for its success at picking correct test-time objects, which explains why the same method reports massive under-performance on the 4-object Pick & Place task, where  also reported a very low success rate from DAML (6.9%percent6.96.9\\%) using a differently-configured simulation of the same task. Multi-task One-shot Imitation We next consider the multi-task setup by mixing data from all 7 tasks into one training dataset. After training, we report the success rate of one model on each task in the rows named “multi” of Table I.\nThe baselines’ performances drop significantly compared with their results from single-task, whereas ours continues to work well across many tasks 111For this setup, we increase the number of attention layers in the model from 2 to 3, and also adjust each baseline accordingly for fair comparisons. However, the performance of DAML  is still not comparable with others using the updated architecture and after tuning\nhyper-parameters.. Novel Task Generalization To show a higher level of generalization ability, we test a one-shot imitation agent with tasks that are sufficiently different from what it already trained on. We hence set up a series of experiments that, each picks 1 out of the 7 tasks in our benchmark suite as the held-out task, and trains a multi-task model on the remaining 6 tasks until convergence. We first directly evaluate each model on its corresponding held-out task. Results are reported in column “Novel-task” of Table II, where each row corresponds to the experiment where the current task was excluded from training and only used for one-shot evaluation. For comparison purposes, we also include: “No Training” column, which evaluates a randomly initialized policy network without any training , “Single-task” column, where each row reports performance of a model trained and tested on the same task, and “Multi-task” column, where we take one model trained on all 7 tasks and report its performance on each task separately. As shown in Table II, directly evaluating a multi-task model largely fails to complete an unseen novel task, and performs significantly worse than when this novel task was included during single- or multi-task training. This failure of direct one-shot imitation on a novel task suggests exciting room for future research.\nNevertheless, the gap between “Novel-task” and “No Training” results 222\nWe remark that, the non-zero success rates in “No Training” column are due to the nature of task design in simulation, where a randomly initialized policy model would sometimes generate an action that accidentally leads to an episode being counted “successful”, such as hitting an opened drawer to shut it close or stumbling on a closed door and pushing it open.\n suggests a multi-task model still learns certain non-random behaviors, which could be generalized directly to a completely novel task. Note that, the improvement over “No Training” is limited to the first three tasks (Door, Drawer and Press Button), which require simpler motions and task reasoning. We are hence encouraged to continue from this setup, but further fine-tune each 6-task model on its corresponding held-out task. We use the exact same dataset for training the models in “Single-task” column, and report the final fine-tuned results in “Fine-tune” column. To investigate the data efficiency of this setup, we additionally experiment with using 25%percent2525\\%, 50%percent5050\\%, 75%percent7575\\% the amount of the original single-task training data for fine-tuning, and compare with training from scratch on that single task using the same dataset size. We plot evaluation results of intermittently-saved checkpoints during each model’s training in Figure 3. We observe that a multi-task pre-trained model is able to adapt quickly to a completely new task, even when limited data is available (i.e., 25%percent2525\\%), and the final convergence performance is sometimes higher than training single-task from-scratch for some challenging tasks (e.g. Nut Assembly, Block stacking and Basketball). This indicates that these models are indeed able to accumulate generalizable knowledge (such as flexible visual feature extractors) from pre-training on many tasks, which then put them at advantage of learning a novel task very efficiently.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: effectiveness at representation learning.
