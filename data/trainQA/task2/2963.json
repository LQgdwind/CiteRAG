In RL with image inputs, model-based approaches [ref]15  which model the world with both a stochastic and a deterministic component, have achieved promising results for simulated robotic control. Kaiser et al.  propose to use an action-conditioned video prediction model, along with a policy learning algorithm. It achieves the first strong performance on Atari games with as little as 400k frames. However, Kielak  and van Hasselt et al.  argue that this is not necessary to achieve strong results with model-based methods, and they show that when tuned appropriately, Rainbow  can achieve comparable results. Recent advances in self-supervised learning, such as SimCLR [ref]8, MoCo , SimSiam  and BYOL [ref]13 have inspired representation learning in image-based RL.\nSrinivas et al.  propose to use contrastive learning in RL algorithms and their work achieves strong performance on image-based continuous and discrete control tasks. Later, Laskin et al.  and Kostrikov et al.  find that contrastive learning is not necessary, but with data augmentations alone, they can achieve better performance.\nSome researchers propose to use contrastive learning to enforce action equivariance on the learned representations .\nSchwarzer et al.  propose a temporal consistency loss, which is combined with data augmentations and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our self-supervised consistency loss is quite similar to SPR, except we use SimSiam [ref]8 while they use BYOL [ref]13 as the base self-supervised learning framework. However,\nthey only apply the learned representations in a model-free manner, while we combine the learned model with model-based exploration and policy improvement, thus leading to more efficient use of the environment model. Despite the recent progress in the sample-efficient RL, today’s RL algorithms are still well behind human performance when the amount of data is limited. Although traditional model-based RL is considered more sample efficient than model-free ones, current model-free methods dominate in terms of performance for image-input settings. In this paper, we propose a model-based RL algorithm that for the first time,\nachieves super-human performance on Atari games with limited data.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: Sample efficiency has attracted significant work in the past.
