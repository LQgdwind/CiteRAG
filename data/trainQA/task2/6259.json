      "content": "Paper Title: StyleDrop: Text-to-Image Generation in Any Style\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNow we present a unified framework for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of generative vision transformers. The proposed framework is not limited to a specific model and application, and is easily applied to the fine-tuning of text-to-image (e.g., Muse [ref]4, Paella , Parti , RQ-Transformer [ref]18) and text-to-video (e.g., Phenaki , CogVideo ) transformers, with a variety of PEFT methods, such as prompt tuning , LoRA , or adapter tuning , as in [ref]32.\nNonetheless, we focus on Muse [ref]4, an NAR text-to-image transformer, using adapter tuning . Following [ref]32, we are interested in adapting a transformer 𝙶𝙶\\mathtt{G}, while the rest (𝙴𝙴\\mathtt{E}, 𝙳𝙳\\mathtt{D}, 𝚃𝚃\\mathtt{T}) remain fixed. Let 𝙶^:𝒱×ℰ×Θ→ℒ:^𝙶→𝒱ℰΘℒ\\widehat{\\mathtt{G}}\\,{:}\\,\\mathcal{V}\\,{\\times}\\,\\mathcal{E}\\,{\\times}\\,\\Theta\\,{\\rightarrow}\\,\\mathcal{L} a modified version of a transformer 𝙶𝙶\\mathtt{G} that takes learnable parameters 𝜽∈Θ𝜽Θ\\bm{\\theta}\\,{\\in}\\,\\Theta as an additional input. Here, 𝜽𝜽\\bm{\\theta} would represent parameters for learnable soft prompts of prompt tuning or weights of adapter tuning. Fig. 2 provides an intuitive description of 𝙶^^𝙶\\widehat{\\mathtt{G}} with adapter tuning. Fine-tuning of the transformer 𝙶^^𝙶\\widehat{\\mathtt{G}} involves learning of newly introduced parameters 𝜽𝜽\\bm{\\theta}, while existing parameters of 𝙶𝙶\\mathtt{G} (e.g., parameters of self-attention and cross-attention layers) remain fixed, with the learning objective as follows: where 𝒟trsubscript𝒟tr\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{tr}} contains a few (image, text) pairs for fine-tuning. Unlike DreamBooth  where the same text prompt is used to represent a set of training images, we use different text prompts for each input image to better disentangle content and style.\nOnce trained, similarly to the procedure in Eq. 2, we synthesize images from the generation distribution of 𝙶^​(⋅,⋅,𝜽)^𝙶⋅⋅𝜽\\widehat{\\mathtt{G}}(\\cdot,\\cdot,{\\color[rgb]{1,0,0}\\bm{\\theta}}). Specifically, at each decoding step k𝑘k, we generate logits lksubscript𝑙𝑘l_{k} as follows: where λAsubscript𝜆A\\lambda_{\\text{A}} controls the level of adaptation to the target distribution by contrasting the two generation distributions, one that is fine-tuned 𝙶^​(vk,𝚃​(t),𝜽)^𝙶subscript𝑣𝑘𝚃𝑡𝜽\\widehat{\\mathtt{G}}\\left(v_{k},\\mathtt{T}(t),{\\color[rgb]{1,0,0}\\bm{\\theta}}\\right) and another that is not 𝙶​(vk,𝚃​(t))𝙶subscript𝑣𝑘𝚃𝑡\\mathtt{G}\\left(v_{k},\\mathtt{T}(t)\\right), and λBsubscript𝜆B\\lambda_{\\text{B}} controls the textual alignment by contrasting the positive (t𝑡t) and negative (n𝑛n) text prompts.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: fine-tuning of generative vision transformers.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
