      "content": "Paper Title: Bangla Natural Language Processing: A Comprehensive Analysis of Classical, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning Based Methods\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe most commonly used classical methods in speech processing and recognition system are Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) , Hidden Markov Model (HMM) , Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) , Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) , Template Matching , Autocorrelation , Cepstrum , Speech Application\nProgram Interface (SAPI) , Factorial Hidden Markov Model , Minimum Classification Error , Knowledge Based Approaches , Template Based Approaches , and Perceptual Linear Prediction. The classical methods used in question answering system are Cosine similarity , Jaccard similarity , Anaphora-Cataphora Resolution , Vector Space Model , Semantic Web Technologies , Inductive Rule Learning and Reasoning , Logic Prover [ref]16 and many more. Spam and fake detection systems mainly use the following classical methods: Traditional Linguistic Features , Text Mining and Probabilistic Language Model , Review Processing Method , Time Series 0, and Active Learning 1. Most of the sentiment analysis systems adopted machine learning (ML) approaches. There are very few classical approaches taken in sentiment analysis. One of the classical methods is the rule-based method2. The classical approaches on machine translation are: Verb based approach3, Rule-based approach using parts of speech tagging4, Fuzzy rules 5, Rule based method6 and many more methods. Parts of speech tagging uses the following classical approaches: Brillâ€™s Tagger7, Rule-based approach8, 9, 0, and Morphological Analysis9, 0. The classical approaches on text summarization are Heuristic approach1 and for parsing, mostly used methods are Simple Suffix Stripping algorithm2, Score based Clustering algorithm2, and Feature Unification based Morphological Parsing3.\nIn the case of the information extraction for the Bangla languages, many statistical approaches 4 5 have been used to construct different systems. Also, to make a robust system, the use of the classical methods to add more feature sets to their datasets is observed. Like Hough Transform-based Fuzzy Feature 6, Gradient Feature, and Haar Wavelet Configuration 7 are used to add more features to a dataset for extraction of the information. In NER (Named Entity Recognition), most of the research works use Dictionary-based, Rule-based, and Statistical-based approaches 8. There are also different statistical models such as Conditional Random Fields (CRF)9 is used for NER. Most of the papers in the parsing are based on the Ruled-based method. Different Lexical Analysis, Semantic Analysis 0, 1\nmethods have been used for parsing. The researchers also have taken the help of different context-free grammar 0 for creating new rules for the parsing. Additionaly, the researchers have also used different open-source tools like PC-KIMMO 2 to construct a morphological parser. Analyzing different semantic information 1 can be utilized to create a parser. In the text summarization task, various information retrieval techniques for summarization with relational graphs are used. The topic sentiment recognition and aggregation are done through the Topic-sentiment model 3, and Theme Clustering 4. Frequency, position value, cue words, and skeleton of the documents are also used 5 for text summarization.\nThe classical approaches that used in word sense disambiguation are Rule-based methods 6, 7. The rules to mark the semiotic classes and the regular expressions are used frequently 6. Also, the use of different Context-free Grammars are seen in the word sense disambiguation7.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: answering system are Cosine similarity , Jaccard similarity , Anaphora-Cataphora Resolution , Vector Space Model , Semantic Web Technologies , Inductive Rule Learning and Reasoning , Logic Prover [ref]16 and many more. Spam and fake detection systems mainly use the following classical methods: Traditional Linguistic Features , Text Mining and Probabilistic Language Model , Review Processing\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
