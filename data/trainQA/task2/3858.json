      "content": "Paper Title: Domain Adaptation meets Individual Fairness. And they get along.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlthough algorithmic bias and distribution shifts are often considered separate problems, there is a recent body of empirical work that shows many instances of algorithmic bias are caused by distribution shifts. Broadly speaking, there are two ways distribution shifts cause algorithmic biases : (i) The model is trained to predict the wrong target; (ii) The model is trained to predict the correct target, but its predictions are inaccurate for demographic groups that are underrepresented in the training data. From a statistical perspective, the first type of algorithmic bias is caused by concept or posterior drift between the training data and the real-world.\nThis leads to a mismatch between the model’s predictions and actual data.\nThis type of algorithmic bias is also known as label choice bias [ref]2.\nThe second type of algorithmic biases arises when ML models are trained or evaluated with non-diverse data, causing the models to perform poorly on underserved groups. This type of algorithmic bias is caused by a covariate shift between the training data and the real-world data. In this paper, we mostly focus on algorithmic biases caused by covariate shift.\nThe overlap between the problems of algorithmic bias and distribution shift suggests two questions: Is it possible to overcome distribution shifts with algorithmic fairness interventions? Is it possible to mitigate biases caused by distribution shifts with domain adaptation methods? For a concrete example, consider building an ML model to predict a person’s occupation from their biography.\nFor this task, Yurochkin et al. [ref]3 showed that ML models trained on top of pre-trained language models without any algorithmic fairness intervention can be unfair:\nthey can change prediction (e.g., from attorney to paralegal or vice versa), when the name and gender pronouns are changed in the input biography.\nThis is a violation of individual fairness (IF), in part caused by underrepresentation of female attorneys in the train (source) data.\nConsequently, this model underperforms on female attorneys, in particular when female attorneys are better represented in the target domain.\nThis is a type of distribution shift known as subpopulation shift in the domain adaptation literature .\nIn this case, enforcing IF will not only result in a fairer model, but can also improve performance in the target domain, i.e., solve the domain adaptation problem. Now, under the same source and target domains, consider applying a domain adaptation (DA) method that matches the distributions of representations on the domains (see Appendix G for a brief review of DA and algorithmic fairness under distribution shifts).\nAssuming class marginals are the same111This setting corresponds to a domain shift assumption common in the DA literature., i.e., source and target have the same fraction of attorneys, any differences between the source and the target distribution are due to different fractions of male to female attorneys.\nLearning a feature (representation) extractor that is invariant to gender pronouns and names will align the two domains and result in a model that is individually fair.\nFor group fairness, Schumann et al. [ref]5 and Creager et al.  show that it is possible to leverage DA algorithms to enforce group fairness.\nThe goal of this paper is to complement these results by precisely characterizing the cases in which enforcing IF achieves domain generalization and vice a versa.\nOur contributions can be summarized as: We show that methods designed for IF can help ML models adapt/generalize to new domains, i.e., improve the accuracy of the trained ML model on out-of-distribution samples. Conversely, we show that DA algorithms that align the feature distributions in the source and target domains can be used to improve IF under certain probabilistic conditions on the features. We verify our theory on the Bios  and the Toxicity  datasets: enforcing IF via the methods of Yurochkin et al. [ref]3 and Petersen et al.  improves accuracy on the target domain, and DA methods 0 1 2 trained with appropriate source and target domains improve IF.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: drift between the training data and the real-world.\nThis leads to a mismatch between the model’s predictions and actual data.\nThis type of algorithmic bias is also known as label choice bias [ref]2.\nThe second type of algorithmic biases arises when ML models are trained or evaluated with non-diverse data, causing the models to perform poorly on underserved groups.
