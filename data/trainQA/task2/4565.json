      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Practical Single-shot Phase Retrieval with Physics-Driven Deep Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo understand the performance of the proposed PPRNet when applied to practical applications, we constructed an optical setup for collecting realistic intensity measurements for training and testing the network. The setup follows the optical path in Fig. 6. A snapshot of it is shown in Fig. 10. It comprises a Thorlabs 10‚Äãm‚ÄãW10ùëöùëä10mW HeNe laser with wavelength Œª=632.8‚Äãn‚ÄãmùúÜ632.8ùëõùëö\\lambda=632.8nm and a 121212-bit 1920√ó1200192012001920\\times 1200 Kiralux CMOS camera with a pixel pitch 5.86‚ÄãŒº‚Äãm5.86ùúáùëö5.86\\mu m. We utilized a 1920√ó1080192010801920\\times 1080 Holoeye Pluto phase-only SLM with pixel pitch Œ¥S‚ÄãL‚ÄãM=8‚ÄãŒº‚ÄãmsubscriptùõøùëÜùêøùëÄ8ùúáùëö\\delta_{SLM}=8\\mu m to generate the target images. The SLM can impose different phase shifts to the coherent light gets through it. It effectively synthesizes the objects in phase imaging applications  . Since the ground truth is known, we can easily evaluate the accuracy of the reconstructed phase images given by different approaches. Another advantage of using the SLM is, similar to that in the simulation, we can directly multiple the defocus kernel with the images to generate the defocusing effect. For the training and testing datasets, we used the same RAF and Fashion-MNIST datasets as in the simulation. Besides, we added the COCO dataset  (used the first 500005000050000 and 200020002000 images of the training and testing dataset, respectively), which contains more complex images for challenging the PR approaches. We used the same approach as in the simulation to generate the phase part of the images based on the images collected from these datasets. The magnitude part was assumed as constant. Then these phase images were multiplied with the defocus kernel and loaded to the SLM. Following the optical path, the images captured by the camera were the defocused Fourier intensity measurements of these phase images. They were used for the training and testing of different PR approaches. The resolutions of these intensity measurements and phase images were the same as in the simulation, i.e., 762√ó762762762762\\times 762 and 128√ó128128128128\\times 128 pixels, respectively. When training the models, we first initialized the models with the ones we used in the simulation, as discussed in Section IV-B. Then we fine-tuned all the pre-trained models by re-training them for 120120120 epochs with the experimental measurements as the new training inputs. We compared the proposed PPRNet with four traditional optimization-based algorithms: GS , HIO , WF , and RAAR [ref]7; and eleven deep learning-based methods: ResNet 1 3, PRCGAN , LearnInitNet 5, 333-scale UNet 4, LenlessNet , CPR-FS , SiSPRNet , NNPhase , and MCNN 2, prDeep [ref]22, and HIO-UNet . Similar to that in the simulation, we modified the input of some of the deep learning-based approaches since they originally could only handle much smaller size intensity measurements. Specifically, for CPR-FS, SiSPRNet, ResNet, NNPhase, MCNN, and PRCGAN, we inserted a pre-processing block before the original network structures. It contains two convolutional layers with a 5√ó5555\\times 5 kernel and strides 333 and 444, respectively, to extract the features and compress the dimension of the inputs from 762√ó762762762762\\times 762 to 128√ó128128128128\\times 128. Besides, we also modified the networks that were originally designed to give real-valued images to reconstruct complex-valued images. Specifically, we set the output channels of LenslessNet, HIO-UNet, and ResNet as 222 to give the real and imaginary parts of the images; and we also set the number of output channels of PRCGAN to 222 for magnitude-phase representation. We evaluate the performance of all competing PR methods using the same metrics as in the simulation, i.e., PSNR, SSIM, and MAE. For the traditional optimization-based algorithms, we fine-tuned the hyper-parameters and fixed them when evaluating with the testing images. We did three trials of evaluation for each testing image, where each trial had 150015001500 iterations. The reconstructed image with the highest PSNR among the three trials was chosen for comparison. Besides, traditional optimization-based algorithms can have trivial ambiguities in the reconstructed images, such as global phase shift, etc. They were removed before comparisons were conducted. The quantitative and qualitative evaluation results are shown in TABLE III and Fig. 11, respectively. To save space, we do not include the qualitative results of GS, WF, RAAR, ResNet, UNet, LearnInitNet, and CPR-FS in Fig. 11 due to their inferior performances. As presented in TABLE III, the reconstruction performances of the proposed PPRNet are much better than those of the compared approaches. Compared with the traditional optimization-based algorithms (GS, HIO, WF, and RAAR), PPRNet has average PSNR and SSIM gains of at least 4.857‚Äãd‚ÄãB4.857ùëëùêµ4.857dB and 0.2660.2660.266, respectively, on the challenging COCO dataset that contains a wide range of rich content natural images. For the facial RAF dataset, the PSNR and SSIM gains can reach 12.219‚Äãd‚ÄãB12.219ùëëùêµ12.219dB and 0.520.520.52, respectively. The PSNR and SSIM gains can even reach 27.312‚Äãd‚ÄãB27.312ùëëùêµ27.312dB and 0.7040.7040.704, respectively, on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. In general, traditional optimization-based methods are difficult to converge to satisfactory results with only one intensity measurement. In particular, they have poorer performances in the Fashion-MNIST dataset. This is because the meaningful contents of the images (i.e., clothes) often located at the center while the values of outer regions are close to zeros. Thus, the algorithms fail to estimate the correct spatial support of the images. Besides, the saturated intensity measurement further complicates the problem, although it has already been lessened by using the defocusing method, as mentioned in Section IV-A. As shown in Fig. 11, both HIO and RAAR methods can only recover the contour of the original images (third and fourth columns), but many defects remain. Compared with the state-of-the-art deep learning-based PR methods, our PPRNet can achieve PSNR and SSIM gains of at least 7.45‚Äãd‚ÄãB7.45ùëëùêµ7.45dB and 0.080.080.08, respectively, on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. It also performs the best on the RAF and COCO datasets. It can be seen in Fig. 11 that the reconstructed images of the proposed PPRNet can provide more details than other methods with fewer artifacts. It is particularly the case for the COCO dataset. Since the images are more complex, other approaches even cannot reconstruct the contours of the objects in the images. PPRNet can recover not only the contours but provide more textures of the original images. It is benefited from the physics information of the underlying image that guides the reconstruction process. Compared with other physics-driven methods, such as HIO-UNet and PrDeep, PPRNet not only provides better quality images but also has a lower complexity. It is expected since PPRNet has a feedforward architecture that does not require iterative estimation. Besides, PPRNet is end-to-end trained. It is different from HIO-UNet and PrDeep, which have an optimizer operated outside the network model. Thus, any mismatch between them can let the iteration process trap at the local minimum. Besides, prDeep is only successful for real-valued images, as claimed by the authors [ref]22. The result is unsatisfactory when it is used to retrieve phase images. The above experimental results have verified the performance of the proposed PPRNet when used in a practical phase retrieval system. It consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFourier\n\nmeasurement\n\n \n\n\nGround-truth\n\n(phase)\n\nHIO\nprDeep\nLenslessNet\nPRCGAN\nNNPhase\nSiSPRNet\nMCNN\nHIO-UNet\n \n\n\nPPRNet\n\n(ours)\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: them for 120120120 epochs with the experimental measurements as the new training inputs.
