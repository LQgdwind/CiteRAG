Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

We report negative log-likelihood (NLL) scores for all AR models in bits, on the test set of the respective datasets. To evaluate NLL, we follow the same protocol as we would for training, splitting the data into non-overlapping chunks (with the same length as training), running each chunk through a model and then using the predictions made on each step of that chunk to calculate the average NLL for the chunk. Evaluation of generated samples.\nFollowing Kong et¬†al. [ref]23, we use 4 standard evaluation metrics for generative models evaluated using an auxiliary ResNeXT classifier [ref]43 which achieved 98.3% accuracy on the test set. Note that Kong et¬†al. [ref]23 reported an additional metric NDB (number of statistically-distinct bins), which we found to be slow to compute and generally uninformative, despite SaShiMi performing best. Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID)  uses the classifier to compare moments of generated and real samples in feature space. Inception Score (IS)  measures both quality and diversity of generated samples, and favoring samples that the classifier is confident on. Modified Inception Score (mIS) [ref]14\nprovides a measure of both intra-class in addition to inter-class diversity. AM Score  uses the marginal label distribution of training data compared to IS. We also report the Cohen‚Äôs inter-annotator agreement Œ∫ùúÖ\\kappa score, which is computed with the classifier as one rater and a crowdworker‚Äôs digit prediction as the other rater (treating the set of crowdworkers as a single rater).\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: running each chunk through a model and then using the predictions made on each step of that chunk to calculate the average NLL for the chunk.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
