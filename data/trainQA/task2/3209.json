      "content": "Paper Title: PeopleSansPeople: A Synthetic Data Generator for Human-Centric Computer Vision\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraditionally computer vision models have been trained using large scale human-labeled datasets such as PASCAL VOC , NYU-Depth V2 , MS COCO , and SUN RGB-D .\nWhile being powerful resources, producing these datasets is costly, and these static data sources do not allow researchers to create datasets appropriate to their task of interest.\nIn response, researchers have adopted simulators to control data generation for desired target tasks.\nSYNTHIA [ref]11, virtual KITTI , CARLA , VIPER , and Synscapes  provide synthetic datasets for computer vision tasks relevant to autonomous vehicle navigation in cities.\nHypersim  and OpenRooms  develop simulators for indoor object detection.\nRobotic simulators include AI-2THOR , Habitat  0, NVIDIA Isaac Sim 1, and iGibson 2 focus largely on embodied AI tasks.\nMore generic tools for object detection dataset generation include BlenderProc 3, BlendTorch 4, NVISII 5, and the Unity Perception package .\nPeopleSansPeople contributes to this growing body of tools by addressing humans as a vital part of the dataset and enabling human-centric computer vision tasks. Synthetic people datasets are challenging to build due to the complexity of human bodies and the significant variations seen in their poses and identities. Several efforts have used learned models to extract 3D posed humans from existing datasets and composited these into new scenes to produce larger synthetic datasets 6 7 8 9.\nModel approximation quality and biases existing in the training data constrain the generalization capabilities of the learned models, in turn limiting the synthetic data.\nAlternatively, we can use simulators to generate richly labeled datasets, derived from hand-crafted scenes , existing games like GTA V   , or game engines .\nPeopleSansPeople builds on this line of work using the Unity Perception package  to produce labeled synthetic data.\nWe use high-quality human assets and rendering pipelines to generate labeled image data, enabling researchers to produce diverse human data.\nPeopleSansPeople allows researchers to exchange the provided assets and scene components, allowing a level of customization absent from previous efforts.\nIt also enables researchers to leverage existing sources of high-quality digital human assets  . Simulators are valuable for data generation as they provide control over the data generation itself and facilitate tuning of the dataset to enable simulation to real (sim2real) transfer.\nDomain randomization [ref]37 is a technique that is used to introduce diversity into the generated data, by randomizing the parameters of the simulator.\nDomain randomization has been applied to tasks including object detection   5 4, robotic manipulation [ref]37 , and autonomous vehicle navigation    .\nPeopleSansPeople enables researchers to use synthetic data with domain randomization in tasks involving people as part of the target class, expanding the space of simulator capabilities in existing and new domains, like autonomous vehicle driving and human pose estimation and tracking.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: do not allow researchers to create datasets appropriate to their task of interest.\nIn response, researchers have adopted simulators to control data generation for desired target tasks.\nSYNTHIA [ref]11, virtual KITTI , CARLA , VIPER , and Synscapes  provide synthetic datasets for computer vision tasks relevant to autonomous vehicle navigation in cities.\nHypersim  and OpenRooms  develop\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
