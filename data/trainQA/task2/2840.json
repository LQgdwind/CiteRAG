      "content": "Paper Title: One Timestep is all you need: Training Spiking Neural Networks with Ultra Low Latency\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets and Models.\nWe perform experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet using VGG16 and ResNet20 architectures. Some small scale studies involve VGG6. We also investigate the performance of the proposed IIR-SNN in reinforcement learning (RL) applications using Cartpole and Atari-pong. Appendix A.2 includes\narchitectural details and training hyperparameters. Results on CIFAR and ImageNet. The experimental results using the proposed IIR-SNN scheme for CIFAR and ImageNet datasets are shown in Table 1. We achieve top-1 accuracy of 93.05% and 70.15% on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively using VGG16 architecture, with just 1 timestep (T1); results using ResNet20 are shown too. Next, to investigate the scalability of the proposed algorithm, we experiment with ImageNet where we obtain 67.71% top-1 accuracy with T1. As we sequentially reduce the timestep from 5 to 1, there is a slight accuracy degradation, however that is due to the inherent accuracy versus latency trade-off in SNNs. Notably, the proposed scheme allows us to bring the SNN latency down to lowest possible limit (1 timestep) while maintaining comparable accuracy to corresponding ANN as well as the 5 timestep SNN. Additionally, this provides the option to choose the SNN model suitable for application in hand from a range of timesteps; if latency and efficiency is the priority, T1 would be preferred, albeit with slightly lower accuracy compared to T5. Performance Comparison. Next, we compare our performance with different state-of-the-art SNNs in Table 2. IIR-SNN performs better than or comparably to all these methods, while achieving significantly lower inference latency. In particular, note that previously it was challenging to obtain satisfactory performance with low latency on ImageNet, with lowest reported latencies of 5 [ref]18 and 6 . In contrast, we report 67.71% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet using T1. Again,  achieve 90.53% accuracy on CIFAR-10 using 12 timesteps with direct input encoding (similar to IIR-SNN), but the proposed method enables us to obtain 93.05% accuracy on CIFAR-10 using T1. For CIFAR100, [ref]18 report 69.67% accuracy with 5 timesteps, whereas IIR-SNN achieves 70.15% with T1. Overall, IIR-SNN demonstrates 5-2500X improvement in inference latency compared to\nother works while maintaining iso or better classification performance. Table 2 also demonstrates the continuum of training SNNs from ANN-SNN conversion to T1 IIR-SNN. Initial ANN-SNN conversion methods required latency on the order of thousands  . Surrogate-gradient based bp   reduced it to few tens to hundred, but scaling up to ImageNet was challenging. Hybrid training  combined these two methods to bring the latency down to few hundreds. Subsequently, direct input encoding enabled convergence on ImageNet with latency of ‚àº5similar-toabsent5\\sim 5 [ref]18 . The proposed IIR-SNN method leverages all these previously proposed techniques and improves upon them by incorporating the sequential reduction approach to obtain unit latency. We also achieve better performance compared to different SNN encoding schemes such as TTFS , phase , burst ; detailed comparison is provided in Appendix section A.3. Inference Efficiency. Next, we compare the energy efficiency of IIR-SNNs with ANNs and multi-timestep SNNs. In SNNs, the floating-point (FP) additions replace the FP MAC operations. This results in higher compute efficiency as the cost of a MAC (4.6‚Äãp‚ÄãJ4.6ùëùùêΩ4.6pJ) is 5.1√ó5.1\\times to an addition (0.9‚Äãp‚ÄãJ0.9ùëùùêΩ0.9pJ)  in 45nm\nCMOS technology (as shown in Fig.¬†2(e)). Appendix A.4 contains the equations of computational cost in the form of operations per layer in an ANN, #‚ÄãANNops#subscriptANNops\\#\\text{ANN}_{\\text{ops}}. For IIR-SNN, the number of operations is given as #‚ÄãIIR-SNNops, q=spike rateq√ó#‚ÄãANNops, q;#subscriptIIR-SNNops, qsubscriptspike rateq#subscriptANNops, q\\#\\text{IIR-SNN}_{\\text{ops, q}}=\\text{spike rate}_{\\text{q}}\\times\\#\\text{ANN}_{\\text{ops, q}}; spike rateqq{}_{\\text{q}} denoting the average number of spikes per neuron per inference over all timesteps in layer q. The layerwise spike rates across T5 to T1 are shown in Fig.¬†2(a-c). Note, the spike rates decrease significantly with latency reduction from 5 to 1, leading to considerably lower operation count in T1 compared to T5. The overall average spike rates using T1 for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet on VGG16 are 0.13, 0.15 and 0.18, respectively; all significantly below 5.1 (relative cost of MAC to addition), indicating the energy benefits of IIR-SNN over the corresponding ANN. The first layer with direct input encoded SNNs receive analog inputs, hence the operations are same as an ANN at this layer. Considering it,\nwe compute the compute energy benefits of IIR-SNN over ANN, Œ±ùõº\\alpha as , The values of\nŒ±ùõº\\alpha for different datasets and architectures are given in Fig.¬†2(d). For VGG16, we obtain Œ±ùõº\\alpha of 33.0, 29.24 and 24.61 on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, respectively.\nBesides compute energy, another significant overhead in SNNs occurs due to memory access costs which can be 2-3 orders of magnitude higher [ref]16 compared to FP adds as shown in Fig.¬†2(e). In multi-timestep SNNs, weights and membrane potentials have to be fetched at every timestep, incurring significant data movement cost. However, most previous works  [ref]18   did not consider this cost while comparing the energy benefits of SNN to ANN. To obtain a fairer comparison, we analyze the costs taking the memory access issue into consideration. For multi-timestep SNNs, in addition to the weights, Vmemmem{}_{\\text{mem}} needs to be stored and fetched at each timestep for all neurons, unlike ANNs. However, the memory requirements for T1 SNNs are same as ANNs; T1 SNNs neither require any extra memory to store Vmemmem{}_{\\text{mem}} for future timesteps, nor do they have any extra memory accesses compared to ANNs as inference is single shot. The actual improvements in energy due to this depends on the hardware architecture and system configurations. Hence, we compare the reduction in terms of number of memory access. For a VGG16, the proposed T1 reduces the number of memory accesses by 5.03√ó\\times compared to [ref]18. More generally, our scheme reduces the number of memory accesses by approximately T√ó\\times compared to an SNN trained with T timesteps. Comparison with binary activated ANNs. A key distinction between ANNs and SNNs is the notion of time, however, T1 IIR-SNN and ReLU activated ANN both infer in single shot, difference being the neuronal functionality and output precision. This difference reduces further with ANNs using binary activations (ANNb) which also have 0/1 output, like SNNs. Thus, it is interesting to compare the performance of T1 IIR-SNN and ANNb which is the focus of Table 3. We observe that IIR-SNN outperforms other ANNb approaches in most cases; our results are slightly lower on CIFAR100 compared to , however in their case, the ANN ReLU output is thresholded to saturate at 2, but the values are still analog. Note, in all cases, weights are full precision. Efficacy of IIR-SNN with shallow networks. As mentioned in section 4, gradual training is required due to spike vanishing at later layers for deep SNNs if direct transition from T5 to T1 is attempted. However, for shallow networks, if there is some propagation of spikes till the end, training with T1 following direct conversion from ANN might be possible. To validate this, we experiment with a VGG6 on CIFAR10 and the results are shown in Table 5. In this table, VGG6g denotes networks trained with gradual latency reduction and VGG6d denotes networks directly converted from ANN and trained using that particular timestep, so the result in the last row of Table 5 is obtained by converting an ANN to SNN and directly training with 1 timestep. We observe that proposed gradual training scheme provides slightly higher accuracy compared to direct training in case of shallower networks, though it increases the training overhead. This is consistent with ANN domain results  [ref]6, where the authors achieve better performing networks using sequential model compression compared to direct compression. IIR-SNN with and without batch-norm. Recent works have achieved low latency by adopting batch-normalization (bn) suitably in SNNs  . To disentangle the effect of bn from the proposed gradual latency reduction scheme and ensure that achieving convergence with 1 timestep is orthogonal to using bn, we perform ablation studies as shown in Table 5. For both CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, IIR-SNN enables training with T5 to T1 irrespective of using bn during ANN training. Using bn enhances accuracy, but sequential latency reduction can be performed independently from it. Also,  report that using threshold-dependent bn allows reducing latency up to a minimum of 6 timesteps, but IIR-SNN can go up to 1. Note, in IIR-SNN, bn is used only during ANN training and the bn parameters are fused with the weights during ANN-SNN conversion as proposed in ; bn is not used in SNN domain training, so the activations at each layer output remain binary. Skipping intermediate latency reduction steps. Since the proposed IIR-SNN scheme increases training overhead due to sequential retraining, it is worth investigating if this cost can be reduced by skipping in between latency reduction steps. To that effect, we experiment with 2 cases- (i) training T5 followed by T3_5, followed by T1_3, (ii) IIR-SNN including all intermediate latencies with the sequence- T5, T4_5, T3_4, T2_3 and T1_2. Interestingly, both these cases perform comparably; for CIFAR10, we obtain 93.01% and 93.05% accuracy, respectively with 1 timestep for cases (i) and (ii). Again, these values for CIFAR100 are 69.92% and 70.15%, respectively, indicating if the end goal is obtaining T1 SNN, training overhead can be reduced by skipping intermediate steps. However, in this paper, we report the whole spectrum of accuracy-latency trade-off from T5 to T1. Is training following direct conversion from ANN with T1 thresholds feasible? As mentioned above, a limitation of IIR-SNN is extra training overhead. Though it does not affect our primary goal (inference efficiency) , it would be better if direct conversion from ANN to T1 would be feasible. This is challenging due to layerwise spike decay as discussed in detail in section 4. In this part, we revisit this from a different angle. First, we obtain the layerwise Vthth{}_{\\text{th}} for T1 using IIR-SNN. Then, using this set of Vthth{}_{\\text{th}}, we convert a VGG16 ANN to SNN, on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 to investigate whether these thresholds trained for T1 can enable direct training with T1 following ANN-SNN conversion. However, training failure occurs in this case too, since during IIR-SNN T1 training, the weights (w) get modified in addition to the thresholds, and layerwise spike propagation depends on both Vthth{}_{\\text{th}} and w. Even if training converged in this case, the challenge would remain how to obtain the suitable Vthth{}_{\\text{th}} for T1 without IIR, however it would indicate the existence of deep T1 SNNs which can be trained by ANN-SNN conversion followed by direct SNN domain T1 training. But in our experiments, we are unable to find such networks, further validating the need of IIR method. IIR-SNN with magnitude based weight pruning. With T1 IIR-SNN, we can obtain maximum compression possible in the temporal domain of SNNs, as 1 forward pass is the minimum for any network to produce output. Additionally, we hypothesize that T1 networks might be amenable to spatial pruning as there is significant redundancy in the layerwise weights of DNNs [ref]6 [ref]16. To investigate this, we perform experiments on T1 with magnitude based weight pruning [ref]16. Our result indicate that we can remove 90% of the total weights of a VGG16 without large drop in performance. Using VGG16 (T1), we obtain 91.15% accuracy on CIFAR10 and 68.20% accuracy on CIFAR100, while retaining just 10% of the spatial connections. This provides evidence that spatial pruning techniques can be combined with T1 IIR-SNNs to achieve holistic spatio-temporal compression, albeit with a slight hit to classification accuracy. Reinforcement learning (RL) with IIR-SNN. Due to their inherent recurrence, SNNs with multiple timesteps might be more useful in sequential decision-making (such as RL tasks) than static image classification. However, application of SNNs in RL may be limited if the latency is too high, since the agent has to make decisions in real-time.  obtain high performing RL agents on Atari games with SNNs, but with 500 timesteps. Hence, in this section, we investigate if IIR-SNN technique can enable training SNNs for RL tasks with low latency. Experiments are performed using SNN based deep Q-networks (DQN)  on cartpole and Atari pong environments. As shown in Fig.¬†3(a) and (b), for both cases, we can train SNNs up to 1 timestep. The rewards are obtained by averaging over 20 trials and plotted with errorbars showing mean¬±plus-or-minus\\pmstd. In (a), the reward is the duration of the cartpole remaining balanced; DQN with ANN, SNN(T1) and SNN(T3) achieve 40.3¬±plus-or-minus\\pm4.8, 38.7¬±plus-or-minus\\pm5.4, 52.2¬±plus-or-minus\\pm4.3, respectively. While T1 SNN performs slightly worse compared to ANN-based DQN, SNN with T3 outperforms the ANN. Similar performance improvement over ANN using SNN for some RL tasks has been reported in . Next, we experiment with a more complex task, Atari pong game; in this case, T1 SNN achieves reward of 17.4¬±plus-or-minus\\pm3.2 compared to ANN based DQN‚Äôs 19.7¬±plus-or-minus\\pm1.1. However, with T5 SNN, we obtain comparable reward (19.4¬±plus-or-minus\\pm1.3) to ANN. Notably, with IIR-SNN, we can obtain SNNs for RL task (pong) with significantly lower latency compared to prior art. On pong,  report reward of 19.8¬±plus-or-minus\\pm1.3 using 500 timesteps, whereas, we obtain 19.4¬±plus-or-minus\\pm1.3 reward using just 5 timesteps. So, IIR-SNN enables obtaining SNNs for RL tasks with comparable performance to ANNs with ‚àº5similar-toabsent5\\sim 5 timesteps, and up to 1 timestep with slightly lower performance. Moreover, such latency reduction translates to considerable energy savings which is critical for agents operating in the real world. The layerwise spike rates for SNN-DQN (T1) are shown in Fig.¬†3(c), the average spike rate is 0.08 only in this case, which results in 7.55X higher energy efficiency compared to ANN-DQN. Again, if we compare iso-performing networks to ANN-DQN, SNN-DQN (T5) infers with average spike rate 0.42, thus providing 5.22X higher energy efficiency compared to ANN-DQN.\nThe details of network topologies used, training setup and additional results are given in appendix A.5.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: significantly lower inference latency.
