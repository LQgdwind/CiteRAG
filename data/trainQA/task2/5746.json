      "content": "Paper Title: Experimenting with Normalization Layers in Federated Learning on non-IID scenarios\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe majority of the FL algorithms simply apply an aggregation function (like averaging) to all the components of a NN, including weights and biases of the normalization layers. Most of the common NN architectures, like residual networks , adopt BN  as normalization layer. However, in contexts like Federated or Transfer Learning, BN may not be the optimal choice, especially when dealing with non-IID data. In this chapter will be reviewed the main characteristics of Batch Normalization and several possible alternatives like Group Normalization (GN) , Layer Normalization (LN) [ref]19, Instance Normalization (IN) [ref]20 and Batch Renormalization (BRN) [ref]21.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: dealing with non-IID data. In this chapter will be reviewed the main characteristics of Batch Normalization and several possible alternatives like Group Normalization (GN) , Layer Normalization (LN) [ref]19, Instance Normalization (IN) [ref]20 and Batch Renormalization (BRN) [ref]21.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
