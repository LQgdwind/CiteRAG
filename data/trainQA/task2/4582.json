      "content": "Paper Title: SIM2E: Benchmarking the Group Equivariant Capability of Correspondence Matching Algorithms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe group-equivariant capabilities of six classical and ten learning-based correspondence matching approaches are evaluated on our SIM2E dataset. For classical correspondence matching approaches, we use the OpenCV  implementations of AKAZE , BRISK , KAZE , ORB [ref]13, FREAK , and SIFT  in our experiments. All these classical approaches use the nearest neighbor matching algorithm for correspondence matching. The ratio test technique (threshold is set to 0.7) is also used to improve the overall performance. For learning-based correspondence matching approaches, we use the official weights of each model. These models were trained on different datasets, as detailed below: SuperPoint  is trained on the MS-COCO [ref]18 dataset, a large-scale dataset for object detection and segmentation. R2D2  is trained on the Aachen Day-Night  dataset and a retrieval dataset . ALIKE  is trained on the MegaDepth [ref]42 dataset. GIFT  is trained on the MS-COCO [ref]18 dataset and finetuned on the GL3D  dataset (consisting of indoor and outdoor scenes). RoRD  is trained on the PhotoTourism  dataset, where the 3D structures of scenes are obtained using SfM. SuperGlue  is trained with the indoor models in the ScanNet  dataset and the outdoor models in the MegaDepth [ref]42 dataset. SGMNet  is trained on the GL3D  dataset. Our experiments utilize the SIFT version of SGMNet, where the detector and descriptor are rotation-invariant. LoFTR  is trained with the same experimental setup as SuperGlue. MatchFormer  is trained with the same experimental setup as SuperGlue and LoFTR. Limited by our GPU memory, the lightweight version of MatchFormer is used in our experiments. SE2-LoFTR  is trained on the MegaDepth dataset. Furthermore, the mean matching accuracy (MMA) is employed to quantify the performance of the aforementioned correspondence matching algorithms, which are run on a PC with an Intel Core i7-10870H CPU and an NVIDIA RTX3080-laptop GPU (having a 16GB DDR4 memory).\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: correspondence matching approaches are evaluated on our SIM2E dataset.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
