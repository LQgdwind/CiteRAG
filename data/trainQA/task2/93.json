      "content": "Paper Title: Sentiment Analysis Using Averaged Weighted Word Vector Features\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the literature, there are some datasets to use models, such as Stanford IMDB Movie Reviews, SEMEVAL restaurant and laptop reviews, and the Yelp dataset. We mentioned previous studies that used these datasets. Although there are some rule-based studies in the literature, we listed only studies that used learning algorithms since our study is also focused on machine learning algorithms. Wang and Manning used Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), support vector machine (SVM), and SVM with NB (NBSVM) feature to find out the polarities of the reviews. They split at spaces for unigrams and filtered out anything that is not [A-Za-z] for bigrams. Their approach computes a log-ratio vector between the average word counts extracted from positive documents and the average word counts extracted from negative documents. NBSVM obtained 91.2%percent91.291.2\\% accuracy for the IMDB dataset. Mesnil et al. used three approaches to discriminate positive and negative sentiment for the IMDB reviews, and then they combined these approaches to reach better accuracy. Their first approach is computing the probability of the test document belonging to the positive and negative class via Bayes’ rule by using n-grams and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) [ref]26. As a second approach, they used a supervised reweighing of the counts as in the Naive Bayes Support Vector Machine (NB-SVM) that was mentioned in the previous paragraph. Finally, they used a sentence vector method, which is proposed by  to learn distributed representations of words and paragraphs. The sentence vector was created by using the word2vec algorithm, which was proposed by . To create review vectors, at the first step, they added a unique ID at the beginning of every review. In this way, this id became a word that represents the review. Then, they ran the word2vec algorithm on these modified reviews and prevented the algorithm from removing review IDs. So, they had a matrix that included word vectors of the words in the reviews and review IDs. Every row represents a word vector of the corresponding word. Then, they created a sub-matrix of this matrix that contains only word vectors of review IDs. This method has one major issue: A review vector should be generated from both training and test reviews. So, if you want to find the polarity of a new review, all steps, including creating review vectors, have to be repeated. Therefore it is not a practical method. Then, they combined the results of the three approaches and achieved higher accuracy. Mesnil et al passed Wang and Manning score and they reached 92.57%percent92.5792.57\\% accuracy. In Semeval 2016 Task 5 Subtask 2, a set of customer reviews about a target entity (e.g. a laptop or a restaurant) was given; the goal is to identify a set of aspect, polarity tuples that summarize the opinions expressed in each review. Khalil et al.(NileTMRG Team)[ref]28 incorporated domain and aspect information in one ensemble classifier consisting of three CNNs[ref]29 trained using the whole training data provided in both domains and initialized with word vectors that were fine-tuned using training examples collected in a semi-supervised way by the same CNN architecture. Each one of the three classifiers is similar to the one with a slight variation resulting from incorporating domain and aspect knowledge into the CNN model. This incorporation was done by introducing new binary features to the hidden layer of the CNN. The new features indicate the presence or the absence of a certain aspect or domain in a given sentence. They have mostly employed Static-CNN, where initialized input vectors are kept as is, and Dynamic-CNN, where input vectors are updated for optimizing the network. Dynamic-CNN on sentences tokenized from the Yelp academic dataset reviews in restaurants. They ensembled their results. This ensemble model counts votes from three classifiers and predicts the class that has the maximum number of votes from the three classes, namely the positive, the negative, and the neutral. They obtained 85.448 percent accuracy for the English Restaurant dataset of Semeval 2016 Task 5. Kumar et al.(IIT-TUDA team) used Lexical Acquisition and supervised classification using Support Vector Machine SVM at Semeval 2016 Task 5. They used lexical expansion to induce sentiment words based on the distributional hypothesis. Due to their observation of rare words, unseen instances, and limited coverage of available lexicons, they thought that the distributional expansion might be a useful back-off technique (Govind et al. ). They constructed a polarity lexicon for all languages using an external corpus and seed sentiment lexicon. Finally, they computed the normalized positive, negative, and neutral scores for each word similar to (Kumar et al. ). Their main assumption is that words with the same sentiment are semantically more similar. Hence, words that appear more in positive (negative/neutral) reviews have a higher positive (negative/neutral) sentiment score. They obtained 86.729 percent accuracy for the English Restaurant dataset of Semeval 2016 Task 5. Brun et al. (XCRE team) apply a term-centric method for feature extraction. For a term, the features are obtained as the lexical-semantic categories (food, service, etc.) associated with the term by a semantic parser, bigrams and trigrams involving the term, and all syntactic dependencies (subject, object, modifier, attribute, etc.) involving the term. First, aspects are extracted using a conditional random field (CRF) model. Then, aspect categories are found and added as features for polarity classification. The features are also delexicalized, replacing a term with its generic aspect category (e.g. “staff” is replaced by “service”, “sushi” is replaced by “food”). They obtained 88.13% accuracy for the English restaurant dataset of the Semeval 2016 Task 5. Jiang et al. (ECNU team) employ the Logistic Regression algorithm with the default parameter implemented in lib-linear tools111https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/cjlin/liblinear/ to build the classifiers. The 5-fold cross-validation is adopted for system development. They used linguistic features (Word N-grams, Lemmatized Word N-grams, POS, etc.), sentiment lexicon features (mainly ratios between positive, negative, and potential words related to a given aspect), topic model (the document distribution among predefined topics, the topic probability of each word indicates its significance in corresponding topic) and word2vec features to learn.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: accuracy.
