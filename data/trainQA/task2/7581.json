      "content": "Paper Title: The complexity of computing in continuous time: space complexity is precision\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, there has been a renewed interest in models of computations over the reals and their associated complexity classes. The fact that these models appear in complexity issues of deep learning models (a.k.a. neural networks) partially explains it. For example, various problems, such as the training of fully connected neural networks, have been proved to be a ‚àÉ‚Ñù‚Ñù\\exists\\mathbb{R}-complete problem .\nComplexity classes like ùêÖùêàùêóùêèùêÖùêàùêóùêè\\mathbf{FIXP} were introduced to discuss the complexity of continuous functions‚Äô fixed points in various contexts, such as game theory . These classes and statements are related to discrete-time models of computation over the reals. For discrete-time models of computations over the reals, the most famous approaches are computable analysis, based on the Turing machine model in  and  and algebraic models such as the Blum Shub Smale (BSS) model of computation [ref]8 . The class ‚àÉ‚Ñù‚Ñù\\exists\\mathbb{R} corresponds to the (constant-free, equivalently uniform) non-deterministic time of the BSS model of computation. An extensive list of decision problems was proved recently to be in this class.\nBoth models were tailored for very different applications and it is well-known we cannot unify existing models with the equivalent of a Church-Turing thesis. For example, computable functions in a computable analysis model need to be continuous, while the BSS model intends to consider functions and problems over the polynomials that are not. It is also explained by the fact that some models have not been introduced with the idea of corresponding to actual physical machines but also to discuss abstract complexity (lower and upper bounds) for associated problems. Among models of computation over the reals, we can also distinguish continuous-time models. This includes models of old, first-ever built computers, such as the Differential Analysers . A famous mathematical model of such machines is the General Purpose Analog Computer model of Claude Shannon . It covers many historical machines and today‚Äôs analogue devices   too. It also includes various recent approaches and models from deep learning such as Neural ODEs 3  with many variants. In the context of continuous-time, the situation is clearer than with discrete-time models, as there is a unifying way to describe these models, provided by ODEs. Each model corresponds to a particular class of ODEs. For example, the GPAC corresponds to polynomial ODEs , and Neural ODEs are made by selecting\nthe best solution among a parameterised class of ODEs: see, e.g. . Even if particular classes of ODES can describe such models, defining a robust and well-defined computation theory for continuous-time computations is not an easy problem: see  for the most recent survey. In short, the problem with time complexity is that considering the time variable as a measure of time is not robust: a curve can always be re-parameterised using a change of variable. The problem with space complexity is similar: reparameterisation corresponds to a change of time variable, but also of space-variable, introducing space and time contractions: See e.g.  [ref]16. Furthermore, many problems for simple dynamical systems are known to be undecidable, hence forbid ùêèùêíùêèùêÄùêÇùêÑùêèùêíùêèùêÄùêÇùêÑ\\mathbf{PSPACE}-completeness see  and 8. There was a recent breakthrough in  [ref]16, where the authors relate time with the length of the solution curve of an ODE. It holds for polynomial ODEs, and their projections, known to cover a very wide class of functions, including all common functions or functions that can be built from them . As the length of a curve is an invariant, this solves the issue of a possible change of variable. Furthermore, the authors prove that for polynomial ODEs, this is polynomially related\nto the time required to solve an ODE, hence providing a robust notion of time for ODEs.\nThese statements and underlying constructions, which allow the simulation of Turing machines,\nled to solving several open problems: the existence of a universal ODE , the proof of the Turing-completeness of chemical reactions , or statements about the hardness of several dynamical systems problems 8. The question of whether we can give a simple equivalent defining space-complexity remains. We argue here that space complexity is polynomially related and conversely to the numerical stability of ODEs and their associated precision. We prove that a problem can be solved in polynomial space\niff it can be simulated by some numerically stable ODE, using a polynomial precision.\nWe prove this holds both for classical complexity over the discrete (functions over the integers) and also for space complexity for real functions in the model of computable analysis. In the literature, there are two possible definitions for ùêÖùêèùêíùêèùêÄùêÇùêÑùêÖùêèùêíùêèùêÄùêÇùêÑ\\mathbf{FPSPACE}, according to whether functions with non-polynomial size values are allowed or not. In this article, when we talk about ùêÖùêèùêíùêèùêÄùêÇùêÑùêÖùêèùêíùêèùêÄùêÇùêÑ\\mathbf{FPSPACE}, we always assume the outputs remain of polynomial size.\nOtherwise, the class is not closed by composition: the issue is about not counting the output\nas part of the total space used. Given fùëìf computable in polynomial space and gùëîg in logarithmic space, f‚àògùëìùëîf\\circ g (and g‚àòfùëîùëìg\\circ f) is computable in polynomial space. But, if exponential size output is allowed, this is not true: if we assumed only fùëìf and gùëîg to be computable in polynomial space since the first might give an output of exponential size. These questions of providing characterisations of classical complexity using ODEs can also be seen from the so-called ‚Äúimplicit complexity‚Äù point of view.\nHaving \"simple\" characterisations of computability and complexity classes is useful\nfor various fundamental and applied science fields. We are interested here in \"algebraic\"\ncharacterisations of those classes: we want to define them as the smallest set [f1,‚Ä¶,fk;o1,‚Ä¶,ol]subscriptùëì1‚Ä¶subscriptùëìùëòsubscriptùëú1‚Ä¶subscriptùëúùëô[f_{1},\\dots,f_{k};o_{1},\\dots,o_{l}] where the fisubscriptùëìùëñf_{i}‚Äôs are functions, closed under the operators oisubscriptùëúùëño_{i}‚Äôs. For example, the set of computable functions over the integers is well-known to be: Implicit complexity aims at giving similar algebras for classes of complexity theory: a reference survey is 4 5.\nThe main benefit is to avoid the use of the framework of Turing machines, which is rather\nheavy and not necessarily well-known outside fundamental computer science.\nSeveral characterisations for ùêèùêìùêàùêåùêÑùêèùêìùêàùêåùêÑ\\mathbf{PTIME} over the integers were proposed.\nThe first is due to Cobham in 6, but relies on explicit ah-hoc bounds.\nOther approaches have then been proposed, see surveys\n4 5. Recently, Bournez and Durand in \nsuggested an algebra using the so-called \"linear-length\" discrete ODEs. Instead of\nhaving explicit bounds, the linearity of the involved discrete ODE guarantees polynomial time complexity. Using a similar approach, Blanc and Bournez in  and in  extended the constructions to a characterisation of ùêèùêìùêàùêåùêÑùêèùêìùêàùêåùêÑ\\mathbf{PTIME} for function over\nthe reals. The latter extended the result to ùêèùêíùêèùêÄùêÇùêÑùêèùêíùêèùêÄùêÇùêÑ\\mathbf{PSPACE}, defining robust ODEs as in Definition 4. However, those models rely\non discrete ODEs, which are discrete-time and less natural than continuous ODEs.\nWe review all those results in Section 3.2. This paper can be related to  [ref]16: the authors of these articles provided a characterisation\nof ùêèùêìùêàùêåùêÑùêèùêìùêàùêåùêÑ\\mathbf{PTIME} with continuous ODEs, establishing that time complexity corresponds to the length of the involved curve, i.e. the motto time complexity = length. Here, we get a motto of the form space complexity = precision. Some of our constructions have similarities with statements in . In the later paper, the authors introduce various robustness concepts and prove they lead to tractability.\nSee the references in  for similar robustness statements. Robustness can also be associated with a dual motivation: the authors of 9 introduced a concept of robust undecidability, while here we want a concept of robustness leading to tractability. This is not the first time ùêÖùêèùêíùêèùêÄùêÇùêÑùêÖùêèùêíùêèùêÄùêÇùêÑ\\mathbf{FPSPACE} is characterised using continuous ODES. However, the existing characterisation 3  is obtained with complicated conditions on ODEs, while we have a simpler statement, linking complexity to precision in a simple manner. Notice that the latter approach dealt with polynomial ODEs, while we do not restrict to polynomial ODEs. We obtain our statements by revisiting the approach of the latter papers but working over a compact domain and dealing with error correction more finely. Intuitively, this can also be read as being in ùêèùêíùêèùêÄùêÇùêÑùêèùêíùêèùêÄùêÇùêÑ\\mathbf{PSPACE} for an ODE is consistent with having an attractor easily discretisable when there is one. We can also define the\nnotion of robustness, as the insensitivity to ‚Äúsmall\" perturbations. While discussing all these issues, we propose an algebraic characterisation of ùêèùêíùêèùêÄùêÇùêÑùêèùêíùêèùêÄùêÇùêÑ\\mathbf{PSPACE}, using continuous ODEs with the algebra (‚Ñù‚Äã‚ÑÇ‚Äãùîª‚Ñù‚ÑÇùîª\\mathbb{RCD} is for Continuous Robust Differential). Schema robust ODE is formally defined in Definition 1: For a function ùêü:‚Ñùd‚Üí‚Ñùd‚Ä≤:ùêüsuperscript‚Ñùùëë‚Üísuperscript‚Ñùsuperscriptùëë‚Ä≤\\mathbf{f}\\mathrel{\\mathop{\\ordinarycolon}}\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{d^{\\prime}} sending every integer ùêß‚àà‚Ñïdùêßsuperscript‚Ñïùëë{\\mathbf{n}}\\in\\mathbb{N}^{d} to the vicinity of some integer of ‚Ñïdsuperscript‚Ñïùëë\\mathbb{N}^{d}, say at distance less than 1/4141/4, we write DP‚Å°(f)DPùëì\\operatorname{DP}(f) for its discrete part: this is the function from ‚Ñïd‚Üí‚Ñïd‚Ä≤‚Üísuperscript‚Ñïùëësuperscript‚Ñïsuperscriptùëë‚Ä≤\\mathbb{N}^{d}\\to\\mathbb{N}^{d^{\\prime}} mapping ùêß‚àà‚Ñïdùêßsuperscript‚Ñïùëë{\\mathbf{n}}\\in\\mathbb{N}^{d} to the integer rounding of ùêü‚Äã(n)ùêüùëõ\\mathbf{f}(n). For a class ùíûùíû\\mathcal{C} of such functions, we write DP‚Å°(ùíû)DPùíû\\operatorname{DP}(\\mathcal{C}) for the class of the discrete parts of the functions of ùíûùíû\\mathcal{C}.

We also provide a characterisation of functions over the reals computable in polynomial space.

This article is organised as follows.\nIn Section 2, we recall the concept of dynamical systems and discuss some associated complexity issues. We introduce the concept of robust ODE and prove that a robust ODE can be solved in polynomial time (Theorem 4). This is obtained, using an original method for solving ODE, optimising space, inspired by Savitch‚Äôs theorem. This provides one direction of all the above theorems. The other direction is the object of the following sections, starting from Section 3. We first recall some previous results on discrete ODEs in Section 3.\nUsing extensions of constructions from , we then prove that we can simulate a Turing machine using robust continuous ODEs in Section 4. This is obtained by simulating some discrete ODEs using continuous ODEs, dealing with error corrections, and using the fact that the functions are robust to a controlled error. The main result of Section 3 is Theorem 10. It states we can simulate Turing machines robustly with continuous ODEs when space remains polynomial.\nThis theorem leads to the proof of Theorem 1 in Section 4. In Section 5, we prove Theorem 2. In Section 6, we conclude and discuss future works.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: over the reals, the most famous approaches are computable analysis, based on the Turing machine model in  and  and algebraic models such as the Blum Shub Smale (BSS) model of computation [ref]8 .
