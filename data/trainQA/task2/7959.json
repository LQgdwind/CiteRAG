Sound Generation from Text and Video\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets.\nTo ensure a fair comparison with existing baselines, we train both the control prediction module and the adapter in the conditional sound generation module on VGGSound [ref]2.\nVGGSound is a large-scale audiovisual dataset containing approximately 200k video clips of 10-second duration, accompanied by corresponding audio tracks.\nThe dataset covers 309 classes of general sounds, roughly categorizing them into acoustic events, music, and people.\nThe videos are sourced from YouTube, providing a diverse and realistic corpus.\nFor our experiments, we leverage a subset of 160k videos from VGGSound due to the availability of public videos at the time of training.\nSince the VGGSound includes plentiful general sound examples, our method trained on the VGGSound enables general-purpose sound generation for real-world scenarios.\nWe split the train data list into training and validation subsets following SpecVQGAN [ref]18.\nTo evaluate temporal alignment accuracy, we evaluate ReWaS on Greatest Hits  test set including the videos of hitting a drumstick with materials. Since Greatest Hits samples have a distinct audio property compared to the other audio samples, we fine-tune our method on the Greatest Hits training samples.\nTo the best of our knowledge, it is the first proposed evaluation protocol to evaluate the model on both of these datasets. Evaluation protocol.\nIn all experiments, we generate 5 seconds of audio corresponding to the input video clips and text prompt.\nWe use sound class categories as the text prompt.\nWe observe that the existing baselines used different numbers of generated samples and audio sequence time, which could lead to inconsistencies in the evaluation.\nFor a fair comparison, we re-implement all baseline methods to generate one audio sample with 5 seconds from one video in VGGSound dataset, consistent with ReWaS.\nOn the other hand, 2 seconds of generation results are used in Greatest Hits. Baselines.\nWe compare ReWaS against existing video-to-sound generation approaches in priority, SpecVQGAN [ref]18, Im2wav , and Diff-Foley , which are trained on the VGGSound and AudioSet datasets.\nFor a fair comparison, we take the following steps:\nWe first generate the full-length audio by SpecVQGAN and Diff-Foley (10s and 8s, respectively) for the test videos.\nThen, we extract the 5-second clip corresponding to the same video frames used in our method.\nSince Im2wav is designed to generate sound with a fixed length of 4 seconds, we first generate the initial 4 seconds and extend it by generating an additional 1 second, resulting in a 5-second audio clip.\nIn the temporal alignment evaluation,\nwe consider CondFoleyGen [ref]7 as a main baseline, which is trained on the Greatest Hits dataset. Evaluation metrics.\nTo evaluate perceptual quality and diversity, we employ Fréchet distance (FID)  and inception score (IS) .\nIS assesses sample quality and diversity, while FID measures distribution-level similarity.\nWe also report the mean of KL divergence (MKL) [ref]18 for paired samples to evaluate the relevance to the condition.\nFollowing the implementation of SpecVQGAN [ref]18, we use a Melception classifier to report those scores.\nWe also measure the alignment between the generated audio and sound categories with CLAP score  in VGGSound.\nIn the Greatest Hits experiment, we report onset accuracy (Acc) and average precision (AP), following the evaluation protocol introduced by CondFoleyGen [ref]7.\nThe onset of sound events is a discrete signal obtained by the thresholding of the amplitude gradient.\nTherefore, it is challenging to detect onsets in natural sound like VGGSound benchmark.\nTo address this issue, we report the mean absolute error (MAE), following the approach in  , to evaluate the difference energy signal from real and generated sounds for the first time in the sound generation task conditioned on video.\nAlthough these evaluation metrics can evaluate different properties of the generated audio, all of them measure the difference between the generated audio and the “ground truth” audio corresponding to the original video. However, a sound is multimodal information; one video can sound differently (e.g., the voice of a human can vary). Consequently, existing quantitative evaluation metrics have challenges in measuring whether the generated audio is truly suited to the given video. To tackle the issue, we conduct a user study to evaluate the quality of the generated audio samples. More details are explained in the next subsection.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Datasets.\nTo ensure a fair comparison with existing baselines, we train both the control prediction module and the adapter in the conditional sound generation module on VGGSound [ref]2.\nVGGSound is a large-scale audiovisual dataset containing approximately 200k video clips of 10-second duration, accompanied by corresponding audio tracks.\nThe dataset covers 309 classes of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
