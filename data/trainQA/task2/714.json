      "content": "Paper Title: Convolutional Complex Knowledge Graph Embeddings\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA wide range of works have investigated KGE to address various tasks such as type prediction, relation prediction, link prediction, question answering, item recommendation and knowledge graph completion   [ref]26 . We refer to    [ref]16  for recent surveys and give a brief overview of selected KGE techniques. Table 1 shows scoring functions of state-of-the-art KGE models. RESCAL [ref]26 is a bilinear model that computes a three-way factorization of a third-order adjacency tensor representing the input KG. RESCAL captures various types of relations in the input KG but is limited in its scalability as it has quadratic complexity in the factorization rank . DistMult  can be seen as an efficient extension of RESCAL with a diagonal matrix per relation to reduce the complexity of RESCAL [ref]4. DistMult performs poorly on antisymmetric relations while performing well on symmetric relations . Note that through applying the reciprocal data augmentation technique, this incapability of DistMult is alleviated . TuckER [ref]4 performs a Tucker decomposition on the binary tensor representing the input KG, which enables multi-task learning through parameter sharing between different relations via the core tensor. ComplEx  extends DistMult by learning representations in a complex vector space. ComplEx is able to infer both symmetric and antisymmetric relations via a Hermitian inner product of embeddings that involves the conjugate-transpose of one of the two input vectors. ComplEx yields state-of-the-art performance on the link prediction task while leveraging linear space and time complexity of the dot products.\nTrouillon et. al.  showed that ComplEx is equivalent to HolE . Inspired by Euler’s identity, RotatE  employs a rotational model taking predicates as rotations from subjects to objects in complex space via the element-wise Hadamard product [ref]16. RotatE performs well on composition/transitive relations while ComplEx performs poorly . QuatE  extends the complex-valued space into hypercomplex by a quaternion with three imaginary components, where the Hamilton product is used as compositional operator for hypercomplex valued-representations. ConvE  applies a 2D convolution to model the interactions between entities and relations. Through interactions captured by 2D convolution, ConvE yields a state-of-art performance in link prediction. ConvKB extends ConvE by omitting the reshaping operation in the encoding of representations in the convolution operation . Similarly, HypER extends ConvE by applying relation-specific convolution filters as opposed to applying filters from concatenated subject and relation vectors .\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: range of works have investigated KGE to address various tasks such as type prediction, relation prediction, link prediction, question answering, item recommendation and knowledge graph completion   [ref]26 .
