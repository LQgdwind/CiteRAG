      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Depth Completion with Calibrated Backprojection Layers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDepth completion is a form of imputation, which requires regularization that hinges the assumption that ‚Äúnearby points‚Äù should be\nassigned ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù (depth) values. Methods differ in the choice of topology i.e. what points should be considered ‚Äúnearby,‚Äù and how to combine the values of such points to impute the missing depth value. Generic Image-Based Regularization. In image topology, nearby points correspond to adjacent pixels. This is not a good choice, for their depths can be arbitrarily different at occluding boundaries. In image segmentation, the RGB values are used to define a topology to partition the image domain into connected regions of nearby points, putatively corresponding to ‚Äúobjects.‚Äù The topology induced by (color) values can be exploited by minimizing Total Variation (TV  and ‚ÄúColor TV‚Äù ) while trying to reproduce the image itself. We adopt TV as a generic regularizer since the statistics of natural range images are very similar to that of natural (intensity) images , whereby the gradient distribution is highly kurtotic, corresponding to homogeneous smooth regions separated by sharp boundaries. Data-driven Regularization.\n‚ÄúCloseness‚Äù among pixels can be defined not just within the same image, but across different images in the training set. In this case, the regularity criterion is not explicit, but implicit in the inductive bias used for training. Before training starts, the bias is encoded in the training loss (L1superscriptùêø1L^{1} prediction error), the generic regularizers (TV), the training set, and the choice of architecture and optimization. After training is completed, all these biases are burnished in the parameters (weights) of the trained model, which inform the prediction of our depth map and therefore act as a regularizing mechanism. Among data-driven methods for depth completion, many are supervised. Early works cast depth completion as compressive sensing  and as morphological operators . Recent works focused on network operations [ref]9 9 and architectures     to effectively deal with the sparse inputs.  proposed an early fusion architecture while   used late fusion to process each data modality separately. 9 performed joint concatenation and convolution to upsample the sparse depth.  proposed a 2D-3D fusion network while  used a cascade hourglass network.  used a convolutional spatial propagation network and 0 leveraged non-local spatial propagation. Whereas, [ref]9  3 4 learned uncertainty of estimates, 2 leveraged confidence maps, and 2 9  used surface normals for guidance. Like us,  7  proposed light-weight networks suitable for use with SLAM/VIO systems. All of these methods require ground truth for training, which is often unavailable and, when available, prohibitively expensive . Hence, these methods are limited to offline training. But even if ground truth were available online, most of these methods employ complex architectures with many layers and parameters, e.g. 25.84M for 0, 53.4M 2, and 28.99M 9, and thus are not suitable for learning online. Instead, we propose to learn dense depth from the virtually limitless amount of un-annotated images and sparse point clouds via a predictive cross-modal validation criterion. Our proposed architecture only uses 6.9M parameters and our choice of supervision allows us to continuously learn even after the system is deployed. Unsupervised/Self-supervised depth completion assumes stereo images or monocular videos to be available during training. Both stereo 9  and monocular  5 6 7 training paradigms leverage sparse depth reconstruction and photometric reprojection error as a training signal by minimizing photometric discrepancies between the input image and its reconstruction from other views.  used Perspective-n-Point  and RANSAC 2 to align consecutive video frames. However,  does not generalize well to indoor scenes with many textureless surfaces.  learned a depth prior conditioned on the image by pretraining a separate network on ground truth from an additional dataset. As mentioned earlier, this is not scalable; also, using a network trained on a specific domain (e.g. outdoors) as supervision will not generalize (e.g. indoors). Unlike , our method does not require ground truth and is not limited to a specific domain.  5 leverage additional synthetic datasets, which require dealing with sim-to-real; our method is able to achieve the state-of-the-art without needing access to additional data. The challenge of depth completion is precisely the sparsity, which renders convolutions ineffective as the activations of early layers tend to be zeros as well. To obtain a denser representation, early layers must propagate (or densify) the signal. As a result,  9  employed very deep networks with many layers and parameters in order to learn the map from sparse depth and image to dense depth. To handle this problem, 7 approximated the scene with a hand-crafted mesh, but it is not differentiable and prone to errors in regions with very few points or complex structures. 5 proposed spatial pyramid pooling (SPP), but their max pooling layers decimated details on closer objects. Instead, we propose a fully differentiable sparse-to-dense module that learns the trade-off between density and detail to retain both near and far structures. Our work goes counter to the trend of forgoing inductive bias, i.e. learning everything with generic architectures like Transformers 3, including what we already know such as basic Euclidean geometry. Our model has a strong inductive bias in our calibrated backprojection layer, which incorporates the calibration matrix directly into the architecture to yield an RGB representation lifted into scene topology via 3D positional encoding. This may seem futile as we could just add intrinsics to the long list of parameters to be learned 5. However, unlike semantic retrieval, spatial inference requires identifiability: There is one true scene in front of us, and unless information about calibration is available and properly exploited, inference yields one of infinitely many depth maps that are equally good at predicting the next frame in the training set. Since there is no supervision, calibration mediates the relation between the prediction error and the true depth. Because existing methods use calibration in the computation of the loss, which the intrinsics are encoded in the weights, hampering transferability. In our architecture, calibration is an input, which can be changed at inference time. While one could pre-process the images to a canonical calibration, this introduces latency, cost and artifacts that can affect the reconstruction quality. We note that 6 5 proposed backprojection as a layer and 0 used calibration as input, but we are the first to consider an RGB 3D representation for depth completion. Our contributions include (a) a sparse-to-dense module that learns a dense representation of the sparse point cloud, (b) an unsupervised depth completion method that takes calibration information as input to the model, and (c) incorporates it directly in the architecture through a novel calibrated backprojection module, which represents spatial positional encoding that is transferred laterally across different branches of the encoder. The resulting inductive bias helps select, among all depth, maps compatible with the prediction loss, those that result in a Euclidean (calibrated) reconstruction. The strong inductive bias allows us to (d) reduce the computational footprint, increase generalization and achieve performance beyond the state of the art despite having fewer parameters.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: data-driven methods for depth completion, many are supervised.
