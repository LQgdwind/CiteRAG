In addition, some methods   utilize contrastive learning to enhance the global class-level structure by minimizing intra-class distance and maximizing inter-class distance, and others   use memory bank to provide class-level information from the source domain and instance-level information from the target domain for contrastive learning. However, the absence of source data makes these methods cannot be applied directly. Source-free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation.\nSource-free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) aims to adapt the well-trained source model to the target domain without the annotated source data. Some methods focus on generating target-style images  or reconstructing fake source distributions via source model . Another stream of SFUDA methods is exploiting the information provided by the source model. Some methods     only leverage the class-level information from the source model and adapt the source model to the target domain by pseudo-labeling, while the other   only exploit the neighborhood information and encourage the consistent predictions among samples with highly local affinity. Contrastive Learning.\nContrastive learning achieves the promising improvement on unsupervised visual representation learning     0 by learning instance discriminative representations. Although the instance-level contrastive learning has well generalization capability in downstream tasks, it does not perform well on the source-free domain adaptation tasks, which demand correct measurement of inter-class affinities on the unsupervised target domain.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation.\nConventional UDA methods alleviate the domain discrepancy between the source domain and target domain by leveraging the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) [ref]3 to match high-order moments of distributions [ref]40 [ref]37  or by adversarial training to learn domain invariant features  .

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
