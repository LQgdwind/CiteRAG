      "content": "Paper Title: Runtime analysis of a coevolutionary algorithm on impartial combinatorial games\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRather than storing a population as a set of points in the search space, as is the case for most EAs, an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) represents its population as a probability distribution over the search space . Whereas most algorithms sample candidates for selection from their current population uniformly at random, an EDA instead samples from its probability distribution. After selection has been completed, the selected individuals are then used to update the probability distribution for the next generation. Much of the existing runtime analysis for EDAs (see     ) has emphasised the benefit provided by the high level of diversity among generated search points. This is also the case in the recent first runtime analysis of a coevolutionary EDA , wherein the difficulty presented by locally intransitive payoff landscapes could be provably averted by evaluating strategies against a diverse set of opponents generated by an EDA. As intransitivity is also apparent in impartial combinatorial games, a coevolutionary EDA is a good candidate for a first runtime analysis on this topic too. Most existing theoretical analysis of EDAs concerns those operating over bitstrings – that is, {0,1}nsuperscript01𝑛\\{0,1\\}^{n} is the search domain. However, as outlined in Section 2, our formulation of strategies gives rise to a more complicated search domain. For a parent set S𝑆S, we are considering search domains of the form 𝒳=∏i∈ISi𝒳subscriptproduct𝑖𝐼subscript𝑆𝑖\\mathcal{X}=\\prod_{i\\in I}S_{i}, where I𝐼I is an indexing set and Si⊆Ssubscript𝑆𝑖𝑆S_{i}\\subseteq S for each i∈I𝑖𝐼i\\in I. Given a tuple p∈∏i∈I𝒫​(Si)𝑝subscriptproduct𝑖𝐼𝒫subscript𝑆𝑖p\\in\\prod_{i\\in I}\\mathcal{P}(S_{i}), let Univ​(𝒳,p)Univ𝒳𝑝\\text{Univ}(\\mathcal{X},p) denote the probability distribution over 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} such that, if x∼Univ​(𝒳,p)similar-to𝑥Univ𝒳𝑝x\\sim\\text{Univ}(\\mathcal{X},p), then for any y∈𝒳𝑦𝒳y\\in\\mathcal{X}, For notational convenience, given a tuple p∈∏i∈I𝒫​(Si)𝑝subscriptproduct𝑖𝐼𝒫subscript𝑆𝑖p\\in\\prod_{i\\in I}\\mathcal{P}(S_{i}) we will often write for i∈I𝑖𝐼i\\in I and s∈S𝑠𝑆s\\in S, The EDA we consider will represent its current population as an element p∈∏i∈I𝒫​(Si)𝑝subscriptproduct𝑖𝐼𝒫subscript𝑆𝑖p\\in\\prod_{i\\in I}\\mathcal{P}(S_{i}), with individuals being generated according to Univ​(𝒳,p)Univ𝒳𝑝\\text{Univ}(\\mathcal{X},p). In the case where I=[n]𝐼delimited-[]𝑛I=[n] and Si={0,1}subscript𝑆𝑖01S_{i}=\\{0,1\\} for each i∈[n]𝑖delimited-[]𝑛i\\in[n], we recover the standard framework for univariate EDAs operating over bitstrings. For these EDAs, the tuple p∈∏i∈[n]𝒫​({0,1})𝑝subscriptproduct𝑖delimited-[]𝑛𝒫01p\\in\\prod_{i\\in[n]}\\mathcal{P}(\\{0,1\\}) is often represented as a frequency vector (p​(1),…,p​(n))∈[ref]0 n𝑝1…𝑝𝑛superscript01𝑛(p(1),\\ldots,p(n))\\in[ref]0 ^{n}, where p​(i)𝑝𝑖p(i) is the probability that x∼Univ​({0,1}n,p)similar-to𝑥Univsuperscript01𝑛𝑝x\\sim\\text{Univ}(\\{0,1\\}^{n},p) has a 111-bit in position i𝑖i. A common feature for EDAs operating over bitstrings is to constrain these frequencies to the interval [γ,1−γ]𝛾1𝛾[\\gamma,1-\\gamma] for some small γ𝛾\\gamma at the end of each generation. For the general case, where we track a tuple p∈∏i∈I𝒫​(Si)𝑝subscriptproduct𝑖𝐼𝒫subscript𝑆𝑖p\\in\\prod_{i\\in I}\\mathcal{P}(S_{i}), we need to constrain each p​(i)∈𝒫​(Si)𝑝𝑖𝒫subscript𝑆𝑖p(i)\\in\\mathcal{P}(S_{i}) to the set 𝒫γ​(Si)subscript𝒫𝛾subscript𝑆𝑖\\mathcal{P}_{\\gamma}(S_{i}). To achieve this, we adopt the following minor variation of the multi-valued EDA framework proposed by Ben Jedidia, Doerr, and Krejca . Given γ∈[0,1|S|)𝛾01𝑆\\gamma\\in[0,\\textstyle{\\frac{1}{|S|}}) and p∈𝒫​(S)𝑝𝒫𝑆p\\in\\mathcal{P}(S), let so that where (2) follows from (1) using the fact that 1−γ​|S|>01𝛾𝑆01-\\gamma|S|>0. Let πγS:𝒫​(S)→𝒫γ​(S):superscriptsubscript𝜋𝛾𝑆→𝒫𝑆subscript𝒫𝛾𝑆\\pi_{\\gamma}^{S}:\\mathcal{P}(S)\\to\\mathcal{P}_{\\gamma}(S) then be the function given by If p∈𝒫​(S)𝑝𝒫𝑆p\\in\\mathcal{P}(S), then setting S+={s∈S:p​(s)⩾γ}superscript𝑆conditional-set𝑠𝑆𝑝𝑠𝛾S^{+}=\\{s\\in S:p(s)\\geqslant\\gamma\\} and S−=S∖S+superscript𝑆𝑆superscript𝑆S^{-}=S\\setminus S^{+} we have and so πγSsuperscriptsubscript𝜋𝛾𝑆\\pi_{\\gamma}^{S} indeed defines a function 𝒫​(S)→𝒫γ​(S)→𝒫𝑆subscript𝒫𝛾𝑆\\mathcal{P}(S)\\to\\mathcal{P}_{\\gamma}(S). It is not difficult to deduce that if p​(s)⩾γ𝑝𝑠𝛾p(s)\\geqslant\\gamma, then (1−γ​|S|)​p​(s)⩽πγS​(p)​(s)⩽p​(s)1𝛾𝑆𝑝𝑠superscriptsubscript𝜋𝛾𝑆𝑝𝑠𝑝𝑠(1-\\gamma|S|)p(s)\\leqslant\\pi_{\\gamma}^{S}(p)(s)\\leqslant p(s). For the case |S|=2𝑆2|S|=2 we obtain and so this model fits the usual method for constraining univariate EDAs over bitstrings. (Despite some differences in notation, the function πγSsuperscriptsubscript𝜋𝛾𝑆\\pi_{\\gamma}^{S} is nearly identical the restriction described in . In the context of [1, Section 4.2], our only modification is to forego an initial clamping of probabilities to the interval [γ,1−(|S|−1)​γ]𝛾1𝑆1𝛾[\\gamma,1-(|S|-1)\\gamma], as the upper border of 1−(|S|−1)​γ1𝑆1𝛾1-(|S|-1)\\gamma is already implied by the fact that the remaining steps produce an element of 𝒫γ​(S)subscript𝒫𝛾𝑆\\mathcal{P}_{\\gamma}(S). Indeed, an actual difference between the two methods only arises for inputs p𝑝p satisfying maxs∈S⁡p​(s)>1−(|S|−1)​γsubscript𝑠𝑆𝑝𝑠1𝑆1𝛾\\max_{s\\in S}p(s)>1-(|S|-1)\\gamma, and even in such cases the difference is not significant.) We next collect some simple properties of πγSsuperscriptsubscript𝜋𝛾𝑆\\pi_{\\gamma}^{S} that will be useful in the proofs later. If p​(s)⩾γ𝑝𝑠𝛾p(s)\\geqslant\\gamma, then (1−βγ−​(p)1−γ​|S|)​p​(s)⩽πγS​(p)​(s)⩽p​(s)1superscriptsubscript𝛽𝛾𝑝1𝛾𝑆𝑝𝑠superscriptsubscript𝜋𝛾𝑆𝑝𝑠𝑝𝑠\\left(1-\\textstyle{\\frac{\\beta_{\\gamma}^{-}(p)}{1-\\gamma|S|}}\\right)p(s)\\leqslant\\pi_{\\gamma}^{S}(p)(s)\\leqslant p(s). For any Si⊆Ssubscript𝑆𝑖𝑆S_{i}\\subseteq S, p∈𝒫​(Si)𝑝𝒫subscript𝑆𝑖p\\in\\mathcal{P}(S_{i}) and s∈S𝑠𝑆s\\in S, πγSi​(p)​(s)⩽max⁡{γ,p​(s)}superscriptsubscript𝜋𝛾subscript𝑆𝑖𝑝𝑠𝛾𝑝𝑠\\pi_{\\gamma}^{S_{i}}(p)(s)\\leqslant\\max{\\{\\gamma,p(s)\\}}. For any Si,A⊆Ssubscript𝑆𝑖𝐴𝑆S_{i},A\\subseteq S and p∈𝒫​(Si)𝑝𝒫subscript𝑆𝑖p\\in\\mathcal{P}(S_{i}), πγSi​(p)​(A)⩽p​(A)+γ​|Si|superscriptsubscript𝜋𝛾subscript𝑆𝑖𝑝𝐴𝑝𝐴𝛾subscript𝑆𝑖\\pi_{\\gamma}^{S_{i}}(p)(A)\\leqslant p(A)+\\gamma|S_{i}|. B1: If p​(s)⩾γ𝑝𝑠𝛾p(s)\\geqslant\\gamma, then by setting α=βγ−​(p)/βγ+​(p)𝛼superscriptsubscript𝛽𝛾𝑝superscriptsubscript𝛽𝛾𝑝\\alpha=\\beta_{\\gamma}^{-}(p)/\\beta_{\\gamma}^{+}(p), and so B1 holds. B2: If p​(s)⩽γ𝑝𝑠𝛾p(s)\\leqslant\\gamma then πγSi​(p)​(s)⩽γ=max⁡{γ,p​(s)}superscriptsubscript𝜋𝛾subscript𝑆𝑖𝑝𝑠𝛾𝛾𝑝𝑠\\pi_{\\gamma}^{S_{i}}(p)(s)\\leqslant\\gamma=\\max{\\{\\gamma,p(s)\\}}. On the hand, if p​(s)⩾γ𝑝𝑠𝛾p(s)\\geqslant\\gamma, then B1 implies that πγSi​(p)⩽p​(s)=max⁡{γ,p​(s)}superscriptsubscript𝜋𝛾subscript𝑆𝑖𝑝𝑝𝑠𝛾𝑝𝑠\\pi_{\\gamma}^{S_{i}}(p)\\leqslant p(s)=\\max{\\{\\gamma,p(s)\\}}. In either case, B2 holds. B3: We can compute as required.\n∎ A description of the algorithm we analyse is now provided by Algorithm 1, which effectively generalises the version appearing in  (which applied only to bitstrings and omitted the step involving πγSisuperscriptsubscript𝜋𝛾subscript𝑆𝑖\\pi_{\\gamma}^{S_{i}}). Note that due to the use of πγSisuperscriptsubscript𝜋𝛾subscript𝑆𝑖\\pi_{\\gamma}^{S_{i}} in line 23, we always have pt∈∏i∈I𝒫γ​(Si)subscript𝑝𝑡subscriptproduct𝑖𝐼subscript𝒫𝛾subscript𝑆𝑖p_{t}\\in\\prod_{i\\in I}\\mathcal{P}_{\\gamma}(S_{i}). A key step towards analysing the performance of Algorithm 1 on impartial combinatorial games is understanding the distribution of a selected individual Pt+1​(j)subscript𝑃𝑡1𝑗P_{t+1}(j). This will be handled by the following lemma. Its conclusion gives an exact expression for how the probability a selected individual would choose to move from u𝑢u to v𝑣v compares to the probability a sampled individual would choose to move from u𝑢u to v𝑣v (where a selected individual is simply the winner of a game played between two independent sampled individuals). Let G𝐺G be an impartial combinatorial game, and let p∈∏v∈Int​(G)𝒫​(F​(v))𝑝subscriptproduct𝑣Int𝐺𝒫𝐹𝑣p\\in\\prod_{v\\in\\text{\\emph{Int}}(G)}\\mathcal{P}(F(v)). Suppose that x,y∼Univ​(𝒳G,p)similar-to𝑥𝑦Univsubscript𝒳𝐺𝑝x,y\\sim\\text{\\emph{Univ}}(\\mathcal{X}_{G},p) are independent, and Then, for any u∈V𝑢𝑉u\\in V and v∈F​(u)𝑣𝐹𝑢v\\in F(u), For an intuition behind (3), the comparative factor has effectively three terms (here interpreted in the context of Algorithm 1): ℙ​(u∈PathG​(x,y))ℙ𝑢subscriptPath𝐺𝑥𝑦\\mathbb{P}(u\\in\\text{{Path}}_{G}(x,y)), the probability the algorithm encounters position u𝑢u; ℙ​(fGu​(x,y)=1)ℙsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝐺𝑢𝑥𝑦1\\mathbb{P}(f_{G}^{u}(x,y)=1), the probability that u𝑢u is observed as a winning position; and 1−ℙ​(fGv​(x,y)=1)1ℙsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝐺𝑣𝑥𝑦11-\\mathbb{P}(f_{G}^{v}(x,y)=1), the probability that v𝑣v is observed as a losing position. If it is likely for v𝑣v to be observed as a losing position, but unlikely for u𝑢u to be observed as a winning position, then it is beneficial to deliberately move from u𝑢u to v𝑣v (placing your opponent in a likely losing position) rather than play out with whatever the current strategy is from u𝑢u (where you are unlikely to win), thus incurring an increase in the prevalence of z​(u)=v𝑧𝑢𝑣z(u)=v among selected individuals. On the other hand, if the reverse is true, then it is beneficial to deliberately avoid moving from u𝑢u to v𝑣v and instead play out normally, thus incurring a decrease in prevalence of z​(u)=v𝑧𝑢𝑣z(u)=v. This helps motivate the effect of the term 1−ℙ​(fGv​(x,y)=1)−ℙ​(fGu​(x,y)=1)1ℙsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝐺𝑣𝑥𝑦1ℙsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝐺𝑢𝑥𝑦11-\\mathbb{P}(f_{G}^{v}(x,y)=1)-\\mathbb{P}(f_{G}^{u}(x,y)=1). The magnitude of this effect scales with the relative frequency with which u𝑢u is encountered as a game position, which corresponds to ℙ​(u∈PathG​(x,y))ℙ𝑢subscriptPath𝐺𝑥𝑦\\mathbb{P}(u\\in\\text{{Path}}_{G}(x,y)). First, we will introduce some notation to assist with this proof. Let us write r=ℙ​(u∈PathG​(x,y))𝑟ℙ𝑢subscriptPath𝐺𝑥𝑦r=\\mathbb{P}(u\\in\\text{Path}_{G}(x,y)), su=ℙ​(fGu​(x,y)=1)subscript𝑠𝑢ℙsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝐺𝑢𝑥𝑦1s_{u}=\\mathbb{P}(f_{G}^{u}(x,y)=1), and sv=ℙ​(fGv​(x,y)=1)subscript𝑠𝑣ℙsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝐺𝑣𝑥𝑦1s_{v}=\\mathbb{P}(f_{G}^{v}(x,y)=1). Let us also write and note that A𝐴A, B𝐵B, and {u}𝑢\\{u\\} are pairwise disjoint sets. Finally, if we have Path​(x,y)=v0​v1​…​vℓPath𝑥𝑦subscript𝑣0subscript𝑣1…subscript𝑣ℓ\\text{Path}(x,y)=v_{0}v_{1}\\ldots v_{\\ell} when regarded as a directed path (where here and throughout we drop the subscript from PathGsubscriptPath𝐺\\text{Path}_{G} to simplify notation), then we will define Note that because Path​(x,y)Path𝑥𝑦\\text{Path}(x,y) is the disjoint union of Path1​(x,y)superscriptPath1𝑥𝑦\\text{Path}^{1}(x,y) and Path2​(x,y)superscriptPath2𝑥𝑦\\text{Path}^{2}(x,y), we have The event z​(u)=v𝑧𝑢𝑣z(u)=v can be written as the disjoint union of the following six events. Let us examine the probability of each of these events occurring. For E1subscript𝐸1E_{1}, the event u∉Path​(x,y)∧fG​(x,y)=1𝑢Path𝑥𝑦subscript𝑓𝐺𝑥𝑦1u\\notin\\text{Path}(x,y)\\wedge f_{G}(x,y)=1 can be determined using only (x​(w))w≠usubscript𝑥𝑤𝑤𝑢(x(w))_{w\\neq u} and (y​(w))w≠usubscript𝑦𝑤𝑤𝑢(y(w))_{w\\neq u}, and so is independent of the event x​(u)=v𝑥𝑢𝑣x(u)=v. Similarly, in E2subscript𝐸2E_{2} the event u∉Path​(x,y)∧fG​(x,y)=−1𝑢Path𝑥𝑦subscript𝑓𝐺𝑥𝑦1u\\notin\\text{Path}(x,y)\\wedge f_{G}(x,y)=-1 is independent of the event y​(u)=v𝑦𝑢𝑣y(u)=v. Therefore, For E3subscript𝐸3E_{3}, the event u∈Path1​(x,y)𝑢superscriptPath1𝑥𝑦u\\in\\text{Path}^{1}(x,y) can be determined using only (x​(w))w∈Asubscript𝑥𝑤𝑤𝐴(x(w))_{w\\in A} and (y​(w))w∈Asubscript𝑦𝑤𝑤𝐴(y(w))_{w\\in A}, and the event fGv​(x,y)=1superscriptsubscript𝑓𝐺𝑣𝑥𝑦1f_{G}^{v}(x,y)=1 can be determined using only (x​(w))w∈Bsubscript𝑥𝑤𝑤𝐵(x(w))_{w\\in B} and (y​(w))w∈Bsubscript𝑦𝑤𝑤𝐵(y(w))_{w\\in B}. Therefore, all three component events in E3subscript𝐸3E_{3} are independent of each other. The same is also true of E5subscript𝐸5E_{5}. Therefore, noting that ℙ​(fGv​(x,y)=−1)=ℙ​(fGv​(y,x)=−1)ℙsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝐺𝑣𝑥𝑦1ℙsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝐺𝑣𝑦𝑥1\\mathbb{P}(f_{G}^{v}(x,y)=-1)=\\mathbb{P}(f_{G}^{v}(y,x)=-1), we can write For E4subscript𝐸4E_{4}, the event u∈Path1​(x,y)𝑢superscriptPath1𝑥𝑦u\\in\\text{Path}^{1}(x,y) can be determined using only (x​(w))w∈Asubscript𝑥𝑤𝑤𝐴(x(w))_{w\\in A} and (y​(w))w∈Asubscript𝑦𝑤𝑤𝐴(y(w))_{w\\in A}, and the event fGu​(x,y)=−1superscriptsubscript𝑓𝐺𝑢𝑥𝑦1f_{G}^{u}(x,y)=-1 can be determined using only (x​(w))w∈{u}∪Bsubscript𝑥𝑤𝑤𝑢𝐵(x(w))_{w\\in\\{u\\}\\cup B} and (y​(w))w∈Bsubscript𝑦𝑤𝑤𝐵(y(w))_{w\\in B}. Therefore, all three component events in E4subscript𝐸4E_{4} are independent of each other. The same is also true of E6subscript𝐸6E_{6}. Therefore, noting that ℙ​(fGu​(x,y)=−1)=ℙ​(fGu​(y,x)=−1)ℙsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝐺𝑢𝑥𝑦1ℙsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝐺𝑢𝑦𝑥1\\mathbb{P}(f_{G}^{u}(x,y)=-1)=\\mathbb{P}(f_{G}^{u}(y,x)=-1), we can write We can now combine these observations to obtain as required.\n∎ As an aside, we note here a parallel with evolutionary game theory. Consider the discrete time replicator equation with nonlinear payoff functions (see (2.1) of ; also  for the more standard continuous and linear versions), where we interpret qisubscript𝑞𝑖q_{i} as the proportion of type i𝑖i in a population and aisubscript𝑎𝑖a_{i} as the fitness of a type i𝑖i individual. If u𝑢u is fixed, then by enumerating F​(u)={v1,…,vk}𝐹𝑢subscript𝑣1…subscript𝑣𝑘F(u)=\\{v_{1},\\ldots,v_{k}\\}, identifying qi=p​(u,vi)subscript𝑞𝑖𝑝𝑢subscript𝑣𝑖q_{i}=p(u,v_{i}) and ai=ℙ​(u∈PathG​(u,vi))⋅(1−ℙ​(fGvi​(x,y)=1))subscript𝑎𝑖⋅ℙ𝑢subscriptPath𝐺𝑢subscript𝑣𝑖1ℙsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝐺subscript𝑣𝑖𝑥𝑦1a_{i}=\\mathbb{P}(u\\in\\text{Path}_{G}(u,v_{i}))\\cdot(1-\\mathbb{P}(f_{G}^{v_{i}}(x,y)=1)), and applying the identity then (3) can be seen to be of the form provided by (8). In this sense, in an application of Algorithm 1 to a game G𝐺G, the evolution of the distribution p​(u,⋅)𝑝𝑢⋅p(u,\\,\\cdot\\,) at each vertex u𝑢u of G𝐺G stochastically emulates these replicator dynamics. (However, a key difference is that in standard evolutionary game theory, each fitness function ai:=ai​(q1,…,qk)assignsubscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑞1…subscript𝑞𝑘a_{i}:=a_{i}(q_{1},\\ldots,q_{k}) typically depends only on the distribution of types in the population; whereas the expression ai=ℙ​(u∈PathG​(u,vi))⋅(1−ℙ​(fGvi​(x,y)=1))subscript𝑎𝑖⋅ℙ𝑢subscriptPath𝐺𝑢subscript𝑣𝑖1ℙsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝐺subscript𝑣𝑖𝑥𝑦1a_{i}=\\mathbb{P}(u\\in\\text{Path}_{G}(u,v_{i}))\\cdot(1-\\mathbb{P}(f_{G}^{v_{i}}(x,y)=1)) depends on the distribution of ‘types’ not just at the node u𝑢u, but also at possibly all other nodes as well, and so the dynamics of each node cannot be considered in isolation.)\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: over bitstrings.
