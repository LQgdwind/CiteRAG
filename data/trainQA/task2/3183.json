      "content": "Paper Title: Fast and scalable neuroevolution deep learning architecture search for multivariate anomaly detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nModern cyberphysical and failure prediction systems involve sophisticated equipment that records MultiVariate Time-Series data from several up to thousands of features. Such systems need to be continuously monitored to prevent expensive failures. In anomaly detection, it is common to have abundant availability of normal data deriving from sensor monitoring, and scarcity of labeled anomalies. For this reason, most anomaly detection works focus on semi-supervised learning settings, where model training is conducted exclusively using normal data , , as well as unsupervised learning settings, where training data is mostly normal but may contain a small number of unknown anomalies . Within deep learning methods, a wide spectrum of autoencoder-based approaches were designed to deal with the anomaly detection problem. The most efficient are those based on convolutional, fully connected, and LSTM layers, or a combination of them in single model. Alternative methods are based on adversarial techniques [ref]4 as well as variational autoencoders [ref]5\nOther recent and very promising trends include autoencoders based on Graph Neural Networks , GAN-based architectures , supervised classification models  and ensemble autoencoders . In this context, one important problem is the identification of a suitable and optimized architecture for a given dataset, in a fully automated way.\nNeuroevolution is a form of artificial intelligence that uses evolutionary approaches to find efficient neural networks. The most popular forms of neuroevolution algorithms are NEAT , HyperNEAT  and coDeepNEAT . The presented approach is an enhancement and improvement of the work in [ref]1. The approach presented in [ref]1 consists of two populations. The first is the modelâ€™s population from which single model is evolved by genetic operators. The second is the subgroup population, which is needed to form the subsets of sensors. Finally, the algorithm sets up the ensemble model from optimised architectures based on the bagging technique. The fitness during the search is the sum of F1 scores from the training dataset and from the random reduced validation dataset.\nThis work presents improvements for presented multi-level neuroevolution. The one novelty of the proposed enhancements is that the subgroup models in each ensemble solution can be evolved independently. The next enhancement is fast non gradient fine-tuning of the learnt network topology. In previous work the subgroup search was run on initial base models to form optimal subgroups with subset of sensors and then the evolution of the model was run. The sub-models in single ensemble solution were all the same during the search process. The modified protocol presented in this work allows the inclusion of different models in single ensemble architecture.\nThe case study upon which the presented approach is tested is multivariate anomaly detection. The base deep learning models are those which achieve the best results on well-known anomaly detection benchmarks. These are mainly autoencoders based on LSTM layers, convolutional or fully connected sequence of layers. These can have a wide variety of enhancements and form variational, denoise, adversarial autoencoders or by a discriminator as an additional verification module be a GAN-based autoencoder.\nThe work shows that the described improved multi-level neuroevolution search can learn deep ensemble autoencoders that can outperform all existing solutions including graph neural networks and GAN-based autoencoders. The main contributions of our work can be summarized in the following: A novel multi-level neuroevolution approach with a separate population of models for each subspace of features, which can be evolved independently, leading to a a better adaptation of specific models to each subspace. A novel selection process for models evolution based on an adapted distance measure for deep autoencoders that promotes model diversity.\n A fast non gradient-based fine-tuning approach for the evolved model architecture, leveraging adaptations of neural network weights in the evolution process, which improves results achieved by the previous steps.\n Automatic induction of a regularized ensemble model with a low number of sub-models, which further improves anomaly detection performance. An extensive evaluation with benchmark datasets that are widely adopted for multivariate anomaly detection. The paper is organised as follows. The second section describes related works. The third section presents the neuroevolution approach with the main improvements. The next section concerns learnt models and results. Finally, the conclusions and future works are formulated.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: problem.
