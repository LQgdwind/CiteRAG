      "content": "Paper Title: Computation-efficient Deep Learning for Computer Vision: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA wide range of knowledge distillation methods has been extensively employed in vision applications. Initially, most knowledge distillation methods were developed for image classification      and later extended to other vision tasks, including face recognition  , action recognition  , object detection   , semantic segmentation    , depth estimation      , image retrieval  , video captioning   , and video classification  , among others. Despite the significant practical success, relatively few works have focused on the theoretical or empirical understanding of knowledge distillation [ref]403 [ref]404 [ref]405 . Hinton et al.  suggest that the success of KD could be attributed to learning similarities between categories. Yuan et al. [ref]403 posited that dark knowledge not only encompasses category similarities but also imposes regularization on student training. They indicate that KD is a learned label smoothing regularization (LSR). Tang et al. [ref]404 propose approach where, in addition to regularization and class relationships, another type of knowledge, instance-specific knowledge, is also used by the teacher to rescale the student model’s per-instance gradients. Chen et al. [ref]405 quantify the extraction of visual concepts from the intermediate layers of a deep learning model to explain knowledge distillation. Wang et al.  connect KD with the information bottleneck and empirically validate that preserving more mutual information between feature representation and input is more important than improving the teacher model’s accuracy. Overall, theoretical research remains limited compared to the diverse and numerous applications.\n\nReference markers found: [403]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]403: , and video classification  , among others.
