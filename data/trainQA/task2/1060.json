      "content": "Paper Title: Provenance Graph Kernel\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nProvenance\nis a form of knowledge graph providing an account of the actions a system performs, describing the data involved and the processes carried out over those data.\nMore specifically, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) defines provenance as a record that describes the people, institutions, entities, and activities involved in producing, influencing, or delivering a piece of data or a thing in the world .\nProvenance is increasingly being captured in a variety of application domains, from scientific workflows¬†  supporting their reproducibility, to climate science¬†, and human-agent teams in disaster response¬†[ref]5.\nHowever, simultaneously, users are being confronted with an increasing volume of provenance data, especially from automated systems, making it a challenge to extract meaning and significance.\nIn this paper, we are interested in the comparison of provenance graphs leading to their classification according to their similarities, with means to procedurally extract explanations for a given classification decision. Similarities between graphs have been often studied in the context of graph classification and detection of malicious activity, with a plethora of different methods being proposed to that end (for recent surveys on graph kernels, see¬†[ref]6, [ref]7, and¬†).\nSuch methods explore graph properties using concepts such as shortest paths between nodes¬†, sub-trees¬†0 1, or random walks¬†2, to mention just a few.\nIn many cases, the graphs being analysed may have continuous or categorical labels for their nodes or edges, but little attention has been given to developing a graph kernel that considers both edge and node categorical labels.\nA well-known family of graphs that can benefit from such a kernel method is the one of provenance graphs. To that end, and inspired by the expressiveness of edge and node labels in provenance graphs conditioned to their distance to a given root node, we introduce a graph kernel method that not only captures provenance graph patterns efficiently, but is explainable, i.e., can be used to help generate explanations of decisions based on them.\nTo extract features from such graphs, our method makes use of the notion of provenance types.\nIntuitively, provenance types are a simplification of tree-patterns of a given depth 0‚Äãp‚Äãt0ùëùùë°0pt rooted at a given node. It captures the set of edge-labels occurring at each layer of these tree-patterns, giving an unpolished indication of the node‚Äôs past history. Types also take in account the labels of nodes at the leaves of such tree-patterns. For each graph, a feature vector is created: it counts the occurrence of each provenance type encountered in this graph for tree-patterns up to a given depth.\nWe show that the computational complexity of inferring types up to depth 0‚Äãp‚Äãt0ùëùùë°0pt of nodes in a graph with mùëöm edges is bounded by ùí™‚Äã(0‚Äãp‚Äãt2‚Äãm)ùí™0ùëùsuperscriptùë°2ùëö\\mathcal{O}(0pt^{2}m). We employ provenance kernels in classifying provenance graphs in six different data sets from three application domains.\nWe compare the performance of provenance kernels against that of existing graph kernels in those classification tasks, showing that provenance kernels are competitive in terms of accuracy and at the same time as being fast in terms of execution times.\nCompared to Provenance Network Analytics (PNA)¬†3, a provenance-specific graph classification method, provenance kernels outperform it both in terms of accuracy and computation time. Furthermore, provenance types employed by provenance kernels (to represent features of provenance graphs) are shown to enable users to gain insights into why a classification was made.\nWe present an example of how the importance of each provenance type can be inferred from a trained classifier using LIME¬†4, identifying the most influential types with respect to a particular classification task.\nFor each identified provenance type, a verbal description can be generated computationally to facilitate the explaining of a classification decision. In summary, the contribution of this paper is twofold: The definition, implementation, and evaluation of a novel graph kernel method, i.e.¬†provenance kernels, which are shown to perform well in classifying provenance graphs when compared to standard graph kernels and the PNA method. Illustrating how provenance types can help improve the explainability of classification models built with provenance kernels. In the remainder of the paper, Section¬†2 introduces provenance kernels, including an efficient algorithm to infer feature vectors from input graphs to be used for their classification.\nThe related work is then discussed in Section¬†3 with a comparison of the theoretical computational complexity between provenance kernels and existing graph kernels.\nSection¬†4 presents the empirical evaluation of provenance kernels in six classification tasks in comparison with generic graph kernels and the PNA method.\nSection¬†5 then discusses the use of provenance types in conjunction with LIME to explain classification decisions.\nFinally, Section¬†6 concludes the paper and outlines the future work.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: is increasingly being captured in a variety of application domains, from scientific workflows¬†  supporting their reproducibility, to climate science¬†, and human-agent teams in disaster response¬†[ref]5.\nHowever, simultaneously, users are being confronted with an increasing volume of provenance data, especially from automated systems, making it a challenge to extract meaning and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
