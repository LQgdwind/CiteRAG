      "content": "Paper Title: A Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Energy Efficient Federated Learning in Wireless Communication Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTwo different types of wireless communication network environments are considered in all performed experiments, in order to showcase the robustness of our proposed approach, namely a static and a dynamic network environment. Both environments are comprised of one coordinator and up to 20 (|𝒦|≤20𝒦20|\\mathcal{K}|\\leq 20) heterogeneous (in terms of computational and communication capabilities) workers. Static Environment Setup:\nIn the static environment the 20%percent2020\\% of all workers are of reduced capabilities and are considered as low-end devices, while the rest are considered as high-end. Intuitively, the lower the resource capabilities of a worker the lower the carbon footprint and vice versa. Each low-end device i𝑖i, operates with a maximum available computational capacity equal to fim​a​x=1superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑥1f_{i}^{max}=1 GHz, with a total number of FLOPs per cycle equal to ci=4subscript𝑐𝑖4c_{i}=4 [ref]20 and a maximum transmission power equal to pim​a​x=28superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑥28p_{i}^{max}=28 dBm. In the same notion, the available computational capacity of each high-end device j𝑗j is up to fjm​a​x=3superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑗𝑚𝑎𝑥3f_{j}^{max}=3 GHz with a total number of FLOPs per cycle equal to cj=2subscript𝑐𝑗2c_{j}=2 and a transmission power up to pjm​a​x=33superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑗𝑚𝑎𝑥33p_{j}^{max}=33 dBm. The effective switched capacitance is fixed for all workers and equal to ςk=10−28subscript𝜍𝑘superscript1028\\varsigma_{k}=10^{-28} Watt/Hz3 . We consider non mobile workers and as such all channel gains can be considered as constant. The channel gain is modeled as gk,n=127+30​l​o​g10​(dk,n)subscript𝑔𝑘𝑛12730𝑙𝑜subscript𝑔10subscript𝑑𝑘𝑛g_{k,n}=127+30log_{10}(d_{k,n}), where dk,nsubscript𝑑𝑘𝑛d_{k,n} is the distance of worker k𝑘k from the coordinator, with white Gaussian noise power spectral density N0=−158subscript𝑁0158N_{0}=-158 dBm/Hz. The distance dksubscript𝑑𝑘d_{k} of each worker is fixed and randomly selected in the range of    m. All workers are assigned with a fixed bandwidth that is equal to bk,n=20subscript𝑏𝑘𝑛20b_{k,n}=20 MHz, ∀k∈𝒦for-all𝑘𝒦\\forall{k}\\in\\mathcal{K} and ∀nfor-all𝑛\\forall{n}. Dynamic Environment Setup: In the dynamic environment, in each RL episode, the percentage of low-end devices varies and follows a truncated normal distribution  in the range   % 𝒩±(μ,μ−,μ+,σ2)plus-or-minus𝒩𝜇superscript𝜇superscript𝜇superscript𝜎2\\mathcal{N}\\pm(\\mu,\\mu^{-},\\mu^{+},\\sigma^{2}), where (μ,μ−,μ+,σ)=(15,−12.5,37.5,12)𝜇superscript𝜇superscript𝜇𝜎1512.537.512(\\mu,\\mu^{-},\\mu^{+},\\sigma)=(15,-12.5,37.5,12). Due to resource contention, the availability of computational resources at workers for the FL training task can vary over time . The maximum available computational and communication capacity of the low-end devices is uniformly selected in the range fi,nm​a​x∈ superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑚𝑎𝑥13f_{i,n}^{max}\\in  GHz and pi,nm​a​x∈ superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑖𝑛𝑚𝑎𝑥2328p_{i,n}^{max}\\in  dBm. In the same notion, the resources of the high-end devices are selected in the range fj,nm​a​x∈[3.2,5]superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑗𝑛𝑚𝑎𝑥3.25f_{j,n}^{max}\\in[3.2,5] GHz, and pj,nm​a​x∈ 3superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑗𝑛𝑚𝑎𝑥2933p_{j,n}^{max}\\in 3 dBm, respectively. Mobile workers are also considered in this environment, where the dk,nsubscript𝑑𝑘𝑛d_{k,n} of each worker dynamically changes in the range    m. The allocated bandwidth of each worker also dynamically and uniformly changes in the range bk,n∈ [ref]20subscript𝑏𝑘𝑛520b_{k,n}\\in [ref]20 MHz.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: i𝑖i, operates with a maximum available computational capacity equal to fim​a​x=1superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑥1f_{i}^{max}=1 GHz, with a total number of FLOPs per cycle equal to ci=4subscript𝑐𝑖4c_{i}=4 [ref]20 and a maximum transmission power equal to pim​a​x=28superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑥28p_{i}^{max}=28 dBm.
