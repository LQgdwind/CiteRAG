Our aim is to remove control input peaks otherwise caused by impact-induced velocity jumps, while accurately tracking the time-invariant velocity vector fields that prescribe the motions.\nThis paper builds on preliminary work on the framework of time-invariant RS in [ref]33  and is a direct extension of . Time-invariant RS uses overlapping ante- and post-impact velocity reference fields that are coupled via the impact dynamics, together with a suitable control structure with an ante-impact, interim and post-impact control mode. This work shows for the first time an experimental validation of time-invariant RS, demonstrating our approach using a robotic dual 7 degree of freedom (DOF) arm setup for a hit-and-push and a dual-arm grabbing use cases. While [ref]33 and  did include a numerical validation using simulations on a planar use cases, no experimental validation was performed in these works. We also demonstrate for the first time that we can reliably use an impact map obtained through a nonsmooth physics engine in this time-invariant RS approach to couple ante- and post-impact velocity reference fields, building on the work of  that experimentally validated the use of nonsmooth simulations to build an impact map. The approach of  did present a similar simulation-based approach using Matlab simulations to evaluate the impact map, which lacked the scalability of simulations using an established physics engine, while the smooth contact model that was used requires knowledge on contact stiffness and damping parameters that are difficult to obtain.\nLastly, the control approach from [ref]33  is modified to be effective in a real-life setting, in particular through the definition of a novel interim-impact mode, which is active when contact is only partially established. The interim-impact mode defined in [ref]33  uses knowledge about the moment when the impact sequence is finished, which is not available in an experimental setting. This work therefore defines a novel interim mode that builds on ideas of [ref]33  by generating a position feedback signal based on the velocity field references, but is also effective in an experimental setting.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: velocity jumps, while accurately tracking the time-invariant velocity vector fields that prescribe the motions.\nThis paper builds on preliminary work on the framework of time-invariant RS in [ref]33  and is a direct extension of .
