Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

Micallef et al.  present techniques to optimize parameter settings for scatterplots like size and opacity to automatically improve the visual results.\nContours have been applied in a variety of approaches to represent set relationships in scatterplots to improve perception and to lower cognitive load    [ref]37. Bubble Sets  employ density estimates and contour lines to determine outlines for a set. Butterfly Plots  use convex hulls and refined convex hulls to enclose data points of the same class. Alpha Shapes, as used in our technique, were previously used by Joia et al.  to highlight 2D clusters. Simonetto et al.  start with a planar graph connecting the points of a set for which a geometric hull is computed. From a theoretical perspective, this approach is similar to ours, though we assume more data points per set, which allows us to go for geometry directly generated through a triangulation. Mayorga and Gleicher [ref]37 present Splatterplots that combine density plots with contours to solve the overplotting problem for large numbers of points and at the same time be agnostic to outliers. This approach is conceptually very similar to ours and inspired the presented rangesets. Challenges that we wanted to further improve are locally non-uniform density and cognitive load. A more detailed discussion is given in Sect. 3.1.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Scatterplot visualization and the treatment of its challenges like overplotting and clutter have been researched in their own right [ref]4.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
