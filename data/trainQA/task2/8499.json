Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: CoCoGaussian: Leveraging Circle of Confusion for Gaussian Splatting from Defocused Images\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n3D scene representation for novel view synthesis has advanced significantly with the advent of neural radiance fields (NeRF) [ref]20, a ray tracing-based volumetric rendering method that generates photo-realistic novel view images from multi-view images. However, as an implicit representation method using deep MLPs, NeRF suffers from slow training and rendering speeds. To address this limitation, explicit representation methods such as Plenoxel , TensoRF , and Instant-NGP [ref]21 have been introduced. More recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [ref]9, a rasterization-based method, has emerged as an alternative to ray tracing, significantly mitigating the speed and memory efficiency constraints of ray tracing-based approaches. NeRF and 3DGS has enabled a wide range of related research, including dynamic scene representation     3 , human avatars 9  , 3D mesh reconstruction 6 5  2, 3D scene representation from sparse-view images   4 , and 3D scene representation from blurry images    7   6   . In this paper, we propose a method for 3D scene representation from defocused images by exploiting 3DGS.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: 3D scene representation for novel view synthesis has advanced significantly with the advent of neural radiance fields (NeRF) [ref]20, a ray tracing-based volumetric rendering method that generates photo-realistic novel view images from multi-view images.
