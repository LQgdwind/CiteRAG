      "content": "Paper Title: Formalizing Integration Patterns with Multimedia Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRitter et al.  showed that, for structured data, the only existing formalization of integration patterns was studied by Fahland et al.  using CPNs, and that was further extended to cover a wider range of integration patterns with more refined requirements in  using (timed) DB-nets.\nHowever, when considering multimedia integration patterns (cf. ), as briefly introduced in Sect. II, these works cannot be used directly (cf. requirements in Tab. II), due to their lack of multimedia data operations (cf. REQ1(a)), semantic operations (cf. REQ-1(b)), and partially their storage (cf. REQ-1(c)).\nTo the best of our knowledge, there have been no attempts to formalize multimedia integration patterns (cf. ). Formalisms for integration patterns. Although the scenario in Ex. 1 is captured in BPMN , this modeling language is not suitable for our requirements (especially REQs-1(a–c), 2).\nYet, BPMN diagrams can be formally represented using Petri nets .\nPetri nets offer a good trade-off between user-friendly graphical modeling and a toolbox for formal analysis of produced models. There are many data-aware extensions of Petri nets (e. g.,    ) allowing to account for more complex, structured data. However, they cannot be readily used for representing multimedia EAI for reasons similar to those discussed above.\nAlternatively, it is possible to study other modeling requirements in which the multimedia message is treated as the first-class citizen, while the object storage is simply left out.\nUnder this assumption, one could use the formalism of Petri nets with structured data  (StDNs for short) for modeling multimedia EAI as tokens in it carry XML documents that, in turn, could be used for representing multimedia metadata – the core concept of the multimedia message. The authors also delineate restrictions required for the decidability of such properties as termination, coverability and boundedness. However, the formalism still does not account for persistent data (violation of REQ-1(d) that is crucial for some patterns) and would need to be extended with the support of functions. Mederly et al. [ref]15 studied an approach for formalizing integration patterns, in which messages are first-order formulas and patterns are operations that add and delete messages, and that uses AI planning for finding an integration process with a minimal number of components.\nWhile this approach shares the formalization objective, MM-nets apply to a broader set of objectives (e. g., formal analysis, simulation) and cover multimedia data, semantics and storage (cf. REQs-1(a–c)). Multimedia data.\nThe approach for storing and querying multimedia data employed in this work is similar to the one in the OCAPI system , which was developed for the semantic integration of image data using knowledge bases.\nRetrieval of multimedia information from (distributed) databases is covered in .\nThe multimedia semantics are represented by semantic attributes based on extended generalized icons with a logical and physical representation on a database.\nWhile our approach separates these different representations as well,  targets extended normal forms and functional dependencies between different attributes and does not define user interaction with the multimedia semantics on a business application-relevant feature level that could be used for message processing.\nMore recently,  developed an image similarity query mechanism in the area of multimedia queries in multimedia databases.\nWhile no query syntax is provided, the approach could be used to formulate decisions based on image similarity.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: the formalism still does not account for persistent data (violation of REQ-1(d) that is crucial for some patterns) and would need to be extended with the support of functions.
