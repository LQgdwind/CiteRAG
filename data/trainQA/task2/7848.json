      "content": "Paper Title: Chiplet-Gym: Optimizing Chiplet-based AI Accelerator Design with Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTable VI shows the optimized parameter found by the optimizer for both cases for a specific Œ±,Œ≤,Œ≥ùõºùõΩùõæ\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma value (user-defined weights on the objective function as explained in Eqn. 17). We observe that best parameter was found by RL PPO algorithm. It is imperative to note that multiple design configurations may exist, achieving almost identical (less than 1 variation) cost model value. The optimum design point for case (i) consists of thirty 3D AI chiplet pairs arranged in a 5√ó6565\\times 6 mesh topology, resulting in 60 chiplets in total. 2 chiplets (forming a pair) are connected with SoIC 3D integration technology with a data rate of 42Gbps per link and link count of 3200 providing up to 131.25 Tbps of bandwidth. Each chiplet pair is connected with other chiplet pair with 2.5D EMIB integration with a data rate of 20Gbps and a link count of 3100 delivering up to 60 Tbps of bandwidth. Four 16GB HBM chiplets, located at top, right, bottom, and middle of the 5√ó6565\\times 6 mesh topology, are connected to two to four neighboring AI chiplets with EMIB 2.5D integration technology with a data rate of 20Gbps per link and a link count of 4900, resulting in a bandwidth of 95 Tbps. The trace length for each 2.5D interconnect is selected as the minimum trace length possible (minimum chiplet-to-chiplet distance). In case (ii), when we increase the maximum number of chiplets to 128, we observe that the optimum design configuration contains 112 chiplets (56 chiplet pairs) and the communication bandwidth decreases for all cases. This is because, as the number of chiplets increases, area per chiplet decreases, resulting in smaller throughput per chiplet, less bandwidth demand, and high system utilization. We observe that 3D architecture, even with area penalty for TSV and TSV-associated keep-out zone, achieves 1.52√ó1.52\\times more logic density than its 2D/2.5D counterpart at the same package size. We synthesize the chiplet module, found by the optimizer, with Synopsys Fusion Compiler using their 14nm PDK  at 1GHz clock frequency and obtain the peak throughput per chiplet, (o‚Äãp‚Äãs/s‚Äãe‚Äãc)A‚ÄãI‚Äã_‚Äãc‚Äãh‚Äãi‚Äãpsubscriptùëúùëùùë†ùë†ùëíùëêùê¥ùêº_ùëê‚Ñéùëñùëù(ops/sec)_{AI\\_chip}, and energy consumption per MAC operation, Eo‚Äãp‚Å£‚àósubscriptùê∏ùëúùëùE_{op*}. We use these values in our analytical model to estimate the throughput and energy efficiency of the 60 and 112 chiplet system. For cost estimation we use the model from . Fig. 12 compares the 60-chiplet, 112-chiplet and monolithic GPU for MLPerf benchmark .\nChiplet-based 3D system achieves higher throughput for all the benchmarks than monolithic chip because of its 1.52√ó1.52\\times more logic density (Fig. 12 (a)). The benchmark features are briefly summarized in Table VII.\nThe 112-chiplet system experiences higher communication latency compared to the 60-chiplet system. However, the lower bandwidth penalty of the 112-chiplet system, in contrast to the 60-chiplet system, outweighs the higher latency, resulting in a superior overall throughput compared to the 60-chiplet system. 60 and 112-chiplet systems are 3.7√ó3.7\\times and 3.6√ó3.6\\times more energy-efficient (inverse of energy consumption) than the monolithic counterpart, respectively (Fig. 12(b)).\nThe fact that chiplet architectures, which requires comparatively slower inter-chiplet links provide 1.5x more\nthroughput, and 3.7x energy efficiency compared to the monolithic one, is counter-intuitive. Because, there is no better solution than housing as many logic and cache as possible on the same die, given the hypothetical scenario that there is no yield, cost, or reticle size limitations (however this is not practically achievable). On the contrary, due to 3D stacking, the logic density, hence the throughput, has increased at the same area footprint. To achieve the same amount of throughput with the monolithic chip, more than one monolithic chip need to be linked off-board on the PCB, which consumes at least one order of magnitude more energy[ref]4 than on-package communication. This is the reason, 3D-stacked chiplet based architecture offers 1.5x throughput and 3.7x energy-efficiency\ncompared to its monolithic counterpart. Fig. 12(c) illustrates that the die cost of the monolithic chip is 76√ó76\\times and 143√ó143\\times higher than that of the 60 and 112 chiplet systems, respectively. This significant cost difference arises from the low yield (48%) of the monolithic chip of 826mm2, compared to the 97% and 98% die yield of the 60 and 112 chiplet systems, with a die size of 26mm2 and 14mm2, respectively, at 7nm node. In addition to that, the cost of the cost of Known Good Dies (KGD) is inversely proportional to the number of KGD (NK‚ÄãG‚ÄãDsubscriptùëÅùêæùê∫ùê∑N_{KGD}). As the die area (A) increases, the number of good dies (NK‚ÄãG‚ÄãDsubscriptùëÅùêæùê∫ùê∑N_{KGD}) decreases, leading to a substantial increase in cost. The relationship between the cost and die area can be approximated as c‚Äão‚Äãs‚ÄãtK‚ÄãG‚ÄãD‚àùA52proportional-toùëêùëúùë†subscriptùë°ùêæùê∫ùê∑superscriptùê¥52cost_{KGD}\\propto A^{\\frac{5}{2}} (taking up to 2 terms of Taylor series expansion of die yield) [ref]4. Please note that, we implement our chiplet in synopsys 14nm free PDK. However, use estimate the cost for 7nm to have a fair comparison between the monolithic one, which was fabricated in 7nm technode. We consider chiplet I/O pad bonding yield of 99%percent9999\\% to estimate the packaging cost. In fact with better process control this bonding yield can reach 100%percent100100\\% as reported by TSMC in . Furthermore, even if there are faulty bondings, 100%percent100100\\% TSV/Hybrid-Bonding bonding yield can be achieved by using the TSV/pad repair techniques with spare TSV/pad [ref]51. We observe that the packaging cost of chiplet-based architecture is higher, 1.62√ó1.62\\times and 2.46√ó2.46\\times, than the monolithic one. However, with near perfect TSV bonding yield[ref]51, the packaging cost of chiplet-based architecture is only 1.28√ó1.28\\times (for 60-chiplets) and 1.63√ó1.63\\times of the monolithic one. Despite the package cost of the chiplet-based architecture being 1.62√ó1.62\\times (1.28√ó1.28\\times for 100%percent100100\\% bonding yield) higher than that of the monolithic architecture,\nthe advantages of smaller dies in the chiplet-based design offset the additional package expenses, as the silicon die cost contributes most to the overall manufacturing RE cost.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: To achieve the same amount of throughput with the monolithic chip, more than one monolithic chip need to be linked off-board on the PCB, which consumes at least one order of magnitude more energy[ref]4 than on-package communication.
