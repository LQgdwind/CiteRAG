      "content": "Paper Title: On the local consequence of modal Product logic: standard completeness and decidability\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nModal logic is broadly understood as the logic of different sorts of modalities, or modes of truth: alethic (“necessarily”), epistemic (“it is known that”), deontic (“it ought to be the case that”), temporal (“it is always the case that”), provability (”it is provable that”), among others. Common logical features of these operators justify the common label. From a merely technical point of view, we could consider that a logic is ”modal” as long as it includes non truth-functional operators (in the sense that they are non truth-functional over the propositional algebra of evaluation). In general, however, fist order logics are not considered ”modal”, and this term is limited to somehow intermediate logical systems. In any case, this perspective allows the natural addition of modal operators to logics different from CPL, which is the setting where this work is framed. In this work, we focus our attention in the modal expansion of the non-classical Product Logic, one of the three main so-called fuzzy logics . An interesting feature of this logic is that it is complete with respect to an algebra with universe    (standard) and the real product as monoidal operation, making it very suitable for modeling of different questions. The addition of modalities poses several questions, starting from the definition of the logic itself, and passing through their axiomatic characterization, completeness and computational behavior. This paper contributes to the above questions, proving first the completeness of the local logical entailment arising from the modal semantics defined over the whole variety of product algebras with respect to the analogous defined over the standard product algebra, and second, the decidability of this logical entailment. The notion of modal many-valued logic studied in this paper follows the tradition initiated by Fitting  0 and Hájek 4 , which differs from another relevant definition of so-called modal substructural logics studied for instance in 8  6. The logics studied in this work are defined over Kripke models whose accessibility relation and variables at each world are valued on certain algebras.\nThe operators □,◇□◇\\square,\\Diamond are generalizations of those of classical modal logic, and are not inter-definable in general .\nOn the other hand, the so-called local and global logics’ derivations arising from these models refer to the interpretation of the premises and conclusion in the derivability relation. In the former case they are considered world-wise, while in the latter the premises should hold in the whole model. These two semantics\nbehave with respect to the F.O. semantics of the corresponding many-valued logic in the analogous way to the classical case and to Fisher-Servi Intuitionistic modal logic [ref]8. Axiomatizability and computational behavior of global modal logics over product and Łukasiewicz logics were studied in detail in , where it is proven that the logics with a crisp accessibility over the corresponding standard algebras are not decidable, and not even recursively enumerable. These results are in consonance with the corresponding First Order logics [ref]23  9. From them, it is easy to prove that the corresponding global logic over the standard algebras and that over the whole variety differ (since the one over the whole variety is recursively enumerable relying in the corresponding axiomatization of the F.O. logic). It remains open the question of whether Gödel based global modal logic is decidable. In this work, we will study in turn local modal logics, in particular the ones expanding the Product logic. It is known that the transitive expansion of the logic over the standard algebra with a crisp accessibility is undecidable , and, on the other hand, that the set of theorems of the modal logic arising from models valued over the standard algebra (with a valued accessibility relation) is decidable . This second result serves us of inspiration to study the local product logic with a valued accessibility relation: in the last section of this paper, we extend  and prove the completeness of the logic over the whole variety of product algebras with respect to that over the standard product algebra, and the decidability of the logical entailment. However, as we will explain later on, this approach is of little help for studying the logics arising from models with a crisp accessibility relation, which is of much interest since this is the modal logic whose class of Kripke frames is the classical one. In a neighboring context, Gödel based local modal logics (both with a crisp and a valued accessibility relation) are known to be decidable , even if the usual semantics lacks the finite model property, but again, the solution is very specific to the Gödel case and has little application to the product one. In this work will prove that local modal product logics (both the one over models with valued and the one with crisp accessibility relations) are standard complete, in the sense that the respective modal logic arising from the (valued or crisp accessibility) models evaluated over the standard product algebra coincides with the one arising from the (valued or crisp accessibility) models evaluated over arbitrary product algebras. We will also prove that these logics are decidable.111The questions we address in this work but for what concerns the modal expansions of Łukasiewicz and Gödel logics are relatively straightforward to answer: completeness with respect to witnessed models of the Łukasiewicz F.O. logic ([13, Thm. 8]) provides completeness of the local modal Łukasiewicz logics with respect to the corresponding finite models, whose cardinality is bounded by the formulas involved. From there, it is quite easy to prove both standard completeness and decidability of these logics. For what concerns modal Gödel logics, as we already said, decidability was proven in , and standard completeness follows from the analogous result for F.O. Gödel logic ([12, Thm. 5.3.3]). The paper is organized as follows. We start in Section 2 by introducing some useful preliminaries, from propositional to modal and F.O. logics. In Section 3 we state in detail the main results of the paper concerning the modal product logic with crisp accessibility. Sections 4 and 5 are devoted to prove the results stated in the previous section. Lastly, Section 6 is devoted to study the modal product logic with valued accessibility, and we exploit the machinery introduced along the paper to prove a result slightly stronger than the one from  in a more concise way.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: model.
