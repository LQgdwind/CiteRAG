Towards Trustworthy Graph Neural Networks via Confidence Calibration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper, we focus on the calibration of semi-supervised node classification in an undirected attributed graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) with the adjacent matrix 𝐀∈ℝN×N𝐀superscriptℝ𝑁𝑁\\mathbf{A}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times N} and the node feature matrix 𝐗=[𝐱1,…,𝐱N]𝖳𝐗superscriptsubscript𝐱1…subscript𝐱𝑁𝖳\\mathbf{X}=[\\mathbf{x}_{1},…,\\mathbf{x}_{N}]^{\\mathsf{T}}. V𝑉V is a set of nodes and E⊆V×V𝐸𝑉𝑉E\\subseteq V\\times V is a set of edges between nodes. N=|V|𝑁𝑉N=|V| is the number of nodes. Here we give the definition of perfect calibration of GNNs as follows: Given random variables 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}, 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X}, 𝐘⊆{1,…,K}𝐘1…𝐾\\mathbf{Y}\\subseteq\\{1,…,K\\} and a GNN model fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f_{\\theta} where θ𝜃\\theta is the learnable parameters, for node i𝑖i with label yi∈𝐘subscript𝑦𝑖𝐘y_{i}\\in\\mathbf{Y},\n𝐳i=fθ​(𝐱i,𝐀)=[zi,1,…,zi,K]𝖳subscript𝐳𝑖subscript𝑓𝜃subscript𝐱𝑖𝐀superscriptsubscript𝑧𝑖1…subscript𝑧𝑖𝐾𝖳\\mathbf{z}_{i}=f_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x}_{i},\\mathbf{A})=[z_{i,1},…,z_{i,K}]^{\\mathsf{T}} is the output of GNNs (i.e., the prediction probability), and y^i=arg⁡maxkzi,ksubscript^𝑦𝑖subscript𝑘subscript𝑧𝑖𝑘\\hat{y}_{i}=\\mathop{\\arg\\max}_{k}{z_{i,k}} and p^i=maxkzi,ksubscript^𝑝𝑖subscript𝑘subscript𝑧𝑖𝑘\\hat{p}_{i}=\\mathop{\\max}_{k}{z_{i,k}} are the prediction and the confidence respectively. Then we define fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f_{\\theta} to be perfectly calibrated as: According to Definition 1, GNN is perfectly calibrated only when the confidence p^isubscript^𝑝𝑖\\hat{p}_{i} is exactly equal to the true probability of getting a correct prediction for every node. Next, we take two representative GNNs (GCN  and GAT 3) as examples to analyze whether they are perfectly calibrated. Specifically, we apply GCN and GAT to four widely used datasets Cora [ref]29, Citeseer [ref]29, Pubmed [ref]29, CoraFull , and examine whether their results satisfy Definition 1. To provide more results, we select three label rates for training set (i.e., 20, 40, 60 labeled nodes per class).\nAll the experimental settings follow  3.\nSince the true probability p𝑝p cannot be exactly known, we take an approximate way to evaluate the calibration as in 2. In particular, we first partition the   range of confidence into 20 equal bins and then we group the nodes into corresponding bins according to their confidence. After that we calculate the average accuracy of each bin. We expect the average accuracy is equal to the average confidence of each bin, which means the model is approximately perfectly calibrated. For example, if the average confidence of nodes in the bin [0.95, 1.0] is 0.96, and then the classification accuracy in this bin should be 96%percent9696\\%. We illustrate the results of label rate being 20 in Fig. 1 using Reliability Diagrams  here, where the x-axis is the confidence in 20 bins of equal size and y-axis is the average accuracy in each bin. The blue represents the classification accuracy of GCN and GAT while the red is our expectation. More results of label rate being 40, 60 and other GNN models can be seen in Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 12, Fig. 13 and Fig. 14 in the appendix. We can see that in all the datasets, the average accuracy of most bins is higher than the average confidence.\nIn other words, these GNNs actually achieve remarkable performance, but they all output low confidence, i.e., the GNNs are usually under-confident. Please note that this phenomenon of GNNs is very different from other modern neural networks, which are generally known to be over-confident 2 9. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2, we also visualize the confidence distribution of test nodes, where the x-axis is the confidence and y-axis is the density . The histogram height multiplied by the width is equal to the frequency. The blue represents the confidence distribution of correct predictions while the yellow represents that of incorrect predictions. More results of label rate being 40 and 60 can be seen in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 in the appendix. We can see that a large quantity of correct predictions are distributed in the low confidence range.\nThe results above indicate that the current GNNs are far from perfect calibration, leading to unreliable confidence.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: every node.
