      "content": "Paper Title: GNNAdvisor: An Adaptive and Efficient Runtime System for GNN Acceleration on GPUs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs)\nemerge to stand on the front-line for handling many graph-based deep learning tasks (e.g., node embedding generation for node classification    and link prediction [ref]6  ).\nCompared with standard methods for graph analytics, such as random walks   and graph Laplacians   , GNNs highlight themselves with the interleaved two-phase execution of both graph operations (scatter-and-gather ) at the Aggregation phase, and Neural Network (NN) operations (matrix multiplication) at the Update phase, to achieve\nsignificantly higher accuracy    and better generality .\nYet, the state-of-the-art GNN frameworks [ref]53   [ref]54, which follow a one-size-fits-all implementation scheme, often suffer from poor performance when handling more complicated GNN architectures (i.e., more layers and higher hidden dimensionality in each layer)\nand diverse graph datasets. Specifically, previous work that supports both GNN training and inference can be classified into two categories.\nThe first type [ref]54  is built on popular graph processing systems and is combined with NN operations.\nThe second type  [ref]53, in contrast, starts with deep learning frameworks and is extended to support vector-based graph operations.\nHowever, these existing solutions are still preliminary and inevitably fall short in the following three major aspects, even on common computing platforms such as GPUs. Failing to leverage GNN input information.\nGNN models demonstrate great diversity in terms of layer sequences, types of aggregation methods, and the dimension size of node embeddings.\nThese profoundly impact the effectiveness of various system optimization choices.\nThe diversity of input graphs further complicates the problem.\nUnfortunately, current GNN frameworks  [ref]53  follow a one-size-fits-all optimization scheme and fail to craft an optimization strategy that maximizes efficiency for a particular GNN application’s settings.\nSome classical graph systems   have exploited input characteristics to facilitate more efficient optimizations, but they only focus on simple graph algorithms like PageRank  while having no support for GNN models. Optimizations not tailored to GNN.\nWhile the update phase in GNNs involves NN operations that are dense in computation and regular in memory access, the aggregation phase is usually sparse in computation and highly irregular in memory access.\nWithout dedicated optimization, it will inevitably become the performance bottleneck.\nExisting GNN frameworks  [ref]53  simply extend the optimization schemes from classical graph systems 6 [ref]54, and do not address the difference between GNN and graph processing.\nFor example, each node is associated with an embedding attribute in GNNs while each node only has a single scalar attribute in traditional graph processing.\nSuch difference invokes novel design principles for GNNs towards more aggressive parallelism and more efficient memory optimization. Poor runtime support for input adaptability.\nPrior GNN frameworks  [ref]53  rely on a Python-based high-level programming interface for ease of user implementation.\nThese frameworks employ static optimizations through a compiler or manually-optimized libraries. Nevertheless, some critical performance-related information for a GNN is only available at runtime (e.g., node degree and embedding size).\nWithout adaptable designs that can leverage such runtime information, we would easily suffer from an inferior performance because of the largely under-utilized the GPU computing resources and inefficient irregular memory access.\nThis limitation motivates the need for runtime environments with flexible designs to handle a wide spectrum of inputs effectively.\n To this end, we propose, GNNAdvisor, an adaptive and efficient runtime system for GNN acceleration on GPUs.\nGNNAdvisor leverages Pytorch  as the front-end to improve programmability and ease user implementation.\nWe show a representative 2-layer Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)  in GNNAdvisor at Listing 1.\nAt the low level, GNNAdvisor is built with C++/CUDA and integrated with Pytorch framework by using Pytorch Wrapper.\nIt can be viewed as a new type of Pytorch operator with a set of kernel optimizations and runtime support. It can work seamlessly with existing operators from the Pytorch Framework.\nData is loaded with the data loader written in Pytorch and passed as a Tensor to GNNAdvisor for computation on GPUs. Once the GNNAdvisor completes its computation at the GPU, it will pass the data Tensor back to the original Pytorch framework for further processing.\nAs detailed in Figure 1, GNNAdvisor consists of several key components to facilitate the GNN optimization and execution on GPUs.\nFirst, GNNAdvisor introduces an input Loader&Extractor to exploit the input-level information that can guide our system-level optimizations.\nSecond, GNNAdvisor incorporates a Decider consisting of analytical modeling for automatic runtime parameter selection to reduce manual effort in design optimization, and a lightweight node renumbering routine to improve graph structural locality.\nThird, GNNAdvisor integrates a Kernel&Runtime Crafter to customize our parameterized GNN kernel and CUDA runtime, which consists of an effective 2D workload management (considering both the number of neighbor nodes and the node embedding dimensionality) and a set of GNN-specialized memory optimizations. Note that in this project, we mainly focus on the setting of single-GPU GNN computing, which is today’s most popular design adopted as the key component in many state-of-the-art frameworks, such as DGL [ref]53 and PyG . Single-GPU GNN computing is desirable for two reasons:\nFirst, many GNN applications with small to medium size graphs (e.g., molecule structure) can easily fit the memory of a single GPU.\nSecond, in the case of large-size graphs that can only be handled by out-of-GPU-core and multi-GPU processing, numerous well-studied graph partition strategies (e.g., METIS 2) can cut the giant graphs into small-size subgraphs to make them suitable for a single GPU. Therefore, the optimization of both the out-of-GPU-core (e.g., GPU streaming processing) and multi-GPU GNN computation still largely demands performance improvements on a single GPU.\nMoreover, while our paper focuses on GNNs, our proposed methodology can be applied to optimize various types of irregular workload (e.g., social network analysis) targeting GPUs as well. Overall, we make the following contributions: We are the first to explore GNN input properties (§​3§3\\S 3) (e.g., GNN model architectures and input graphs), and give an in-depth analysis of their importance in guiding system optimizations for GPU-based GNN computing. We propose a set of GNN-tailored system optimizations with parameterization, including a novel 2D workload management (§​4§4\\S 4) and specialized memory customization (§​5§5\\S 5) on GPUs. We incorporate the analytical modeling and parameter auto-selection (§​6§6\\S 6) to ease the design space exploration. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the strength of GNNAdvisor over state-of-the-art GNN execution frameworks, such as Deep Graph Library (average 3.02×3.02\\times) and NeuGraph (average 4.36×4.36\\times), on mainstream GNN architectures across various datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)\nemerge to stand on the front-line for handling many graph-based deep learning tasks (e.g., node embedding generation for node classification    and link prediction [ref]6  ).\nCompared with standard methods for graph analytics, such as random walks   and graph Laplacians   , GNNs highlight themselves with the interleaved two-phase execution of both graph\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
