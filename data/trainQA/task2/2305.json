      "content": "Paper Title: Ensemble and Auxiliary Tasks for Data-Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEnsemble learning is a powerful technique to improve the performance of machine learning models on a diverse set of problems.\nIn reinforcement learning (RL), ensembles are mostly used to stabilize learning and reduce variability [ref]1 [ref]5 , and in few cases, to enable exploration  . Orthogonal to the utilization of ensembles, auxiliary tasks also enjoy widespread use in RL to aid learning    . The interplay between these two methods has been studied within a limited capacity in the context of simple neural networks  and decision trees . In reinforcement learning, this interaction – to the best of our knowledge – has not been studied at all. Our principal aim in this work is to study ensembles and auxiliary tasks in the context of deep Q-learning algorithm. Specifically, we apply ensemble learning on the well-established Rainbow agent  [ref]9, and additionally augment it with auxiliary tasks.\nWe study the problem theoretically through the use of bias-variance-covariance analysis and by performing an empirical case study on a popular reinforcement learning benchmark, ATARI games, under the constraint of low number of interactions . ATARI games offer a suite of diverse problems, improving the generality of the results, and data scarcity makes the effect of ensembles more pronounced. Moreover, under the constraint of low data, it is naturally preferable to trade-off the extra computational requirement of using an ensemble for the performance gain that it provides. We derive a more refined analysis of the bias-variance-covariance decomposition for ensembles. The usual analysis assumes that each member of the ensemble is trained on a different dataset. Instead, we focus our analysis on a single dataset, used with multiple instantiations of a randomized learning algorithm. This is commonly how ensembles are actually used in practice; in fact, the multiple datasets that are used for training members of the ensemble are often constructed from a single dataset through the use of randomization. Additionally, we introduce some new “weak” auxiliary tasks that provide small improvements, based on model learning and learning properties of objects and events. We show how ensembles can be used for combining multiple ”weak” auxiliary tasks to provide stronger improvements. Our case study and analysis shows that, Independent training of ensemble members works well. Joint training of the entire ensemble reduces Q-learning error but, surprisingly did not perform as well as an independently trained ensemble. The new auxiliary tasks are “weakly” helpful. Combining them together using an ensemble can provide a significant performance boost. We observe reduction in variance and covariance with the use of auxiliary tasks in the ensemble. Despite their benefits, using all auxiliary tasks on each predictor in ensemble may results in poorer performance. Analysis indicates that this could cause higher bias and covariance due to loss of diversity. It is interesting to note that our ensemble, despite its simplicity, achieves better performance on 13 out of 26 games compared to recent previous works. Moreover, our ensemble with auxiliary tasks achieves significantly better human mean and median normalized performance; 1.6×1.6\\times and 1.55×1.55\\times better than data-efficient Rainbow [ref]9, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: technique to improve the performance of machine learning models on a diverse set of problems.\nIn reinforcement learning (RL), ensembles are mostly used to stabilize learning and reduce variability [ref]1 [ref]5 , and in few cases, to enable exploration  .
