      "content": "Paper Title: The Annotated Dependency Pair Framework for Almost-Sure Termination of Probabilistic Term Rewriting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this work, we developed the ADP framework to prove 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} and 𝚒𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{iAST} of PTRSs completely automatically.\nBy using annotated DPs instead of dependency tuples as in , we obtain complete criteria for both 𝚒𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{iAST} and 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST}, which also simplifies the framework substantially.\nAs explained at the end of Sect. 1, this paper is based on our conference papers  \nand it extends them by unifying the two separate frameworks for 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} and 𝚒𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{iAST} and by several new ADP processors, explanations, and remarks. Compared to the non-probabilistic DP framework for termination of TRSs    1 2, analyzing (𝚒)​𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{(i)AST} automatically is significantly more difficultdue to the lack of a “minimality property” in the probabilistic setting, which would allow several further processors.\nMoreover, the ADP framework for PTRSs is restricted to reduction pairs based on barycentric, ℕ\\mathbb{N}-collapsible algebras (e.g., to multilinear polynomial interpretations).\nThe soundness proofs for our processors are much more involved than in the non-probabilistic setting, due to the more complex structure of chain trees.\nHowever, the processors themselves are analogous to their non-probabilistic counterparts, and thus, existing implementations of the processors can easily be adapted to their new probabilistic versions. Our novel ADP framework for full 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} is particularly useful when analyzing overlapping PTRSs, as for such PTRSs we cannot use the criteria of 8\nfor classes of PTRSs where 𝚒𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{iAST} implies 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST}.\nThe frameworks for 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} and 𝚒𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{iAST} differ in power, since some processors are less powerful for 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST}, and some are not even applicable for 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST}.\nThe following table illustrates the differences between the ADP frameworks for 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} and 𝚒𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{iAST}.\nThe parts in italics show the differences to the non-probabilistic DP framework.\nHere, “(¬\\lnot)S” and “(¬\\lnot)C” stand for “(not) sound” and “(not) complete”. We implemented our new contributions in our termination prover\nAProVE \nand compared the new version of AProVE\nbased on the probabilistic ADP framework\nincluding all new processors and improvements\npresented in this paper (journal) with\na previous version of AProVE\nwhich only contains the processors\nas presented\nin our corresponding\nconference papers   (conf). Moreover,\nwe also compare with a version of AProVE implementing our earlier framework from\n which used dependency tuples instead of ADPs\n(dt).\nAs explained at the end of Sect. 1,\ncompared to the conference papers of conf,\nin journal\nwe added the\nsubterm criterion processor, the instantiation, forward instantiation, and\nrule overlap instantiation\nprocessors,\nand we\nextended the\nprobabilistic reduction pair processors\nto algebras, which allows the use of, e.g., matrix orders. Similarly, matrix\norders can now also be used in our corresponding criterion of\n\nfor a direct application of orders to prove 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} (outside of the ADP\nframework). This direct application of orders was only used with polynomial\ninterpretations in dt and conf, but in\njournal, we also use it with matrix orders.\nFurthermore, note that dt is restricted to the analysis of\ninnermost rewriting,\nand cannot handle arbitrary rewrite strategies. The main goal for probabilistic termination\nanalysis is to become as powerful as termination analysis in the non-probabilistic setting.\nTherefore, in our first experiment, we\nconsidered the non-probabilistic TRSs of the TPDB  (the\nbenchmark set used in the annual Termination and Complexity Competition (TermComp)\n) and compared journal, conf, and dt with\nAProVE’s techniques for\nordinary non-probabilistic TRSs (AProVE-NP),\nbecause at the current TermComp,\nAProVE-NP was the\nmost powerful tool for termination of ordinary\nnon-probabilistic TRSs.\nAProVE-NP\nincludes many additional DP processors and benefits from using separate\ndependency pairs\nfor each occurrence of a defined symbol in the right-hand side of a rule\ninstead of ADPs.\nClearly, a TRS can be represented as a PTRS with trivial probabilities,\nand then (innermost) 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} is the same as (innermost) termination.\nWhile all three variants journal, conf, and dt\nhave a probability removal processor to\nswitch to the classical DP framework for such problems, we disabled that\nprocessor in this experiment.\nAs in TermComp,\nwe used a timeout of 300 seconds for each example.\nThe “TRS Innermost” and “TRS Standard” categories contain 366 and 1512 benchmarks and\nthe results regarding innermost rewriting can be seen in Table 1 and\nTable 2, respectively.\nOne can see that the transformations are very important for automatic termination proofs\nas we get\naround 5% closer to AProVE-NP’s results\nwhen using only the rewriting processor (in conf), and 12-16% closer when also\nusing the remaining transformational processors that use instantiations (in journal). Furthermore, we also tried to prove termination w.r.t. an arbitrary evaluation strategy for the examples from the “TRS Standard” category.\nHere, AProVE-NP can prove termination of 1031 examples, while journal and conf (using the ADP framework for full rewriting) can only show termination of 241 and 201 examples, respectively, see Table 2 again.\nRecall that dt cannot handle arbitrary evaluation strategies.\nAgain, our new transformations clearly increase power, while\nit becomes clear that proving 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} is significantly harder than proving\n𝚒𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{iAST}. In  we also considered\nan ADP framework for proving 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} if one only considers reductions starting with\nbasic terms.\nA basic\nterm has the form f​(t1,…,tn)f(t_{1},\\ldots,t_{n}), where ff is a defined symbol\nfrom 𝒟\\mathcal{D}\n(i.e., ff is an “algorithm” that can be evaluated) and the t1,…,tnt_{1},\\ldots,t_{n} are\nconstructor terms\nfrom 𝒯​(𝒞,𝒱)\\mathcal{T}(\\mathcal{C},\\mathcal{V})\n(i.e., they represent “data” that is given to the algorithm).\nConsidering only basic start terms\nmeans that we only analyze algorithms on given data, but not on arguments containing other executable functions.\nThe power of the ADP framework for basic start terms is in between the ones for\n𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} and 𝚒𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{iAST}, as some processors that are applicable for\n𝚒𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{iAST} but not for 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} can be applied for 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} if we\nrestrict ourselves to\nbasic start terms (e.g., this holds for the usable rule processor from Sect. 4.3). In the next experiment, we used the PTRS benchmark set of the TPDB,\ncontaining 128 typical probabilistic programs,\nincluding examples with complicated probabilistic structure and probabilistic algorithms\non lists and trees.\nFor instance, it contains\nthe following PTRS ℛ𝗊𝗌𝗋𝗍\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathsf{qsrt}} for\nprobabilistic quicksort. Here,\nlists are represented via the constructors\n𝗇𝗂𝗅\\mathsf{nil} (for the empty list) and 𝖼𝗈𝗇𝗌\\mathsf{cons}, where, e.g.,\n𝖼𝗈𝗇𝗌​(𝗌​(𝟢),𝖼𝗈𝗇𝗌​(𝗌​(𝟢),𝖼𝗈𝗇𝗌​(𝟢,𝗇𝗂𝗅)))\\mathsf{cons}(\\mathsf{s}(\\mathsf{0}),\\mathsf{cons}(\\mathsf{s}(\\mathsf{0}),\\mathsf{cons}(\\mathsf{0},\\mathsf{nil}))) represents the list\n[ref]1 [ref]1 [ref]0[ref]1 [ref]1 [ref]0. To ease readability,\nwe write rr\ninstead of {1:r}\\{1:r\\}. The 𝗋𝗈𝗍𝖺𝗍𝖾\\mathsf{rotate}-rules rotate\na list randomly often (they are\n𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST}, but not terminating). Thus, by choosing the first element\nof the resulting list, one obtains random pivot elements for the recursive calls of\n𝗊𝗌𝗋𝗍\\mathsf{qsrt} in the second 𝗂𝖿\\mathsf{if}-rule.\nIn addition to the rules above, ℛ𝗊𝗌𝗋𝗍\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathsf{qsrt}} contains rules for\nlist concatenation (𝖺𝗉𝗉\\mathsf{app}), and rules such that\n𝗅𝗈𝗐​(x,𝑥𝑠)\\mathsf{low}(x,\\mathit{xs}) (𝗁𝗂𝗀𝗁​(x,𝑥𝑠)\\mathsf{high}(x,\\mathit{xs}))\nreturns all elements of the list 𝑥𝑠\\mathit{xs} that are smaller (greater or equal) than\nxx, see App. A.2.\nProving 𝚒𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{iAST} of the\nabove rules requires transformational processors\nto instantiate and rewrite the 𝖾𝗆𝗉𝗍𝗒\\mathsf{empty}-,\n𝗁𝖽\\mathsf{hd}-,\nand 𝗍𝗅\\mathsf{tl}-subterms in the\nright-hand side of the 𝗊𝗌𝗋𝗍\\mathsf{qsrt}-rule.\nThus, dt and conf fail for this example,\nbut journal can prove 𝚒𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{iAST} of ℛ𝗊𝗌𝗋𝗍\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathsf{qsrt}}.\n(Our ADP framework for 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} is not applicable here, since the PTRS is\nduplicating.) The AProVE variant\ndt can prove 𝚒𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{iAST} for 77 of the\n128 PTRSs from the corresponding collection of the TPDB,\nand conf can prove it for 88.\nAdding the new and improved processors in journal increases this number to\n107, which demonstrates their power for PTRSs with non-trivial probabilities.\nWhen regarding full rewriting,\nconf can prove 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} for 56\nexamples and journal succeeds on 58 PTRSs, see Table 3.\nFor details on our experiments and for instructions on how to run our implementation\nin AProVE via its web interface or locally, see: On this website, we also performed experiments where we disabled individual transformational processors\nof the ADP framework, which shows the usefulness of each processor. In future work, we\nwill try to adapt the ADP framework in order to analyze stronger properties (like\n𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{PAST}) and we want to develop techniques (and processors for the ADP framework)\nin order to disprove 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST}.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: where, e.g.,\n𝖼𝗈𝗇𝗌​(𝗌​(𝟢),𝖼𝗈𝗇𝗌​(𝗌​(𝟢),𝖼𝗈𝗇𝗌​(𝟢,𝗇𝗂𝗅)))\\mathsf{cons}(\\mathsf{s}(\\mathsf{0}),\\mathsf{cons}(\\mathsf{s}(\\mathsf{0}),\\mathsf{cons}(\\mathsf{0},\\mathsf{nil}))) represents the list\n[ref]1 [ref]1 [ref]0[ref]1 [ref]1 [ref]0.
