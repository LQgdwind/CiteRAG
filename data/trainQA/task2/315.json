Herlihy and Shavit  proposed a characterization\nof wait-free task computability through the existence of\na simplicial map from a subdivision of the input complex of\na task ℐℐ\\mathcal{I} to its output complex 𝒪𝒪\\mathcal{O}. (The reader is referred\nto  for a thorough discussion of the use of\ncombinatorial topology in distributed computability.)\nHerlihy and Rajsbaum  studied colorless task computability\nin the special case of superset-c7-TRlosed adversaries.\nThey show that the protocol complex of a superset-closed adversary\nwith minimal core size c𝑐c is (c−2)𝑐2(c-2)-connected.\nThis result, obtained via an iterative application of the Nerve lemma,\ngives a combinatorial characterization of superset-closed adversaries.\nThe characterization only applies to colorless tasks,\nand it does not allow us to express the adversary in an affine way. Gafni et al.  introduced the notion of an affine task\nand characterized task computability in iterated adversarial models\nvia infinite subdivisions of input complexes, assuming a limited notion of\nsolvability that only guarantees outputs to “fast”\nprocesses [ref]11  (i.e., “seen” by every other process infinitely often).\nThe liveness property defined in this paper for iterated models\nguarantees outputs for every process, which allowed us to establish\na task-computability equivalence with conventional non-iterated models. Saraph et al.  gave a compact combinatorial characterization of\nt𝑡t-resilient task computability. Note that 𝒜t−𝑟𝑒𝑠subscript𝒜𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑠\\mathcal{A}_{t-\\mathit{res}} is a superset-closed\n(and thus fair) adversary. Our solution of the affine task ℛ𝒜subscriptℛ𝒜\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathcal{A}}\nin the α𝛼\\alpha-model is inspired by the t𝑡t-resilient solution of\nℛt−𝑟𝑒𝑠subscriptℛ𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑠\\mathcal{R}_{t-\\mathit{res}} in .\nGafni et al.  presented affine tasks for the model of\nk𝑘k-set consensus and, thus, k𝑘k-concurrency and k𝑘k-obstruction-freedom,\nwhich can be expressed as a symmetric and thus fair adversary. The notions of agreement functions and a fair adversaries\nwere introduced by the first two authors in .\nOne can determine the agreement function of any given adversary\nusing the formula suggested earlier for the set consensus power .\nIt has been shown in  that agreement functions\nencode enough information to characterize the task computability\nof any fair adversary. A short version of this paper appeared as a conference\nbrief announcement , and as an extended\nversion without formal proofs and shorten explanation .\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: task computability in iterated adversarial models\nvia infinite subdivisions of input complexes, assuming a limited notion of\nsolvability that only guarantees outputs to “fast”\nprocesses [ref]11  (i.e., “seen” by every other process infinitely often).\nThe liveness property defined in this paper for iterated models\nguarantees outputs for every process, which allowed us to establish\na\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
