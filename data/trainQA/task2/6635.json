      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Select SAT Encodings for Pseudo-Boolean and Linear Integer Constraints\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSavile Row implements nine SAT encodings for linear and pseudo-Boolean\nconstraints. Eight of these are encodings of PB(AMO)\nconstraints  [ref]2 , which are\npseudo-Boolean constraints with non-intersecting at-most-one (AMO) groups of\nterms (where at most one of the corresponding eisubscript𝑒𝑖e_{i} expressions are true in\nany solution). Encodings of PB(AMO) constraints can be substantially smaller and\nmore efficient to solve than the corresponding PB constraints\n [ref]2  . For the eight PB(AMO) encodings the constraints must be placed in a normal form\nwhere all coefficients are positive, only ≤\\leq is allowed, and each eisubscript𝑒𝑖e_{i}\nmust be a Boolean expression. The first normalisation step is to decompose\nequality into two inequalities ≤\\leq and ≥\\geq. Second, any ≥\\geq\nconstraints are converted to ≤\\leq by negating all qisubscript𝑞𝑖q_{i} coefficients and\nk𝑘k. At this stage, all constraints are in ≤\\leq form. Non-trivial integer terms qi​eisubscript𝑞𝑖subscript𝑒𝑖q_{i}e_{i} (where eisubscript𝑒𝑖e_{i} is not Boolean and\nD​(ei)≠{0,1}𝐷subscript𝑒𝑖01D(e_{i})\\neq\\{0,1\\}) are dealt with as follows. If qi<0subscript𝑞𝑖0q_{i}<0 then\nqi←−qi←subscript𝑞𝑖subscript𝑞𝑖q_{i}\\leftarrow-q_{i} and ei←−ei←subscript𝑒𝑖subscript𝑒𝑖e_{i}\\leftarrow-e_{i}. The integer variable\ncontained in eisubscript𝑒𝑖e_{i} is required to have a direct SAT encoding.\nFinally, qi​eisubscript𝑞𝑖subscript𝑒𝑖q_{i}e_{i} is replaced with an AMO group of |D​(ei)|−1𝐷subscript𝑒𝑖1\\lvert D(e_{i})\\rvert-1\nterms representing each value of qi​eisubscript𝑞𝑖subscript𝑒𝑖q_{i}e_{i} except the smallest (which is\ncancelled out by adjusting k𝑘k). For example, if qi=2subscript𝑞𝑖2q_{i}=2 and eisubscript𝑒𝑖e_{i} has\nvalues {1,2,3}123\\{1,2,3\\} then k←k−2←𝑘𝑘2k\\leftarrow k-2 and qi​eisubscript𝑞𝑖subscript𝑒𝑖q_{i}e_{i} would be replaced\nwith the following AMO group of two terms. At this point all terms qi​eisubscript𝑞𝑖subscript𝑒𝑖q_{i}e_{i} in the constraint must be Boolean or have\ndomain D​(ei)={0,1}𝐷subscript𝑒𝑖01D(e_{i})=\\{0,1\\}. If qi<0subscript𝑞𝑖0q_{i}<0, the term is replaced with\n−qi​(ei=0)subscript𝑞𝑖subscript𝑒𝑖0-q_{i}(e_{i}=0) or −qi​(¬ei)subscript𝑞𝑖subscript𝑒𝑖-q_{i}(\\neg e_{i}) (as appropriate for the type of eisubscript𝑒𝑖e_{i})\nand k←k−qi←𝑘𝑘subscript𝑞𝑖k\\leftarrow k-q_{i}. Otherwise, the term is replaced with qi​(ei=1)subscript𝑞𝑖subscript𝑒𝑖1q_{i}(e_{i}=1)\nor remains unchanged (as appropriate for the type). Automatic AMO detection  (which applies constraint\npropagation to find AMO groups among the Boolean terms of the original\nconstraint) is enabled in our experiments. Automatic AMO detection has been\nshown to substantially improve solving time in some\ncases . It partitions the Boolean terms of the\nconstraint into AMO groups, and (as described above) each integer term becomes\nan AMO group also. Finally, we exactly follow the PB(AMO) normalisation rules\nof Bofill et al  prior to encoding. The PB(AMO) encodings are as follows: The Multi-valued Decision Diagram\nencoding  (a generalisation of the BDD encoding for\nPB constraints ) uses an MDD to encode the PB(AMO)\nconstraint. Each layer of the MDD corresponds to one AMO group. BDDs and MDDs\nare a popular choice for encoding sums to SAT since they can compress\nequivalent states in each layer. The Generalized Global Polynomial Watchdog\nencoding [ref]2 (generalising GPW )\nis based on bit arithmetic and is polynomial in size. It has the CC property but not GAC. The Generalized Local Polynomial Watchdog\nencoding  (generalising LPW ) is\nsimilar to GGPW but has the GAC property. However, while being polynomial in\nsize, it is often too large to be practical. The Generalized Generalized Totalizer [ref]2\nencodes the PB(AMO) constraint with a binary tree, where the leaves represent\nthe AMO groups and each internal node represents the sum of all leaves beneath\nit. GGT extends the Generalized Totalizer . The binary\ntree is constructed using the minRatio heuristic  that\naims to minimise the numbers of values of internal nodes. is identical to GGT except that a balanced binary tree is used. The Reduced Generalized Generalized Totalizer \nattempts to improve on GGT by compressing equivalent states at its internal nodes.\nThe minRatio heuristic is used to construct the tree. The Generalized Sequential Weight Counter [ref]2\n(based on the Sequential Weight Counter )\nencodes the sum of each prefix sub-sequence of the AMO groups. The Generalized n-Level Modulo\nTotalizer  (based on the n-Level Modulo\nTotalizer ) is an extension of the Generalized Totalizer that\nrepresents values of the internal nodes in a mixed-radix base. GMTO can be\nsubstantially more compact than other PB(AMO) encodings. The MDD, GLPW, GGT, GGTd, RGGT, and GSWC encodings all have the GAC property\n(described in section 1.2). Where the original constraint c𝑐c contains\nno integer terms and the comparator of the original constraint is neither ==\nnor ≠\\neq then these six encodings will enforce GAC on c𝑐c. GGPW has the\nCC property. Where the original constraint c𝑐c contains no integer terms and\nthe comparator of the original constraint is not == or ≠\\neq then GGPW\nwill have the CC property for c𝑐c.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Savile Row implements nine SAT encodings for linear and pseudo-Boolean\nconstraints. Eight of these are encodings of PB(AMO)\nconstraints  [ref]2 , which are\npseudo-Boolean constraints with non-intersecting at-most-one (AMO) groups of\nterms (where at most one of the corresponding eisubscript𝑒𝑖e_{i} expressions are true in\nany solution).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
