      "content": "Paper Title: On the impact of treewidth in the computational complexity of freezing dynamics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAn automata network is a network of nùëõn entities, each holding a state from a finite set QùëÑQ and evolving according to a local update rule which depends only on its neighbors in the network‚Äôs graph. More concisely, it can be seen as a dynamical system (deterministic or not) acting on the set QnsuperscriptùëÑùëõQ^{n}. The model can be seen as a non-uniform generalization of (finite) cellular automata. Automata networks have been used as modelization tools in many areas  and they can also be considered as a distributed computational model with various specialized definitions like in  . An automata network is freezing if there is an order on states such that the state evolution of any node is non-decreasing in any orbit. Several models that received a lot of attention in the literature are actually freezing automata networks, for instance: bootstrap percolation which has been studied on various graphs  [ref]5  , epidemic 8 or forest fire  propagation models 111They are discrete counterparts of the family of spatial SIR/SEIR models 6 (or other variants) which are sadly famous amid the actual COVID-19 pandemic., cristal growth models 7  and more recently self-assembly tilings 9. On the other hand, their complexity as computational models has been studied from various point of view: as language recognizers where they correspond to bounded change or bounded communication models 8 9 0, for their computational universality 1  , as well as for various associated decision problems 3   . A major topic of interest in automata networks theory is to determine how the network graph affects dynamical or computational properties 9 . In the freezing case, it was for instance established that one-dimensional freezing cellular automata, while being Turing universal via Minsky machine simulation, have striking computational limitations when compared to bi-dimensional ones: they are NL-predictable (instead of P-complete) 1 1 8, can only produce computable limit fixed points starting from computable initial configurations (instead of non-computable ones starting from finite configurations) 1, and have a polynomial time decidable nilpotency problem (instead of uncomputable) 1. The present paper aims at understanding what are the key parameters which influence the overall computational complexity of finite freezing automata networks. A natural first parameter is the alphabet size, as automata networks are usually considered as simple machines having a number of states that is independent of the size of the network. For the same reasons, a second parameter that we consider is the maximum degree of the network, as a simple machine might not be able to handle the information incoming from a large number of neighbors. Finally the results mentioned earlier show a gap between bi-dimensional grids and one-dimensional grids (i.e. paths or rings). Since Courcelle‚Äôs theorem on MSO properties 2, graph parameters like treewidth 4 are used to measure a sort of distance to a grid. Indeed, it is known that paths or rings have constant treewidth, and the treewidth of a graph is polynomially related to the size of its largest grid minor 1. Therefore treewidth is a natural parameter for our study. A canonical model checking problem to capture many classical dynamical problems. We define a general model checking problem SPEC, that asks whether a given freezing automata networks has an orbit that satisfies a given set of local constraints on the trace at each node (Problem¬†3.5). It takes advantage of the sparse orbits of freezing automata networks (a bounded number of changes per node in any orbit) which allow to express properties in the temporal dimension in an efficient way. We show thanks to a kind pumping lemma on orbits (Lemma¬†3.2) that it captures many standard problems in automata network theory, among which we consider four ones: prediction 3  1, nilpotency 3  4, predecessor 5 0 and asynchronous reachability 4. Note that since Boolean circuits are easily embedded into freezing automata networks, our framework also includes classical problems on circuit: circuit value problem is a sub-problem of our prediction problem (see Theorem¬†6.8) and SAT is a sub-problem of our nilpotency problem (see Remark¬†3.9 and Theorem¬†6.3). Fast parallel algorithm. We then present a NC algorithm that solves our general model checking problem SPEC on any freezing automata network with bounded number of states and graph with bounded degree and bounded treewidth (Theorem¬†4.13). It solves in particular the four canonical problems above in NC for such graphs, as well as circuit value problem and SAT (see 6  for better known results for these specific problems). Note that our algorithm is uniform in the sense that, besides the graph, both the automata network rule and the constraint to test are part of the input and not hidden in an expensive pre-processing step. As suggested above, temporal traces of the evolution of a bounded set of nodes have a space efficient representation. However, it is generally hard to distinguish real orbits projected on a set of nodes from locally valid sequences of states that respect the transition rule for these nodes. Our algorithm exploits bounded treewidth and bounded degree to solve this problem via dynamic programming for any finite set of nodes. In the deterministic case, our algorithm can completely reconstruct the orbit from the initial configuration. Hardness results. In light of Courcelle‚Äôs theorem, one might think that our algorithm solving SPEC could be directly obtained (or even improved) by simply expressing the problem in MSOL 2. We show that previous statement is impossible, unless W‚Äã=F‚ÄãP‚ÄãTùëädelimited-[]2ùêπùëÉùëáW=FPT. More precisely, we show that the version of our model checking problem where treewidth is the unique parameter and alphabet and degree are fixed is W‚Äãùëädelimited-[]2W-hard (Corollary¬†5.3), and thus is not believed to be fixed parameter tractable. We obtain a similar result on a slight variation of our problem when alphabet is the unique parameter and treewidth and degree are fixed (Corollary¬†5.4). Finally, we prove that the four problems mentioned before, (namely prediction, nilpotency, predecessor and asynchronous reachability) are complete in there respective class (respectively P-Complete and coNP- Complete for the first two, and NP-Complete for the later) when we restrict the input graphs to a constructible family of sufficiently large treewidth (Theorems¬†6.3, 6.5 and 6.8). To do so, we rely on an efficient algorithm to embed arbitrary (but polynomially smaller) digraph into our input graph (Lemma¬†6.1), which relies on polynomial perfect brambles that can be efficiently found in graphs with polynomially large treewidth 8 (here by polynomial we mean Œ©‚Äã(nŒ±)Œ©superscriptùëõùõº{\\Omega(n^{\\alpha})} for some positive real number Œ±ùõº\\alpha). This embedding allows to simulate a precise dynamics on the desired digraph inside the input graph and essentially lifts us from the graph family constraint as soon as the treewidth is large enough. Moreover, for problems prediction (Theorem¬†6.8), predecessor and asynchronous reachability (Theorem¬†6.5) we achieve the hardness result with a fixed uniform set-defined rule (i.e. a rule that change the state of each node depending only on the set of states seen in the neighborhood) which is not part of the input. This shows that there is a uniform isotropic universally hard rule for these problems, which makes sense for applications like bootstrap percolation, epidemic propagation or cristal growth where models are generally isotropic and spatially uniform.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: in any orbit.
