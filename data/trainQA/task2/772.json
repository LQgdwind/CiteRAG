      "content": "Paper Title: Assessing Safety-Critical Systems from Operational Testing: A Study on Autonomous Vehicles\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCBI was initially presented for assessing the reliability of conventional SCSs in . Several extensions, e.g.,    , have been developed, considering different prior knowledge and objective functions. CBI has recently been used for estimating catastrophic failure related parameters in the runtime formal verification of robots [ref]50, and forming safety arguments in assurance cases for deep learning . Similarly to , we have extended CBI from previous “single system/environment” applications to a scenario in which multiple systems/environments need to be considered. But the bivariate CBI theorem presented here in Section 4 is novel, since: i) the reliability measure of interest in  is a posterior expected failure rate, while here we consider a posterior confidence bound; and ii) the evidence being observed in  is only from the new system/environment, while in this paper we model evidence generated from both systems/environments (i.e. a more general form of the likelihood function). Studies in      provide descriptive statistics on AV safety and reliability. Both  and \nconclude that road testing alone is inadequate evidence of AV safety, and argue the need for other methods to supplement testing on public roads.\nWe agree, and our CBI approach provides a concrete way to incorporate such essential prior knowledge into the assessment.\nThere are preliminary Bayesian frameworks, e.g.,  , trying to account for verification and validation activities performed prior to testing. However, they assume parametric families (e.g., Beta) for prior distributions, while our CBI approach does not have this restriction and is thus more practical, and more trustworthy (through not demanding unrealistically detailed input and guaranteeing conservatism) for decisions on safety.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: considering different prior knowledge and objective functions.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
