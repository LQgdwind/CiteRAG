      "content": "Paper Title: Operationalizing Convolutional Neural Network Architectures for Prohibited Object Detection in X-Ray Imagery\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTable I presents prohibited items detection results for the first set of experiments using the CNN architectures set out in Section II are applied to OPIXray [ref]4 and SIXray  to provide benchmark performances. We observe that the best performance for OPIXray (mAP: 87.787.787.7, Table I, upper) is achieved by FreeAnchor  producing maximal AP across all five classes. Cascade R-CNN [ref]24 achieves a comparable mAP of 85.985.985.9 and both models significantly outperform the prior works FCOS+DOAM [ref]4 (mAP of 82.482.482.4).\nFor SIXray, FreeAnchor  again produces the best performance outperforming Cascade R-CNN [ref]24 (mAP: 85.885.885.8 vs 84.684.684.6, Table I, lower). Both models again outperform the prior work of CHR  in terms of mAP.\nOverall, FreeAnchor  achieves the maximal mAP for both datasets. This is possibly because FreeAnchor  does not use fixed hand-crafted anchors during detection, and it is not practical to match the anchors using predefined sizes when the prohibited items are often slender objects (knives, scissors), cluttered and overlapped under X-ray scanner. Instead, it selects the most suitable anchor from a set of candidate anchors by employing likelihood estimation for each target prohibited item. Along with AP/mAP, Table II presents the computational efficiency, training time (T, hours taken to train for 30 epochs) and speed, which are crucial criteria for operational perspective and real-world deployment applications. FreeAnchor  has ∼2×\\sim 2\\times fewer parameters than Cascade R-CNN [ref]24 while always achieving a higher computational efficiency (mAP:C) of 2.412.412.41 and 2.362.362.36 on OPIXray [ref]4 and SIXray , respectively.\nBoth models achieve real-time operational throughput (fps), which is within the belt speed (0.20.20.2 meter/second) of a standard X-ray scanner .\nFreeAnchor  achieves ∼1.08×\\sim 1.08\\times the throughput of Cascade R-CNN [ref]24 on each dataset (Table II).\nDemonstrating the trade-off that FreeAnchor  has made to exceed multi-stage Cascade R-CNN [ref]24 performance. While comparing the training time, FreeAnchor  requires the shortest time (hours) to train for both OPIXray and SIXray (T: 7.87.87.8 and T: 7.17.17.1, respectively), and trains on average in 808080% of the time required to train Cascade R-CNN [ref]24 while achieving a higher overall detection accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Table I presents prohibited items detection results for the first set of experiments using the CNN architectures set out in Section II are applied to OPIXray [ref]4 and SIXray  to provide benchmark performances.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
