      "content": "Paper Title: Robust Sylvester-Gallai type theorem for quadratic polynomials\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe PIT problem asks to give a deterministic algorithm that given an arithmetic circuit as input determines whether it computes the identically zero polynomial. The circuit can be given either via a description of its graph of computation (white-box model) or via oracle access to the polynomial that it computes (black-box model). This is a fundamental problem in theoretical computer science that has received a lot of attention from researchers in the last two decades. Besides of being a natural and elegant question, the PIT problem is important due its connections to lower bounds for arithmetic circuits (hardness-randomness tradeoffs)    3 ; its relation to other derandomization problems such as finding perfect matching deterministically, in parallel, 6 , derandomizing factoring algorithms , derandomization questions in geometric complexity theory  8; its role in algebraic natural proofs 9 2. In particular, PIT appears to be the most general algebraic derandomization problem. For more on the PIT problem see  [ref]38  7. For a survey of algebraic hardness-randomness tradeoffs see . A beautiful line of work has shown that deterministic algorithms for the PIT problem for homogeneous depth-444 circuits or for depth-333 circuits would lead to deterministic algorithms for general circuits  1. This makes small depth circuits extremely interesting for the PIT problem. This is also the setting where Sylvester-Gallai type theorems play an important role.\nThe relation between (colored-versions of the) SG-theorem and deterministic PIT algorithms for depth-333 circuits was observed in 1. The work of   used this relation to obtain polynomial- and quasi-polynomial-time PIT algorithms for depth-333 circuits, depending on the characteristic. Currently, the best algorithm for PIT of depth-333 circuits was obtained through a different yet highly related approach in . As the SG-theorem played such an important role in derandomizing PIT for depth-333 circuits, it was asked whether a similar approach could work for depth-444 circuits. This motivated  4 to raise Problem¬†1.4 and Conjecture¬†1.6. In [ref]37 we gave a positive answer to Conjecture¬†1.6 for the case of degree-222 polynomials (r=2ùëü2r=2). Interestingly, Theorem¬†1.2 played a crucial role in the proof, as well as in the proofs of  . Studying the proofs of   [ref]37 leads to the conclusion that in order to solve Problem¬†1.4 and Conjecture¬†1.6 for degrees larger than 222, we must first obtain a result analogous to Theorem¬†1.2.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: in geometric complexity theory  8; its role in algebraic natural proofs 9 2.
