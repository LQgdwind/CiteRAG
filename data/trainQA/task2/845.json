      "content": "Paper Title: Towards the Quantification of Safety Risks in Deep Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs recent works show that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples, there are constantly increasing number of attacks to generate adversarial examples with new countermeasures .\nAdversarial attacks apply heuristic search algorithms to find adversarial examples.\nStarting from Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) algorithm [ref]7,\na number of adversarial attack algorithms have been developed, including notably FGSM [ref]8, JSMA , C&W attacks , RecurJac [ref]30, one-pixel attacks , structured attack , binary attack  etc. Most of current works are guided by the forward gradient or the gradient of the cost-function, which in turn rely on the existence of first-order derivative, i.e., differentiability, of neural network. The method proposed in this paper relaxes this assumption and can work with any neural network.\nMoreover, while adversarial attacks can falsify the robustness of a neural networks,\nour method can also verify the robustness, thanks to its theoretically grounded approach of taking a Lipschitzian metric with confidence interval expression as an indicator of the robustness. Finally, beyond robustness, our metric is generic and can express other properties such as Uncertainty.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: with new countermeasures .\nAdversarial attacks apply heuristic search algorithms to find adversarial examples.\nStarting from Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) algorithm [ref]7,\na number of adversarial attack algorithms have been developed, including notably FGSM [ref]8, JSMA , C&W attacks , RecurJac [ref]30, one-pixel attacks , structured attack , binary attack\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
