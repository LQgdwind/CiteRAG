      "content": "Paper Title: Variance-Reduced Gradient Estimation via Noise-Reuse in Online Evolution Strategies\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBeyond the related work we discuss in Section¬†2 and 6 on evolution strategies methods, in this section, we discuss additional related work in gradient estimation for unrolled computation graphs, including work on automatic differentiation (AD) (reverse mode and forward mode) methods and a concurrent work on online evolution strategies.\nSome of the AD methods described in this section are compared against as baselines in our experiments in Section¬†5.1 and 5.2. When the loss function and transition functions in UCG is differentiable, the default method for computing gradients is backpropagation through time (BPTTBPTT\\mathrm{BPTT}). However, BPTTBPTT\\mathrm{BPTT} has difficulties when applied to UCGs: 1) memory issues:\nthe default BPTT implementations [e.g., 34, 35] store all activations of the graph in memory, making memory usage scale linearly with the length of the unrolled graph. There are works that improve the memory dependency of BPTTBPTT\\mathrm{BPTT}; however, they either require customized framework implementation [ref]36 [ref]37 or specially-designed reversible computation dynamics  . 2) not online: each gradient estimate using BPTTBPTT\\mathrm{BPTT} requires full forward and backward computation through the UCG, which is computationally expensive and incurs large latency between successive parameter updates. To alleviate the memory issue and allow online updates, a popular alternative is truncated backpropagation through time (TBPTTTBPTT\\mathrm{TBPTT}) which estimates the gradient within short truncation windows. However, this blocks the gradient flow to the parameters applied before the current window, making the gradient estimate biased and unable to capture long-term dependencies . In contrast, NRESNRES\\mathrm{NRES} is memory efficient, online, and doesn‚Äôt suffer from bias, while able to handle loss surfaces with extreme local sensitivity. An alternative to RMD in automatic differentiation is FMD, which computes gradient estimates through Jacobian-vector products alongside the actual forward computation, thus allowing for online applications. Among FMD methods, real-time recurrent learning (RTRLRTRL\\mathrm{RTRL})  requires a computation cost that scales with the dimension of the learnable parameter, making it intractable for large problems. To alleviate the computation cost, stochastic approximations of RTRLRTRL\\mathrm{RTRL} have been proposed: DODGEDODGE\\mathrm{DODGE}  computes directional gradient along a certain direction; UOROUORO\\mathrm{UORO}  unbiasedly approximates the Jacobian with a rank-1 matrix; KF‚àíRTRLKFRTRL\\mathrm{KF}-\\mathrm{RTRL}  and OK  uses Kronecker product decomposition to improve the gradient estimate‚Äôs variance, but are specifically for RNNs. In Section¬†5.1 and 5.2, we experiment with forward mode methods DODGEDODGE\\mathrm{DODGE} (with standard Gaussian random directions) and UOROUORO\\mathrm{UORO} and demonstrate NRESNRES\\mathrm{NRES}‚Äôs advantage over these two methods when the loss surfaces have high sensitivity to small changes in the parameter space. Finally, we note that a concurrent work [ref]19 on online evolution strategies proposes a similar algorithm (ES-Single) to the algorithm NRESNRES\\mathrm{NRES} proposed in our paper. However, their analyses and experiments differ from ours in a number of ways: Theoretical assumptions. To capture the online nature of the online ES methods considered in our paper, we adopt a novel view which treats the random truncation window that an online ES method starts from as a random variable (which we denote by ùùâùùâ\\bm{\\tau}). In contrast, this assumption is not made neither in the prior work on PES  nor in the concurrent work [ref]19. As such, these analyses cannot distinguish the theoretical difference between the estimator FullES‚Äã(Œ∏)FullESùúÉ\\mathrm{FullES}(\\theta) and NRES‚Äã(Œ∏)NRESùúÉ\\mathrm{NRES}(\\theta). Theoretical conclusions. As a result of our novel viewpoint/theoretical assumption regarding the random truncation window used in online ES methods, we provide a precise variance characterization of our newly proposed class of GPESKsubscriptGPESùêæ\\mathrm{GPES}_{K} gradient estimators. Two of the main theoretical contributions of our work are thus: a) showing that NRESNRES\\mathrm{NRES} provably has the lowest variance among the entire GPESGPES\\mathrm{GPES} class and b) identifying the conditions under which NRESNRES\\mathrm{NRES} can have lower variance than FullESFullES\\mathrm{FullES} with the same compute budget. In contrast, [ref]19 do not make such contributions ‚Äî in fact, in their theoretical analyses, they characterize their proposed method ES-Single as having the exact same variance as FullESFullES\\mathrm{FullES}, and as such they are unable to draw conclusions about the variance reduction benefits of their approach as we have done in our analyses. Experimental comparison against non-online method FullESFullES\\mathrm{FullES}. In  [ref]19, when comparing against ES methods, the authors primarily compare against online ES methods but not the canonical non-online ES method, FullESFullES\\mathrm{FullES}. In contrast, in our paper, we experimentally show that NRESNRES\\mathrm{NRES} can indeed provide significant speedup benefits over its non-online counterpart FullESFullES\\mathrm{FullES}. We believe these more complete results provide critical evidence which encourages evolution strategies users to consider switching to online methods (NRESNRES\\mathrm{NRES}) when working with unrolled computation graphs. Identifying the appropriate scenarios for the proposed method. In our work, we precisely identify problem scenarios that are most appropriate for the use of NRESNRES\\mathrm{NRES} (when the losses are extremely locally sensitive or blackbox) and provide experiments mirroring these scenarios to compare different gradient estimation (both ES and AD) methods. In contrast, [ref]19 perform some of their experiments on problems where the loss surface might not have high sensitivity (e.g., LSTM copy task) and only show performance of ES methods (but not AD methods). However, for these scenarios where the loss surfaces are well-behaved, ES methods likely should not be used in the first place over traditional AD approaches (we discuss this further in Section¬†F in the Appendix). In addition, [ref]19 treats the application of their proposed method to blackbox losses (e.g., reinforcement learning) as future work, while we provide experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of NRESNRES\\mathrm{NRES} over other ES methods for this important set of applications in Section¬†5.3.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: scale linearly with the length of the unrolled graph.
