Let λ:V→Γ:𝜆→𝑉Γ\\lambda\\colon V\\to\\Gamma.\nWe define the ΓΓ\\Gamma-CSP 𝒞H,Γ,λsuperscript𝒞𝐻Γ𝜆\\mathcal{C}^{H,\\Gamma,\\lambda} with variable set {ye|e∈E}conditional-setsubscript𝑦𝑒𝑒𝐸\\{\\mathchoice{\\,}{}{}{}y_{e}\\;|\\;e\\in E\\mathchoice{\\,}{}{}{}\\} and linear equations In case Γ=ℤ2Γsubscriptℤ2\\Gamma=\\mathbb{Z}_{2}, we obtain the classic Tseitin tautologies .\nSince we fix ΓΓ\\Gamma, G𝐺G, and H𝐻H in this section,\nwe will omit the superscripts and write 𝒞λsuperscript𝒞𝜆\\mathcal{C}^{\\lambda} for 𝒞H,Γ,λsuperscript𝒞𝐻Γ𝜆\\mathcal{C}^{H,\\Gamma,\\lambda}.\nWe will also identify the variables with the edges\nand view 𝒞λsuperscript𝒞𝜆\\mathcal{C}^{\\lambda} as a CSP with variable set E𝐸E.\nThe CSP 𝒞λsuperscript𝒞𝜆\\mathcal{C}^{\\lambda} is solvable if and only if ∑v∈Vλ​(v)=0subscript𝑣𝑉𝜆𝑣0\\sum_{v\\in V}\\lambda(v)=0 [ref]8.\nFor every set W⊆V𝑊𝑉W\\subseteq V,\nthe CSP 𝒞λsuperscript𝒞𝜆\\mathcal{C}^{\\lambda} implies the constraint C​(W)𝐶𝑊C(W) defined via For λ:V→Γ:𝜆→𝑉Γ\\lambda\\colon V\\to\\Gamma and a set X⊆E𝑋𝐸X\\subseteq E,\na partial assignment f:X→Γ:𝑓→𝑋Γf\\colon X\\to\\Gamma for 𝒞λsuperscript𝒞𝜆\\mathcal{C}^{\\lambda} is ℓℓ\\ell-consistent,\nif for every W∈(V≤ℓ)𝑊binomial𝑉absentℓW\\in\\binom{V}{\\leq\\ell} such that δ​(W)⊆X𝛿𝑊𝑋\\delta(W)\\subseteq X, the assignment f𝑓f satisfies the constraint C​(W)𝐶𝑊C(W).\nNote that f𝑓f is a partial solution if it is 111-consistent.\nWe call f𝑓f robustly consistent if it is n/3𝑛3n/3-consistent. For all λ:V→Γ:𝜆→𝑉Γ\\lambda\\colon V\\to\\Gamma and X∈(E≤k)𝑋binomial𝐸absent𝑘X\\in\\tbinom{E}{\\leq k},\nthere is a robustly consistent partial assignment f:X→Γ:𝑓→𝑋Γf\\colon X\\to\\Gamma for 𝒞λsuperscript𝒞𝜆\\mathcal{C}^{\\lambda}. If Γ=Γ1×Γ2ΓsubscriptΓ1subscriptΓ2\\Gamma=\\Gamma_{1}\\times\\Gamma_{2} is a direct product and there is an i∈{1,2}𝑖12i\\in\\{1,2\\} such that, for all v∈V𝑣𝑉v\\in V, the group element λ​(v)𝜆𝑣\\lambda(v) is zero in the ΓisubscriptΓ𝑖\\Gamma_{i}-entry, then f​(e)𝑓𝑒f(e) can be taken to be zero in the ΓisubscriptΓ𝑖\\Gamma_{i}-entry for all e∈X𝑒𝑋e\\in X. For |X|=1𝑋1|X|=1, it is clear that there are robustly consistent partial solutions.\nIt then follows from Lemmas 4.4 and 4.5 in [ref]8 that such a robustly consistent partial solution can always be extended while maintaining robust consistency, as long as the domain size is constant.\nIt is also clear (and can be seen from the proofs of Lemmas 4.4 and 4.5 in [ref]8) that f𝑓f can be defined such that f​(e)𝑓𝑒f(e) is always zero in the ΓisubscriptΓ𝑖\\Gamma_{i}-entry if λ𝜆\\lambda is zero in ΓisubscriptΓ𝑖\\Gamma_{i}.\n∎ When we view 𝒞λsuperscript𝒞𝜆\\mathcal{C}^{\\lambda} as a homomorphism problem,\nthen for every X⊆E𝑋𝐸X\\subseteq E,\na partial solution f:X→Γ:𝑓→𝑋Γf\\colon X\\to\\Gamma of 𝒞λsuperscript𝒞𝜆\\mathcal{C}^{\\lambda} (so in particular a robustly consistent partial assignment)\nis a homomorphism in Hom​(𝒞λ,𝚪3)Homsuperscript𝒞𝜆subscript𝚪3\\mathrm{Hom}(\\mathcal{C}^{\\lambda},\\mathbf{\\Gamma}_{3})\nand vice versa\n(recall that 𝚪3subscript𝚪3\\mathbf{\\Gamma}_{3} is the template structure for 333-ary ΓΓ\\Gamma-CSPs). For every λ:V→Γ:𝜆→𝑉Γ\\lambda\\colon V\\to\\Gamma,\nthe k𝑘k-consistency algorithm does not rule out any robustly consistent partial assignments.\nThis means that, for every X∈(E≤k)𝑋binomial𝐸absent𝑘X\\in\\binom{E}{\\leq k}, every robustly consistent assignment\ncontained in Hom​(𝒞λ​[X],𝚪3)Homsuperscript𝒞𝜆delimited-[]𝑋subscript𝚪3\\mathrm{Hom}(\\mathcal{C}^{\\lambda}[X],\\mathbf{\\Gamma}_{3})\nis contained in κk𝚪3​[𝒞λ]​(X)superscriptsubscript𝜅𝑘subscript𝚪3delimited-[]superscript𝒞𝜆𝑋\\kappa_{k}^{\\mathbf{\\Gamma}_{3}}[\\mathcal{C}^{\\lambda}](X).

So this restriction is also robustly consistent. For the forth-condition, let f∈Hom​(𝒞λ​[X],𝚪3)n/3𝑓Homsubscriptsuperscript𝒞𝜆delimited-[]𝑋subscript𝚪3𝑛3f\\in\\mathrm{Hom}(\\mathcal{C}^{\\lambda}[X],\\mathbf{\\Gamma}_{3})_{n/3}, for some |X|<k𝑋𝑘|X|<k. Let y∈E∖X𝑦𝐸𝑋y\\in E\\setminus X. We need to show that there exists an f′∈Hom​(𝒞λ​[X∪{y}],𝚪3)n/3superscript𝑓′Homsubscriptsuperscript𝒞𝜆delimited-[]𝑋𝑦subscript𝚪3𝑛3f^{\\prime}\\in\\mathrm{Hom}(\\mathcal{C}^{\\lambda}[X\\cup\\{y\\}],\\mathbf{\\Gamma}_{3})_{n/3} that extends f𝑓f.\nThis is again proven in Lemmas 4.4 and 4.5 in [ref]8.\n∎ For all λ:V→Γ:𝜆→𝑉Γ\\lambda\\colon V\\to\\Gamma and X∈(E≤k)𝑋binomial𝐸absent𝑘X\\in\\binom{E}{\\leq k},\nwe have κk𝚪3​[𝒞λ]​(X)≠∅superscriptsubscript𝜅𝑘subscript𝚪3delimited-[]superscript𝒞𝜆𝑋\\kappa_{k}^{\\mathbf{\\Gamma}_{3}}[\\mathcal{C}^{\\lambda}](X)\\neq\\emptyset. Combine Lemmas 18 and 19.\n∎ For a prime p𝑝p, a p𝑝p-group is a group in which the order of every element is a power of p𝑝p. For instance, ℤ2subscriptℤ2\\mathbb{Z}_{2} is a 222-group and ℤ3subscriptℤ3\\mathbb{Z}_{3} a 333-group. If Γ′≤ΓsuperscriptΓ′Γ\\Gamma^{\\prime}\\leq\\Gamma is a p𝑝p-group,\nand λ:V→Γ′:𝜆→𝑉superscriptΓ′\\lambda\\colon V\\to\\Gamma^{\\prime},\nthen there is a p𝑝p-solution of 𝖫𝖢𝖲𝖯k,𝚪3​(𝒞λ)subscriptsuperscript𝖫𝑘subscript𝚪3𝖢𝖲𝖯superscript𝒞𝜆\\mathsf{L}^{k,\\mathbf{\\Gamma}_{3}}_{\\mathsf{CSP}}(\\mathcal{C}^{\\lambda}) such that non-robustly consistent partial assignments are mapped to 00, each robustly consistent partial solution is mapped to 1/pℓ1superscript𝑝ℓ1/p^{\\ell} for some ℓ∈ℕℓℕ\\ell\\in\\mathbb{N}, and each partial assignment whose image is not in Γ′superscriptΓ′\\Gamma^{\\prime} is mapped to 00.
