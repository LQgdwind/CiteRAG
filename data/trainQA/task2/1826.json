Then we show how ASSENT can be used to synthesize\nelectrical circuits in two cases. In the first case, we use ASSENT for architecture search and\ncomponent selection to design a circuit that achieves the functionality of a two-stage\ntransimpedance amplifier. In the second case, we select the component values for a fixed\narchitecture for two-stage and three-stage transimpedance amplifiers.\nWe implement ASSENT using Keras ,\nScikit-learn , Gurobi , and PyGMO . The simulations\nare performed on an Intel Xeon processor with 64 GB of DRAM.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: how ASSENT can be used for component selection in the\ndesign of the following benchmarks: Lunar lander , Acrobot ,\nPolak3 , Waveglider ,\nRover path planning , and sensor placement for a power grid [ref]9.
