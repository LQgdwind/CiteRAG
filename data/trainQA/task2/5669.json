      "content": "Paper Title: Distortion-Disentangled Contrastive Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHigh-quality representation learning has been a core topic in deep learning research, which is challenging for computer vision due to the low information density [ref]24 . In recent years, label-free un/self-supervised contrastive learning methods with instance discrimination as a pretext task undergo steady development, rapidly closing the performance gap with supervised learning methods and demonstrating reliable generalization capabilities [ref]8 [ref]24   [ref]12. Some previous studies have used different augmented views of the same instance as positive samples with other instances in the mini-batch as negative samples. They employ a series of query-key operations to classify samples in the mini-batch and train models to extract the discriminative representations. However, such methods require a large set of positive and negative samples to provide sufficient negative information, such as using large batch sizes [ref]8  , memory banks  , and memory queues [ref]24   . Recent POCL methods have achieved superior performance without the use of negative samples   [ref]12. These methods aim to minimize the distance between positive sample pairs in the feature space and extract the distortion invariant representation (DIR) by explicitly supervising the Euclidean distance , cross-correlation , or vector angle [ref]12 of the positive sample pairs. The implicit objective of the POCL methods is to filter out or ignore the distortion variant representation (DVR) using the aforementioned supervision to extract the DIR of the positive sample pairs. However, some recent studies   have shown that the appropriate use of complex distortion strategy and DVR in contrastive learning can improve the performance of models in downstream domain-specific tasks. In addition, the performance of these POCL methods is sensitive to augmentations. As such, augmentation strategies need to be carefully selected for generating positive sample pairs . We do observe that these methods have unstable performance on the same test set with different augmentations. Motivated by these, we argue that filtering out or ignoring the DVR using a single loss (i.e., DIR loss) that only supervises the DIR is straightforward but insufficient for representation supervision and utilization in the POCL method. Such inadequately supervised representation may result in the DIR and DVR being entangled in the learned representation, leading to reduced performance. Therefore, we propose a novel POCL framework, named Distortion-Disentangled Contrastive Learning (DDCL). Unlike previous studies, DDCL does not use augmented information, multi-head structures, or augmentation-specific predictions. This fully adaptive training method makes DDCL applicable to more complex augmentation strategies. In DDCL, we group the last layer (i.e., overall representation) of the encoder into two parts to extract the DIR and DVR. The first part is utilized to extract the DIR using the DIR loss of the corresponding original POCL method. The remaining part is utilized to extract the DVR using our novel loss. We propose a novel Distortion-Disentangled Loss (DDL) to independently supervise the DVR by making the DVRs of a positive sample pair orthogonal. As shown in Fig. 1, DDL explicitly extracts and disentangles the DVR from the overall representation. It is worth noting that the disentangled DVR is not noise or useless information but contains valuable features and distortion information. We further analyze this in Sec. 4.6. By concatenating the DIR and DVR in the following inference task, the model’s convergence, representation ability, and robustness are further improved without additional parameters and computation. We conduct experiments on two existing POCL methods, i.e., Barlow Twins  and Simsiam [ref]12. They both use a two-branch architecture and their losses are only designed to extract DIR. Experiments demonstrate that our DDCL and DDL are adaptable to different POCL architectures and corresponding DIR losses, achieving improved performance compared to the original POCL methods. Our main contributions are as follows: We propose a novel POCL framework, named DDCL, which explicitly disentangles the representation into DIR and DVR. DDCL can adaptively extract the DVR without any other manual designs, which makes DDCL applicable and flexible to more complex augmentation strategies. We can utilize the DVR to enhance the model’s performance and robustness. In DDCL, we propose a novel objective function, DDL, which explicitly supervises and extracts the DVR for its efficient use in the downstream task. Our proposed DDCL can be adapted to current popular POCL methods. It improves the convergence, representation ability, and robustness without additional inference parameters or computation.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: High-quality representation learning has been a core topic in deep learning research, which is challenging for computer vision due to the low information density [ref]24 .
