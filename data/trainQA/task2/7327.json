      "content": "Paper Title: Spatial-Aware Latent Initialization for Controllable Image Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, deep generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) , Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) , Flow-based Models , and Diffusion Models (DMs)   [ref]26 [ref]23 , have all demonstrated immense potential in generating realistic images by incorporating extensive training datasets and scalable architectures. Among them, diffusion models have emerged as cutting-edge generative models due to their impressive ability to synthesize high-quality data by gradually denoising the initialization Gaussian noise. In particular, text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion [ref]26, DALL-E-2 [ref]23, and Imagen , can generate imaginative images given textual input, dramatically improving the efficiency of artists. Despite the significant achievements of current text-to-image diffusion models in image generation, there remain important challenges that need to be addressed, particularly in achieving precise control over the position description provided in the textual prompt. Previous work  evaluates state-of-the-art (SOTA) text-to-image diffusion models and reveals that even these models struggle to comprehend the spatial location requirements within the textual inputs. The primary obstacle lies in the semantic gap between texts and images, indicating that relying solely on texts is insufficient to convey spatial information effectively in images. To address this issue, previous studies 2 0 propose to train diffusion models from scratch by using layout-image data pairs. While these approaches achieve commendable layout controllability, they overlook the potential of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models and require a substantial amount of annotated data pairs. Moreover, their generalization capability in open environments is limited 2. On the other hand, to avoid additional training or fine-tuning of pre-trained diffusion models, recent works [ref]2  propose optimizing the noisy data during the sampling process to align cross-attention maps with layout conditions. Unfortunately, these methods fail to consistently achieve satisfactory performance in terms of both the layout control accuracy and image quality. Different from previous works, Mao et al.  discover that layout control can be achieved by modifying the initialization noise.\nHowever, their proposed method can only achieve rough guidance based on the provided spatial description. Note that the image generation process is primarily influenced by the initialization noise, the diffusion model, and the text prompt. In particular, we empirically find that the initialization noise plays an important role in zero-shot layout guidance approaches [ref]2 . Specifically, the presence of spatial layout information within the initialization noise helps enhance the layout guidance, and the accuracy is proportional to the level of such spatial awareness. Motivated by this, we propose utilizing a spatial-aware latent that contains spatial layout information within the provided layout area as the initialization noise for sampling images. To further enhance layout control, we introduce an additional attention guidance process during sampling. Notably, due to our spatial-aware latent initialization approach, the number of optimization iterations required is significantly reduced.\nIt is worth noting that our proposed method does not require any additional training or fine-tuning on pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. As illustrated in Fig. 1, given textual prompts and layout requirements, our approach achieves controllable generation in terms of the layout and quality of generated images. In summary, our contributions are as follows: Through empirical studies, we find that the cross-attention map alignment method achieves effective layout guidance when the layout of images denoised from an initialization noise is close to the target position description. However, random initialization noise lacks such spatial awareness. Consequently, the resultant layout of generated images may be significantly influenced by other factors such as the denoising process and prompts. To address this issue, we aim to find a spatial-aware initialization noise for better layout control. We propose utilizing the DDIM  inversion latent from finite steps as the spatial-aware initialization noise. In particular, given various prompts, the spatial information introduced by the DDIM inversion latent remains stable throughout the denoising process. Our proposed spatial-aware latent initialization can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play module into existing layout guidance frameworks to enhance the effectiveness of layout control. We provide extensive experimental results, which demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms SOTA zero-shot layout guidance methods on IoU and mAP@0.5 by more than 15% and 25%, respectively, while maintaining a comparable CLIP score.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: In recent years, deep generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) , Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) , Flow-based Models , and Diffusion Models (DMs)   [ref]26 [ref]23 , have all demonstrated immense potential in generating realistic images by incorporating extensive training datasets and scalable architectures.
