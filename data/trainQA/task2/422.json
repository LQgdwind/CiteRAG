      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Efficient Scheduling of Federated Mobile Devices under Computational and Statistical Heterogeneity\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMcMahan et al. introduce FedAvg that averages aggregated parameters from the local devices and minimizes a global loss [ref]2. Formally, for the local loss function lk​(⋅)​(k∈{1,2,⋯,N})subscript𝑙𝑘⋅𝑘12⋯𝑁l_{k}(\\cdot)(k\\in\\{1,2,\\cdots,N\\}) of N𝑁N mobile devices, FL minimizes the global loss L𝐿L by averaging the local weights 𝒘𝒘\\bm{w}, In each round, mobile device k𝑘k performs a number of E𝐸E local updates, with learning rate ηisubscript𝜂𝑖\\eta_{i} and i={0,1,⋯,E}𝑖01⋯𝐸i=\\{0,1,\\cdots,E\\}. The local updates 𝒘Eksuperscriptsubscript𝒘𝐸𝑘\\bm{w}_{E}^{k} are aggregated towards the server for averaging, and the server broadcasts the global model to the mobile devices to initiate the next round. From the user’s persecutive, one may advocate designs without much central coordination. As most of the FL approaches pursue the first-order synchronous approach [ref]2 [ref]4     [ref]10, the starting time of the next round is determined by the straggler in the last round, who finishes the last among all the users. Hence, from the service provider’s perspective, it is far from efficient due to the straggler problem. It leads to slower convergence and generates a less performing model with low accuracy and ultimately undermines the collaborative efforts from all the users. A solution is to switch to asynchronous update  . Asynchronous methods allow the faster users to resume computation without waiting for the stragglers. However, inconsistent gradients could easily lead to divergence and amortize the savings in computation time. Though it is possible to estimate the gradient of the stragglers using second-order Taylor expansion, the computation and memory cost of the Hessian matrix become prohibitive for complex models . In the worst case, gradients from the stragglers that are multiple epoches old could significantly divert model convergence to a local minima. For example, the learning process typically decreases the learning rate to facilitate convergence on the course of training. The stragglers’s stale gradients with a large learning rate would exacerbate such divergence . The practical solution from Google is to simply drop out the stragglers in large scale implementation . Yet, for those small-scale federated tasks, e.g., learning from a small set of selected patients with rare disease, such hard drop-out could be detrimental to model generalization and accuracy. Gradient coding  replicates copies of data between users so when there is a slow-down, any linear combination from the neighbors can still recover the global gradient. It is suitable for GPU clusters, where all the nodes are authenticated and data can be moved without privacy concerns. Nevertheless, sharing raw data among users defeats the original privacy-preserving purpose of FL, thereby rendering such pre-sharing method unsuitable for distributed mobile environments. As a key difference from distributed learning, non-IIDness is discussed in  [ref]4 . It is shown in  that for strongly convex and smooth problems, FedAvg still retains the same convergence rate on non-IID data. However, convergence may be brittle for the rest non-convex majorities like multi-layer neural networks. As a remedy, [ref]4 pre-shares a subset of non-sensitive global data to mobile devices and  utilizes a generative model to restore the data back to IID, but at non-negligible computation, communication and coordination efforts. Another thread of works address the common problem of communication efficiency in FL   [ref]10   . The full model is compressed and cast into a low-dimensional space for bandwidth saving in . Local updates that diverge from the global model are identified and excluded to avoid unnecessary communication . Decentralized approaches and convergence are discussed in [ref]10 when users only exchange gradients with their neighbors. Evolutionary algorithm is explored to minimize communication cost and test error in a multi-objective optimization . The challenges from system, statistics and fault tolerance are jointly formulated into a unified multi-task learning framework . A new architecture is proposed with tiered gradient aggregation for saving network bandwidth . Such aggregation re-weights the individual’s contribution to the global model, that may unwittingly emphasize the share of non-IID users. As recommended by , a practical way to save the monetary cost of communication is to schedule FL tasks at night when the devices are usually charging and connected to WiFi. These efforts are orthogonal to our research and can be efficiently integrated to complement our design. Our study has fundamental difference from a large body of works in scheduling paralleled machines 1 2 3. First, rather than targeting at jobs submitted by cloud users, we delve into a more microcosmic level and jointly consider partitioning a learning task and makespan minimization, where the cost function is characterized from real experimental traces. Second, FL calls for the scheduling algorithm to be aware of non-IIDness and model accuracy when workloads are partitioned. Hence, our work is among the first to address computational and statistical heterogeneity on mobile devices.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: McMahan et al. introduce FedAvg that averages aggregated parameters from the local devices and minimizes a global loss [ref]2.
