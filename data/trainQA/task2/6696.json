      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Source Domain Adaptation through Dataset Dictionary Learning in Wasserstein Space\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the following discussion, we need to extend the definition of risk of a classifier hℎh, for pairs (h,h′)∈ℋℎsuperscriptℎ′ℋ(h,h^{\\prime})\\in\\mathcal{H}, as is done in , This is different to what was presented in section 3.1, but is needed to state the results that follow. Note that, under the assumption that ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} suffices the triangle inequality, so does ℛQsubscriptℛ𝑄\\mathcal{R}_{Q} for h1,h2,h3∈ℋsubscriptℎ1subscriptℎ2subscriptℎ3ℋh_{1},h_{2},h_{3}\\in\\mathcal{H}. We start by bounding risks under P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q by their Wasserstein distance. (Due to )\nLet P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q be two probability distributions over ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}. Assume that the cost function c​(𝐱(P),𝐱(Q))=∥ϕ​(𝐱(P))−ϕ​(𝐱(Q))∥ℱ𝑐superscript𝐱𝑃superscript𝐱𝑄subscriptdelimited-∥∥italic-ϕsuperscript𝐱𝑃italic-ϕsuperscript𝐱𝑄ℱc(\\mathbf{x}^{(P)},\\mathbf{x}^{(Q)})=\\lVert\\phi(\\mathbf{x}^{(P)})-\\phi(\\mathbf{x}^{(Q)})\\rVert_{\\mathcal{F}}, where ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space equipped with kernel Φ:ℝd×ℝd→ℝ:Φ→superscriptℝ𝑑superscriptℝ𝑑ℝ\\Phi:\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} induced by ϕ:ℝd→ℋk:italic-ϕ→superscriptℝ𝑑subscriptℋ𝑘\\phi:\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{H}_{k} and Φ​(𝐱(P),𝐱(Q))=⟨ϕ​(𝐱(P)),ϕ​(𝐱(Q))⟩ℱΦsuperscript𝐱𝑃superscript𝐱𝑄subscriptitalic-ϕsuperscript𝐱𝑃italic-ϕsuperscript𝐱𝑄ℱ\\Phi(\\mathbf{x}^{(P)},\\mathbf{x}^{(Q)})=\\langle\\phi(\\mathbf{x}^{(P)}),\\phi(\\mathbf{x}^{(Q)})\\rangle_{\\mathcal{F}}. Assume that the kernel Φ∈ℱΦℱ\\Phi\\in\\mathcal{F} is square-root integrable w.r.t. both P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q and 0≤Φ​(𝐱(P),𝐱(Q))≤M0Φsuperscript𝐱𝑃superscript𝐱𝑄𝑀0\\leq\\Phi(\\mathbf{x}^{(P)},\\mathbf{x}^{(Q)})\\leq M, ∀𝐱(P),𝐱(Q)∈ℝdfor-allsuperscript𝐱𝑃superscript𝐱𝑄superscriptℝ𝑑\\forall\\mathbf{x}^{(P)},\\mathbf{x}^{(Q)}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}. Then the following holds, Note. Following , Hölder’s inequality implies that p≤q⟹Wp≤Wq𝑝𝑞subscript𝑊𝑝subscript𝑊𝑞p\\leq q\\implies W_{p}\\leq W_{q}, where Wpsubscript𝑊𝑝W_{p} corresponds to the Wasserstein distance with ground-cost c​(𝐱(P),𝐱(Q))=∥𝐱(P)−𝐱(Q)∥pp𝑐superscript𝐱𝑃superscript𝐱𝑄superscriptsubscriptdelimited-∥∥superscript𝐱𝑃superscript𝐱𝑄𝑝𝑝c(\\mathbf{x}^{(P)},\\mathbf{x}^{(Q)})=\\lVert\\mathbf{x}^{(P)}-\\mathbf{x}^{(Q)}\\rVert_{p}^{p}. As consequence, bound 13 is also valid for the Euclidean distance. The consequence of Lemma 1 relates the risk of a pair (h,h′)ℎsuperscriptℎ′(h,h^{\\prime}) under distributions P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q by the Wasserstein distance. This is in line with other theoretical results, such as . Before relating the risks of hℎh with the empirical Wasserstein distance, one needs to establish the convergence of the empirical P^^𝑃\\hat{P} to\nthe true P𝑃P. This is done in the next lemma. (Due to ) Let P𝑃P be a probability distribution over ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}, so that for some α>0𝛼0\\alpha>0 we have that ∫ℝdeα​‖𝐱‖2​𝑑P<∞subscriptsuperscriptℝ𝑑superscript𝑒𝛼superscriptnorm𝐱2differential-d𝑃\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{d}}e^{\\alpha||\\mathbf{x}||^{2}}dP<\\infty and P^^𝑃\\hat{P} be its associated empirical approximation with support {𝐱i(P)}i=1nsuperscriptsubscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝐱𝑖𝑃𝑖1𝑛\\{\\mathbf{x}_{i}^{(P)}\\}_{i=1}^{n} drawn independently from P𝑃P. Then, for any d′>dsuperscript𝑑′𝑑d^{\\prime}>d and ξ′<2superscript𝜉′2\\xi^{\\prime}<\\sqrt{2} there is a constant n0subscript𝑛0n_{0} depending on d′superscript𝑑′d^{\\prime} and some square exponential moment of P𝑃P such that for any ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0 and n≥n0​max​(ϵ−(d′+2),1)𝑛subscript𝑛0maxsuperscriptitalic-ϵsuperscript𝑑′21n\\geq n_{0}\\text{max}(\\epsilon^{-(d^{\\prime}+2)},1), where d′superscript𝑑′d^{\\prime} and ξ′superscript𝜉′\\xi^{\\prime} can be calculated explicitly. Lemma 2 states the conditions for which P^^𝑃\\hat{P} and P𝑃P are close in the sense of Wasserstein. This last bound is on the form ℙ​[q​u​a​n​t​i​t​y>ϵ]<δℙdelimited-[]𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑦italic-ϵ𝛿\\mathbb{P}[quantity>\\epsilon]<\\delta, that is, with high probability q​u​a​n​t​i​t​y≤ϵ𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑦italic-ϵquantity\\leq\\epsilon. These types of bounds are ubiquitous in the theoretical analysis of learning algorithms. We can express ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon explicitly in terms of δ𝛿\\delta, which will be useful in the following discussion. We recall that, as stated in [9, Theorem 2], and Theorem 1, under suitable conditions, These results allowed  to provide theoretical guarantees for the OTDA framework of [ref]1. As discussed in , the minimization of W2​(P^,Q^)subscript𝑊2^𝑃^𝑄W_{2}(\\hat{P},\\hat{Q}) alone does not guarantees DA success. As illustrated by the authors, during transportation one can minimize the domain distance while mixing classes. This leads to a situation where one has a low W2subscript𝑊2W_{2}, but a risk ℛPsubscriptℛ𝑃\\mathcal{R}_{P} high over all h∈ℋℎℋh\\in\\mathcal{H}. The same reasoning may be applied to the joint error λ𝜆\\lambda. A few assumptions need to be done at this point, The distribution P^′superscript^𝑃′\\hat{P}^{\\prime} which reduces W2​(⋅,Q^)subscript𝑊2⋅^𝑄W_{2}(\\cdot,\\hat{Q}) has distinguishable classes, i.e., ℛP′​(h)subscriptℛsuperscript𝑃′ℎ\\mathcal{R}_{P^{\\prime}}(h) is low. The distribution P^′superscript^𝑃′\\hat{P}^{\\prime} which reduces W2​(⋅,Q^)subscript𝑊2⋅^𝑄W_{2}(\\cdot,\\hat{Q}) has the same class-structure as Q^^𝑄\\hat{Q} (i.e. classes lie on the same side of the boundary). In other words, λ𝜆\\lambda is low. We now recast this theorem and hypothesis in terms of DaDiL-R. First, one has Q=QT𝑄subscript𝑄𝑇Q=Q_{T}, i.e., the target domain distribution. Second, one uses P=BT𝑃subscript𝐵𝑇P=B_{T}, i.e., the barycentric reconstruction of the target, through our dictionary. Our algorithm regulates ℛBTsubscriptℛsubscript𝐵𝑇\\mathcal{R}_{B_{T}} by integrating the labels in the ground-cost. As a consequence, giving mass to samples with different classes is too costly, and the OT transport plans are class sparse, i.e. πi​j>0⇔yi(P)=yj(Q)iffsubscript𝜋𝑖𝑗0superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑃superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑗𝑄\\pi_{ij}>0\\iff y_{i}^{(P)}=y_{j}^{(Q)}. The second hypothesis is difficult to ensure in unsupervised DA, as one does not have any information about the class structure of Q^^𝑄\\hat{Q}. As [ref]1 and , we assume a degree of regularity in the distributional shift of distributions in 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q}. This allows us to predict classes in the target, through label propagation.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: in the following discussion.
