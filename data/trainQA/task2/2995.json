      "content": "Paper Title: Regular Decision Processes for Grid Worlds\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSequential decision making under uncertainty, often simply denoted by its core algorithmic subfield reinforcement learning (RL)   , has been showing a huge amount of progress the last decades. Among the recent breakthroughs is the progression of DeepMind’s RL methods solving the board game Go , chess, Atari computer games, the real-time strategy game StarCraft II, and lately chip design . The algorithms employ combinations of (Monte Carlo) planning and value function approximation using deep neural networks. Underlying typical RL systems is the Markov decision process (MDP) 0 in which states carry all necessary information to choose (optimal) actions. The Markov property dictates that given the present, the future is independent of the past. To scale to more complex problems, one can exploit structure in the space of state(-action) spaces, or policies or value functions, to utilize abstractions and approximations, for example as value function approximation, state space abstractions , and hierarchical decompositions, cf. . Many current deep RL algorithms too assume the environment behaves as an MDP . To scale to larger problems, the Markov property is no longer adequate, and one may require dependence on a history of events and observations. For example, consider a robotic waiter working in a restaurant. It needs to deliver food and beverages to tables, but only after it has been requested by guests, and at the end the guests need to pay the price of the items delivered earlier. However, keeping a history of every possible event that ever occurred soon becomes practically infeasible. One well-known class of non-Markov MDP extensions is the partially observable MDP  in which the current state can be represented as a probability distribution over (latent) state features, denoted a belief state. Despite the existence of effective POMDP algorithms, many in robotics domains, the general class of POMDPs is computationally much more complex than MDPs, it is not easy to decide what the belief state should include exactly, and how much history should be included, and updating and interpreting the belief states is non-trivial. A prominent RL direction  is to model dependence on the arbitrary past explicitly resulting in non-Markovian variants of MDPs. Inspired by seminal work  the idea is to utilize modern logical languages such as linear temporal logic  to represent goals and reward functions over past traces, and to employ formal computer science techniques (e.g. automata, verification and model-checking) in decision making. A core idea here is to compile a temporal specification of a reward function into an automaton that monitors the fulfillment of the temporal formula. Monitors allow for compiling the original non-Markov problem back into the MDP framework such that all existing algorithms, including deep RL, can be employed. This fruitful marriage of RL and formal verification combines flexible behavior learning algorithms with formal performance guarantees. One motivation for employing temporal logic in RL comes from the ability to elegantly specify complex reward structures as in the waiter example, where earnings depend on an ordered series of events in the history. Another, more general, motivation is the need to constrain RL behaviors using (declarative) knowledge about which behaviors are desired or considered safe , for example to teach an autonomous car how to drive while still obeying traffic rules. Transparent safety of learned behaviors is often part of a general desire for AI systems to behave responsibly and explainable  [ref]24 . In this paper we empirically investigate algorithmic variations in one of the most recently introduced models, regular decision processes (RDP) , in which reward functions and transition functions can be specified using temporal logic. We employ RDPs specifically for grid worlds, which are archetypical problem scenarios in RL and allow for focused experimentation with new representations and algorithms. More specifically, our contributions are i) a novel tool chain implementing RDPs, utilizing exisiting algorithms and tools for RL and model checking, ii) an empirical investigation of the recently introduced RDPs in grid worlds, iii) algorithmic RL extensions to learn RDP behaviors based on Monte Carlo value estimation and incremental (online) compilation of RDPs, and iv) initial steps towards an (empirical) investigation of the trade-offs between temporal logical specifications and the complexity of learning. The paper is organized as follows: we first provide all necessary background in the next section, after which we discuss our approach in Section 3, then we continue with an extensive experimental evaluation in Section 4 and we conclude in Section 5.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: an autonomous car how to drive while still obeying traffic rules.
