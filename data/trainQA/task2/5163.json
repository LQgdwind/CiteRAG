Adversarial examples are inputs with small perturbations added, such that machine learning models misclassify them with high confidence. Addressing the security risks posed by adversarial examples are critical for the safe deployment of machine learning in areas like health care  and self driving vehicles . However, current defenses and attacks in adversarial machine learning have trended towards a cat and mouse dynamic, where in new defenses are being proposed and then broken     by improved attacks. In parallel to attack and defense development, studies have also been conducted on the transferability of adversarial examples   . Transferabiltiy refers to the phenomena where adversarial examples generated for one model are also misclassified by a different machine learning model. However, to the best of our knowledge no analyses have been done on the transferability of adversarial examples designed to attack specific defenses. From these observations several pertinent questions arise: Do adversarial examples generated for one specific defense transfer to other defenses? Based on adversarial transferability, can a game theoretic framework be developed to determine the optimal choices for both attacker and defender? How can the addition of multi-defense consensus voting (adversarial detection) and multi-model attacks be exploited by both the attacker and defender within a game theoretic framework? These are precisely the questions our paper seeks to answer. We break from the traditional dynamic of adversarial machine learning, which focuses on the single best attack and defense. We instead take a multi-faceted approach and develop a game theoretic framework to answer the above questions. We provide the following contributions: Defense Transferability Analysis- We analyze the adversarial transferability of state-of-the-art defenses like Trash is Treasure , Barrage of Random Transforms , Friendly Adversarial Training  and other new architectures like SNNs   and ViTs . We show specific attacks on defenses do no transfer well, meaning there is potential for a combinational defense within a game theoretic framework. New Combinational Adversarial Attacks - We develop three new attacks: the Momentum Iterative Method over Expectation attack (MIME), the Multi-Agent Gradient Expectation attack (MAGE) and detector based Multi-Agent Gradient Expectation attack (MAGE-D). These attacks are designed to create the strongest possible adversary to attack randomized and multi-classifier based defenses. Game theoretic Mixed Experts - We propose a game-theoretic framework for finding approximately optimal strategies for adversarial attackers and defenders that can implement multi-model attack and defense techniques. We mathematically derive our framework, and empirical test it by implementing multiple state-of-the-art adversarial attacks and defenses on two datasets, CIFAR-10  and Tiny ImageNet . Through our framework we demonstrate that we are able to achieve a 37.3% increase in robustness on CIFAR-10, and a 45.65% increase on Tiny ImageNet over all single-model defenses we tested. In contrast to previous works studying similar adversarial games [ref]32, our framework is more comprehensive, state-of-the-art, and includes broader analyses. Specifically, we consider an adversary that can employ both state-of-the-art single model and multi-model attacks (of which we formulate three new ones). Likewise, our defender is different from [ref]32 in that they can utilize randomized transformations, different voting schemes, and adversarial detection mechanisms. Overall, our paper demonstrates that by using our framework, higher robustness can be achieved than any single state-of-the art defense we studied.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: Machine learning models have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples [ref]11 [ref]26.
