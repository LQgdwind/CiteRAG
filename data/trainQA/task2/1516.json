      "content": "Paper Title: Knowledge Distillation Methods for Efficient Unsupervised Adaptation Across Multiple Domains\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques alleviate the problem of domain shift of a deep learning model that is trained on a labeled source domain data, using unlabeled data from a target domain. Currently, UDA can be achieved by encouraging domain confusion [ref]3 [ref]4, learning domain-invariant features [ref]2 , mapping between source and target domains   , ensemble learning , statistic normalization  and target discriminate methods. Domain confusion between source and target domain has been done by employing an adversarial loss[ref]4  or by using a gradient reversal layer like [ref]3 in combination with a domain classifier. Differently, a model can also learn domain-invariant features, for example, by minimizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between source and target [ref]2. Other works such as   propose to find a mapping from the source to the target domain or vice-versa, typically based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) . This setting is commonly regarded as a zero-sum game between two networks, a discriminator and a generator. While the generator tries to fool the discriminator by generating images with target style, the discriminator tries to distinguish the domain the images belong to.\nIn , the authors further improve mapping by performing the adaptation at the feature level. Another strategy is to employ multiple models as an ensemble or as self-ensembling (multiple models at different times) such that they can produce reliable pseudo-labels on target domains. Last, some other researchers have proposed to adapt the batch norm statistics  instead of adapting the networkâ€™s layers.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: of domain shift of a deep learning model that is trained on a labeled source domain data, using unlabeled data from a target domain.
