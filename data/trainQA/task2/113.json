      "content": "Paper Title: MonoLayout: Amodal scene layout from a single image\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere is another recent set of approaches to object detection in bird’s eye view—pseudo-lidar approaches . At the core of these approaches lies the idea that, since lidar object detection works exceedingly well, monocular images can be mapped to (pseudo) lidar-like maps in bird’s eye view, and object detecion networks tailored to lidar bird’s eye view maps can readily be applied to this setting. Such approaches are primarily geared towards detecting objects in lidar-like maps. MonoLayout, on the other hand, intends to estimate an amodal scene layout, and to do so, it must reason not only about vehicles, but also about the static scene layout. Table 5 compares MonoLayout with a set of pseudo-lidar approaches, in terms of vehicle occupancy estimation and road layout estimation. Specifically, we evaluate the following pesudo-lidar based methods. ENet + Pseudo-lidar input (Monodepth2): Uses an ENet [ref]27-style encoder-decoder architecture that uses Monodepth2  to get monocular depth estimates. PointRCNN + Pseudo-lidar input (Monodepth2): Uses a PointRCNN [ref]35 architecture (a two-stage object detector comprising a region proposal network, and a classification network) to detect vehicles in bird’s eye view. AVOD + Pseudo-lidar input (PSMNet): A stereo, supervised method. Uses the aggregated view object detector AVOD [avod] and pseudo-lidar input computed from a disparity estimation network (PSMNet [ref]4). The comparision is shown in Table 5. The PointRCNN [ref]35 and AVOD  are tailored specifically for object detection, and hence cannot be repurposed to estimate road layouts. However, the ENet [ref]27 architecture can, and we trained it for the task of road layout estimation. We observe that, among all approaches, MonoLayout is the fastest (about an order of magnitude speedup over pseudo-lidar methods). Furthermore, the accuracy is competitive, if not greater, compared to pseudo-lidar based approaches. We also evaluate against a stereo pseudo-lidar baseline (AVOD + pseudolidar PSMNet [ref]4). By virtue of using stereo images, and being supervised on the KITTI Object dataset 777Monodepth2  is unsupervised, and has not been finetuned on the KITTI Object dataset, achieves superior performance. However, the comparision is unfair, and is provided only for a reference, to enable progress in amodal layout estimation from a monocular camera. Another shortcoming of pseudolidar-style approaches is that, it is not possible to learn visual (i.e., image intensity based) features that are extremely useful in road layout estimation).\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: in terms of vehicle occupancy estimation and road layout estimation.
