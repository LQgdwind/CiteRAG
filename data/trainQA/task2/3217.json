      "content": "Paper Title: CGIBNet: Bandwidth-constrained Communication with Graph Information Bottleneck in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMARL communication.\nCommunication plays an important role in the MARL research since it can alleviate the non-stationary problem of multi-agent systems, thereby improving the group‚Äôs cooperation .\nRecently, a variety of works have been proposed to explore communication protocols in MARL, such as improving the message aggregation mechanism   [ref]8 [ref]9 , introducing memory modules  , learning world dynamic models  [ref]14, adjusting experience buffers , etc.\nHowever, all the above methods require each agent to receive the messages from all agents in each control cycle to take an action, which is not suitable for practical scenarios where communication bandwidth is limited.\nTo efficiently utilize finite communication resources,\nthe existing works reduce the communication burden from two points: 1) who to communicate with (structure information) and 2) what to communicate (node information). For the first point, researchers introduce various gating mechanisms to reduce communication channels between agents.\ne.g., IC3Net  models the gate by learning an extra actor, while G2A  achieves this goal through hard attention and combines with soft attention to improve its performance.\nHowever, IC3Net and G2A do not explicitly constrain or penalize the communication frequency, thus these methods still occupy a lot of communication overhead.\nSchedNet  and ETCNet  leverage actor-based weight generators to explicitly restrict bandwidth occupancy,\nthus these methods can save some communication channels.\nUnfortunately, all the existing methods have some application limitations.\nSpecifically, IC3Net, SchedNet and ETCNet can only be applied to policy-based MARL frameworks.\nThis is because they model communication scheduler as an actor Œºùúá\\mu and directly optimize the parameter Œ∏ùúÉ\\theta of Œºùúá\\mu by policy gradient theorem , i.e., A‚Äã‚àáŒ∏log‚Å°Œºùê¥subscript‚àáùúÉùúáA\\nabla_{\\theta}\\log\\mu, which is not feasible in value-based frameworks since the policy gradient theorem is not applicable.\nFor a similar reason, these methods can only achieve single-round communication, because recursive optimization gradient A‚Äã‚àáŒ∏(log‚Å°Œº‚Äã(‚àáŒ∏log‚Å°Œº))ùê¥subscript‚àáùúÉùúásubscript‚àáùúÉùúáA\\nabla_{\\theta}(\\log\\mu(\\nabla_{\\theta}\\log\\mu)) in multiple rounds of communication does not conform to the policy gradient theorem.\nG2A is not limited by the training frameworks, however, this method can only be used for single-round communication since its message aggregation module (i.e., BiLSTM ) is not compatible with the multi-round communication process. For the second point, researchers introduce various regularizers to learn compact message representations. e.g., NDQ  derives two regularizers based on mutual information to ensure the expressiveness and succinctness of the message. However, this method does not design a message aggregation module but uses fully connected communication, resulting in sub-optimal message representations and poor performance in some specific scenarios. e.g., target communication is needed [ref]9.\nIMAC  is most relevant to our work since it also introduces the information bottleneck (IB) principle .\nWe emphasize the differences between our method and IMAC as follows:\n1) Theory: The IB principle used by IMAC can only solve the problem of what to communicate (i.e., compress message representations) for each agent, but has no theoretical guidance on who to communicate with (i.e., reduce communication channels). However, we extend the IB principle to the graph information bottleneck (GIB) principle, which can simultaneously solve the above two problems under a unified framework.\n2) Instantiation: Although IMAC claims that it can determine each agent is communicating to whom by learning a message aggregation module, we find this module cannot reduce communication channels between agents since it still uses the fully connected style. Therefore, no matter in theory or implementation, IMAC cannot reduce communication overhead in terms of who to communicate with.\nFurthermore, the message aggregation module of IMAC is modeled as an actor, which means that it has many usage restrictions similar to IC3Net, SchedNet and ETCNet.\nDifferent from these methods, we model the message scheduler as a link prediction task  in graph neural networks, which can be naturally combined with our deduced information-theoretic regularizer and achieve end-to-end training without the above application limitations. For better comparison, we list the properties of different methods as shown in Table I. Note that the difference between ‚ÄòSchedule structure information‚Äô and ‚ÄòCompress structure information‚Äô is that the latter explicitly constrains or penalizes the redundant structural information. Information bottleneck. Information bottleneck (IB), originally proposed for signal processing, tries to find a short code of the input signal but preserves maximum information of the code . Alexander et al.  first introduce the IB into deep neural networks, then the IB is applied to various domains   . Recently,\nWu et al.  extend the IB theory to the graph data to learn compact node representations, which can improve model robustness against adversarial examples .\nHowever, they assume that the graph data satisfies the local-dependence assumption and the underlying graph is a static graph (i.e., each layer of the graph structure is consistent and constant). Instead, we deal with a dynamic graph (i.e., the structure of the communication graph is different at each timestep). Meanwhile, we assume the structure of the lower layer is based on the upper layer in multiple rounds of communication. These lead to the differences between our method and their method in terms of both theoretical derivation and instantiation.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: systems, thereby improving the group‚Äôs cooperation .\nRecently, a variety of works have been proposed to explore communication protocols in MARL, such as improving the message aggregation mechanism   [ref]8 [ref]9 , introducing memory modules  , learning world dynamic models  [ref]14, adjusting experience buffers , etc.\nHowever, all the above methods require each agent to receive the messages\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1.
