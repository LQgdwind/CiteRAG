Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

The considered classes. There are slight differences in the classes used to train and evaluate the model. For instance, some models are trained with a multi-class objective to simultaneously segment objects such as cars, pedestrian or cones¬†[ref]16 [ref]24 [ref]39.\nSome others only train and evaluate in a binary semantic segmentation setting on a meta-class vehicles which includes cars, bicycles, trucks, etc.¬† .\nSome works also use instance segmentation information to train their model where the centers of each distinct vehicle is known at train time .\nIn all of our experiments, we place ourselves in the binary semantic segmentation setting of the meta-class vehicles. This choice is made to have fair and consistent comparisons with our baselines  , however, it should be noted that our model is not constrained to this setting. The levels of visibility of objects. Objects selected as ground truth, both for training and evaluating the model, differ in terms of their levels of visibility. Three options have been considered: objects that are in line-of-sight with the ego car‚Äôs LiDAR¬†[ref]16, or objects with a nuScenes visibility above a defined threshold, either 0%¬† or 40%¬†.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: as there are previous works.\nDifferences are found at three different levels: The resolution of the output grid where two main settings have been used: a grid of 100m√ó\\times50m at a 25cm resolution  [ref]16 [ref]24 [ref]39 and a grid of 100100100m√ó100absent100\\times 100m at a 505050cm resolution  .
