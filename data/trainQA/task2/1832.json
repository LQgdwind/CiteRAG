      "content": "Paper Title: White Box Methods for Explanations of Convolutional Neural Networks in Image Classification Tasks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe adversarial approach for explanations is more recent and differs in its principles from previously presented categories. They are taken from the principles of adversarial attacks and the use of generative networks like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to explain the DNN classifiers. Thus adversarial methods deserve a separate category. Many recent works have used adversarial attacks on CNNs to demonstrate the susceptibility of the networks to simple methods that could lead the network to make completely wrong predictions[ref]40. Different adversarial attacks on the network can be used to interpret its behaviour[ref]41. Sample images that produce adversarial results give hints about the behaviour of the network [ref]43. For example, the one-pixel attack proposed by Su et al., showed that the network can have a completely wrong prediction when just one pixel in input image has been changed. Studying these adversarial attacks we can interpret the regions of the image that the network focuses on to make a decision. In addition to the adversarial attack based interpretation of the network, we bring focus on a recent adversarial learning-based explanation method proposed by Charachon et al. that uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based model. GAN is a type of network architecture with two components: i) Generator ii) Discriminator, that simultaneously trains the generator (G) to learn the data distribution and the discriminator (D) to estimate if the sample belongs to the dataset or has been generated by G. For the case of a binary classification task on medical images, the authors  along with their CNN classifier, use two generator networks i) Similar image generator gs¯¯subscript𝑔𝑠\\bar{g_{s}} ii) Adversarial image generator ga¯¯subscript𝑔𝑎\\bar{g_{a}} to produce explanations. The network gs¯¯subscript𝑔𝑠\\bar{g_{s}} is trained to generate an image that has the same output as the input image x𝑥x by the network. The ga¯¯subscript𝑔𝑎\\bar{g_{a}} network is trained to produce an image with a prediction that is opposite to that of the x𝑥x (adversarial). Consequently, the authors propose that the difference in these two generated images forms the explanation of the output by the network. For a given image x𝑥x the explanation of the classifier is then given as shown in Eq. (27). The approach of just one network to generate an adversarial image (xa)x_{a}) and use the difference in the input image x𝑥x and the xasubscript𝑥𝑎x_{a} as the explanation was observed to produce noisy and non-intuitive features. To improve this, the authors use the two-generator approach and train gs¯¯subscript𝑔𝑠\\bar{g_{s}} and ga¯¯subscript𝑔𝑎\\bar{g_{a}} to sample from the same adversarial space, to have minimal differences in their learnt parameters but produce images with opposite classifications by the CNN.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: category. Many recent works have used adversarial attacks on CNNs to demonstrate the susceptibility of the networks to simple methods that could lead the network to make completely wrong predictions[ref]40.
