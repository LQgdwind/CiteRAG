      "content": "Paper Title: RvS: What is Essential for Offline RL via Supervised Learning?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOffline and off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) are typically addressed using value-based methods. While theoretically appealing because they include performance guarantees under certain assumptions , such methods can be difficult to apply in practice; they tend to require complex tricks to stabilize learning and delicate tuning of many hyperparameters.\nRecent work has explored an alternative approach: convert the RL problem into a conditional, filtered, or weighted imitation learning problem.\nThis typically uses a simple insight: suboptimal experience for one task may be optimal for another task. By conditioning on some piece of information, such as a goal, reward function parameterization, or reward value, such experience can be used for simple behavior cloning [ref]6       [ref]26  [ref]5 . We refer to this set of approaches as RL via supervised learning (RvS). These approaches commonly condition on goals  [ref]6  or reward values [ref]26  [ref]5, but they can also involve reweighting or filtering    [ref]26. RvS methods are appealing because of their algorithmic simplicity. However, prior work has put forward conflicting hypotheses about which factors are essential for their good performance, including online data , advantage weighting [ref]26, or large Transformer sequence models [ref]5.\nThe first question we study is: what elements are essential for effective RvS learning?\nBeyond this, it also remains unclear on which tasks and datasets such methods work well. For example, prior work has argued that temporal compositionality (dubbed “subtrajectory stitching”) is an important component for solving offline RL when there are few near-optimal trajectories present in the data (e.g., the Franka Kitchen and AntMaze tasks in D4RL ). A priori, one might expect that dynamic programming via TD learning is needed for these tasks. So we also ask: what are the limits of RvS learning, and does it scale to settings with few near-optimal trajectories? The main contribution of this paper is a study of RvS methods on a wide range of offline RL problems, as well as a set of analyses about which design factors matter most for such methods.\nFirst, we show that pure supervised learning (maximizing the likelihood of actions observed in the data) performs as well as conservative TD learning across a diverse set of environments. Second, simple feedforward models can match the performance of more complex sequence models from prior work across a wide range of tasks. Finally, choosing to condition on reward values versus goals can have a large effect on performance, with different choices working better in different domains.\nThese simple results contradict the narrative put forward in many prior works that argue for more complex design decisions [ref]26  [ref]5. To the best of our knowledge, our results match or exceed those reported by any prior RvS method. We believe that these findings will be useful to the RL community because they help to understand the essential ingredients and limitations of RvS methods, providing a foundation for future work on simple and performant offline RL algorithms.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: be optimal for another task.
