      "content": "Paper Title: CAMERAS: Enhanced Resolution And Sanity preserving Class Activation Mapping for image saliency\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep visual models are fast surpassing human-level performance for various vision tasks, including image classification , , object detection , , and semantic segmentation , .\nHowever, they hardly offer any explanation of their decisions, and are rightfully considered black-boxes.\nThis is problematic for their practical deployment, especially in high-risk emerging applications where transparency is vital, e.g. in healthcare, self-driving vehicles and smart surveillance 1.\nThe problem is exacerbated by the push of ‘right to explanation’ by algorithmic regulatory authorities and their objection to black-box models in safety-critical applications . Addressing this issue for deep visual models, techniques are emerging to offer input-agnostic 1 and input-specific [ref]8, 1,  explanation of model predictions. This work subscribes to the latter, where the ultimate goal is to identify the contribution of each pixel in an input to the output prediction.\nThe popular techniques to achieve this adopt one of two strategies.\nThe first, systematically modifies the input image pixels (i.e. image regions) and analyzes the effects of those perturbations on the output predictions [ref]8, , , [ref]33. The underlying search nature of this perturbation-based formulation offers high-fidelity model-centric importance attribution to the input pixels, albeit at a high computational cost. Hence, tractability is achieved under heuristics or external priors over the computed importance maps. This is undesired because the eventual maps may be influenced by these external factors, which compromises the model-fidelity of the maps. The second strategy relies on the activation maps of the internal layers and gradients of the models. Commonly known as backpropagation saliency methods , 1, , , [ref]33,  approaches adopting this strategy are computationally efficient, thereby offering the possibility of avoiding unnecessary heuristics or priors. However, for the visual neural models, the layers closer to the input are class-insensitive 1. This limits the ammunition of backpropagation saliency methods to the deeper layers of the networks, where the size of activation maps is very small, e.g. 10−3×10^{-3}\\times of the input size. Projecting the saliency computed with those maps onto the original image grid results in intrinsically low-resolution image saliency. On the other hand, using heuristics or priors to sharpen those projections inadvertently compromise the sanity of the maps . Not to mention, employing activation signals of multiple internal layers for resolution enhancement takes us back to a combinatorial search problem of choosing the best layers, under a pre-specified heuristic. Addressing the above issues, we introduce CAMERAS - an Enhanced Resolution And Sanity preserving Class Activation Mapping for backpropagation image saliency. The proposed technique (Fig. 1-top) systematically accumulates and fuses multi-scale activation maps and backpropagated gradients of a model to construct precise saliency maps. By avoiding the influence of any external factor, e.g. heuristics, priors, thresholds, the saliency maps of CAMERAS easily pass the sanity checks for image saliency (Fig. 1-bottom). Moreover, the technique allows saliency estimation with a single network layer, not requiring any layer search for map resolution enhancement. Contributions of the paper are summarised below: We propose CAMERAS for precise backpropagation image saliency while preserving the sanity. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art saliency methods by a large margin, achieving up to 27.5%percent27.527.5\\% error reduction for the popular pointing game metric . Exploring the newly found precision saliency mapping with CAMERAS, we visualise differences in the semantic understanding of different architectures that govern their performance. We also highlight model-centric discrimination of input features for visually similar objects in never-before-seen details. Considering the equivalent treatment of deep models as differentiable programs by the fast-developing parallel field of adversarial learning, we enhance the widely considered strongest adversarial attack PGD 8 with our saliency technique - drastically improving the efficacy of the attack. The ability of precise saliency computation allowed by CAMERAS calls for new quantitative metrics and sanity checks. We contribute two new evaluation metrics and a sanity check to advance this research direction.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: and their objection to black-box models in safety-critical applications .
