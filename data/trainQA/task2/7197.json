      "content": "Paper Title: Dr2Net: Dynamic Reversible Dual-Residual Networks for Memory-Efficient Finetuning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLarge pretrained models play an increasingly crucial role in modern computer vision tasks. These large models, such as ViTs [ref]13 and Swin transformers  , are pretrained on large-scale datasets  , by various means such as fully-supervised learning [ref]13  , self-supervised learning     or vision-language pretraining . They have strong representational capacity due to the large model scale and the data scale, and therefore become indispensable for various downstream tasks 3 5  . Although these pretrained large models have shown good generality, they need to be end-to-end finetuned on specific downstream tasks to reach an optimal performance 3   5  . End-to-end finetuning refers to training the backbone, which is initialized with a pretrained model, simultaneously with the task-specific network components during finetuning. For example, it is a common practice in image object detection that the backbone is initialized from a model pretrained on ImageNet classification  and finetuned end-to-end on the object detection datasets 3. For the task of video temporal action localization, recent research has shown performance boost of using end-to-end finetuning compared to frozen-backbone finetuning   5. For self-supervised pretrained models such as MAE , end-to-end finetuning is required to reach even a decent performance for downstream tasks. However, end-to-end finetuning is memory intensive, especially for those large models on a task with high-dimension or high-resolution data, as shown in Fig. 1 (a).\nFor example, in long-form video understanding tasks, e.g., temporal action localization   5, thousands of video frames need to be processed at a time for long-term reasoning. Without dramatically downscaling the resolution, it is even impossible to finetune a Video Swin - large model with a video of 30 seconds in the largest GPU, i.e., A100 with 80 GB memory 5. Therefore, reducing GPU memory consumption is a vital problem in finetuning large models. Recently, reversible networks have demonstrated their efficacy in significantly reducing memory consumption during training     5. They can reconstruct intermediate activations from network output, and therefore don’t need to store those activations in memory during the forward process.\nHowever, existing reversible networks     are not able to leverage pretrained models, and have to be trained from scratch, which leads to inferior performance as shown in Fig. 1 (b).\nWhile the more recent work Re2TAL 5 proposed a rewiring strategy enabling the reuse of pretrained model architectures and parameters, it still requires pretraining the reversible model before finetuning it on the downstream task to maintain performance. A major challenge in directly fine-tuning reversible networks from pretrained models is the inherent architectural disparity. The majority of existing pretrained models are designed as non-reversible networks, making direct transfer learning to the distinctly different architecture of reversible networks in the downstream tasks challenging. To reduce memory consumption without compromising performance when finetuning pretrained non-reversible models on downstream tasks, in this paper, we propose a family of network architectures, dubbed as Dynamic Reversible\nDual-Residual Networks or Dr2Net. Dr2Net acts as a surrogate backbone network during finetuning, and can be seamlessly initialized from pretrained non-reversible models.\nDr2Net is essentially a super network encompassing both the pretrained non-reversible architecture and the downstream reversible architecture. It employs two types of residual connections: one preserves the residual structure of the pretrained non-reversible architecture, while the other facilitates reversibility. By applying two distinct coefficients to these residual connections,\nwe can control the network’s proximity to either architecture.\nDuring finetuning, we dynamically update the coefficients such that the network seamlessly transitions from the pretrained non-reversible model to a reversible network of increased numerical precision (referred to as a robust reversible network). This design effectively bridges the architectural gap between the two types of networks. We summarize our contributions as follows. We propose a novel family of network architectures dubbed as Dynamic Reversible Dual-Residual Networks (Dr2Net) to finetune any pretrained model with substantially reduced memory consumption. We introduce a dynamic finetuning strategy to seamlessly transition any network to a robust reversible network, achieving performance comparable to conventional finetuning while conserving memory. We have shown the effectiveness of Dr2Net on various pretrained models such as Swin  and ViT [ref]13, and a broad range of vision tasks such as temporal action detection 2. Dr2Net significantly reduces memory while preserving accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: Large pretrained models play an increasingly crucial role in modern computer vision tasks.
