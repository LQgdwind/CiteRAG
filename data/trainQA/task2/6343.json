It regained traction with the seminal works of [ref]6   and the release of CARLA , a 3D simulator used in numerous recent research advances in autonomous driving  [ref]15     3 . Early IL approaches evaluated in CARLA used a discrete navigation command (NC) [ref]15  [ref]8, but their performance is not competitive to modern approaches   1  which predict waypoints conditioned on TPs. In this work, we revisit an idea used in early systems but neglected in modern TP-conditioned methods: geometric shift augmentations [ref]6  [ref]15 . LAV  supervises waypoint outputs with additional data by making predictions for other nearby agents in the scene. Their waypoints are initially generated with NC conditioning. These are then refined using a GRU . They observe a large (+50) improvement in route completion from this refinement. Our findings suggest that the refinement module improves steering primarily through TP conditioning, which is only provided to the refinement GRU.\nTCP 1 observes that waypoints are stronger at collision avoidance than directly predicting controls, but sometimes suffer at large turns. They leverage the strength and mitigate the weaknesses of these two representations by creating a situation dependent ensemble. Our study suggests that the waypoints are better at collision avoidance due to an implicit slowdown when the car is uncertain.\nPlanT  investigates planning on CARLA by processing object bounding boxes with a transformer. Its sensorimotor version differs from other SotA models in that it is trained in two stages (not end-to-end). In our setting, we find that end-to-end training is crucial. We show that their observations about dataset scale also hold for end-to-end models. TransFuser   is a simple, well-known and widely used baseline for CARLA. We provide an explanation for the large differences in route completion between the target point conditioned TransFuser architecture and its NC conditioned baselines [ref]15  [ref]8. Further, we propose modifications to its architecture, output representation and training strategy which lead to significant improvements. Interfuser  regresses a path for steering, predicts object density maps, and classifies traffic rule flags. This representation is converted by a forecasting mechanism and hand designed heuristics into control. Like our proposed method, it uses a transformer decoder for pooling features, and disentangles future velocities from the path in the output. While these ideas were already present, they were not studied or discussed as significant. Our work adds to the literature by showing that these design choices are indeed critical to performance and providing explanations as to why. Furthermore, our final system is simpler and significantly outperforms Interfuser on Longest6. ReasonNet , ThinkTwice  and CaT 2 are concurrent end-to-end driving approaches that all use TP conditioning and waypoints as output representation.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: IL for autonomous driving dates back over 30 years .
