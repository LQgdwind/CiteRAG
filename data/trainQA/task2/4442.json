      "content": "Paper Title: Component twin-width as a parameter for BINARY-CSP and its semiring generalisations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConstraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) are rooted in artificial intelligence and operations research and provide a rich framework for encoding many different types of problems (for a wealth of applications, see e.g. the book by Rossi et al. ).\nA CSP example of paramount importance is the Boolean satisfiability problem, SAT, which can be viewed as a constraint satisfaction problem over the Boolean domain.\nAnother noteworthy CSP example is the H𝐻H-COLORING problem  that asks whether there exists an homomorphism from an (undirected) input graph G𝐺G to the target graph H𝐻H. Indeed, this problem can be formalized as a particular case of a CSP over binary constraints (BINARY-CSP): given a set of variables V𝑉V and a set of constraints of the form R​(u1,u2)𝑅subscript𝑢1subscript𝑢2R(u_{1},u_{2}) for (u1,u2)∈V2subscript𝑢1subscript𝑢2superscript𝑉2(u_{1},u_{2})\\in V^{2} and binary relations R⊆D2𝑅superscript𝐷2R\\subseteq D^{2}, the objective is to map variables in V𝑉V to values in the domain D𝐷D such that every such constraint is satisfied. Such a mapping is then referred as a solution of the instance. When the relations belong to a fixed language ΓΓ\\Gamma, this problem is usually denoted by BINARY-CSP(Γ)Γ(\\Gamma), and the decision problem is stated as the problem of deciding whether a solution exists. Clearly, the H𝐻H-COLORING problems subsume the well known q𝑞q-COLORING problem\nwith H𝐻H being the q𝑞q-clique, which itself can be seen as the satisfaction of constraints expressed through the relation NEQq={(a,b)∈[q]2∣a≠b}subscriptNEQ𝑞conditional-set𝑎𝑏superscriptdelimited-[]𝑞2𝑎𝑏\\text{NEQ}_{q}=\\{(a,b)\\in[q]^{2}\\mid a\\neq b\\}. Hell & Nešetřil  showed that the complexity of H𝐻H-COLORING problems for a given graph H𝐻H is NP-complete whenever H𝐻H is not bipartite; otherwise, it is in P. This result can be seen as a particular case of the CSP dichotomy theorem\nwhich states that every CSP problem (and, in particular, BINARY-CSP) is either in P or NP-complete  . For certain applications however, the basic decidability setting provides insufficient modelling power and one may be instead interested in counting the number of solutions (we prefix the problem by # to denote the corresponding counting problem). Also, counting problems may be subjected to additional constraints such as lists, where a function l:V↦𝒫​(D):𝑙maps-to𝑉𝒫𝐷l:V\\mapsto\\mathcal{P}(D) is given and any solution f𝑓f has to satisfy ∀u∈V,f​(u)∈l​(u)formulae-sequencefor-all𝑢𝑉𝑓𝑢𝑙𝑢\\forall u\\in V,f(u)\\in l(u), and costs, where sending u∈V𝑢𝑉u\\in V to v∈D𝑣𝐷v\\in D has a cost C​(u,v)𝐶𝑢𝑣C(u,v), with the goal of minimizing ∑u∈VC​(u,f​(u))subscript𝑢𝑉𝐶𝑢𝑓𝑢{\\scriptstyle\\sum\\limits_{u\\in V}}C(u,f(u)). This framework makes it possible to encode phase transition systems modelled by partition functions, modeling problems such as counting q𝑞q-particle Widom–Rowlinson configurations and counting Beach models, or the classical Ising model (for many more examples, see e.g.  Dyer & Greenhill ). The complexity of these generalized problems has been the subject of intense research, starting with the complexity dichotomy for the #H𝐻H-COLORING problems by Dyer & Greenhill , later extended to #CSP by Bulatov , and culminating into the dichotomy theorem by Cai & Chen  in the presence of weights. In contrast to the classical CSP, which admits a rich tractability landscape  , the associated counting problems are generally hard except for trivial cases. For example, #H𝐻H-COLORING is #P-hard if H𝐻H is not a disjoint union of looped cliques and loopless complete bipartite graphs, and is in P otherwise . Thus, non-trivial templates H𝐻H of actual interest tend to result in NP-hard (#)H𝐻H-COLORING problems, necessitating tools and techniques from parameterized and fine-grained complexity. Here, there is no lack of results for specific templates H𝐻H. One of the most well-known results is likely Björklund et al.’s  dynamic programming algorithm which solves q𝑞q-COLORING, as well as the counting, summation, and optimization versions, in O∗​(2n)superscript𝑂superscript2𝑛O^{*}(2^{n})111The O∗superscript𝑂O^{*} notation means that we ignore polynomial factors. time. Another result for #​H#𝐻\\#H-COLORING from Díaz et al.  is the existence of an improved algorithm assuming that the input graph G𝐺G has tree-width k𝑘k and is given with a nice tree decomposition: for any graph H𝐻H, #​H#𝐻\\#H-COLORING can then be solved on G𝐺G in O​(|VH|k+1​min⁡(k,n)⋅n)𝑂⋅superscriptsubscript𝑉𝐻𝑘1𝑘𝑛𝑛O(|V_{H}|^{k+1}\\min(k,n)\\cdot n) time using only O​(|VH|k+1​log⁡(n))𝑂superscriptsubscript𝑉𝐻𝑘1𝑛O(|V_{H}|^{k+1}\\log(n)) additional space.\nThe latter examples indicate that bounding the class of input instances by parameters such as tree-width and the related clique-width, can be applied more generally and with powerful algorithmic results. More generally, two noteworthy extensions of H𝐻H-COLORING can be defined by restricting either the input or the target graphs with respect to a given parameter k𝑘k. In the former, the goal is to obtain FPT algorithms, while one in the latter simply wishes to improve upon exhaustive search (O∗​(|D|n)superscript𝑂superscript𝐷𝑛O^{*}(|D|^{n})), with a single-exponential running time O∗​(cn)superscript𝑂superscript𝑐𝑛O^{*}(c^{n}) for a fixed c𝑐c depending only on k𝑘k representing the most desired outcome. Hence, restricting the class of input graphs yields a problem of interest in parameterized complexity while restricting the target graphs yields a problem with closer ties to fast exponential-time algorithms and fine-grained complexity. For instance, the algorithm by Fomin et al.  solves H𝐻H-COLORING in O∗​((t+3)n)superscript𝑂superscript𝑡3𝑛O^{*}((t+3)^{n}) time if H𝐻H has tree-width at most t𝑡t on every graph G𝐺G with |VG|=nsubscript𝑉𝐺𝑛|V_{G}|=n, assuming that the tree-decomposition is given. Moreover, Wahlström  designed an algorithm based on k𝑘k-expressions and clique-width in order to solve the #​H#𝐻\\#H-COLORING problem in time O∗​((2​k+1)n)superscript𝑂superscript2𝑘1𝑛O^{*}((2k+1)^{n}), assuming that the clique-width of the graph H𝐻H is k≥1𝑘1k\\geq 1. The running time descends to O∗​((k+2)n)superscript𝑂superscript𝑘2𝑛O^{*}((k+2)^{n}) if H𝐻H admits a linear k𝑘k-expression, leading to a O∗​(6n)superscript𝑂superscript6𝑛O^{*}(6^{n}) complexity for #​Cp#subscript𝐶𝑝\\#C_{p}-COLORING (where Cpsubscript𝐶𝑝C_{p} is the p𝑝p-cycle for p≥5𝑝5p\\geq 5, Cpsubscript𝐶𝑝C_{p} having a linear 444-expression), and an O∗​(5n)superscript𝑂superscript5𝑛O^{*}(5^{n}) complexity for #​H#𝐻\\#H-COLORING, for any cograph H𝐻H (the cographs with at least one edge being exactly the graphs of clique-width 222). Recently, Okrasa and Rza̧żewski gave in  an algorithm running in time O∗​(|VH|t​w​(G))superscript𝑂superscriptsubscript𝑉𝐻𝑡𝑤𝐺O^{*}(|V_{H}|^{tw(G)}) solving H𝐻H-COLORING (assuming an optimal tree-decomposition of G𝐺G is given) and established its optimality, in the sense that H𝐻H-COLORING can not be solved in time O∗​((|VH|−ε)t​w​(G))superscript𝑂superscriptsubscript𝑉𝐻𝜀𝑡𝑤𝐺O^{*}((|V_{H}|-\\varepsilon)^{tw(G)}) for all ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 (under the hypothesis that H𝐻H is a projective core), unless the strong exponential-time hypothesis (SETH) fails222I.e., that SAT can not be solved in time (2−ε)n×(n+m)O​(1)superscript2𝜀𝑛superscript𝑛𝑚𝑂1(2-\\varepsilon)^{n}\\times(n+m)^{O(1)} on instances with n𝑛n variables and m𝑚m clauses. . They also achieved similar results involving clique-width , where they showed the existence and the optimality of their algorithm running in O∗​(s​(H)c​w​(G))superscript𝑂𝑠superscript𝐻𝑐𝑤𝐺O^{*}(s(H)^{cw(G)}) (with s​(H)𝑠𝐻s(H) being a new structural parameter of H𝐻H), in the sense that the running time O∗​((s​(H)−ε)c​w​(G))superscript𝑂superscript𝑠𝐻𝜀𝑐𝑤𝐺O^{*}((s(H)-\\varepsilon)^{cw(G)}) can not be reached under the SETH. In this paper we pursue this line of research and study the fine-grained and parameterized complexities of (#)​H#𝐻(\\#)H-COLORING problems and, more generally, of #BINARY-CSP(Γ)Γ(\\Gamma) with a particular focus on the parameter twin-width, recently introduced and now widely investigated    [ref]9    [ref]12  [ref]14  . This parameter, as well as the underlying contraction sequences, give information on whether two vertices are “similar” (in the sense that they have almost the same neighborhoods) in order to treat them simultaneously and thus reduce the computation time. A major achievement of twin-width is that deciding whether a graph G𝐺G is a model of a closed first-order formula φ𝜑\\varphi is FPT when parameterized by the twin-width of G𝐺G and the length of φ𝜑\\varphi [ref]14. Also, the k𝑘k-INDEPENDENT SET problem is FPT when parameterized by k𝑘k and twin-width [ref]9. In [ref]12 Bonnet et al. also gave a proof that the q𝑞q-COLORING problem was FPT when parameterized by component twin-width. Specifically, the parameter component twin-width appears to be the most relevant and natural parameter in the setting of homomorphism problems. In fact, many of the algorithms in [ref]9 that are FPT when parameterized by twin-width, such as the one solving k𝑘k-IND-SET, can be seen as an optimization of a more natural FPT algorithm parameterized by component twin-width. Despite their impressive success, parameters based on twin-width\nhave not been used to tackle #​H#𝐻\\#H-COLORING problems, except for the very restricted case of q𝑞q-COLORING briefly discussed in [ref]12.\nTo extend the applicability of such parameters to larger classes of graphs and problems, in Section 3 we propose a representation of instances and templates of BINARY-CSPs as “edge-labelled graphs”. However, classical representations via Gaifman graphs are not adapted to algorithms dealing with component twin-width because the latter does not necessarily increase with higher number of edges. We thus propose the algebraic notion of pre-morphism into a semiring in Section 4, that enables a unified formalism for the list, the counting and the cost generalisations of BINARY-CSP. This formalism also subsumes the semiring based generalisations of CSP (SCSP) by Bistarelly , including in particular the counting version of CSP. Even though Wilson 3 proposed an equivalent generalisation through semirings, Wilson’s formalism can be seen as a descendant approach, studying subsets of the set of solutions with less and less specifications over time. In contrast, our method builds the set of solutions from trivial cases and two basic operations ⊎⊎\\uplus and ⨝join\\Join, that we will perform (through our pre-morphism) in the semiring instead. This approach is often a more common and prolific way to involve graph parameters; see, e.g., Wahlström  in the context of clique-width. Finally, in Section 5 we use contraction sequences along with component twin-width to implement dynamic programming algorithms that efficiently solve these generalisations of BINARY-CSPs. Here, we consider both the case where we bound the input graphs and the case where we bound the template by component twin-width, and we solve both of these questions by two novel algorithms: an FPT algorithm applicable for inputs of bounded component twin-width, and a superpolynomial but significantly improved algorithm applicable to templates of bounded component twin-width.\nThey strongly generalize and improve the results by, e.g., Wahlström , and are to the best of our knowledge the most general algorithms of their kind (for binary constraints). In fact, our two algorithms even solve combinations of generalisations of BINARY-CSP without impacting the running time. In Table 1 we summarize a few cases where our approach improves the upper bounds that we can derive from , which uses k𝑘k-expressions and clique-width, and which complements the q𝑞q-COLORING problems untreated by the inclusion-exclusion method of Björklund et al. . Regarding the latter, we also observe that while it runs in O∗​(2n)superscript𝑂superscript2𝑛O^{*}(2^{n}) time and is able to solve many combinations of generalisations of q𝑞q-COLORING, it does not cover all combinations of generalisations of BINARY-CSP solved by our algorithms, and is naturally restricted to the very specific case of complete graphs.\nFor our FPT algorithms, component twin-width and clique-width are functionally equivalent [ref]12 on graphs, which allows us to derive FPT conditions for generalized H𝐻H-COLORING problems with respect to clique-width.\nThis extends the corollary derived from Courcelle et al.  that for every graph H𝐻H, H𝐻H-COLORING is FPT when parameterized by clique-width even if we add costs, since we now allow combinations of counting generalisations. We summarize the FPT results in Table 4.\nThese results raise several questions for future research, and we discuss some of them in Section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: complexities of (#)​H#𝐻(\\#)H-COLORING problems and, more generally, of #BINARY-CSP(Γ)Γ(\\Gamma) with a particular focus on the parameter twin-width, recently introduced and now widely investigated    [ref]9    [ref]12  [ref]14  .
