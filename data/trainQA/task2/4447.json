      "content": "Paper Title: Jacobian Norm with Selective Input Gradient Regularization for Improved and Interpretable Adversarial Defense\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent years have seen deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve impressive performance in a myriad of image recognition tasks, e.g., image classification on real-world benchmarks. However, DNNs could be easily fooled by crafted imperceptible perturbations aimed at driving the network to make a wrong prediction. Such a vulnerability poses an obstacle in the deployment of deep learning systems for real-world applications given the security-sensitivity and legal ramifications . Since this vulnerability was first identified by Szegedy et al. , many techniques for generating a group of malicious examples have been proposed including i) white-box attacks (e.g., Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) , Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)  and C&W [ref]4) which require knowledge of the deep learning parameters; and ii) black-box attacks  [ref]6  can attack the DNNs even without any knowledge of the model parameters. This is due to the transferability of adversarial examples: examples generated to fool one model tend to fool all models trained on the same dataset  . Currently, the best defense models available to counter adversarial attacks are based on adversarial training (AT), which trains the\nmodels on a mixture of clean and adversarial examples to better classify potentially adversarial examples during test time 0. Although a number of effective defenses employing AT have been proposed 1 2, they rely on a computationally expensive brute force solution to generate the potent adversarial examples 3. Besides, a study 4 shows that the robustness provided by AT can be circumvented by randomizing or transferring perturbations from other models, albeit ensemble helps. This has raised concerns about the generalization ability of adversarially trained models under the attacking of adversarial examples simply modified from a unknown distribution. For example, a robust DNN model adversarially trained on gradient-generated examples should still remain robust when these examples are further crafted by Gaussian randomness on the feature dimensions (The dversarially generated example with a new additive Gaussian noise can be viewed as a transferred one from its source 5). Besides robustness, domain experts are also concerned with the interpretability of a DNN’s predictions. Interpretability is of particular importance in domains with safety requirements which need to know how a model is trained and used. For example, medical specialists are intriguing to know how the model responds to training data from different hospitals. To be more interpretable, some methods proposed to regularize the input gradients 6 7, which can illuminate the regions of confidence predicted by the DNNs. For example, 7 has shown that by training a model to have smooth input gradients with fewer extreme values (including the background pixels), the prediction of a DNN will be more interpretable. However, this endeavor 7 smoothed out all the gradients without showing the most appropriate interpretability of DNNs, i.e., such method 7 is limited in presenting the network’s response to small input variations. Other techniques such as integrated gradients 8 and SmoothGrad 9 can also generate smoother and more interpretable prediction confidence but they do not capture the response of a deep neural network under input variations. As a matter of fact, the local behavior can simulate how the network responds to small perturbations of its inputs. In this paper, we aim to improve both robustness and prediction interpretability in the presence of small input perturbations. This is achieved by simultaneously minimizing the Jacobian norm of the whole network as well as regularizing the input gradients. Specifically, we introduce the notion of linearized robustness, which sets the bounds on the network response towards a perturbed example. And we show that the robustness can be approximated by the Jacobian norm, which is computed as the gradients of the network prediction logits with respect to the input. However, directly using the raw input gradients could be noisy and hard to interpret. Inspired by 6 which has shown that gradient suppression together with selected features can explain the robustness of a model, we propose to regularize the input gradients to provide a better input space. Then, we train the network using the Jacobian’s Frobenius norm, which sets the bounds on the response of the network layers to input perturbations. We empirically show how the Jacobian norm relates to the linearized robustness of the DNNs, and how to leverage it into the adversarial training to mitigate the adversarial effects. To further make the prediction more interpretable, we propose to use the perterbation-based saliency map, which is taken as the salient Jacobian matrix that can relate the gradients to the corrupted input image and semantically visualize the discriminative portions of that image 0. These Jacobians, computed during training for different robust models, can be regarded as visual resemblers to the corresponding images, and a previous study has shown that the saliency map is a result of robustness 1. This strategy is demonstrated to be robustness across different transferred adversarial examples. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as: We propose a novel approach to achieve both improved robustness and high interpretability of DNNs under adversarial attacks. The proposed approach effectively leverages the Jacobian norm and selective input gradient regularization, which explicitly describes the network responses to input perturbations. We investigate the relationship between a Jacobian norm and the linearized robustness 111(The distance from the input image to the decision boundary) of DNNs. Based on perturbation-based saliency maps, our results give insights into the prediction confidence of DNNs, which relates to the adversarial effects. Our method improves the robustness of DNNs towards transferred adversarial examples across multiple architectures and different attacks. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews the recent related works. Section IV details the proposed method, and Section V presents extensive experiments to evaluate our method. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section VI.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: , many techniques for generating a group of malicious examples have been proposed including i) white-box attacks (e.g., Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) , Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)  and C&W [ref]4) which require knowledge of the deep learning parameters; and ii) black-box attacks  [ref]6  can attack the DNNs even without any knowledge of the model parameters.
