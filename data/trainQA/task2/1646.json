      "content": "Paper Title: AniGAN: Style-Guided Generative Adversarial Networks for Unsupervised Anime Face Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGenerative Adversarial Networks.\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs)  have achieved impressive performance for various image generation and translation tasks      6 2   .\nThe key to the success of GANs is the adversarial training between the generator and discriminator. In the training stage, networks are trained with an adversarial loss, which constrains the distribution of the generated images to be similar to that of the real images in the training data. To better control the generation process, variants of GANs, such as conditional GANs (cGANs)  and multi-stage GANs  , have been proposed. In our work, we also utilize an adversarial loss to constrain the image generation. Our model uses GANs to learn the transformation from a source domain to a significantly different target domain, given unpaired training data. Image-to-Image Translation.\nWith the popularization of GANs, GAN-based image-to-image translation techniques have been widely explored in recent years  5  [ref]30 [ref]18 [ref]24   7. For example, trained with paired data, Pix2Pix  uses a cGAN framework with an L‚Äã1ùêø1L1 loss to learn a mapping function from input to output images. Wang et al. proposed an improved version of Pix2Pix 5 with a feature matching loss for high-resolution image-to-image translation. For unpaired data, recent efforts  [ref]30 [ref]18 [ref]24  have greatly improved the quality of generated images. CycleGAN  proposes a cycle-consistency loss to get rid of the dependency on paired data. UNIT [ref]30 maps source-domain and target-domain images into a shared-latent space to learn the joint distribution between the source and target domains in an unsupervised manner. MUNIT [ref]18 extends UNIT to multi-modal contexts by incorporating AdaIN  into a content and style decomposition structure. To focus on the most discriminative semantic parts of an image during translation, several works  [ref]24 involve attention mechanisms. ContrastGAN  uses the object mask annotations from each dataset as extra input data. UGATIT [ref]24 applies a new attention module and proposes an adaptive layer-instance normalization (AdaLIN) to flexibly control the amount of change in shapes and textures. However, the style controllability of the above methods is limited due to the fact that the instance-level style features are not explicitly encoded. To overcome this, FUNIT  utilizes a few-shot image translation architecture for controlling the categories of output images, but its stability is still limited. Neural Style Transfer.\nStyleFAT can also be regarded as a kind of the neural style transfer (NST)   . In the field of NST, many approaches have been developed to generate paintings with different styles. For example, CartoonGAN  devises several losses suitable for general photo cartoonization. ChipGAN  enforces voids, brush strokes, and ink wash tone constraints to a GAN loss for Chinese ink wash painting style transfer. APDrawingGAN 9 utilizes a hierarchical GAN to produce high-quality artistic portrait drawings.\nCariGANs  and WarpGAN 1 design special modules for geometric transformation to generate caricatures.\nYaniv et al. 8 proposed a method for geometry-aware style transfer for portraits utilizing facial landmarks.\nHowever, the above methods either are designed for a specific art field which is completely different from animation, or rely on additional annotations (such as facial landmarks).\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: domain, given unpaired training data.
