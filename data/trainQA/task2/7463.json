      "content": "Paper Title: Temporal hierarchies of regular languages\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nContext.\nThis paper addresses a fundamental question in automata theory: understanding the formalisms used to describe regular languages. A flagship example is the class of star-free languages. These are languages that can be defined by a regular expression without Kleene star, but where complement is allowed. A striking feature of this class is its robustness. McNaughton and Papert  proved that star-free languages are those that can be described in first-order logic FO​(<)FO\\textup{FO}(<) and Kamp  proved that FO​(<)FO\\textup{FO}(<) has the same expressiveness as linear time temporal logic LTL. Also, Schützenberger  proved that membership is decidable for the star-free languages: given as input a regular language, one can decide if it is star-free. This led Brzozowski and Cohen  to define a natural classification of the star-free languages according to the difficulty of expressing them: the dot-depth hierarchy. The dot-depth is a concatenation hierarchy. Such hierarchies are based on the “BPol” operator: given an input class 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}, it builds the class BPol​(𝒞)BPol𝒞\\textup{BPol}(\\mathcal{C}) consisting of all Boolean combinations of languages L0​a1​L1​⋯​an​Lnsubscript𝐿0subscript𝑎1subscript𝐿1⋯subscript𝑎𝑛subscript𝐿𝑛L_{0}a_{1}L_{1}\\cdots a_{n}L_{n}, where the Lisubscript𝐿𝑖L_{i}’s are in 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} and the aisubscript𝑎𝑖a_{i}’s are letters. Each concatenation hierarchy is built uniformly from a single class 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} called its basis. Level zero is the basis (i.e., BPol0​(𝒞)=𝒞subscriptBPol0𝒞𝒞\\textup{BPol}_{0}(\\mathcal{C})=\\mathcal{C}). Then, each level n+1𝑛1n+1 is obtained from level n𝑛n by applying the “BPol” operator (i.e., BPoln+1​(𝒞)=BPol​(BPoln​(𝒞))subscriptBPol𝑛1𝒞BPolsubscriptBPol𝑛𝒞\\textup{BPol}_{n+1}(\\mathcal{C})=\\textup{BPol}(\\textup{BPol}_{n}(\\mathcal{C}))). The dot-depth starts from the basis DD={∅,{ε},A+,A∗}DD𝜀superscript𝐴superscript𝐴\\textup{DD}=\\{\\emptyset,\\{\\varepsilon\\},A^{+},A^{*}\\} (where A𝐴A is the alphabet). Other standard such hierarchies include the one of Straubing and Thérien  0 of basis ST={∅,A∗}STsuperscript𝐴\\textup{ST}=\\{\\emptyset,A^{*}\\}, the group hierarchy  whose basis GR consists of languages recognized by a permutation automaton 1, and the modulo hierarchy  whose basis MOD⊆GRMODGR\\textup{MOD}\\subseteq\\textup{GR} consists of languages for which membership of a word is determined by its length modulo an integer. The levels of concatenation hierarchies are robust: level n𝑛n corresponds to the class ℬ​ΣnℬsubscriptΣ𝑛\\mathcal{B}\\Sigma_{n} of all languages expressible in first-order logic with n𝑛n blocks of quantifiers ∃∗/∀∗superscriptsuperscriptfor-all\\exists^{*}/\\forall^{*}, under a tailored signature constructed from the basis . This was first discovered by Thomas 2 for the dot-depth. In this context, group languages are relevant bases, as they yield natural signatures. For example, the class MOD yields predicates testing the value of a position modulo a certain integer. Interesting bases are also obtained by extending these group classes 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} into larger ones, denoted 𝒢+superscript𝒢\\mathcal{G}^{+}, obtained by adding or deleting the empty word to the languages of 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G}. On the logical side, this adds the successor relation  . This robustness justifies to investigate membership for individual levels. It is, however, a difficult problem. For example, in the dot-depth and Straubing-Thérien hierarchies, it is known to be decidable only at levels one   and two [ref]27 despite decades of active research. The most significant progress has been achieved by combining two key ideas. The first is to focus on operators (such as “BPol”) rather than individual classes. The aim of this approach is to treat all variations of the same class in a uniform, generic way. The hope would be to simultaneously handle membership for all levels “one” of concatenation hierarchies whose basis meets a reasonable condition. Of course, this approach requires an adjustment to the original membership question. Indeed, if Op is an operator, deciding membership for Op​(𝒞)Op𝒞\\textup{Op}(\\mathcal{C}) obviously depends on the class 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}. Therefore, the new question is: what property on 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} suffices to ensure that Op​(𝒞)Op𝒞\\textup{Op}(\\mathcal{C})-membership is decidable? Thus, we aim at a transfer result from a property for the input class to a property for the output of the operator. This leads to the second ingredient. The decidability of 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}-membership rarely transfers directly to Op​(𝒞)Op𝒞\\textup{Op}(\\mathcal{C})-membership. Typically, one has to decide a stronger problem on 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}. One such problem is 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}-separation. It asks whether two input languages L1,L2subscript𝐿1subscript𝐿2L_{1},L_{2} are 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}-separable: does there exist K∈𝒞𝐾𝒞K\\in\\mathcal{C} such that L1⊆Ksubscript𝐿1𝐾L_{1}\\subseteq K and K∩L2=∅𝐾subscript𝐿2K\\cap L_{2}=\\emptyset? This generalizes membership: a regular language belongs to 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} if and only if it is 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}-separable from its complement. An illustration of the desired type of transfer result is given in [ref]28: in a concatenation hierarchy, if the basis is a class of group languages with decidable separation, then its level one has decidable separation as well. Temporal hierarchies. We consider another classification: the temporal hierarchy of basis 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}. Its construction is similar to concatenation hierarchies: its level n𝑛n (written TLn​(𝒞)subscriptTL𝑛𝒞\\textup{TL}_{n}(\\mathcal{C})) is obtained from 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} using n𝑛n applications of an operator 𝒟↦TL​(𝒟)maps-to𝒟TL𝒟\\mathcal{D}\\mapsto\\textup{TL}(\\mathcal{D}). The class TL​(𝒟)TL𝒟\\textup{TL}(\\mathcal{D}) consists of all languages definable in a variant of unary temporal logic with future/past modalities built from 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}. Each language in 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} gives rise to a future modality FLsubscriptF𝐿\\textup{F}_{L} and a past one PLsubscriptP𝐿\\textup{P}_{L} generalizing the classic ones F and P. For instance, FL​φsubscriptF𝐿𝜑\\textup{F}_{L}~{}\\varphi holds at position i𝑖i in a word w𝑤w if there is a position j>i𝑗𝑖j>i such that φ𝜑\\varphi holds at j𝑗j in w𝑤w, and the infix of w𝑤w between i𝑖i and j𝑗j belongs to L𝐿L. One can verify that TL​(𝒞)⊆BPol​(𝒞)TL𝒞BPol𝒞\\textup{TL}(\\mathcal{C})\\subseteq\\textup{BPol}(\\mathcal{C}). Thus, the operator 𝒞↦TL​(𝒞)maps-to𝒞TL𝒞\\mathcal{C}\\mapsto\\textup{TL}(\\mathcal{C}) is a generalization of BPol admitting a natural definition. It has been considered in , where it is shown that TL​(𝒞)TL𝒞\\textup{TL}(\\mathcal{C})-membership reduces to 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}-separation using an elegant generic algebraic characterization of TL​(𝒞)TL𝒞\\textup{TL}(\\mathcal{C}). These considerations make it appealing to investigate the operator 𝒞↦TL​(𝒞)maps-to𝒞TL𝒞\\mathcal{C}\\mapsto\\textup{TL}(\\mathcal{C}). Level one in the temporal hierarchy of basis ST={∅,A∗}STsuperscript𝐴\\textup{ST}=\\{\\emptyset,A^{*}\\} is the standard class of languages definable in unary temporal logic TL with the F and P modalities. Results of   3  underscore its multiple characterizations: it consists of languages definable in two-variable first-order logic FO2​(<)superscriptFO2\\textup{FO}^{2}(<), corresponds also to the “intermediate level” Δ2​(<)subscriptΔ2\\Delta_{2}(<), is the class of unambiguous languages and has a nice decidable algebraic characterization. Level one in the temporal hierarchy of basis DD=ST+DDsuperscriptST\\textup{DD}=\\textup{ST}^{+} is also standard: it is the class of languages definable in unary temporal logic TLX with the F, P, X (“next”) and Y (“yesterday”) modalities. Finally, level two in the temporal hierarchy of basis ST turns out to correspond to a class recently investigated in  [ref]14 : two-variable first-order logic with between predicates, where the link with temporal logic is also observed and considered. Contributions.\nWe carry out a general investigation of temporal hierarchies. First, we show that BPoln​(𝒞)⊆TLn​(𝒞)subscriptBPol𝑛𝒞subscriptTL𝑛𝒞\\textup{BPol}_{n}(\\mathcal{C})\\subseteq\\textup{TL}_{n}(\\mathcal{C}) for all n∈ℕ𝑛ℕn\\in\\mathbb{N} and ⋃n∈ℕBPoln​(𝒞)=⋃n∈ℕTLn​(𝒞)subscript𝑛ℕsubscriptBPol𝑛𝒞subscript𝑛ℕsubscriptTL𝑛𝒞\\bigcup_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}\\textup{BPol}_{n}(\\mathcal{C})=\\bigcup_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}\\textup{TL}_{n}(\\mathcal{C}). For an arbitrary basis 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}, the temporal hierarchy and the concatenation hierarchy classify the same languages. We focus on hierarchies whose bases are of the form 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} or 𝒢+superscript𝒢\\mathcal{G}^{+}, where 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} represents a class of group languages. We present several results that offer key insights into such hierarchies: We prove that the two temporal (resp. concatenation) hierarchies of bases 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} and 𝒢+superscript𝒢\\mathcal{G}^{+} are always strict and intertwined. We show that the classes TLk​(𝒞)subscriptTL𝑘𝒞\\textup{TL}_{k}(\\mathcal{C}) and BPoln​(𝒞)subscriptBPol𝑛𝒞\\textup{BPol}_{n}(\\mathcal{C}) are incomparable if 2≤k<n2𝑘𝑛2\\leq k<n and either 𝒞=𝒢+𝒞superscript𝒢\\mathcal{C}=\\mathcal{G}^{+}, or 𝒞=𝒢𝒞𝒢\\mathcal{C}=\\mathcal{G} and contains MOD. The situation is depicted in Figure 1. This strengthen a result of , which implies that TL2​(ST)subscriptTL2ST\\textup{TL}_{2}(\\textup{ST}) intersects all levels of the Straubing-Thérien hierarchy. We prove that membership for both TL2​(𝒢)subscriptTL2𝒢\\textup{TL}_{2}(\\mathcal{G}) and TL2​(𝒢+)subscriptTL2superscript𝒢\\textup{TL}_{2}(\\mathcal{G}^{+}) reduces to 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G}-separation, by combining two known transfer results of [ref]28 . This theorem applies for 𝒢=ST𝒢ST\\mathcal{G}=\\textup{ST}, MOD and GR as these classes have decidable separation  2. Our main theorem applies to TL2​(ST)subscriptTL2ST\\textup{TL}_{2}(\\textup{ST}). We prove that it has decidable covering (a generalization of separation [ref]28). Interestingly, we use a covering algorithm for TL​(ST+)TLsuperscriptST\\textup{TL}(\\textup{ST}^{+})  as a subprocedure. This has important consequences. First, the class TL2​(ST)subscriptTL2ST\\textup{TL}_{2}(\\textup{ST}) is of particular interest as it corresponds to two-variable first-order logic with between predicates  [ref]14 . Second, we combine this result with the theorem of  to prove that level three (TL3​(ST)subscriptTL3ST\\textup{TL}_{3}(\\textup{ST})) has decidable membership. Third, we use transfer theorems  9 to lift our results to the basis DD=ST+DDsuperscriptST\\textup{DD}=\\textup{ST}^{+}, so that TL2​(DD)subscriptTL2DD\\textup{TL}_{2}(\\textup{DD}) has decidable covering and TL3​(DD)subscriptTL3DD\\textup{TL}_{3}(\\textup{DD}) has decidable membership. Organization. In Section 3, we define the temporal hierarchies, we compare them with concatenation hierarchies and we investigate membership for level 2. Section 4 presents the framework we use for covering, and the covering algorithm for TL2​(ST)subscriptTL2ST\\textup{TL}_{2}(\\textup{ST}) is presented in Section 5.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: membership for individual levels.
