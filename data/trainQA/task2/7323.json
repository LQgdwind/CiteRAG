Despite this challenge, there is a pleasant number of positive results on regular separability.\nIt has been shown that disjoint WSTS languages are always separated by a regular language  4.\nFor disjoint VASS coverability languages, matching upper and lower bounds on the size of least separators have been found 5.\nFor Parikh automata [ref]3 and Büchi VASS coverability languages , regular separability has been shown to be decidable. Unfortunately, for the main model in this field, namely VASS reachability languages, the search has only brought partial results.\nThis includes the decidability of\nthe regular separability problem\nfor the reachability languages of one-dimensional VASS ,\nfor ℤℤ\\mathbb{Z}-VASS reachability languages [ref]3,\nfor the commutative closure of VASS reachability languages [ref]4,\nand for VASS reachability languages from any of the aforementioned classes .\nThe study has also led to important new techniques.\nWith the transducer trick, one can reduce the regular separability problem to a variant where only one language is taken as input and the second is fixed [ref]3 .\nFor this variant, the basic separator approach tries to determine a limited set of regular languages so that, if separability holds, then a finite combination of these languages will serve as a separator .\nThe techniques turned out widely applicable  5 , and the transducer trick will also play a central role in our work.\nRelated to regular separability is the separability of VASS reachability sets [ref]4.\nA landmark result in this context shows that VASS reachability sets admit Presburger-definable invariants , which resulted in a new algorithm for solving VASS reachability .\nTo sum up, despite more than a decade of efforts, the decidability of regular separability for VASS reachability languages is still open. We solve the open problem and show that regular separability for VASS reachability languages is decidable and 𝐅ωsubscript𝐅𝜔\\mathbf{F}_{\\omega}-complete.\nThe problem is primitive recursive if the dimension of the input VASS is fixed.\nThe class 𝐅ωsubscript𝐅𝜔\\mathbf{F}_{\\omega} contains the problems that can be solved with Ackermannian time and space  , and the master problem is VASS reachability.\nThe hardness of VASS reachability has been established only recently   9.\nThe decidability is a classic result  7 8, with  an early attempt, and based on the algorithms proposed in these works, the upper bound has been brought down from 𝐅ω3subscript𝐅superscript𝜔3\\mathbf{F}_{\\omega^{3}}  over 𝐅ω2subscript𝐅superscript𝜔2\\mathbf{F}_{\\omega^{2}}  to 𝐅ωsubscript𝐅𝜔\\mathbf{F}_{\\omega} .\nThe algorithms reduce the VASS reachability problem to the reachability problem in ℤℤ\\mathbb{Z}-VASS, using an iterative decomposition that creates potentially many and potentially large ℤℤ\\mathbb{Z}-VASS.\nWe will follow the same strategy, and reduce the regular separability problem of VASS reachability languages to the regular separability problem of ℤℤ\\mathbb{Z}-VASS reachability languages, also with a decomposition.\nThe latter problem has been shown to be decidable in [ref]3.\nFor the precise upper bound, we rely on an analysis inspired by . While this is the overall strategy, it takes new ingredients to make it work that go beyond the toolkit of VASS reachability.\nTo explain them, we refer to the input as the subject VASS.\nThe second is the Dyck VASS, and can be fixed with the transducer trick [ref]3 .\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Regular separability problems for the languages of infinite-state systems are recently gaining momentum  [ref]3  [ref]4     4 5.\nThese problems take as input two infinite-state systems with languages L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} and L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}, and ask whether\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
