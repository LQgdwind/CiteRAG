      "content": "Paper Title: Sequence-to-Sequence Predictive Model: From Prosody To Communicative Gestures\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHuman naturally performs gestures while speaking . There are different types of communicative gestures which vary based on the types of information they convey  such as iconic (e.g., linked to the description of an object), metaphoric (e.g. conveying abstract idea), deictic (indicating a point in space) or beat (marking speech rhythm). Gesture helps the locutor to form what he or she wants to convey and also helps the listener to comprehend the speech . Thus, it is desirable for a virtual agent which interacts with humans to show natural-looking gesturing behaviour. Because of that, researchers have been working on automatic gesture generation in the context of human-computer interaction  [ref]30. The techniques behind these generators are based on the principle that gestures and speech are related . Most of the prior gesture generators simplify the problem by focusing and generating only one type of gesture (e.g. beat inly or iconic only). There is also a recent work  which tries to infer the gesture from both the speech acoustic and the text, which in principle enables the model to learn both the beat gestures and the semantic gestures. However, there is also a benefit of separating the learning of the gesture timing (when does it occur in relation to speech) from the learning of the gesture shape (the hands shape, wrist position, palm orientation, etc). By learning them separately, it would enable different models to be plugged in. On the other hand, if a model which does everything happens to not perform well on a certain task (e.g. generating the shape of semantic gestures), then fixing that weakness would require modifying the whole model. In our current work, we first attempt to compute when a virtual-agent should perform a certain type of gesture. That is, we compute the gesture timing. We also simplify the problem by considering two categories of gesture: beat and other gesture types. We compute the gesture class based on the speech acoustic. We learn their relationship by using a recurrent neural network with an attention mechanism [ref]2. The input is the sequence of speech prosody and the output is the sequence of gesture classes. Our input features are the fundamental frequency (F0), the F0 direction score, and intensity. These features have been found to be highly correlated with gesture production. We also experiment with using other acoustic features that consider human perception of speech, namely the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) as the input features because they have been successfully used to generate body movements  [ref]30. It should be noted that the model we are developing uses only the acoustic features as the input; the semantic feature is not considered yet. Our model aims to predict where gestures occur; more precisely the type of gestures (beat or ideational) and the timing of occurrence of gesture phases (stroke and other phases). We are not yet dealing with the problem of predicting the form of the gestures nor which hand is used for the gesture. We will deal with this topic in a next step. In Section 2 (Background), we explain the background concepts. In Section 3, we explain the relevant prior works about gesture and gesture generation techniques. In Section 4, we explain the dataset we use for our experiments. We explain the raw content and the various annotations provided in the dataset. In Section 5, we explain about how we extract usable data from the raw dataset. In Section 6, we explain the model which we use and how it is implemented. In section 7, we present the way we measure the performance of the model. In Section 8, we describe our objective experiments. In Section 9I, we describe our subjective experiment. In Section 10, we discuss our results and we draw the conclusions. Finally, we explain our future direction in Section 11.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: which interacts with humans to show natural-looking gesturing behaviour.
