      "content": "Paper Title: Algorithms for Computing Closest Points for Segments\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecall that we have used the BS data structure to answer the outside-hull segment\nqueries. Unfortunately the algorithm does not fit into the ΓΓ\\Gamma-algorithm\nframework. Indeed, the BS data structure is a binary tree. However, each node of the tree represents a convex hull of a subset of points and it is not associated with a predicate that we can use to apply the ΓΓ\\Gamma-algorithm framework (e.g., the search lemma as discussed above). We provide more details on why the BS data structure does not fit into the ΓΓ\\Gamma-algorithm\nframework. Roughly speaking, in order to fit into the framework, the search structure has to have certain kind of “locality” property. Let’s use an example to explain this. Suppose we want to find the predecessor of a query number x𝑥x among a sorted list X𝑋X of numbers. Assume that the numbers of X𝑋X are stored in a binary search tree TXsubscript𝑇𝑋T_{X}. Hence, each node v𝑣v of TXsubscript𝑇𝑋T_{X} is associated with a range formed by the leftmost and rightmost leaves of the subtree rooted at v𝑣v. It is easy to see that if the predecessor of x𝑥x is in the range of v𝑣v, then it must be in the range of exactly one of the two children of v𝑣v. This is the locality property for the predecessor searching problem, i.e., by looking at the local information at v𝑣v, we are able to determine which subtree of v𝑣v contains the search target.\nFor our outside-hull segment query problem, the search algorithm of the BS data structure does not have this locality property. For example, the algorithm searches a binary tree from the root and eventually obtain two candidates along two search paths from the root; finally, the better one from the two candidates is returned as the answer. Therefore, the search target does not only rely on the local information and it has to compare with the result from the other search path (in contrast a locality property always guarantees that only one search path is necessary). In the following, we first present a new algorithm for\nsolving the outside-hull segment queries. Our algorithm,\nwhose performance matches that of the BS data structure, is simpler, and thus may be of independent interest; more importantly, it leads to an algorithm that fits the ΓΓ\\Gamma-algorithm framework to provide an O​(n4/3)𝑂superscript𝑛43O(n^{4/3}) upper bound. Let Q𝑄Q be a set of n′superscript𝑛′n^{\\prime} points. The problem is to preprocess Q𝑄Q\nso that given any query segment s𝑠s outside the convex hull 𝖢𝖧​(Q)𝖢𝖧𝑄\\mathsf{CH}(Q) of Q𝑄Q, the\nclosest point of s𝑠s in Q𝑄Q can be computed efficiently. Recall that in our original problem (i.e., the recurrence (5)) Q𝑄Q is a subset of P𝑃P and the sum of n′superscript𝑛′n^{\\prime} for all subsets of P𝑃P that we need to build the outside-hull query data structures is O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n). We make this an observation below, which will be referred to later. The size of the subsets of P𝑃P that we need to build the outside-hull query data structures is O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n), i.e., ∑n′=O​(n​log⁡n)superscript𝑛′𝑂𝑛𝑛\\sum n^{\\prime}=O(n\\log n). In the preprocessing, we compute the Voronoi diagram\n𝖵𝖣​(Q)𝖵𝖣𝑄\\mathsf{VD}(Q) of Q𝑄Q, from which we can obtain the convex hull 𝖢𝖧​(Q)𝖢𝖧𝑄\\mathsf{CH}(Q) in linear time. For each edge e𝑒e of 𝖢𝖧​(Q)𝖢𝖧𝑄\\mathsf{CH}(Q), we determine the subset\nQesubscript𝑄𝑒Q_{e} of points of Q𝑄Q whose Voronoi cells intersect e𝑒e in order\nalong e𝑒e. This order is exactly the order of the perpendicular\nprojections of the points of Qesubscript𝑄𝑒Q_{e} onto e𝑒e . Consider a query segment s𝑠s that is outside 𝖢𝖧​(Q)𝖢𝖧𝑄\\mathsf{CH}(Q). Let pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s} be the first\npoint of Q𝑄Q hit by s𝑠s if we drag s𝑠s along the direction perpendicularly to\ns𝑠s and towards 𝖢𝖧​(Q)𝖢𝖧𝑄\\mathsf{CH}(Q); see Fig. 1. For ease of exposition, we assume that pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s} is unique. Our goal is to compute pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s} in the case where\nthe point of s𝑠s closest to Q𝑄Q is not an endpoint of s𝑠s since the other case\ncan be easily solved by using 𝖵𝖣​(Q)𝖵𝖣𝑄\\mathsf{VD}(Q). Henceforth, we assume that\nthe point of s𝑠s closest to Q𝑄Q is not an endpoint of s𝑠s, implying that pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s} is the point of Q𝑄Q closest to s𝑠s.\nWithout loss of generality, we assume that s𝑠s is horizontal and s𝑠s is below\n𝖢𝖧​(Q)𝖢𝖧𝑄\\mathsf{CH}(Q).\nLet a𝑎a and b𝑏b be the left and right endpoints of s𝑠s,\nrespectively (see Fig. 1). We first find the lowest vertex v𝑣v of 𝖢𝖧​(Q)𝖢𝖧𝑄\\mathsf{CH}(Q), which can be done in O​(log⁡n′)𝑂superscript𝑛′O(\\log n^{\\prime})\ntime by doing binary search on 𝖢𝖧​(Q)𝖢𝖧𝑄\\mathsf{CH}(Q). If x​(a)≤x​(v)≤x​(b)𝑥𝑎𝑥𝑣𝑥𝑏x(a)\\leq x(v)\\leq x(b), then v𝑣v is pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s} and we are done with the query.\nOtherwise, without loss of generality, we assume that x​(b)<x​(v)𝑥𝑏𝑥𝑣x(b)<x(v). By binary\nsearch on 𝖢𝖧​(Q)𝖢𝖧𝑄\\mathsf{CH}(Q), we find the edge e𝑒e in the lower hull of 𝖢𝖧​(Q)𝖢𝖧𝑄\\mathsf{CH}(Q) that intersects\nthe vertical line through b𝑏b. Since x​(a)≤x​(b)<x​(v)𝑥𝑎𝑥𝑏𝑥𝑣x(a)\\leq x(b)<x(v),\ne𝑒e must have a negative slope (see Fig. 1).\nThen, as discussed\nin , pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s} must be in Qesubscript𝑄𝑒Q_{e}. To\nfind pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s} efficiently, we first make some observations (which were not discovered in the previous work). Suppose p1,p2,…,pmsubscript𝑝1subscript𝑝2…subscript𝑝𝑚p_{1},p_{2},\\ldots,p_{m} are the points of Qesubscript𝑄𝑒Q_{e}, sorted following the order of their Voronoi\ncells in 𝖵𝖣​(Q)𝖵𝖣𝑄\\mathsf{VD}(Q) intersecting e𝑒e from left to right. We define two special indices i∗superscript𝑖i^{*} and j∗superscript𝑗j^{*} of Qesubscript𝑄𝑒Q_{e} with respect to a𝑎a and b𝑏b, respectively. Define j∗superscript𝑗j^{*} as the largest index of the point of Qesubscript𝑄𝑒Q_{e} that is to the left of b𝑏b.\nDefine i∗superscript𝑖i^{*} as the smallest index of the point of Qesubscript𝑄𝑒Q_{e} such that\npjsubscript𝑝𝑗p_{j} is to the right of a𝑎a for all j≥i∗𝑗superscript𝑖j\\geq i^{*}. Note that j∗superscript𝑗j^{*} must exist as pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s} is in Qesubscript𝑄𝑒Q_{e} and is\nto the left of b𝑏b.\nWe have the following lemma.\n If i∗superscript𝑖i^{*} does not exist or i∗>j∗superscript𝑖superscript𝑗i^{*}>j^{*}, then pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s} cannot be the closest point of s𝑠s in Q𝑄Q. We first assume that i∗superscript𝑖i^{*} exists and i∗>j∗superscript𝑖superscript𝑗i^{*}>j^{*}. In the following, we prove that pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s} cannot be the closest point of s𝑠s in Q𝑄Q.\nBy the definition of j∗superscript𝑗j^{*}, for any i≥j∗+1𝑖superscript𝑗1i\\geq j^{*}+1, pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} is to the right of b𝑏b and thus is to the right of a𝑎a.\nHence, by the definition of i∗superscript𝑖i^{*}, it holds that i∗≤j∗+1superscript𝑖superscript𝑗1i^{*}\\leq j^{*}+1.\nSince i∗>j∗superscript𝑖superscript𝑗i^{*}>j^{*}, i∗superscript𝑖i^{*} must be j∗+1superscript𝑗1j^{*}+1.\nAgain by the definition of i∗superscript𝑖i^{*}, pj∗subscript𝑝superscript𝑗p_{j^{*}} must be strictly to the left\nof a𝑎a since otherwise i∗≤j∗superscript𝑖superscript𝑗i^{*}\\leq j^{*} must hold. Let q𝑞q (resp., q′superscript𝑞′q^{\\prime}) be the intersections between e𝑒e (resp., s𝑠s)\nand the vertical line through\npssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s} (e.g., see Fig. 2). Note that both q𝑞q and q′superscript𝑞′q^{\\prime} must exit by the definition of\npssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s}. Assume to the contradiction that pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s} is the closest point of s𝑠s in Q𝑄Q. Without loss of\ngenerality, assume pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s} is pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} for some index i∈[1,m]𝑖1𝑚i\\in[1,m]. Then,\nsince x​(a)≤x​(pi)≤x​(b)𝑥𝑎𝑥subscript𝑝𝑖𝑥𝑏x(a)\\leq x(p_{i})\\leq x(b), we have i≤j∗𝑖superscript𝑗i\\leq j^{*} by the\ndefinition of j∗superscript𝑗j^{*}. Further, i𝑖i cannot be j∗superscript𝑗j^{*} since pj∗subscript𝑝superscript𝑗p_{j^{*}} is strictly\nto the left of a𝑎a. Therefore, i<j∗𝑖superscript𝑗i<j^{*}.\nRecall that the index order of Qesubscript𝑄𝑒Q_{e} follows the intersections of\nthe Voronoi cells with e𝑒e from left to right. Since i<j∗𝑖superscript𝑗i<j^{*} and\nx​(pj∗)<x​(a)≤x​(pi)𝑥subscript𝑝superscript𝑗𝑥𝑎𝑥subscript𝑝𝑖x(p_{j^{*}})<x(a)\\leq x(p_{i}), the bisector of pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} and pj∗subscript𝑝superscript𝑗p_{j^{*}} intersects\ne𝑒e at a point to the left of a𝑎a (e.g., see Fig. 2).\nAs q𝑞q is to the right of a𝑎a, q𝑞q must be closer to pj∗subscript𝑝superscript𝑗p_{j^{*}} than to pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i}. On the other hand, since pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} is the closest point of s𝑠s in Q𝑄Q and\npi​q′¯¯subscript𝑝𝑖superscript𝑞′\\overline{p_{i}q^{\\prime}} is perpendicular to s𝑠s, for any point p∈pi​q′¯𝑝¯subscript𝑝𝑖superscript𝑞′p\\in\\overline{p_{i}q^{\\prime}}, p𝑝p’s closest point in Q𝑄Q is pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i}. Hence, q𝑞q, which is a\npoint on pi​q′¯¯subscript𝑝𝑖superscript𝑞′\\overline{p_{i}q^{\\prime}},\nmust be closer to pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} than to pj∗subscript𝑝superscript𝑗p_{j^{*}}. We thus obtain contradiction. We next argue that if i∗superscript𝑖i^{*} does not exist, then pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s} cannot be the closest point of s𝑠s in Q𝑄Q. The argument is similar as above. First notice that pmsubscript𝑝𝑚p_{m} must be strictly to the left of a𝑎a, since otherwise i∗superscript𝑖i^{*} would exit. Without loss of generality, assume pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s} is pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} for some index i∈[1,m]𝑖1𝑚i\\in[1,m]. Since x​(a)≤x​(pi)≤x​(b)𝑥𝑎𝑥subscript𝑝𝑖𝑥𝑏x(a)\\leq x(p_{i})\\leq x(b), i𝑖i cannot be m𝑚m and thus i<m𝑖𝑚i<m. Hence, we have i<m𝑖𝑚i<m and x​(pm)<x​(a)≤x​(pi)𝑥subscript𝑝𝑚𝑥𝑎𝑥subscript𝑝𝑖x(p_{m})<x(a)\\leq x(p_{i}). Then, by applying the same argument as above (just replace pj∗subscript𝑝superscript𝑗p_{j^{*}} by pmsubscript𝑝𝑚p_{m}), we can prove that pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s} cannot be the closest point of s𝑠s in Q𝑄Q. By Lemma 3.3, if i∗superscript𝑖i^{*} does not exist or if i∗>j∗superscript𝑖superscript𝑗i^{*}>j^{*}, then we can simply stop the query algorithm.\nIn the following, we assume that i∗superscript𝑖i^{*} exists and i∗≤j∗superscript𝑖superscript𝑗i^{*}\\leq j^{*}.\nLet Qe​[i∗,j∗]subscript𝑄𝑒superscript𝑖superscript𝑗Q_{e}[i^{*},j^{*}] denote the subset of points of Qesubscript𝑄𝑒Q_{e} whose indices\nare between i∗superscript𝑖i^{*} and j∗superscript𝑗j^{*} inclusively. The following lemma implies that we can\nuse the supporting line of s𝑠s to search pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s}. Suppose pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s} is the closest point of s𝑠s in Q𝑄Q. Then, pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s} is the\npoint of Qe​[i∗,j∗]subscript𝑄𝑒superscript𝑖superscript𝑗Q_{e}[i^{*},j^{*}] closest to the supporting line of s𝑠s (i.e., the line containing s𝑠s). Let ℓℓ\\ell denote the supporting line of s𝑠s and let p∗superscript𝑝p^{*} denote the\npoint of Qe​[i∗,j∗]subscript𝑄𝑒superscript𝑖superscript𝑗Q_{e}[i^{*},j^{*}] closest to ℓℓ\\ell. Our goal is to prove that\np∗superscript𝑝p^{*} is pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s}, i.e., p∗superscript𝑝p^{*} is the closest point of s𝑠s in Q𝑄Q.\nTo this end, it suffice to prove the following: (1) x​(a)≤x​(p∗)≤x​(b)𝑥𝑎𝑥superscript𝑝𝑥𝑏x(a)\\leq x(p^{*})\\leq x(b);\n(2) for any point p𝑝p of Qesubscript𝑄𝑒Q_{e} not in\nQe​[i∗,j∗]subscript𝑄𝑒superscript𝑖superscript𝑗Q_{e}[i^{*},j^{*}],\np𝑝p cannot be pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s}. We first prove (1).\nConsider a point pi∈Qe​[i∗,j∗]subscript𝑝𝑖subscript𝑄𝑒superscript𝑖superscript𝑗p_{i}\\in Q_{e}[i^{*},j^{*}] such that x​(pi)∉[x​(a),x​(b)]𝑥subscript𝑝𝑖𝑥𝑎𝑥𝑏x(p_{i})\\not\\in[x(a),x(b)].\nIn the following we prove that Qe​[i∗,j∗]subscript𝑄𝑒superscript𝑖superscript𝑗Q_{e}[i^{*},j^{*}] must have another point pjsubscript𝑝𝑗p_{j} such that\nd​(pj,ℓ)<d​(pi,ℓ)𝑑subscript𝑝𝑗ℓ𝑑subscript𝑝𝑖ℓd(p_{j},\\ell)<d(p_{i},\\ell) and x​(pj)∈[x​(a),x​(b)]𝑥subscript𝑝𝑗𝑥𝑎𝑥𝑏x(p_{j})\\in[x(a),x(b)]. This will\nlead to (1). Since i∈[i∗,j∗]𝑖superscript𝑖superscript𝑗i\\in[i^{*},j^{*}], pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} is to the right of a𝑎a.\nAs x​(pi)∉[x​(a),x​(b)]𝑥subscript𝑝𝑖𝑥𝑎𝑥𝑏x(p_{i})\\not\\in[x(a),x(b)], pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} must be strictly to the right of b𝑏b. Since pj∗subscript𝑝superscript𝑗p_{j^{*}}\nis to the left of b𝑏b, we obtain x​(pj∗)≤x​(b)<x​(pi)𝑥subscript𝑝superscript𝑗𝑥𝑏𝑥subscript𝑝𝑖x(p_{j^{*}})\\leq x(b)<x(p_{i}) and i<j∗𝑖superscript𝑗i<j^{*}.\nRecall that the index order of Qesubscript𝑄𝑒Q_{e} follows the intersections of\nthe Voronoi cells of Qesubscript𝑄𝑒Q_{e} with e𝑒e from left to right. Since i<j∗𝑖superscript𝑗i<j^{*}, the portion of e𝑒e closer to pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} is to the left of\nthe portion of e𝑒e closer to pj∗subscript𝑝superscript𝑗p_{j^{*}}.\nThis is possible only if y​(pi)>y​(pj∗)𝑦subscript𝑝𝑖𝑦subscript𝑝superscript𝑗y(p_{i})>y(p_{j^{*}}) (e.g., see Fig. 4).\nIndeed, assume to the contradiction that y​(pi)≤y​(pj∗)𝑦subscript𝑝𝑖𝑦subscript𝑝superscript𝑗y(p_{i})\\leq y(p_{j^{*}}) (e.g., see Fig. 4). Then,\nsince the slope of e𝑒e is negative and x​(pj∗)≤x​(b)<x​(pi)𝑥subscript𝑝superscript𝑗𝑥𝑏𝑥subscript𝑝𝑖x(p_{j^{*}})\\leq x(b)<x(p_{i}), the portion of e𝑒e closer to pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} must be to the right of\nthe portion of e𝑒e closer to pj∗subscript𝑝superscript𝑗p_{j^{*}}, incurring contradiction. As such, y​(pi)>y​(pj∗)𝑦subscript𝑝𝑖𝑦subscript𝑝superscript𝑗y(p_{i})>y(p_{j^{*}}) must hold.\nHence,\nd​(pj∗,ℓ)<d​(pi,ℓ)𝑑subscript𝑝superscript𝑗ℓ𝑑subscript𝑝𝑖ℓd(p_{j^{*}},\\ell)<d(p_{i},\\ell) as ℓℓ\\ell is horizontal.\nNotice that x​(pj∗)∈[x​(a),x​(b)]𝑥subscript𝑝superscript𝑗𝑥𝑎𝑥𝑏x(p_{j^{*}})\\in[x(a),x(b)]. Indeed, by definition,\npj∗subscript𝑝superscript𝑗p_{j^{*}} is to the left of b𝑏b. On the other hand, since i∗≤j∗superscript𝑖superscript𝑗i^{*}\\leq j^{*},\npj∗subscript𝑝superscript𝑗p_{j^{*}} is to the right of a𝑎a. Hence, x​(pj∗)∈[x​(a),x​(b)]𝑥subscript𝑝superscript𝑗𝑥𝑎𝑥𝑏x(p_{j^{*}})\\in[x(a),x(b)]. This proves (1)\nsince pj∗subscript𝑝superscript𝑗p_{j^{*}} is a point in Qe​[i∗,j∗]subscript𝑄𝑒superscript𝑖superscript𝑗Q_{e}[i^{*},j^{*}]. We now prove (2). Consider any point pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} of Qe∖Qe​[i∗,j∗]subscript𝑄𝑒subscript𝑄𝑒superscript𝑖superscript𝑗Q_{e}\\setminus Q_{e}[i^{*},j^{*}]. Our goal is to prove that pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} is not pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s}.\nRecall that pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s} is the closest point of Q𝑄Q and x(ps)∈[x(a),x(b]x(p_{s})\\in[x(a),x(b]. First of all, if x​(pi)∉[x​(a),x​(b)]𝑥subscript𝑝𝑖𝑥𝑎𝑥𝑏x(p_{i})\\not\\in[x(a),x(b)], then it is vacuously\ntrue that pi≠pssubscript𝑝𝑖subscript𝑝𝑠p_{i}\\neq p_{s}. We now assume that x​(pi)∈[x​(a),x​(b)]𝑥subscript𝑝𝑖𝑥𝑎𝑥𝑏x(p_{i})\\in[x(a),x(b)].\nHence, pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} is to the left of b𝑏b. By the definition of j∗superscript𝑗j^{*},\ni≤j∗𝑖superscript𝑗i\\leq j^{*} holds. As i∉[i∗,j∗]𝑖superscript𝑖superscript𝑗i\\not\\in[i^{*},j^{*}], we have i<i∗𝑖superscript𝑖i<i^{*}.\nSince pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} is to the right of a𝑎a, by the definition of i∗superscript𝑖i^{*},\nthere must be a point pjsubscript𝑝𝑗p_{j} with i<j<i∗𝑖𝑗superscript𝑖i<j<i^{*} such that pjsubscript𝑝𝑗p_{j} is strictly\nto the left of a𝑎a. Recall that the index order of Qesubscript𝑄𝑒Q_{e} follows the intersections of\nthe Voronoi cells of Qesubscript𝑄𝑒Q_{e} with e𝑒e from left to right.\nSince i<j𝑖𝑗i<j and x​(pj)<x​(a)≤x​(pi)𝑥subscript𝑝𝑗𝑥𝑎𝑥subscript𝑝𝑖x(p_{j})<x(a)\\leq x(p_{i}), the bisector of pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} and\npjsubscript𝑝𝑗p_{j} intersects e𝑒e at a point to the left of a𝑎a (e.g., see Fig. 5). This means that\nq𝑞q is closer to pjsubscript𝑝𝑗p_{j} than to pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i}, where q𝑞q is the intersection\nbetween e𝑒e and the vertical line through pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i}. Assume to the contrary that pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} is pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s}. Let q′superscript𝑞′q^{\\prime} be the\nintersection between s𝑠s and the vertical line through pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} (e.g., see Fig. 5). Since\npisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} is the closest point of s𝑠s in Q𝑄Q, every point of\nq′​pi¯¯superscript𝑞′subscript𝑝𝑖\\overline{q^{\\prime}p_{i}} has pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} as its closest point in Q𝑄Q. In\nparticular, q𝑞q, which is on q′​pi¯¯superscript𝑞′subscript𝑝𝑖\\overline{q^{\\prime}p_{i}}, is closer to pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} than to pjsubscript𝑝𝑗p_{j}. But this incurs\ncontradiction. This proves (2). Based on Lemma 3.5, we have the following three steps to\ncompute pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s}: (1) compute j∗superscript𝑗j^{*}; (2) compute i∗superscript𝑖i^{*}; (3) find the point of\nQe​[i∗,j∗]subscript𝑄𝑒superscript𝑖superscript𝑗Q_{e}[i^{*},j^{*}] closest to the supporting line ℓssubscriptℓ𝑠\\ell_{s} of s𝑠s. The following Lemma 3.7, which is for outside-hull segment queries, is a by-product of our above observations. Its complexity is the same as that in . However, we feel that our new query algorithm is simpler and thus this result may be interesting in its own right. The query algorithm of\nthe lemma actually does not fit the ΓΓ\\Gamma-algorithm framework. Instead, following the above observations\nwe will give another query algorithm that fits the ΓΓ\\Gamma-algorithm framework. Given a set Q𝑄Q of n′superscript𝑛′n^{\\prime} points in the plane, we can build a data structure of\nO​(n′)𝑂superscript𝑛′O(n^{\\prime}) space in O​(n′​log⁡n′)𝑂superscript𝑛′superscript𝑛′O(n^{\\prime}\\log n^{\\prime}) time such that each outside-hull query can be\nanswered in O​(log⁡n′)𝑂superscript𝑛′O(\\log n^{\\prime}) time. The preprocessing time is O​(n′)𝑂superscript𝑛′O(n^{\\prime}) if the Voronoi\ndiagram of Q𝑄Q is known. The preprocessing algorithm is essentially the same as that in .\nWe first compute the Voronoi diagram\n𝖵𝖣​(Q)𝖵𝖣𝑄\\mathsf{VD}(Q) of Q𝑄Q, from which we can obtain the convex hull 𝖢𝖧​(Q)𝖢𝖧𝑄\\mathsf{CH}(Q) of Q𝑄Q in linear time. Then, we determine Qesubscript𝑄𝑒Q_{e} for each edge e𝑒e of\n𝖢𝖧​(Q)𝖢𝖧𝑄\\mathsf{CH}(Q). We preprocess each Qesubscript𝑄𝑒Q_{e} as follows.\nWe build a balanced binary search tree Tesubscript𝑇𝑒T_{e} whose leaves corresponding to\nthe points of Qe={p1,p2,…,pm}subscript𝑄𝑒subscript𝑝1subscript𝑝2…subscript𝑝𝑚Q_{e}=\\{p_{1},p_{2},\\ldots,p_{m}\\}\nin their index order as discussed before. For each node v𝑣v of Tesubscript𝑇𝑒T_{e}, we use\nQe​(v)subscript𝑄𝑒𝑣Q_{e}(v) to denote the set of points in the leaves of the subtree\nrooted at v𝑣v. Before enhancing Tesubscript𝑇𝑒T_{e} with additional information, we describe\nour query algorithm. Consider a query segment s𝑠s. Without loss of generality, we assume that s𝑠s is\nhorizontal and below 𝖢𝖧​(Q)𝖢𝖧𝑄\\mathsf{CH}(Q). Let a𝑎a and b𝑏b be the left and right endponits\nof s𝑠s, respectively. As discussed before,\nwe first find the lowest vertex v𝑣v of 𝖢𝖧​(Q)𝖢𝖧𝑄\\mathsf{CH}(Q), which can be done in O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n)\ntime by doing binary search on 𝖢𝖧​(Q)𝖢𝖧𝑄\\mathsf{CH}(Q). If x​(a)≤x​(v)≤x​(b)𝑥𝑎𝑥𝑣𝑥𝑏x(a)\\leq x(v)\\leq x(b), then v𝑣v\nmust be the closest point of Q𝑄Q to s𝑠s and we are done with the query.\nOtherwise, without loss of generality, we assume that x​(b)<x​(v)𝑥𝑏𝑥𝑣x(b)<x(v). By binary\nsearch on 𝖢𝖧​(Q)𝖢𝖧𝑄\\mathsf{CH}(Q), we find in O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) time\nthe edge e𝑒e in the lower hull of 𝖢𝖧​(Q)𝖢𝖧𝑄\\mathsf{CH}(Q) that intersects\nthe vertical line through b𝑏b. Then, the closest point of s𝑠s in Q𝑄Q must be in\nQesubscript𝑄𝑒Q_{e} .\nWe next find pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s} using Tesubscript𝑇𝑒T_{e} and the algorithm has three steps as\ndiscussed above. First, for computing j∗superscript𝑗j^{*}, starting from the\nroot of Tesubscript𝑇𝑒T_{e}, for each node v𝑣v, we do the following. Let u𝑢u be\nthe right child of v𝑣v. Let xlsubscript𝑥𝑙x_{l} and xrsubscript𝑥𝑟x_{r} denote the\nx𝑥x-coordinates of the leftmost and rightmost points of Qe​(u)subscript𝑄𝑒𝑢Q_{e}(u), respectively.\nIf xl≤x​(b)subscript𝑥𝑙𝑥𝑏x_{l}\\leq x(b), then pj∗subscript𝑝superscript𝑗p_{j^{*}} is in Qe​(u)subscript𝑄𝑒𝑢Q_{e}(u) and we proceed on\nu𝑢u. Otherwise, pj∗subscript𝑝superscript𝑗p_{j^{*}} cannot be in Qe​(u)subscript𝑄𝑒𝑢Q_{e}(u) and we proceed on the\nleft child of v𝑣v. Second, for computing i∗superscript𝑖i^{*}, starting from the\nroot of Tesubscript𝑇𝑒T_{e}, for each node v𝑣v, we do the following. Let u𝑢u be\nthe right child of v𝑣v. Let w𝑤w be the left child of v𝑣v. Let xlsubscript𝑥𝑙x_{l} and xrsubscript𝑥𝑟x_{r} denote the\nx𝑥x-coordinates of the leftmost and rightmost points of Qe​(u)subscript𝑄𝑒𝑢Q_{e}(u), respectively.\nIf xl<x​(a)≤xrsubscript𝑥𝑙𝑥𝑎subscript𝑥𝑟x_{l}<x(a)\\leq x_{r}, then pi∗subscript𝑝superscript𝑖p_{i^{*}} must be in Qe​(u)subscript𝑄𝑒𝑢Q_{e}(u) and we\nproceed on u𝑢u. If x​(a)≤xl𝑥𝑎subscript𝑥𝑙x(a)\\leq x_{l}, then we proceed on w𝑤w since pi∗subscript𝑝superscript𝑖p_{i^{*}} is either in Qe​(w)subscript𝑄𝑒𝑤Q_{e}(w) or\nthe leftmost leaf of the subtree rooted at u𝑢u (the latter case will be handled\nnext). If x​(a)>xr𝑥𝑎subscript𝑥𝑟x(a)>x_{r}, then pi∗subscript𝑝superscript𝑖p_{i^{*}} is w′′superscript𝑤′′w^{\\prime\\prime}, where\nw′′superscript𝑤′′w^{\\prime\\prime} is the right neighboring leaf of w′superscript𝑤′w^{\\prime} and w′superscript𝑤′w^{\\prime} is the rightmost leaf of\nthe subtree rooted at u𝑢u. After i∗superscript𝑖i^{*} and j∗superscript𝑗j^{*} are found, by standard approach, we can obtain a set V𝑉V of\nO​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) nodes of\nTesubscript𝑇𝑒T_{e} such that the union of Qe​(v)subscript𝑄𝑒𝑣Q_{e}(v) of all nodes v∈V𝑣𝑉v\\in V is exactly\nQe​[i∗,j∗]subscript𝑄𝑒superscript𝑖superscript𝑗Q_{e}[i^{*},j^{*}]. For each node v∈V𝑣𝑉v\\in V, we find the lowest point of\nQe​(v)subscript𝑄𝑒𝑣Q_{e}(v) as a candidate; finally among all such candidate points, we return the lowest one as pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s}. To implement all above three steps in O​(log⁡n′)𝑂superscript𝑛′O(\\log n^{\\prime}) time, we enhance Tesubscript𝑇𝑒T_{e}\nin the same way as that in . We briefly\ndiscuss it here for completeness. We first\nstore the convex hull 𝖢𝖧​(Qe)𝖢𝖧subscript𝑄𝑒\\mathsf{CH}(Q_{e}) at the root of Tesubscript𝑇𝑒T_{e}. Any other internal node\nstores the portion of its convex hull that is not stored by its\nancestors. For this, a key observation is that the convex hull of a\nnode can be obtained from the convex hulls of its children by\ncomputing the two common tangents (this is because the two subsets of\npoints at the two children are separated by a line perpendicular to e𝑒e).\nIn addition, we construct a fractional cascading\nstructure  so that if a tangent to the convex\nhull at a node v𝑣v\nis known, then the tangents of the same slope to the convex hulls of\nthe two children can be found in constant time. The total\npreprocessing time for Q𝑄Q is O​(n′​log⁡n′)𝑂superscript𝑛′superscript𝑛′O(n^{\\prime}\\log n^{\\prime}) and the space is O​(n′)𝑂superscript𝑛′O(n^{\\prime}). In\naddition, if the Voronoi diagram of Q𝑄Q is known, then the\npreprocessing time can be reduced to O​(n′)𝑂superscript𝑛′O(n^{\\prime}).\nIn this way, all above three steps (and thus the entire query algorithm)\ncan be implemented in O​(log⁡n′)𝑂superscript𝑛′O(\\log n^{\\prime})\ntime. For example, to compute j∗superscript𝑗j^{*}, we need to access O​(log⁡n′)𝑂superscript𝑛′O(\\log n^{\\prime})\nnodes and for each such node v𝑣v, we need to find the leftmost and\nrightmost points of Qe​(v)subscript𝑄𝑒𝑣Q_{e}(v). This can be done in O​(log⁡n′)𝑂superscript𝑛′O(\\log n^{\\prime}) time\nusing the fractional cascading structure by computing the tangents to\ntheir convex hulls of a slope perpendicular to s𝑠s. In summary, the above gives an O​(n′)𝑂superscript𝑛′O(n^{\\prime}) space data structure that can\nsupport each outside-hull segment query in O​(log⁡n′)𝑂superscript𝑛′O(\\log n^{\\prime}) time. The\ndata structure can be built in O​(n′​log⁡n′)𝑂superscript𝑛′superscript𝑛′O(n^{\\prime}\\log n^{\\prime}) time or in O​(n′)𝑂superscript𝑛′O(n^{\\prime}) time if\nthe Voronoi diagram of Q𝑄Q is known. We now give a new algorithm that fits the ΓΓ\\Gamma-algorithm framework.\nThe new algorithm requires slightly more preprocessing than Lemma 3.7.\nBut for our purpose, we are satisfied with O​(n4/3)𝑂superscript𝑛43O(n^{4/3}) preprocessing time.\nWe have different preprocessing for each of the three steps of the query algorithm, as follows. For computing j∗superscript𝑗j^{*}, we will use the basic search lemma (i.e.,\nLemma 4.1) in [ref]11. In order to apply the lemma,\nwe perform the following preprocessing. Recall that Qe={p1,p2,…,pm}subscript𝑄𝑒subscript𝑝1subscript𝑝2…subscript𝑝𝑚Q_{e}=\\{p_{1},p_{2},\\ldots,p_{m}\\} is ordered by their Voronoi cells\nintersecting e𝑒e. We partition the sequence into r𝑟r contiguous subsequences of\nsize roughly m/r𝑚𝑟m/r each. Let Qeisuperscriptsubscript𝑄𝑒𝑖Q_{e}^{i} denote the i𝑖i-th subsequence, with 1≤i≤r1𝑖𝑟1\\leq i\\leq r.\nFor each i∈[1,r]𝑖1𝑟i\\in[1,r], we compute and explicitly\nmaintain the convex hull 𝖢𝖧​(i)𝖢𝖧𝑖\\mathsf{CH}(i) of all points in the union\nof the subsequences Qejsuperscriptsubscript𝑄𝑒𝑗Q_{e}^{j}, j=i,i+1,…,r𝑗𝑖𝑖1…𝑟j=i,i+1,\\ldots,r.\nNext, for each subsequence Qeisuperscriptsubscript𝑄𝑒𝑖Q_{e}^{i}, we further partition it into r𝑟r contiguous sequences\nof size roughly |Qei|/rsuperscriptsubscript𝑄𝑒𝑖𝑟|Q_{e}^{i}|/r and process it in the same way as above. We do\nthis recursively until the subsequence has no more than r𝑟r points. In this\nway, we obtain a tree T𝑇T with m𝑚m leaves such that each node has r𝑟r children. For each node v𝑣v, we use 𝖢𝖧​(v)𝖢𝖧𝑣\\mathsf{CH}(v) to denote the convex hull that is computed above corresponding to v𝑣v (e.g., if v𝑣v is the child of the root corresponding to Qeisuperscriptsubscript𝑄𝑒𝑖Q_{e}^{i}, then 𝖢𝖧​(v)𝖢𝖧𝑣\\mathsf{CH}(v) is 𝖢𝖧​(i)𝖢𝖧𝑖\\mathsf{CH}(i) defined above).\nThe total time for constructing T𝑇T can be easily bounded by O​(m​r​log⁡m​logr⁡m)𝑂𝑚𝑟𝑚subscript𝑟𝑚O(mr\\log m\\log_{r}m) as the height of T𝑇T is O​(logr⁡m)𝑂subscript𝑟𝑚O(\\log_{r}m). Now to compute j∗superscript𝑗j^{*}, we search the tree T𝑇T: starting from\nthe root, for each node v𝑣v, we apply the basic search lemma on all r𝑟r\nchildren of v𝑣v. Indeed, this is possible due to the following. Consider the\nroot v𝑣v. For each i𝑖i with 1≤i≤r1𝑖𝑟1\\leq i\\leq r, let xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} denote the\nx𝑥x-coordinate of the leftmost point of the union of the subsequences\nQejsuperscriptsubscript𝑄𝑒𝑗Q_{e}^{j}, j=i,i+1,…,r𝑗𝑖𝑖1…𝑟j=i,i+1,\\ldots,r; note that xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} is also the leftmost vertex of 𝖢𝖧​(i)𝖢𝖧𝑖\\mathsf{CH}(i).\nIt is not difficult to see that x1≤x2≤…≤xrsubscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2…subscript𝑥𝑟x_{1}\\leq x_{2}\\leq\\ldots\\leq x_{r}. Observe that pj∗subscript𝑝superscript𝑗p_{j^{*}} is in Qeisuperscriptsubscript𝑄𝑒𝑖Q_{e}^{i} if and only if xi≤x​(b)<xi+1subscript𝑥𝑖𝑥𝑏subscript𝑥𝑖1x_{i}\\leq x(b)<x_{i+1}.\nTherefore, we find the index i𝑖i such that xi≤x​(b)<xi+1subscript𝑥𝑖𝑥𝑏subscript𝑥𝑖1x_{i}\\leq x(b)<x_{i+1} and then\nproceed to the child of v𝑣v corresponding to Qeisuperscriptsubscript𝑄𝑒𝑖Q_{e}^{i}. This property satisfies the\ncondition of the basic search lemma (essentially, we are looking for the\npredecessor of b𝑏b in the sequence x1,x2,…,xrsubscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2…subscript𝑥𝑟x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{r} and this is somewhat\nsimilar to the insertion sort algorithm of Theorem 4.1 [ref]11, which uses the basic search lemma). By\nthe basic search lemma, finding the index i𝑖i can be done using O​(1−r​Δ​Φ)𝑂1𝑟ΔΦO(1-r\\Delta\\Phi)\ncomparisons provided that the x𝑥x-coordinates x1,x2,…,xrsubscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2…subscript𝑥𝑟x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{r} are available to\nus (we will discuss how to compute them later). We then follow the same idea recursively until we reach a leaf.\nIn this way, the total number of comparisons for computing j∗superscript𝑗j^{*} is\nO​(logr⁡m−r​Δ​Φ)𝑂subscript𝑟𝑚𝑟ΔΦO(\\log_{r}m-r\\Delta\\Phi). By setting r=mϵ𝑟superscript𝑚italic-ϵr=m^{\\epsilon} for a small constant ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon, the\npreprocessing time is O​(m1+ϵ​log⁡m)𝑂superscript𝑚1italic-ϵ𝑚O(m^{1+\\epsilon}\\log m) and\ncomputing j∗superscript𝑗j^{*} can be done using O​(1−mϵ​Δ​Φ)𝑂1superscript𝑚italic-ϵΔΦO(1-m^{\\epsilon}\\Delta\\Phi) comparisons.\nRecall that there are O​(n4/3)𝑂superscript𝑛43O(n^{4/3}) queries in our original problem (i.e., recurrence (5)) and the total time for −Δ​ΦΔΦ-\\Delta\\Phi during the entire algorithm is O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n). Also, since m𝑚m is the number of points of Q𝑄Q whose Voronoi cells intersecting the edge e𝑒e of 𝖢𝖧​(Q)𝖢𝖧𝑄\\mathsf{CH}(Q),\nthe sum of m𝑚m for all outside-hull segment query data structures for all edges of 𝖢𝖧​(Q)𝖢𝖧𝑄\\mathsf{CH}(Q) is |Q|𝑄|Q|, which is n′superscript𝑛′n^{\\prime}. By Observation 3.3, the sum of n′superscript𝑛′n^{\\prime} for all data structures in our original problem is O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n).\nHence, the total preprocessing time for our original problem is O​(n1+ϵ​log2+ϵ⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛1italic-ϵsuperscript2italic-ϵ𝑛O(n^{1+\\epsilon}\\log^{2+\\epsilon}n), which is bounded by O​(n4/3)𝑂superscript𝑛43O(n^{4/3}) if we set ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon to a small constant (e.g.,\nϵ=1/4italic-ϵ14\\epsilon=1/4). As such,\nwith a preprocessing step of O​(n4/3)𝑂superscript𝑛43O(n^{4/3}) time, we can compute j∗superscript𝑗j^{*} for all\nqueries using a total of O​(n4/3)𝑂superscript𝑛43O(n^{4/3}) comparisons. The above complexity analysis for computing j∗superscript𝑗j^{*} is based on the assumption that the leftmost\npoint of 𝖢𝖧​(v)𝖢𝖧𝑣\\mathsf{CH}(v) for each node v𝑣v of T𝑇T is known. To find these points during\nthe queries, we take advantage of the property that all queries are\noffline, i.e., we know all query segments before we start the queries.\nNotice that although there are\nO​(n4/3)𝑂superscript𝑛43O(n^{4/3}) queries, the number of distinct query segments is n𝑛n, i.e., those\nin S𝑆S (a segment may be queried on different subsets of P𝑃P).\nLet s𝑠s be the current query segment and p𝑝p be the leftmost point of a convex\nhull C​H​(v)𝐶𝐻𝑣CH(v) with respect to s𝑠s (i.e., by assuming s𝑠s is horizontal). Let\nρ1subscript𝜌1\\rho_{1} be the ray from p𝑝p going vertically upwards. Let ρ2subscript𝜌2\\rho_{2} be another ray from p𝑝p\ngoing through the clockwise neighbor of p𝑝p on C​Hv𝐶subscript𝐻𝑣CH_{v}, i.e., ρ2subscript𝜌2\\rho_{2} contains\nthe clockwise edge of C​Hv𝐶subscript𝐻𝑣CH_{v} incident to v𝑣v. Observe that for another query\nsegment s′superscript𝑠′s^{\\prime}, p𝑝p is still the leftmost point of C​Hv𝐶subscript𝐻𝑣CH_{v} with respect to s′superscript𝑠′s^{\\prime} as\nlong as the direction perpendicular to s′superscript𝑠′s^{\\prime} is within the angle from ρ1subscript𝜌1\\rho_{1}\nclockwise to ρ2subscript𝜌2\\rho_{2}.\nBased on this observation, before we start any query, we sort the perpendicular\ndirections of all segments of S𝑆S along with the directions of all edges of all\nconvex hulls of all nodes of the trees T𝑇T for all outside-hull segment query\ndata structures in our original problem (i.e., the recurrence (5)).\nAs analyzed above, the total size of convex hulls of all trees T𝑇T is\nO​(n1+ϵ​log2+ϵ⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛1italic-ϵsuperscript2italic-ϵ𝑛O(n^{1+\\epsilon}\\log^{2+\\epsilon}n). Hence, the sorting can be done in\nO​(n1+ϵ​log3+ϵ⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛1italic-ϵsuperscript3italic-ϵ𝑛O(n^{1+\\epsilon}\\log^{3+\\epsilon}n) time. Let L𝐿L be the sorted list. We\nsolve the queries for segments following their order in L𝐿L.\nLet s𝑠s and s′superscript𝑠′s^{\\prime} be two consecutive segments of S𝑆S in L𝐿L. After we solve all\nqueries for s𝑠s, the directions between s𝑠s and s′superscript𝑠′s^{\\prime} in L𝐿L correspond to those\nnodes of the trees T𝑇T whose leftmost points need to get updated, and we then\nupdate the leftmost points of those nodes before we solve queries for s′superscript𝑠′s^{\\prime}. The\ntotal time we update the tree nodes for all queries is proportional to the total\nsize of all trees, which is O​(n1+ϵ​log2+ϵ⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛1italic-ϵsuperscript2italic-ϵ𝑛O(n^{1+\\epsilon}\\log^{2+\\epsilon}n). In summary, after O​(n4/3)𝑂superscript𝑛43O(n^{4/3}) time preprocessing, computing j∗superscript𝑗j^{*} for all\nO​(n4/3)𝑂superscript𝑛43O(n^{4/3}) outside-hull segment queries can be done using O​(n4/3)𝑂superscript𝑛43O(n^{4/3})\ncomparisons. For computing i∗superscript𝑖i^{*}, the idea is similar and we only sketch it.\nIn the preprocessing, we build the same tree T𝑇T as above for the first step.\nOne change is that we add the first point p𝑝p of the subsequence Qeisuperscriptsubscript𝑄𝑒𝑖Q_{e}^{i} to the\nend of Qei−1superscriptsubscript𝑄𝑒𝑖1Q_{e}^{i-1}, i.e., p𝑝p appears in both Qeisuperscriptsubscript𝑄𝑒𝑖Q_{e}^{i} and Qei−1superscriptsubscript𝑄𝑒𝑖1Q_{e}^{i-1}. This does\nnot change the complexities asymptotically. For each query, to compute i∗superscript𝑖i^{*}, consider the root v𝑣v. Observe that i∗superscript𝑖i^{*} is\nin Qeisuperscriptsubscript𝑄𝑒𝑖Q_{e}^{i} if and only if xi<x​(a)≤xi+1subscript𝑥𝑖𝑥𝑎subscript𝑥𝑖1x_{i}<x(a)\\leq x_{i+1} (xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} and xi+1subscript𝑥𝑖1x_{i+1} are\ndefined in the same way as before). As such, we can apply the basic search lemma to\nfind i∗superscript𝑖i^{*} in O​(1−mϵ​Δ​Φ)𝑂1superscript𝑚italic-ϵΔΦO(1-m^{\\epsilon}\\Delta\\Phi) comparisons. We can use the same\napproach as above to update the leftmost points of convex hulls of nodes of the\ntrees T𝑇T (i.e., computing a sorted list L𝐿L and process the queries of the\nsegments following their order in L𝐿L). In summary, after O​(n4/3)𝑂superscript𝑛43O(n^{4/3}) time preprocessing, computing i∗superscript𝑖i^{*} for all\nO​(n4/3)𝑂superscript𝑛43O(n^{4/3}) outside-hull segment queries can be done using O​(n4/3)𝑂superscript𝑛43O(n^{4/3})\ncomparisons. The third step of the query algorithm is to find the point pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s} of\nQe​[i∗,j∗]subscript𝑄𝑒superscript𝑖superscript𝑗Q_{e}[i^{*},j^{*}] closest to ℓ​(s)ℓ𝑠\\ell(s), where ℓ​(s)ℓ𝑠\\ell(s) is the supporting line of s𝑠s.\nWe first discuss the preprocessing step on Qesubscript𝑄𝑒Q_{e}. We build a balanced binary search tree Tesubscript𝑇𝑒T_{e} whose leaves corresponding to\nthe points of Qe={p1,p2,…,pm}subscript𝑄𝑒subscript𝑝1subscript𝑝2…subscript𝑝𝑚Q_{e}=\\{p_{1},p_{2},\\ldots,p_{m}\\}\nin their index order as discussed before. For each node v𝑣v of Tesubscript𝑇𝑒T_{e}, we use\nQe​(v)subscript𝑄𝑒𝑣Q_{e}(v) to denote the set of points in the leaves of the subtree\nrooted at v𝑣v.\nFor each node v𝑣v of Tesubscript𝑇𝑒T_{e}, we explicitly store the convex hull of\nQe​(v)subscript𝑄𝑒𝑣Q_{e}(v) at v𝑣v.\nFurther, for each leaf v𝑣v, which stores a point pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} of Qesubscript𝑄𝑒Q_{e}, for each ancestor\nu𝑢u of v𝑣v, we compute the convex hull 𝖢𝖧r​(v,u)subscript𝖢𝖧𝑟𝑣𝑢\\mathsf{CH}_{r}(v,u) of all points\npi,pi+1,…,pjsubscript𝑝𝑖subscript𝑝𝑖1…subscript𝑝𝑗p_{i},p_{i+1},\\ldots,p_{j}, where pjsubscript𝑝𝑗p_{j} is the point in the\nrightmost leaf of the subtree at u𝑢u. We do this in a bottom-up manner\nstarting from v𝑣v following the path from v𝑣v to u𝑢u. More specifically,\nsuppose we are currently at a node w𝑤w, which is v𝑣v initially.\nSuppose we have the convex hull 𝖢𝖧r​(v,w)subscript𝖢𝖧𝑟𝑣𝑤\\mathsf{CH}_{r}(v,w).\nWe proceed on the parent w′superscript𝑤′w^{\\prime} of w𝑤w as follows. If w𝑤w is the right child of w′superscript𝑤′w^{\\prime}, then 𝖢𝖧r​(v,w′)subscript𝖢𝖧𝑟𝑣superscript𝑤′\\mathsf{CH}_{r}(v,w^{\\prime}) is 𝖢𝖧r​(v,w)subscript𝖢𝖧𝑟𝑣𝑤\\mathsf{CH}_{r}(v,w) and thus we do nothing.\nOtherwise, we merge 𝖢𝖧r​(v,w)subscript𝖢𝖧𝑟𝑣𝑤\\mathsf{CH}_{r}(v,w) with the convex hull of Qe​(w′′)subscript𝑄𝑒superscript𝑤′′Q_{e}(w^{\\prime\\prime}) at w′′superscript𝑤′′w^{\\prime\\prime}, where\nw′′superscript𝑤′′w^{\\prime\\prime} is the right child of w′superscript𝑤′w^{\\prime}. Since points of 𝖢𝖧r​(v,w)subscript𝖢𝖧𝑟𝑣𝑤\\mathsf{CH}_{r}(v,w) are\nseparated from points of Qe​(w′′)subscript𝑄𝑒superscript𝑤′′Q_{e}(w^{\\prime\\prime}) by a line perpendicular to\ne𝑒e , we can merge the two hulls by\ncomputing their common tangents in O​(log⁡m)𝑂𝑚O(\\log m)\ntime . We use a persistent tree to maintain\nthe convex hulls (e.g., by a path-copying\nmethod)   so that after the\nmerge we still keep 𝖢𝖧r​(v,w)subscript𝖢𝖧𝑟𝑣𝑤\\mathsf{CH}_{r}(v,w). In this way, we have\ncomputed 𝖢𝖧r​(v,w′)subscript𝖢𝖧𝑟𝑣superscript𝑤′\\mathsf{CH}_{r}(v,w^{\\prime}) and we then proceed on the parent\nof w′superscript𝑤′w^{\\prime}. We do this until we reach the root. As such, the total time and\nextra space for computing the convex hulls for a leaf v𝑣v is O​(log2⁡m)𝑂superscript2𝑚O(\\log^{2}m), and the total time and space for doing this for all leaves\nis O​(m​log2⁡m)𝑂𝑚superscript2𝑚O(m\\log^{2}m). Symmetrically, for each leaf v𝑣v, which stores a point pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} of Qesubscript𝑄𝑒Q_{e}, for each ancestor u𝑢u of v𝑣v, we compute the convex hull 𝖢𝖧l​(v,u)subscript𝖢𝖧𝑙𝑣𝑢\\mathsf{CH}_{l}(v,u) of all points\nph,ph+1,…,pisubscript𝑝ℎsubscript𝑝ℎ1…subscript𝑝𝑖p_{h},p_{h+1},\\ldots,p_{i}, whether phsubscript𝑝ℎp_{h} is the point in the\nleftmost leaf of the subtree at u𝑢u. Computing the convex hulls 𝖢𝖧l​(v,u)subscript𝖢𝖧𝑙𝑣𝑢\\mathsf{CH}_{l}(v,u) for all ancestors u𝑢u for all leaves v𝑣v can be done in O​(m​log2⁡m)𝑂𝑚superscript2𝑚O(m\\log^{2}m) in a similar way as above.\nIn addition, we construct a lowest common ancestor (LCA) data\nstructure on the tree Tesubscript𝑇𝑒T_{e} in O​(m)𝑂𝑚O(m) time so that the LCA of any two query nodes of\nTesubscript𝑇𝑒T_{e} can be found in O​(1)𝑂1O(1) time  .\nThe total preprocessing time for constructing the tree Tesubscript𝑇𝑒T_{e} as above is O​(m​log2⁡m)𝑂𝑚superscript2𝑚O(m\\log^{2}m).\nRecall that the sum of m𝑚m for all outside-hull segment query data structures is O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n). Therefore, the total preprocessing time as above for all data structures is O​(n​log3⁡n)𝑂𝑛superscript3𝑛O(n\\log^{3}n). Now consider the third step of the query algorithm. Suppose\ni∗superscript𝑖i^{*} and j∗superscript𝑗j^{*} are known. The problem is to compute the point pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s} of\nQe​[i∗,j∗]subscript𝑄𝑒superscript𝑖superscript𝑗Q_{e}[i^{*},j^{*}] closest to the supporting line ℓ​(s)ℓ𝑠\\ell(s) of s𝑠s. Let\nu𝑢u and v𝑣v be the two leaves of Tesubscript𝑇𝑒T_{e} storing the two points pi∗subscript𝑝superscript𝑖p_{i^{*}}\nand pj∗subscript𝑝superscript𝑗p_{j^{*}}, respectively. Let w𝑤w be the lowest common ancestor of u𝑢u\nand v𝑣v. Let u′superscript𝑢′u^{\\prime} and v′superscript𝑣′v^{\\prime} be the left and right children of w𝑤w,\nrespectively. It is not difficult to see that the convex hull of\n𝖢𝖧r​(u,u′)subscript𝖢𝖧𝑟𝑢superscript𝑢′\\mathsf{CH}_{r}(u,u^{\\prime}) and 𝖢𝖧l​(v,v′)subscript𝖢𝖧𝑙𝑣superscript𝑣′\\mathsf{CH}_{l}(v,v^{\\prime}) is the convex hull of Qe​[i∗,j∗]subscript𝑄𝑒superscript𝑖superscript𝑗Q_{e}[i^{*},j^{*}]. As\nsuch, to find pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s}, it suffices to compute the vertex of\n𝖢𝖧r​(u,u′)subscript𝖢𝖧𝑟𝑢superscript𝑢′\\mathsf{CH}_{r}(u,u^{\\prime}) closest to ℓ​(s)ℓ𝑠\\ell(s) and the vertex of 𝖢𝖧l​(v,v′)subscript𝖢𝖧𝑙𝑣superscript𝑣′\\mathsf{CH}_{l}(v,v^{\\prime}) closest to\nℓ​(s)ℓ𝑠\\ell(s), and among the two points, return the one closer to ℓ​(s)ℓ𝑠\\ell(s) as pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s}.\nTo implement the algorithm, finding w𝑤w can be done in O​(1)𝑂1O(1) time\nusing the LCA data structure  .\nTo find the closest vertex of 𝖢𝖧r​(u,u′)subscript𝖢𝖧𝑟𝑢superscript𝑢′\\mathsf{CH}_{r}(u,u^{\\prime}) to ℓ​(s)ℓ𝑠\\ell(s), recall that the preprocessing computes a balanced binary search tree (maintained by a persistent tree), denoted by Tr​(u,u′)subscript𝑇𝑟𝑢superscript𝑢′T_{r}(u,u^{\\prime}), for maintaining 𝖢𝖧r​(u,u′)subscript𝖢𝖧𝑟𝑢superscript𝑢′\\mathsf{CH}_{r}(u,u^{\\prime}).\nWe apply a search lemma of Chan and Zheng (Lemma\nA.1 [ref]11) on the tree Tr​(u,u′)subscript𝑇𝑟𝑢superscript𝑢′T_{r}(u,u^{\\prime}). Indeed, the problem is\nequivalent to finding the predecessor of the slope of ℓ​(s)ℓ𝑠\\ell(s) among the slopes\nof the edges of 𝖢𝖧r​(u,u′)subscript𝖢𝖧𝑟𝑢superscript𝑢′\\mathsf{CH}_{r}(u,u^{\\prime}). Using the search lemma, we can find the\nvertex of 𝖢𝖧r​(u,u′)subscript𝖢𝖧𝑟𝑢superscript𝑢′\\mathsf{CH}_{r}(u,u^{\\prime}) closest to ℓ​(s)ℓ𝑠\\ell(s) using O​(1−Δ​Φ)𝑂1ΔΦO(1-\\Delta\\Phi) comparisons.\nSimilarly, the vertex of 𝖢𝖧l​(v,v′)subscript𝖢𝖧𝑙𝑣superscript𝑣′\\mathsf{CH}_{l}(v,v^{\\prime}) closest to ℓ​(s)ℓ𝑠\\ell(s) can be found\nusing O​(1−Δ​Φ)𝑂1ΔΦO(1-\\Delta\\Phi) comparisons. In this way, pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s} can be computed using O​(1−Δ​Φ)𝑂1ΔΦO(1-\\Delta\\Phi) comparisons. In summary, with O​(n​log3⁡n)𝑂𝑛superscript3𝑛O(n\\log^{3}n) time preprocessing, the third step of the query algorithm for all\nO​(n4/3)𝑂superscript𝑛43O(n^{4/3}) queries can be done using a total of O​(n4/3)𝑂superscript𝑛43O(n^{4/3}) comparisons (recall that the sum of\n−Δ​ΦΔΦ-\\Delta\\Phi in the entire algorithm is O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n)). Combining the three steps discussed above, all O​(n4/3)𝑂superscript𝑛43O(n^{4/3}) outside-hull segment queries can be solved using O​(n4/3)𝑂superscript𝑛43O(n^{4/3}) comparisons.\nRecall that the above only discussed\nthe query on the data structure for a single edge e𝑒e of the convex hull of Q𝑄Q.\nAs the first procedure of the query, we need to find the vertex of 𝖢𝖧​(Q)𝖢𝖧𝑄\\mathsf{CH}(Q) closest to\nthe supporting line of s𝑠s.\nFor this, we can maintain the convex hull 𝖢𝖧​(Q)𝖢𝖧𝑄\\mathsf{CH}(Q) by a balanced binary search tree\nand apply the search lemma of Chan and Zheng (Lemma\nA.1 [ref]11) in the same way as discussed above. As such, this procedure for all\nqueries uses O​(n4/3)𝑂superscript𝑛43O(n^{4/3}) comparisons. The second procedure of the query is to find the edge of\n𝖢𝖧​(Q)𝖢𝖧𝑄\\mathsf{CH}(Q) intersecting the line through one of the endpoints of s𝑠s and perpendicular to\ns𝑠s. This operation is essentially to find a predecessor of the above endpoint of s𝑠s on the vertices of the lower hull of 𝖢𝖧​(Q)𝖢𝖧𝑄\\mathsf{CH}(Q). Therefore, we\ncan also apply the search lemma of Chan and Zheng, and thus this procedure for all\nqueries also uses O​(n4/3)𝑂superscript𝑛43O(n^{4/3}) comparisons.\nAs such, we can solve all O​(n4/3)𝑂superscript𝑛43O(n^{4/3}) outside-hull segment queries using O​(n4/3)𝑂superscript𝑛43O(n^{4/3}) comparisons, or\nalternatively, we have an algebraic decision tree of height O​(n4/3)𝑂superscript𝑛43O(n^{4/3}) that\ncan solve all O​(n4/3)𝑂superscript𝑛43O(n^{4/3}) queries.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: time.\nWe have different preprocessing for each of the three steps of the query algorithm, as follows. For computing j∗superscript𝑗j^{*}, we will use the basic search lemma (i.e.,\nLemma 4.1) in [ref]11. In order to apply the lemma,\nwe perform the following preprocessing. Recall that Qe={p1,p2,…,pm}subscript𝑄𝑒subscript𝑝1subscript𝑝2…subscript𝑝𝑚Q_{e}=\\{p_{1},p_{2},\\ldots,p_{m}\\} is ordered by\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
