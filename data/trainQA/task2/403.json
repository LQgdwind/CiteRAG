      "content": "Paper Title: Speech to Text Adaptation: Towards an Efficient Cross-Modal Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe final step is constructing the concrete structure of KD, where the teacher pre-trained LM [ref]6 utilizes text input, and the student adopts a speech instance , while two share the same type of prediction .\nIn this process, we set rules of thumb to leverage the given structure and training resources as efficiently as possible. Since one of our aims is to make the best of verified ready-made solutions, we integrated the released structures, the specifications follow as: Backbone student model adopts ASR pre-trained module  and RNN-based intent classifier , which respectively yields word posterior sequence and slot-wise predictions. For the teacher model, the pre-trained BERT is utilized without additional modification, and the fine-tuning only exploits a freely available benchmark. In addition to the cross-entropy (CE) function that is used as the loss of an end-to-end SLU module, a KD loss is augmented to the total loss to reflect the influence of the teacher in the student training phase. In sharing the knowledge, as mentioned above, the guidance is conveyed from the upper components of the fine-tuned BERT logit layers so that the student coincides with the representation that comes from the text input.\nUnlike the raw-text-friendly input layers of LM, we believe that the upper layers are the parts where the abstracted textual information possibly meets the spoken features.  More specifically, the shared knowledge can be represented as a regulation (loss function) that the teacher model gives to the student in the training phase, which leads the tutee to a desirable direction. The notation for the total loss function is as follows: where t𝑡t is a scheduling factor and αt+βt=1subscript𝛼𝑡subscript𝛽𝑡1\\alpha_{t}+\\beta_{t}=1. αtsubscript𝛼𝑡\\alpha_{t} and βtsubscript𝛽𝑡\\beta_{t}, here denoted as KD weight, are hyper-parameters that decide the influence of Lc​esubscript𝐿𝑐𝑒L_{ce} and Lk​dsubscript𝐿𝑘𝑑L_{kd} respectively, which can be either fixed or dynamically updated. Detailed on the losses, Lc​esubscript𝐿𝑐𝑒L_{ce} is a CE between the answer labels and the predicted logits of the SLU component, as in (2), where f(⋅)subscript𝑓⋅f_{(\\cdot)} is a logit representation and Y𝑌Y is the target label. Lk​dsubscript𝐿𝑘𝑑L_{kd} is either a mean-squared error (MSE) or smoothed L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} loss (MAE) between the predicted logits of SLU component and the fine-tuned BERT, adopted based on  and  respectively. In (3), D𝐷D determines the type of distance (e.g., MSE, MAE): In BERT fine-tuning, we adopt two kinds of engineering to investigate the teacher models of diverse performance. For a less accurate one, we build a fully connected (FC) layer on the top of [CLS] representation of BERT [ref]6, while for the stronger model, we set FC layers for all the output representations of BERT and then apply a max pooling. We call the former teacher and the latter professor henceforth, considering the difference in training accuracy of both. Furthermore, to leverage the teacher and professor model simultaneously, we mix up the loss that comes from each network to make up a hybrid case as in (4): where γ=0𝛾0\\gamma=0 denotes only teacher and γ=1𝛾1\\gamma=1 only professor. For 0<γ<10𝛾10<\\gamma<1, hybrid, we apply the batch-wise intent error rate, γ=e​r​r𝛾𝑒𝑟𝑟\\gamma=err, inspired be . This implies that the professor models teaches more than teacher for the challenging samples.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: The final step is constructing the concrete structure of KD, where the teacher pre-trained LM [ref]6 utilizes text input, and the student adopts a speech instance , while two share the same type of prediction .\nIn this process, we set rules of thumb to leverage the given structure and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
