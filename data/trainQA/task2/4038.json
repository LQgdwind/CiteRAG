      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-scale Wasserstein Shortest-path Graph Kernels for Graph Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph-structured data is ubiquitous in many scenarios, such as protein-protein interaction networks, social networks, citation networks, and cyber-physical systems. One interesting and fundamental problem with graph-structured data is quantifying their similarities, which can be measured by graph kernels. Most of the graph kernels belong to the family of the R-convolution kernels  that decompose graphs into substructures and compare them. There are many kinds of substructures used in graph kernels, such as walks  [ref]3 , paths , subgraphs    , and subtree patterns 0 1 2 3 4 5. The R-convolution graph kernels have two main challenges. Firstly, when computing the similarity between two graphs, they count the number of occurrences of each unique substructure in each graph and aggregate the occurrences. Simple aggregation operation such as sum aggregation neglects the distributions of substructures in each graph, which might restrict their ability to capture complex relationships between substructures. Secondly, many R-convolution graph kernels cannot compare graphs at multiple different scales. For example, WL 2 3 computes graph similarity at coarse scales, because subtrees only consider the whole neighborhood structures of nodes rather than single edges between two nodes; SP  computes the graph similarity at fine scales because shortest paths do not take neighborhood structures into account. In many real-world scenarios, graphs such as social networks have structures at multiple different scales,\nsuch as chains, rings, and stars. Graph kernels should not only differentiate the overall shape of graphs but also their small substructures. To solve the first challenge, PM 6 eigendecomposes the adjacency matrix of a graph and embeds each node in the space spanned by the eigenvectors. The similarity between two graphs is computed by the Earth Mover’s Distance 7 or the Pyramid Match kernel 8 9, considering the distributions of node embeddings. However, eigenvectors can only capture the global connectivity of a graph. Thus, PM cannot compare graphs at multiple different scales. WWL 5 adopts the Weisfeiler-Lehman test of graph isomorphism 0 to relabel each node. The new label of a node corresponds to the subtree pattern around it. WWL considers node labels as categorical embeddings. The similarity between two graphs is computed by the Wasserstein distance, using the normalized Hamming distance as the ground distance for categorical node embeddings. The distributions of subtree patterns are considered in the computation of graph similarity. But WWL cannot compare graphs at fine scales because of the utilization of the subtree patterns as used in WL. To solve the second challenge, MLG  computes graph similarity at multiple different scales by applying recursively the Feature space Laplacian Graph (FLG) kernel on a hierarchy of nested subgraphs. Specifically, FLG is a variant of the Bhattacharyya kernel 1 that computes the similarity between two graphs by using their Laplacian matrices. The sizes of subgraphs increase with the increasing level of the hierarchy, including the different scales of the graph structure around a node. However, MLG does not take the distributions of node embeddings (denoted by the rows of the graph Laplacian matrix) into account when computing graph similarity. Considering that many real-world graphs have the small world property 2, i.e., the mean shortest-path length is small, the shortest-path graph kernel (SP)  fits these kind of graphs well. We study SP in this paper. The substructure used in SP is the shortest path which is represented by a triplet whose elements are the labels of source and sink nodes of this shortest path and its length. The triplet representation is coarse and may lose information because it neglects the labels of the intermediate nodes in a shortest path. In this paper, each shortest path is denoted by the concatenation of the labels of all the nodes in this shortest path rather than the simple triplet representation. Guided by the small world property, we build a truncated BFS (Breadth-First Search) tree of depth d𝑑d rooted at each node in a graph and only consider the shortest paths starting from the root to any other node in the truncated BFS tree. In this way, the maximal length of a shortest path in a graph is limited to d𝑑d. To mitigate the two challenges, we propose a multi-scale shortest-path graph/node feature map, capturing the multiple different scales of the graph structure. The shortest-path graph/node feature map is constructed by counting the number of occurrences of shortest paths in a graph or around a node. As aforementioned, SP cannot compare graphs at multiple different scales. To integrate the multiple different scales of the graph structure into the shortest-path graph/node feature map, we allow components in a shortest path to be BFS trees of different depths. To represent such kind of shortest paths, we project each BFS tree into an integer label by an injective hash method, i.e., hashing the same BFS trees to the same integer label and different BFS trees to different integer labels. Thus, the representation of such kind of shortest paths is just the concatenation of the integer labels of all BFS trees in this shortest path. We concatenate the multiple different scales of shortest-path graph/node feature maps and adopt the Wasserstein distance to compute graph similarity, capturing the distributions of shortest paths. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows: We build a truncated BFS tree of limited depth rooted at each node to restrict the maximal length of shortest paths in a graph, guided by the small world property. Each shortest path is represented by the concatenation of all its node labels rather than the simple triplet representation, considering all node labels in this shortest path. We propose the multi-scale shortest-path graph/node feature map that incorporates the different scales of the graph structure into the shortest-path graph/node feature map and can compare graphs at multiple different scales. The different scales of the graph structure are captured by the truncated BFS trees of varying depths rooted at each node. We develop a graph kernel called MWSP (for Multi-scale Wasserstein Shortest-Path graph kernel) that employs the Wasserstein distance to compute the similarity between the multi-scale shortest-path node feature maps of two graphs, capturing the distributions of shortest paths. We show in the experiments that our graph kernel MWSP achieves the best classification accuracy on most benchmark datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: kernels belong to the family of the R-convolution kernels  that decompose graphs into substructures and compare them.
