      "content": "Paper Title: “How Does It Detect A Malicious App?” Explaining the Predictions of AI-based Android Malware Detector\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nArtificial intelligence (AI) technologies, in particular shallow machine learning methods (e.g., logistic regression, SVM and random forest, etc.) and deep neural networks (e.g., CNN and LSTM, etc.), have been widely used to fight against cyber attacks today  .\nHowever, explaining the reasoning behind the predictions made by AI models remains one of the most challenging problems in both AI and cyber security communities.\nThe model explanation is to identify the relevance of data features to the model’s predicted class (Fig. 1).\nIt is not only to facilitate the cyber security practitioners’ understanding on how the AI model identifies the cyber threats, where the confidence on the model’s stability is expected, but also helps the AI researchers to find out the models’ vulverabilities from certain examples [ref]3.\nThe main factors affecting the insights provided by a model explainer are: the challenges of data, such as unbalanced data and high dimentionalities for different applications (e.g., malware detection),\nand the model complexity that is about the number of parameters and various types of model structures (e.g, SVM, CNN and LSTM).\nThese factors have motivated the interest on the model-agnostic explainers research   that are capable of explaining any types of AI models. The AI-based malware detection for Android operating system is a well studied problem     0.\nThe popularity and open nature of Android 1 and its official apps market, i.e., Google Play 2, have aroused large interests from malware developers, and accordingly make Android users more vulnerable to such attacks by thousands of malicious apps.\nIn 2019, AV-TEST 3 reported 3.16 million Android malware developed.\nThe efforts on Android malware detection research pay more attention on a secure AI model and the detection performance (e.g., detection rate), where the model explanation is rarely covered.\nDemontis et. al.  introduced a secure SVM on Android malware detection that can detect those malware apps evaded from standard SVM-based detectors, through the constraints on the model’s parameters selection.\nZhang et. al. 4 combined the n-gram analysis and the online classifier techniques to detect the Android malware and attribute their malware families. The online classifier using incremental learning makes it scalable to the rapid evolved malware.\nThe recently emerging detection methods based on deep neural networks do not only bring astonishing performance in terms of detection rate (i.e., true positive rate), but also remove the needs of features engineering manually, through an automatic joint end-to-end learning   .\nThe large amount of parameters and hidden layers structure in deep neural networks, such as CNN and LSTM, make it more difficult for end users to understand the reasoning behind the predictions, even if the authors provided the insights on the effects of performance by the data and network structure manipulation .\nHowever, only recently has the model explanation for malware detection been addressed 0. Clearly, the primary aim of model explanation for Android malware detection is to identify the quantified “relevance” between the data features and the predictions.\nExisting explainable AI research   5 provides model-agnostic explainers for those models that may not be suitable for cyber security issues.\nLIME  explains a model through an optimization 6 of a linear model that is human-understandable over the perturbed data with the labels generated by the model’s inference.\nThe high dimensionailty and sparsity of Android malware feature data may cease the explainability of the interpretable models in LIME that is too linear to underfitting. Integrated Gradients (IGs)  attributes the relevance of data features through the integration of predictions’ gradients with respect to the data features varying from zero-values to the real values.\nHowever, the IGs method requires the availability of gradients computation for prediction scores with respect to the model input, which is not available in certain types of classifiers, such as random forests.\nThe expectation, therefore, on accurate and efficient AI model explanation for cyber security issues, such as malware detection, is still remaining. In this article, we propose a novel model explanation methodology capable of exploring the reasoning behind the predictions for AI-based Android malware detectors.\nThe main goal of our methodology is to identify and quantify the relevance of data features with respect to the predictions for any AI-based malware detectors, as compared to the detectors with few human-understandable explanation for specific types of models 0.\nFurthermore, this methodology explains an AI model by a simple data perturbation technique and efficient linear optimization that is based on the modern portfolio theory (MPT) 7.\nThe main advantage of the method based on optimization for features attribution lies in the potential to explain a model accepting a high-dimension data and no requirement on the gradients of prediction scores w.r.t. the inputs.\nThe proposed methodology can be divided into two stages:\nan initial data perturbation technique followed by a linear optimization for feature attribution values (i.e., relevance of features).\nThe first stage consists of the following steps:\ni) data features perturbation by multiplying a scaling factor in  01  to have the small changes of feature values (i.e., perturbed data);\nand ii) associated prediction scores are obtained by the forward process of the model over these perturbed data.\nThe second stage then minimizes the variance of the multiplication of these prediction scores and the attribution values, with the constraint that the sum of all features’ attribution is one.\nThe main contribution of this article is the formation of the optimization for features attribution, which assumes that the small changes of relevant features affect the prediction scores significantly, and thus are assigned high attribution values. In addition, results from the quantitative evaluation show that our proposed technique is sensitive to identify the relevant data features to the predictions made by the AI-based Android malware apps detectors, such as SVM 0 8 9 and BERT 0.\nThis is verified by the facts that\n1) the feature with the largest attribution value is helpful for the clustering algorithm to group the apps from the same malware family into the same cluster, and more features do not increase the performance significantly;\n2) a significant ratio of the camouflaged features activated for the adversarial samples, which evade the malware detection by the classifiers, can be identified. The rest of the paper is structured as follows:\nwe present current work on AI-based Android malware apps detection and the model explanation methods in Section 2.\nThe two learning-based classifiers, i.e., SVM and BERT, are presented in Section 3, followed by the introduction to the proposed model-agnostic MPT explainer in Section 5.\nWe then validate the proposed methodology with the comprehensive experiments in Section 6.\nFinally, the conclusion of this methodology is discussed in Section 7.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: the AI model identifies the cyber threats, where the confidence on the model’s stability is expected, but also helps the AI researchers to find out the models’ vulverabilities from certain examples [ref]3.\nThe main factors affecting the insights provided by a model explainer are: the challenges of data, such as unbalanced data and high dimentionalities for different applications (e.g., malware\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
