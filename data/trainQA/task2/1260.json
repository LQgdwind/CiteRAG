      "content": "Paper Title: SB-MTL: Score-based Meta Transfer-Learning for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the past decade, vast improvements to visual recognition systems have been achieved by training deep neural networks on ever-expanding training data-sets  [ref]13. However, the performance of deep neural networks has directly depended on the size and variance of the training data-sets . Unfortunately, acquiring large and representative data-sets is extremely costly in both time and resources . Furthermore, when dealing with rare examples in medical (e.g. rare cancers) or satellite images (e.g. oil spills), our ability to obtain labelled samples is limited. To address the limitations of previous deep learning methods, few-shot learning (FSL) methods have been developed to explicitly optimize models that predict new classes using only a few labelled images per class. More recent FSL methods have displayed performance converging to that of typical supervised deep learning . However, existing few-shot learning methods fail to generalize when there is domain-shift, as these methods have been developed with the assumption that the training and test data-sets are drawn from the same distribution [ref]3. This places a significant restriction on the utility of existing few-shot learning methods, as domain-shifts are common in practical applications . Furthermore, new domains arise frequently in computer vision, and having a robust cross-domain few-shot learning solution would allow new domains to be quickly conquered . Hence, the Broader Study of Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (BSCD-FSL) was introduced by [ref]12 as a new benchmark to test for generalization ability across a range of vastly dissimilar domains. The benchmark includes domains from natural, satellite and medical images, which has a range of perspective and color. This is in contrast to previous attempts at considering Cross-Domain Few-shot Learning [ref]3  , as these attempts were limited to natural images. Moreover, the domains in BSCD-FSL are also common applications of computer vision today. Critically, however, the results in BSCD-FSL show that current state-of-the-art meta-learning methods significantly underperform compared to transfer-learning methods [ref]12. This is likely due to the inability of meta-learning to transfer features from the source domain to the target domain when the domain shift is large like those in BSCD-FSL. Hence, the main objective of this paper is to propose a meta-learning method that performs well on sharp domain shifts found in the BSCD-FSL benchamrk. To this end, we integrate the best aspects of transfer-learning with the best aspects of meta-learning to learn how to transfer. Thus, we propose a novel method that is conceptually simple yet effective, which is Score-based Meta-Transfer Learning. At the initial stage of Score-based Meta Transfer-Learning, we include a deep residual network [ref]13 that has the last few layers designed to be fine-tuned. This is done using a modified first-order MAML-based algorithm . Subsequently, the predicted scores (which correspond to pre-softmax probabilities) from the fine-tuning process are linearly mapped onto a metric space through a learned linear layer. A Graph Neural Network (GNN) then predicts a label by aggregating the message propagated from the support set to the query image . Each message contains information on actual labels and initial predicted scores. During test time, we also use data augmentation and further boost the accuracy derived from fine-tuning. We also demonstrate how the addition of the graph neural network improves performance over merely using a first-order MAML-based algorithm. In our final results, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed system over both existing transfer-learning and meta-learning methods [ref]12. The main objective behind using classification scores as the input of the GNN is to address the problem of overfitting of the metric space. By having a metric based on classification scores, we create a metric space that only considers the relations between classification scores. These score-based relations are domain-agnostic as they not directly related to domain-specific features. The GNN also learns how to re-interpret patterns in the initial classification scores to correct for asymmetric confusion . Our key contributions can be summarized as: We achieve state-of-the-art performance on BSCD-FSL over existing meta-learning and transfer-learning methods. In some settings, our methods achieve accuracies comparable to typical supervised deep learning. We provide a simple and effective method to combine transfer-based (learning to fine-tune) and metric-based meta-learning methods. We are the first to propose using classification scores to create a metric space for re-classification by a Graph Neural Network. We demonstrate its effectiveness and highlight reasons why it works well.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: In the past decade, vast improvements to visual recognition systems have been achieved by training deep neural networks on ever-expanding training data-sets  [ref]13.
