Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

We first evaluate our method on four datasets from the UCI machine-learning repository [ref]5: POWER, GAS. HEPMASS, MINIBOONE, and also the BSDS300 dataset, which are all preprocessed by . We compare our method to several existing normalizing flow models, including Real NVP [ref]7, Glow , RQ-NSF ), CP-FLOW [ref]15, FFJORD , UMNN  and autoregressive models such as MAF , MADE  and BNAF . Model configuration and training. We use 10 (or 5) masked AUTM layers and set the hidden dimensions 40 times (or 10 times) the dimension of the input. We apply a random permutation of the elements of each output vector, as the masked linear coupling layer, so that a different set of elements is considered at each layer, which is a widely used technique , [ref]7, . We use Adam as the optimizer and select hyperparameters after an extensive grid search. Results. We report average negative log-likelihood estimates on the test sets in Table 2. It can be observed that AUTM consistently outperforms Real NVP, Glow, MADE, MAF, CP-Flow. On MINIBONDE dataset, our models perform better than all other models except BNAF. On POWER, HEPMASS, BSDS300 dataset, one of the AUTM models performs best among all baseline models. On GAS dataset, our results are competitive at either top 2 or top 3 spot with a tiny gap from the best.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Data sets and baselines.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
