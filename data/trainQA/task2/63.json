      "content": "Paper Title: CryptoSPN: Privacy-preserving Sum-Product Network Inference\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn our increasingly connected world, the abundance of user information and availability of data analysis techniques originating from artificial intelligence (AI) research has brought machine learning (ML) techniques into daily life.\nWhile these techniques are already deployed in many applications like credit scoring, medical diagnosis, biometric verification, recommender systems, fraud detection, and language processing, emerging technologies such as self-driving cars will further increase their popularity. These examples show that progress in AI research certainly has improved user experience, potentially even saving lives when employed for medical or safety purposes.\nHowever, as the prevalent usage in modern applications often requires the processing of massive amounts of sensitive information, the impact on user privacy has come into the public spotlight. This culminated in\nprivacy regulations such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into effect in 2018.\nNot only does the GDPR provide certain requirements to protect user data, it also includes restrictions on decisions based on user data, which may be interpreted as a “right to explanation” .\nLuckily, new deep probabilistic models that encode the joint distribution, such as sum-product networks (SPNs) , can indicate whether the model is fit to predict the data at hand, or raise a warning otherwise.\nThis increases trust as they “know when they do not know”.\nMoreover, SPNs can also perform inference with missing information , an important aspect for real-life applications. Generally, probabilistic graphical models [ref]24 provide a framework for understanding what inference and learning are, and have therefore emerged as one of the principal theoretical and practical approaches to ML and AI .\nHowever, one of the main challenges in probabilistic modeling is the trade-off between the expressivity of the models and the complexity of performing various types of inference, as well as learning them from data.\nThis inherent trade-off is clearly visible in powerful – but intractable – models like Markov random fields, (restricted) Boltzmann machines, (hierarchical) Dirichlet processes, and variational autoencoders.\nDespite these models’ successes, performing inference on them resorts to approximate routines.\nMoreover, learning such models from data is generally harder as inference is a sub-routine of learning, requiring simplified assumptions or further approximations.\nHaving guarantees on tractability at inference and learning time is therefore a highly desired property in many real-world scenarios. Tractable graphical models such as SPNs guarantee exactly this: performing exact inference for a range of queries.\nThey compile probabilistic inference routines into efficient computational graphs similar to deep neural networks, but encode a joint probability distribution.\nAs a result, they can not only be used for one ML task, but support many different tasks by design, ranging from outlier detection (joint distribution) to classification or regression (conditional inference).\nThey have been successfully used in numerous real-world applications such as image classification, completion and generation, scene understanding, activity recognition, and language and speech modeling.\nDespite these successes, it is unclear how one can develop an SPN framework that is GDPR-friendly. As a naive solution, SPN tasks can be performed only on client devices to ensure that no sensitive information is handed out, but this requires the service provider to ship a trained model to clients, thereby giving up valuable intellectual property and potentially leaking sensitive data as such models often contain traces of sensitive training data, e.g., due to unintended memorization .\nTherefore, current “ML as a Service” (MLaaS) applications usually send and hence leak client data to a remote server operated by the service provider to perform inference (cf. top of Figure 1). Even if the service provider and the remote server are considered trustworthy, the privacy of clients can still be compromised by breaches, hacks, and negligent or malicious insiders.\nSuch incidents occur frequently even at high-profile companies:\nrecently, Microsoft Outlook was hacked  and AT&T’s customer support was bribed .\nThus, it is not enough to protect client data just from outsiders, it must also be hidden from the server to ensure privacy. Previously, protecting the identity of individuals via anonymization techniques was seen as sufficient when learning on or inferring from data of a collection of users.\nSuch techniques reduce raw data to still enable extraction of knowledge without individuals being identifiable.\nHowever, recent works conclude that current de-identification measures are insufficient and unlikely satisfy GDPR standards . We believe this indicates that cryptographic measures\nshould be employed to satisfy today’s privacy demands.\nThe cryptographic literature has actively developed protocols and frameworks for efficient and privacy-preserving ML in the past years.\nSo far, efforts were focused on deep/convolutional neural networks, see  for a recent systematization of knowledge.\nThere, usually a scenario is considered where the server holds a model and performs private ML inference on a client’s data, with no information except for the inference result being revealed to the client (cf. bottom of Figure 1). Existing frameworks mostly rely on homomorphic encryption (HE), secure multi-party computation (SMPC), or a combination of both, to enable private inference with various security, resource, and usage properties.\nAs many ML tasks today already require intense computational resources, the overhead incurred by introducing cryptographic privacy mechanisms is substantial.\nThough a line of prominent frameworks from CryptoNets  to XONN [ref]39 has established increased efficiency and relatively low execution times for private inference, research has mainly focused on NNs by looking for efficient ways to securely compute common activation functions, sometimes degrading accuracy by using more efficient approximations.\nExisting frameworks only possess a low degree of automation and often require very low-level model descriptions, making it hard for non-experts to run private inference using their own models.\nAdditionally, for approaches using SMPC, it is very common that the topology of the NN is leaked, which might reveal some model information to the client. In this work, we present foundations and tools for privacy-preserving ML in the unexplored domain of sum-product networks (SPNs). Our framework, which we call CryptoSPN, demonstrates that SPNs can very well be protected with cryptographic measures.\nSpecifically, after presenting the necessary background for private ML and SPNs (Section 2), we show how to efficiently perform private SPN inference using SMPC (Section 3).\nWe combine techniques from both AI and applied cryptography to achieve this.\nContrary to popular SMPC-based approaches for protecting NNs, ours leaks no information from the network topology by using Random Tensorized SPNs (RAT-SPNs) .\nWe implement CryptoSPN using the state-of-the-art SMPC framework ABY  and provide an open-source tool that can transform SPN instances from the SPFlow framework  into privacy-preserving executables (Section 4).\nCryptoSPN is easily usable by non-experts and intended to make private ML available to the broader AI community working on a wide range of sophisticated models.\nIn an experimental evaluation (Section 5), we show that CryptoSPN performs private inference in reasonable time while preserving accuracy.\nWith our work, we push private ML beyond NNs and bring attention to the crucial, emerging task of making a variety of ML applications private.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: as they “know when they do not know”.\nMoreover, SPNs can also perform inference with missing information , an important aspect for real-life applications.
