At the same time, a conflicting block with transaction t​x′𝑡superscript𝑥′tx^{\\prime} at the adversarial chain will be (Π+Sk)Πsubscript𝑆𝑘(\\Pi+S_{k})-deep. If Π+Sk≥kΠsubscript𝑆𝑘𝑘\\Pi+S_{k}\\geq k, then the adversary can publish its private chain and cancel t​x𝑡𝑥tx. Else, the race enters the post-confirmation phase, where adversarial deficit is D=k−Π−Sk𝐷𝑘Πsubscript𝑆𝑘D=k-\\Pi-S_{k}, i.e., the difference between the length of the longest honest chain containing t​x𝑡𝑥tx and the longest adversarial chain containing t​x′𝑡superscript𝑥′tx^{\\prime}. In this part of the race, the adversary has to make up for its deficit D𝐷D, in order to discard the confirmed transaction t​x𝑡𝑥tx. If at any time after τk+Δksubscript𝜏𝑘subscriptΔ𝑘\\tau_{k}+\\Delta_{k}, the adversary’s private chain is able to catch the longest honest chain containing t​x𝑡𝑥tx, it can publish its chain to cancel t​x𝑡𝑥tx. Given mining rate μ2subscript𝜇2\\mu_{2}, honest fraction α𝛼\\alpha, delay rate μ1subscript𝜇1\\mu_{1} and confirmation depth k𝑘k, a confirmed transaction cannot be discarded with probability greater than, where M=maxi≥1⁡(Si′−i+1)𝑀subscript𝑖1subscriptsuperscript𝑆′𝑖𝑖1M=\\max\\limits_{i\\geq 1}(S^{\\prime}_{i}-i+1) and Si′=∑j′=1iCj′subscriptsuperscript𝑆′𝑖superscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝑗′1𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝐶′𝑗S^{\\prime}_{i}=\\sum_{j^{\\prime}=1}^{i}C^{\\prime}_{j} where Cj′subscriptsuperscript𝐶′𝑗C^{\\prime}_{j} are i.i.d. with Cj′∼Csimilar-tosubscriptsuperscript𝐶′𝑗𝐶C^{\\prime}_{j}\\sim C. Proof:  The case of D≤0𝐷0D\\leq 0, which denotes the fact that the adversary has at least k𝑘k blocks on top of t​x′𝑡superscript𝑥′tx^{\\prime} when t​x𝑡𝑥tx is k𝑘k-deep, is trivial since S1=C1′≥0subscript𝑆1subscriptsuperscript𝐶′10S_{1}=C^{\\prime}_{1}\\geq 0. Consider D>0𝐷0D>0 and beginning from τk+Δksubscript𝜏𝑘subscriptΔ𝑘\\tau_{k}+\\Delta_{k}, let us denote τk+hsubscript𝜏𝑘ℎ\\tau_{k+h} as τh′subscriptsuperscript𝜏′ℎ\\tau^{\\prime}_{h}. Once the honest miners mine an honest jumper block b1′subscriptsuperscript𝑏′1b^{\\prime}_{1} at τ1′subscriptsuperscript𝜏′1\\tau^{\\prime}_{1}, which will be published at τ1′+Δ1′subscriptsuperscript𝜏′1subscriptsuperscriptΔ′1\\tau^{\\prime}_{1}+\\Delta^{\\prime}_{1}, there will be C1′∼Csimilar-tosubscriptsuperscript𝐶′1𝐶C^{\\prime}_{1}\\sim C adversarial blocks mined during [τk+Δk,τ1′+Δ1′]subscript𝜏𝑘subscriptΔ𝑘subscriptsuperscript𝜏′1subscriptsuperscriptΔ′1[\\tau_{k}+\\Delta_{k},\\tau^{\\prime}_{1}+\\Delta^{\\prime}_{1}]. If C1′≥Dsubscriptsuperscript𝐶′1𝐷C^{\\prime}_{1}\\geq D, the adversary can publish its private chain right before τ1′+Δ1′subscriptsuperscript𝜏′1subscriptsuperscriptΔ′1\\tau^{\\prime}_{1}+\\Delta^{\\prime}_{1}, discarding the transaction from some honest view. This explains the case where S1′≥Dsubscriptsuperscript𝑆′1𝐷S^{\\prime}_{1}\\geq D. Assume C1′<Dsubscriptsuperscript𝐶′1𝐷C^{\\prime}_{1}<D, consider the total number of adversarial blocks mined from τk+Δksubscript𝜏𝑘subscriptΔ𝑘\\tau_{k}+\\Delta_{k} until the second honest jumper’s publication time at τ2′+Δ2′subscriptsuperscript𝜏′2subscriptsuperscriptΔ′2\\tau^{\\prime}_{2}+\\Delta^{\\prime}_{2}, i.e., during [τk+Δk,τ2′+Δ2′]subscript𝜏𝑘subscriptΔ𝑘subscriptsuperscript𝜏′2subscriptsuperscriptΔ′2[\\tau_{k}+\\Delta_{k},\\tau^{\\prime}_{2}+\\Delta^{\\prime}_{2}], which is equal to S2′=C1′+C2′subscriptsuperscript𝑆′2subscriptsuperscript𝐶′1subscriptsuperscript𝐶′2S^{\\prime}_{2}=C^{\\prime}_{1}+C^{\\prime}_{2}. Right before τ2′+Δ2′subscriptsuperscript𝜏′2subscriptsuperscriptΔ′2\\tau^{\\prime}_{2}+\\Delta^{\\prime}_{2}, t​x𝑡𝑥tx is k+1𝑘1k+1-deep at honest miners views (except the miner of b2′subscriptsuperscript𝑏′2b^{\\prime}_{2}), whereas t​x′𝑡superscript𝑥′tx^{\\prime} is Π+Sk+S2′Πsubscript𝑆𝑘subscriptsuperscript𝑆′2\\Pi+S_{k}+S^{\\prime}_{2}-deep. If Π+Sk+S2′≥k+1Πsubscript𝑆𝑘subscriptsuperscript𝑆′2𝑘1\\Pi+S_{k}+S^{\\prime}_{2}\\geq k+1, t​x𝑡𝑥tx will be discarded from some honest view, which explains S2′−1≥Dsubscriptsuperscript𝑆′21𝐷S^{\\prime}_{2}-1\\geq D. In general, for i>0𝑖0i>0, right before τi′+Δi′subscriptsuperscript𝜏′𝑖subscriptsuperscriptΔ′𝑖\\tau^{\\prime}_{i}+\\Delta^{\\prime}_{i}, t​x𝑡𝑥tx is k+i−1𝑘𝑖1k+i-1-deep at honest miners views (except the miner of bi′subscriptsuperscript𝑏′𝑖b^{\\prime}_{i}), whereas t​x′𝑡superscript𝑥′tx^{\\prime} is Π+Sk+Si′Πsubscript𝑆𝑘subscriptsuperscript𝑆′𝑖\\Pi+S_{k}+S^{\\prime}_{i}-deep, hence we need Si′−i+1≥Dsubscriptsuperscript𝑆′𝑖𝑖1𝐷S^{\\prime}_{i}-i+1\\geq D for some i𝑖i.\n ■■\\blacksquare (Fault tolerance) limk→∞p¯​(α,μ1,μ2,k)→0→subscript→𝑘¯𝑝𝛼subscript𝜇1subscript𝜇2𝑘0\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}\\overline{p}(\\alpha,\\mu_{1},\\mu_{2},k)\\rightarrow 0 iff Proof:  Note that from Lemma 1, replacing σ−1superscript𝜎1\\sigma^{-1} with 1+κ1𝜅1+\\kappa, (26) is necessary and sufficient condition for positive recurrence of the birth-death chain of P𝑃P. Thus, the random walk escapes to infinity for α≤1(2−κ)𝛼12𝜅\\alpha\\leq\\frac{1}{(2-\\kappa)}. Although after τ𝜏\\tau, the walk can take negative values as well, this does not change the dynamics of the walk and the transition probabilities. Thus, we can simply check if limk→∞P​(Π≥k)subscript→𝑘𝑃Π𝑘\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}P(\\Pi\\geq k).\n ■■\\blacksquare p¯​(α,μ1,μ2,k)=p¯​(α,1,κ,k)¯𝑝𝛼subscript𝜇1subscript𝜇2𝑘¯𝑝𝛼1𝜅𝑘\\overline{p}(\\alpha,\\mu_{1},\\mu_{2},k)=\\overline{p}(\\alpha,1,\\kappa,k). Proof:  First, note that β=1−α𝛽1𝛼\\beta=1-\\alpha, ρ=1−σ𝜌1𝜎\\rho=1-\\sigma, and where Cj′subscriptsuperscript𝐶′𝑗C^{\\prime}_{j} are i.i.d. with Cj′∼Csimilar-tosubscriptsuperscript𝐶′𝑗𝐶C^{\\prime}_{j}\\sim C. Hence, the distributions of ΠΠ\\Pi, Sksubscript𝑆𝑘S_{k} and M𝑀M are solely expressable in terms of α𝛼\\alpha, σ𝜎\\sigma and k𝑘k as a result of Lemmas 1 and 2.\nFurther, σ𝜎\\sigma and κ𝜅\\kappa have one-to-one relationship given in Table 1. Thus, replacing (μ1,μ2)subscript𝜇1subscript𝜇2(\\mu_{1},\\mu_{2}) with (1,κ)1𝜅(1,\\kappa) does not change p¯​(α,μ1,μ2,k)=P​(M+Π+Sk≥k)¯𝑝𝛼subscript𝜇1subscript𝜇2𝑘𝑃𝑀Πsubscript𝑆𝑘𝑘\\overline{p}(\\alpha,\\mu_{1},\\mu_{2},k)=P(M+\\Pi+S_{k}\\geq k).\n ■■\\blacksquare Proposition 1 essentially means that the relationship between μ1subscript𝜇1\\mu_{1} and μ2subscript𝜇2\\mu_{2} has to be kept constant to keep p¯​(α,b,μ1,μ2,k)¯𝑝𝛼𝑏subscript𝜇1subscript𝜇2𝑘\\overline{p}(\\alpha,b,\\mu_{1},\\mu_{2},k) at a certain level, hence, κ𝜅\\kappa is a safety parameter. In other words, given α𝛼\\alpha, k𝑘k and a security violation threshold p¯¯𝑝\\overline{p}, the maximum κ𝜅\\kappa possible, denoted as κ¯¯𝜅\\overline{\\kappa}, can be found from the analysis provided here, i.e., κ¯=f​(α,k,p¯)¯𝜅𝑓𝛼𝑘¯𝑝\\overline{\\kappa}=f(\\alpha,k,\\overline{p}) for some function f𝑓f. We note that finding f𝑓f or the distribution of M𝑀M explicitly is a complex task, which we avoid here since our main goal is to establish a relationship between μ1,μ2subscript𝜇1subscript𝜇2\\mu_{1},\\mu_{2} and security, which we already did in Proposition 1. To find an explicit upper bound, we resort to a simpler rigged model originally proposed by  where adversary is even more (strictly) powerful than that modeled in the rigged jumper model of  during the post-confirmation race. Here, we apply a similar simple model, where ΔhsubscriptΔℎ\\Delta_{h} are exponentially distributed random variables. At each mining event after τk+Δksubscript𝜏𝑘subscriptΔ𝑘\\tau_{k}+\\Delta_{k}, we toss a coin: with probability α𝛼\\alpha the block is honest. This honest block is converted to an adversarial one if any other block is mined before the block can be published, which happens with probability ρ𝜌\\rho. Hence, a block becomes and remains honest with probability α​σ𝛼𝜎\\alpha\\sigma. The race between the adversarial and the honest chains at this time can be represented with this coin toss model similar to . Here, we use the fact that the maximum of a random walk with downward drift, M~~𝑀\\tilde{M} is distributed geometrically [17, Eqn. (7.3.5)], with where α​σ𝛼𝜎\\alpha\\sigma is the probability of going down. We note that the results from this last model will not be as tight as those calculated for ΠΠ\\Pi and S𝑆S, in other words M~>M~𝑀𝑀\\tilde{M}>M, but as noted by , the main contribution to safety violation comes from S𝑆S which is modeled tight enough. Combining the results of each of the phases above, i.e., pre-mining gain, confirmation interval and post-confirmation race, we have the following lemma. Given mining rate μ2subscript𝜇2\\mu_{2}, honest fraction α𝛼\\alpha, delay rate μ1subscript𝜇1\\mu_{1} and confirmation depth k𝑘k, a confirmed transaction cannot be discarded with probability greater than, Proof:  As the adversary modeled in the post-confirmation race is strictly more powerful than the adversary of 𝔹¯​(α,μ1,μ2,λ,k)¯𝔹𝛼subscript𝜇1subscript𝜇2𝜆𝑘\\overline{\\mathbbm{B}}(\\alpha,\\mu_{1},\\mu_{2},\\lambda,k), hence,\np​(α,μ1,μ2,k)≤p¯​(α,μ1,μ2,k)≤p~​(α,μ1,μ2,k)𝑝𝛼subscript𝜇1subscript𝜇2𝑘¯𝑝𝛼subscript𝜇1subscript𝜇2𝑘~𝑝𝛼subscript𝜇1subscript𝜇2𝑘p(\\alpha,\\mu_{1},\\mu_{2},k)\\leq\\overline{p}(\\alpha,\\mu_{1},\\mu_{2},k)\\leq\\tilde{p}(\\alpha,\\mu_{1},\\mu_{2},k).\n ■■\\blacksquare Note that using the simple rigged model where a block remains honest with probability α​σ𝛼𝜎\\alpha\\sigma, limk→∞p¯​(α,μ1,μ2,k)→0→subscript→𝑘¯𝑝𝛼subscript𝜇1subscript𝜇2𝑘0\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}\\overline{p}(\\alpha,\\mu_{1},\\mu_{2},k)\\rightarrow 0 is trivially satisfied if α​σ>12𝛼𝜎12\\alpha\\sigma>\\frac{1}{2}, which can be restated as Further, p~​(α,μ1,μ2,k)=p~​(α,1,κ,k)~𝑝𝛼subscript𝜇1subscript𝜇2𝑘~𝑝𝛼1𝜅𝑘\\tilde{p}(\\alpha,\\mu_{1},\\mu_{2},k)=\\tilde{p}(\\alpha,1,\\kappa,k) can be proved using similar ideas to those in Proposition 1. There is an extensive discussion about choosing parameters of a blockchains in [ref]5 when designing a blockchain while taking security-latency into account, e.g., choosing the mining difficulty μ2subscript𝜇2\\mu_{2} in relation to ΔΔ\\Delta. Our security-latency analysis in this section implies that one can consider μ2subscript𝜇2\\mu_{2} and μ1subscript𝜇1\\mu_{1} as dependent parameters when designing a blockchain with a certain security level. Moreover, network delay μ1subscript𝜇1\\mu_{1} is necessarily a function of the block size b𝑏b, i.e., μ1=g​(b)subscript𝜇1𝑔𝑏\\mu_{1}=g(b) for some function g𝑔g, which depends on the network . Thus, given b𝑏b, α𝛼\\alpha, k𝑘k and a security violation threshold p¯¯𝑝\\overline{p}, one can choose the maximum mining rate as, Further, it is shown in , that the block propagation delay (here 1μ11subscript𝜇1\\frac{1}{\\mu_{1}}) increases sublinearly with block size b𝑏b and the real-world data for g​(b)𝑔𝑏g(b) resembles a piecewise linear function. Note that the security of the content of a block decreases with the increasing mining rate. As a result, the mining rate should decrease with the increasing block size b𝑏b to keep the security of the transactions in a block at a certain level since a valid nonce protects the whole block together with all its transactions. The proportional relationship of g​(b)𝑔𝑏g(b) and μ2subscript𝜇2\\mu_{2} shown in (33) is a side effect of the network delay that depends on the block size b𝑏b, however, it does not consider the security of all b𝑏b transactions in a single block since p¯¯𝑝\\overline{p} analyzed in this section considers the probability that a transaction is discarded. However, the adversary can potentially discard more than one transaction (up to b𝑏b transactions if they happen to be in the same block) with the same attack which is successful with probability less than p¯¯𝑝\\overline{p}. In this sense, a designer should consider p¯¯𝑝\\overline{p} as a security threshold for b𝑏b transactions while determining μ2subscript𝜇2\\mu_{2}. Finding f𝑓f rigorously requires finding the distribution of M𝑀M explicitly and it is a complex task as mentioned previously. However, one can use bisection method on (30) to find the maximum possible κ~~𝜅\\tilde{\\kappa} with p~​(α,1,κ~,k)<p¯~𝑝𝛼1~𝜅𝑘¯𝑝\\tilde{p}(\\alpha,1,\\tilde{\\kappa},k)<\\overline{p} which necessarily satisfies p¯​(α,1,κ~,k)<p¯¯𝑝𝛼1~𝜅𝑘¯𝑝\\overline{p}(\\alpha,1,\\tilde{\\kappa},k)<\\overline{p}. Since κ~≤κ¯~𝜅¯𝜅\\tilde{\\kappa}\\leq\\overline{\\kappa} for a given p¯¯𝑝\\overline{p}, picking μ~2=κ~​g​(b)subscript~𝜇2~𝜅𝑔𝑏\\tilde{\\mu}_{2}=\\tilde{\\kappa}g(b) is an approximate solution to the maximum mining rate μ¯2subscript¯𝜇2\\overline{\\mu}_{2}, where μ~2<μ¯2subscript~𝜇2subscript¯𝜇2\\tilde{\\mu}_{2}<\\overline{\\mu}_{2}. (30) gives an upper bound for the safety violation probability. For a lower bound on p​(α,μ1,μ2,k)𝑝𝛼subscript𝜇1subscript𝜇2𝑘p(\\alpha,\\mu_{1},\\mu_{2},k), the distributions of ΠΠ\\Pi, S𝑆S and M~~𝑀\\tilde{M} have to be replaced as follows: A lower bound for the lead can be found by replacing σ𝜎\\sigma and ρ𝜌\\rho with σ′superscript𝜎′\\sigma^{\\prime} and ρ′superscript𝜌′\\rho^{\\prime} in Lemma 1 (replacing σ𝜎\\sigma and ρ𝜌\\rho in definitions of a¯isubscript¯𝑎𝑖\\bar{a}_{i} and b¯isubscript¯𝑏𝑖\\bar{b}_{i} as well). A lower bound for the adversarial arrivals during the confirmation interval can be found by replacing σ𝜎\\sigma and ρ𝜌\\rho with σ′superscript𝜎′\\sigma^{\\prime} and ρ′superscript𝜌′\\rho^{\\prime} in (14). Although tighter results can be obtained by using the idea presented in [8, Lemma 3], lower bound on the maximum deficit adversary can recover can be simply found by replacing (1−α​σα​σ)1𝛼𝜎𝛼𝜎\\left(\\frac{1-\\alpha\\sigma}{\\alpha\\sigma}\\right) with βα𝛽𝛼\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} in (29).\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: can be proved using similar ideas to those in Proposition 1.
