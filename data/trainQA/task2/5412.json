      "content": "Paper Title: YOLO-based Object Detection in Industry 4.0 Fischertechnik Model Environment\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWithin the context of computer vision, the task of simultaneously performing object localisation and recognition in an given image is perhaps one of the most interesting and important tasks with a broad range of applications on different environments, namely underwater, on the ground and in the sky  5 7. In general, there are mainly two types of state-of-the-art object detectors, namely those based on only a single or two-stage detection phases. One can refer to methods proposed in [ref]9 and  [ref]28 as the most well known representatives for each type and also to 6 for a concrete survey on the state-of-the-art deep learning based object detection approaches. Let us refer to the line of R-CNN work devised in [ref]9, that enriches a set of extracted overlapping region proposals from the input image using CNN and performs the classification task on them by adopting a linear SVM . R-CNN works according to the motto recognition using regions introduced in . The Faster R-CNN 1 reported the R-CNN region proposal computation to be the running time bottle-neck and substituted it by a Region Proposal Network (RPN) as a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and their scores at each position and fed them to the detection network. The so called Mask R-CNN  was an improvement over Faster R-CNN, by adding a branch for predicting segmentation masks on each region proposal and in parallel with the existing branch for classification and region proposal regression. The mask branch is a small fully connected layer (FCN) applied to each region proposal, predicting a segmentation mask in a pixel-to-pixel manner. In contrast to the R-CNNs [ref]9  1, YOLOv1 [ref]28 is extremely faster since the detection task is framed in general as a regression problem, in a sense that a single convolutional network simultaneously predicts multiple bounding boxes and class probabilities for those boxes. Here, the regional proposal computation, as a distinct property of R-CNN based approaches, is avoided to achieve the state-of-the-art run time efficiency. In addition, YOLOv1 reasons globally about the entire image and all objects appeared in it, that means it simultaneously predicts each bounding box and assigns its corresponding label across all classes. This property has root in model architecture of the YOLOv1 that will be explained later. However, YOLOv1 has a relatively lower recall rate and localisation accuracy compared to proposal-based methods, that was compensated in YOLOv2  and its successors YOLOv3 0, YOLOv4  and YOLOv5 . One can refer to   7 and  that report YOLOv3 and YOLOv4, respectively, to have better mAP measures  compared to Faster R-CNN algorithms. Nevertheless, the recent major advances in object detection are still expected to be integrated within the emerging family of YOLO. Among them, one can refer to anchor-free detection mechanism  as all of the YOLO versions addressed in current study rely on anchors as prior-bounding boxes with predefined ratios between their heights and widths. Adoption of an anchor-free mechanism significantly reduces the number of model parameters and avoids the task of heuristic tuning to obtain initial prior-boxes . As an anchor-free approach authors of  introduced the CornerNet as a single-stage object detection approach to eliminate the critical role of anchor boxes within the object detection context. The so called corner pooling layer as a new type of pooling layer was introduced as part of the CornerNet to localize corners of bounding boxes. In this way, the pre-processing task of prior-box creation can be replaced by the convolutional neural network CornerNet introduced in . In current study, we will closely discuss different aspects of YOLOv1 [ref]28, concerning model architecture, the cost function and the way in which YOLOv1 realises the single-stage  object detection principle. Later, we feature important improvements appeared in more advanced versions, namely YOLOv3 0 and YOLOv5 . In addition, YOLOv5 consists of four versions on its own, which are YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, YOLOv5l, and YOLOv5x. This is classified according to the memory storage size, but the principle is the\nthe same . In a similar ways, YOLOv3 is also developed in two small and large scales, YOLOv3s and YOLOv3l respectively. In current study, we report our results based on YOLOv3s, YOLOv3l, YOLOv5s and YOLOv5l. In specific, our major contributions consist of investigate the applicability of the latest development technology in the field of YOLO object detectors to localise and classify our objects of interest transported across an industry 4.04.04.0 manufacturing simulator shown as Fig. 1. Our simulator is further augmented with a wide range of spatial image processing task , after being recorded by a Logi HD 108010801080p webcam. In Sub-section 3, we clearly explain the creation of our augmented dataset to account for any environmental variation that may occur in real world scenarios.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: in the sky  5 7.
