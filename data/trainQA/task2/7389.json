Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

Afterwards, we describe dataset-specific details in Secs. C.1.1, C.1.2 and C.1.3, for each dataset and experiment. Standard Networks.\nAs mentioned in Sec. 4 in the main paper, we follow the recipe from . For standard models, we use the AdamW optimizer [ref]23 with a weight-decay factor of 10−4superscript10410^{-4} and a cosine-annealing learning-rate scheduler [ref]24 with an initial learning-rate of 0.01, reached with an initial warmup for 5 epochs. We clip gradients by norm at 1.0. B-cos Networks. We use the latest implementations for B-cos models . Following [ref]5 , we use the Adam optimizer [ref]23 and do not apply weight-decay. We use a cosine-annealing learning-rate scheduler [ref]24 with an initial learning-rate of 10−3superscript10310^{-3}, reached with an initial warmup for 5 epochs. Following , we clip gradients using adaptive gradient clipping (AGC) . Unless specified otherwise, across all models and datasets we use random crops and random horizontal flips as data augmentation during training, and at test time we resize the images to 256 (along the smaller dimension) and apply center crop of (224, 224). We use PyTorch  and PyTorch Lightning  for all of our implementations.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: C.1.2 and C.1.3, for each dataset and experiment.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
