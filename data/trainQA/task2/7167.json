For the multi-label case, we considered ML-C&W , MLA-LP \nand LOTS  (we have not considered ML-DF as its performance are always inferior to ML-C&W, see  ).\nAs described in Section 3, LOTS can be applied to any internal layer of the network.\nIn our experiments, for a fair comparison, we have applied LOTS at the logits layer.\nBy following , for every target label vector, we randomly selected 20 images\nwith that label vector, and averaged the logits to get the target output vector (for target label vectors for which the total number of images available is lower than 20, we used all the images).\nWe stress that, in the way it works, LOTS can not target an arbitrary labels’ combination, since examples for that combination may not be available.\n For the case of ECOC classification, the comparison is carried out against C&W,\nwhich is also the attack considered in [ref]9,\nand [ref]17 (ECOC Attack) specialized to work with the ECOC model [ref]17.\nAlthough suboptimal in this case, we also considered ML-C&W and MLA-LP, by applying the latter as discussed in Section 3.2. However, given the complexity of the attack in the ECOC scenario and the high sub-optimality of MLA-LP, the performance of this algorithm are extremely poor, and no image can be attacked by using this method.\nFinally, the performance of LOTS attack are also assessed. In this case, the target output vectors are computed by averaging on 50 images (when the number of available images is lower than 50, we averaged all of them).\n For the one-hot encoding scenario, we considered the original C&W algorithm , which is one of the best performing white-box attack working at the logits level.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: labels’ combination, since examples for that combination may not be available.\n For the case of ECOC classification, the comparison is carried out against C&W,\nwhich is also the attack considered in [ref]9,\nand [ref]17 (ECOC Attack) specialized to work with the ECOC model [ref]17.\nAlthough suboptimal in this case, we also considered ML-C&W and MLA-LP, by applying the latter as discussed in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
