      "content": "Paper Title: Benchmarking Learned Indexes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we describe the index structures we evaluate, and how we tune their size/performance tradeoffs. Table 1 lists each technique and its capabilities. Learned indexes. We compare with RMIs, PGM indexes, and RadixSpline indexes (RS), each of which are described in Section 3. We use implementations tuned by each structure’s original authors. RMIs are tuned using CDFShop , an automatic RMI optimizer. RS and PGM are tuned by varying the error tolerance of the underlying models. Tree structures. We compare with several tree-structured indexes: the STX B-Tree (BTree) , an interpolating BTree (IBTree) , the Adaptive Radix Trie (ART) [ref]20, the Fast Architectural-Sensitive Tree (FAST) [ref]16, Fast Succinct Trie (FST) , and Wormhole . For each tree structure, we tune the size/performance tradeoff by inserting a subset of the data as described in Section 2.1. To build a tree of maximum size with perfect accuracy, we insert every key. To build a tree with a smaller size and decreased accuracy, we insert every other key. We note that this technique, while simple, may not be the ideal way to trade space for accuracy in each tree structure. Specifically, ART may admit a smarter method in which keys are retained or discarded based on the fill level of a node. We only evaluate the simple and universal technique of inserting fewer keys into each structure, and leave structure-specific optimizations to future work. Hashing. While most hash tables do not support range queries, hash tables are still an interesting point of comparison due to their unmatched lookup performance. Unordered hash tables cannot be shrunk using the same technique as we use for trees.111Wormhole , which we evaluate, represents a state-of-the-art ordered hashing approach. Therefore, we only evaluate hash tables that contain every key. We evaluate a standard implementation of a Robinhood hash table (RobinHash)  and a SIMD-optimized Cuckoo map (CuckooMap) . Baselines. We also include two naive baselines: binary search (BS), and a radix binary search (RBS). Radix binary search [ref]17 stores only the radix table used by the learned RS approach. We vary the size of the radix table to achieve different size/performance tradeoffs.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: error tolerance of the underlying models. Tree structures. We compare with several tree-structured indexes: the STX B-Tree (BTree) , an interpolating BTree (IBTree) , the Adaptive Radix Trie (ART) [ref]20, the Fast Architectural-Sensitive Tree (FAST) [ref]16, Fast Succinct Trie (FST) , and Wormhole .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
