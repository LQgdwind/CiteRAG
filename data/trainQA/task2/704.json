      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Play Two-Player Perfect-Information Games without Knowledge\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany Hex player programs have been developed. For example, Mohex 1.0\n is a program based on Monte Carlo tree search.\nIt also uses many techniques dedicated to Hex, based on specific theoretical\nresults. In particular, it is able to quickly determine a winning\nstrategy for some states (without expanding the search tree) and to\nprune at each state many actions that it knows to be inferior.\nIt also uses ad hoc knowledge to bias simulations of Monte Carlo tree\nsearch. Mohex 2.0  is an improvement of Mohex 1.0 that\nuses learned knowledge through supervised learning (namely correlations\nbetween victory and board patterns) to guide both tree exploration\nand simulations. Other work then focused on predicting best actions, through supervised\nlearning of a database of games, using a neural network [ref]51 [ref]52 .\nThe neural network is used to learn a policy, i.e. a prior\nprobability distribution on the actions to play. These prior probabilities\nare used to guide the exploration of Monte Carlo tree search. First,\nthere is Mohex-CNN  which is an improvement of\nMohex 2.0 using a convolutional neural network [ref]54.\nA new version of Mohex was then proposed: Mohex-3HNN .\nUnlike Mohex-CNN, it is based on a residual neural network .\nIt calculates, in addition to the policy, a value for states and\nactions. The value of states replaces the evaluation of states based\non simulations of Monte Carlo tree search. Adding a value to actions\nallows Mohex-HNN to reduce the number of calls of the neural network,\nimproving performance. Mohex-3HNN is the best Hex program. It wons\nHex size 11 and 13 tournaments at 2018 Computer Olympiad . Programs which learn the evaluation function by reinforcement have\nalso been designed. These programs are NeuroHex ,\nEZO-CNN , DeepEzo \nand ExIt . They learn from self-play.\nUnlike the other three programs, NeuroHex performs supervised learning\n(of a common Hex heuristic) followed by reinforcement learning. NeuroHex\nalso starts its games with a state from a database of games. EZO-CNN\nand DeepEzo use knowledge to learn winning strategies in some states.\nDeepEzo also uses knowledge during confrontations. ExIt learns a policy\nin addition to the value of states and it is based on MCTS. It is\nthe only program to have learned to play Hex without using knowledge.\nThis result is, however, limited to the board size 999. A comparison\nof the main characteristics of these different programs is presented\nin TableÂ 2.\n\nReference markers found: [51]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]51: and board patterns) to guide both tree exploration\nand simulations.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
