      "content": "Paper Title: “How Does It Detect A Malicious App?” Explaining the Predictions of AI-based Android Malware Detector\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe vulnerabilities in Android system are still emerging , and the malware is in rapid evolution.\nThis requires the development of AI-based models that can predict unknown malware samples in certain degrees.\nThe AI-based methods described in the Android malware detection literature have focused on four basic features extraction approaches .\nIn this section, we reviewed two main feature extraction techniques: the dynamic analysis and the static analysis that are relevant to our work.\nThe first method for features extraction is dynamic analysis that obtain the features via the apps execution, such as system calls and file system usage, etc.\nFor example, Xiao et. al.  propose a deep learning method that analyses the API calls obtained dynamically through two Long-term Short Memory (LSTM) networks trained for malware and non-malware apps, respectively. The second and most commonly used method is the static analysis technique that analyses the application source code and resources without execution and requires small running time overhead.\nFor example, Samra et. al.  use the clustering algorithm in the malware detection that the permissions data were extracted from the applications as the features statically.\nIn , a mobile malware analysis tool, AndroDialysis, is developed and used to assess the malware detection performance with intents feature (explicit and implicit), which is a run-time binding message object for the inter-process communication in Android framework.\nThe conclusion drawn from the experiment results shows that intents as the only features in the classification are more effective than that with permissions features.\nZhang et. al.  convey the semantic information in malware classification via the graph construction of the dependencies among the API calls as the features.\nSimilarly, Aafer et. al.  capture the semantic information about the apps’ behavior at the API level.\nIn addition to classification by single features, there are also a number of AI-based methods that classify the malware apps using a combination of features extracted by the static analysis technique.\nFor instance, Zhu et. al.  detect malware apps by building up an ensemble classifier, Rotation Forests  with the features extracted from the APK archive file that includes permissions, sensitive APIs and monitoring system events, etc.\nThe classifier was trained on a dataset of 2,130 samples of Android apps that malware and benign apps take 50% respectively, and the results outperforms a SVM classifier.\nArp et. al.  learn a linear SVM classifier with the application features, inlcuding permissions, API calls and network addresses.\nThey propose a lightweight features extraction method to extract from mainifest.xml file and the dex bytecode.\nIn the above methods, only DREBIN  provided a limited explanation of the model’s prediction. However, their explanation is based on the weights of the SVM models, which cannot be generalised into other models. Deep learning methods have been successfully applied on the cyber security issues.\nFor example, Xiao et. al.  proposed a deep learning method that detects the Android malware through training two Long-term Short Memory (LSTM) networks for malware and non-malware apps features (i.e., system calls) respectively.\nVinayakumar et. al.  tried different LSTM network topologies in Android malware detection.\nHowever, the hidden layers and cells structure in LSTM make the inference process in a black-box mechanism for users, and thus impossible to have the insights on the reasoning.\nThis reduces the trust on the model’s prediction for an example, because it has the risk for the model to be misled to make a wrong decision by an carefully designed example, such as that in the stop sign recognition problem [ref]3, and the user cannot know how the decision is made.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: the model’s prediction for an example, because it has the risk for the model to be misled to make a wrong decision by an carefully designed example, such as that in the stop sign recognition problem [ref]3, and the user cannot know how the decision is made.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
