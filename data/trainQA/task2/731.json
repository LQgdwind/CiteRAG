      "content": "Paper Title: Predicting Visual Overlap of Images Through Interpretable Non-Metric Box Embeddings\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAbility to quickly determine if two images observe the same scene is useful in multiple computer vision pipelines, especially for SLAM, Structure-from-Motion (SfM), image-based localization, landmark recognition, etc. For example, Bag-of-Words (BoW) models 3 are used in many SLAM systems, e.g. ORB-SLAM2 3, to detect when the camera has revisited a mapped place, i.e. a loop closure detection, to re-optimize the map of the scene.\nThe BoW model allows to quickly search images of a mapped area and find a match to the current frame for geometric verification.\nA similar use case for BoW model can be found in SfM pipelines [ref]48  , where thousands or even millions of images are downloaded from the Internet and two-view matching is impractical to do between all pairs of images.\nOnce a 3D model of a scene is built, a user might want to browse the collection of images . Finding images that are zoom-ins to parts of the query and provide detailed, high-resolution images of interesting parts of the scene was addressed in  , where they modified a BoW model to also store local feature geometry information  that can be exploited for Document at a Time (DAAT) scoring  and further geometric verification. However, that approach relies on iterative query expansion to find zoomed-in matches, and re-ranking of retrieved images still requires geometric verification, even when choosing images for query expansion.\nSimilarly the loss of detail in SfM reconstructions was identified to be a side-effect of retrieval approaches in  and solution based on modification of query expansion and DAAT scoring was proposed, that favors retrieval of images with scale and viewing directions changes. Again, each image query retrieves a subset of images from the image collection in a certain ranking order and geometric verification is performed to establish the pairwise relation of the views. Weyand and Leibe  build a hierarchy of iconic views of a scene by iteratively propagating and verifying homography between pairs of images and generating clusters of views. Later, they extended  it to find details and scene structure with hierarchical clustering over scale space. Again, the relation between views is estimated with geometric verification. Schönberger et al.  propose to learn to identify image pairs with scene overlap without geometric verification for large-scale SfM reconstruction applications to decrease the total computation time. However, their random forest classifier is trained with binary labels, a pair of images either overlap or not, and no additional output about the relative pose relation is available without further geometric verification.\nShen et al.  proposed to learn an embedding which can be used for quick assessment of image overlap for SfM reconstructions. They trained a neural network with triplet loss with ground-truth overlap triplets, however their embedding models minimal overlap between two images, which can be used to rank images according to predicted mutual overlap, but does not provide additional information about relative scale and pose of the image pairs. Neural networks can be used to directly regress a homography between a pair of images    , however a homography only explains a single planar surface co-visible between views. Finally, image retrieval is a common technique in localization   : first, a database of geo-tagged images is searched to find images that are similar to the query, followed by image matching and pose estimation to estimate the pose of the query. Again, the image retrieval reduces the search space for local feature matching, and it is done using a compact representation such as BoW 8, VLAD  or Fisher vectors 7. Recently proposed methods use neural networks to compute the image representation and learn the image similarity using geometric information available for the training images, e.g. GPS coordinates for panoramic images , camera poses in world coordinate system , camera pose and 3D model of the environment .\nNetworks trained to directly regress the camera pose 2 4 were also shown to be similar to image retrieval methods . The image embeddings are learned to implicitly encapsulate the geometry of a scene so that similar views of a scene are close in the embedding space. However, these representations are typically learned with metric learning, and so they only allow to rank the database images with respect to the query, and no additional camera pose information is encoded in the representations. We should also mention that localization can also be tackled by directly finding correspondences from 2D features in the query to 3D points in the 3D model without explicit image retrieval, e.g.    .\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: scene.\nThe BoW model allows to quickly search images of a mapped area and find a match to the current frame for geometric verification.\nA similar use case for BoW model can be found in SfM pipelines [ref]48  , where thousands or even millions of images are downloaded from the Internet and two-view matching is impractical to do between all pairs of images.\nOnce a 3D model of a scene is built, a\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
