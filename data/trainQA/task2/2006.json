Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

[ref]15 analyze ViTs against adversarial noise and show ViTs are more robust to high frequency changes.\nSimilarly, Bhojanapalli et al.  study ViT against spatial perturbations [ref]15 and its robustness to removal of any single layer.\nSince ViT processes image patches, we focus on their robustness against patch masking, localized adversarial patches  and common natural corruptions.\nA concurrent work from Paul and Chen  also develops similar insights on robustness of ViTs but with a somewhat different set of experiments. Geirhos et al. [ref]9 provide evidence that CNNs mainly exploit texture to make a decision and give less importance to global shape.\nThis is further confirmed by CNN ability to only use local features .\nRecently,  quantifies mutual information  between shape and texture features.\nOur analysis indicates that large ViT models have less texture bias and give relatively higher emphasis to shape information.\nViT’s shape-bias approaches human-level performance when directly trained on stylized ImageNet [ref]9.\nOur findings are consistent with a concurrent recent work that demonstrates the importance of this trend on human behavioural understanding and bridging the gap between human and machine vision .\nA recent work  shows that self-supervised ViT can automatically segment foreground objects. In comparison, we show how shape-focused learning can impart similar capability in the image-level supervised ViT models, without any pixel-level supervision. Zeiler et al.  introduce a method to visualize CNN features at different layers and study the performance of off-the-shelf features.\nIn a similar spirit, we study the generalization of off-the-shelf features of ViT in comparison to CNN. Receptive field is an indication of network’s ability to model long range dependencies.\nThe receptive field of Transformer based models covers the entire input space, a property that resembles handcrafted features , but ViTs have higher representative capacity.\nThis allows ViT to model global context and preserve the structural information compared to CNN .\nThis work is an effort to demonstrate the effectiveness of flexible receptive field and content-based context modeling in ViTs towards robustness and generalization of the learned features.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: CNNs have shown state-of-the-art performance in independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) settings but remain highly sensitive to distributional shifts; adversarial noise [ref]11 , common image corruptions , and domain shifts (e.g., RGB to sketches) .\nIt is natural to ask if ViT, that processes inputs based on self-attention, offers any advantages in comparison to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
