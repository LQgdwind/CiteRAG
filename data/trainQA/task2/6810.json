      "content": "Paper Title: SpOctA: A 3D Sparse Convolution Accelerator with Octree-Encoding-Based Map Search and Inherent Sparsity-Aware Processing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPoint clouds, a collection of points obtained from a variety of 3D sensors such as LiDAR scanners and RGB-D cameras, contain extensive geometric, shape and depth information[ref]1.\nIn contrast to 2D images, point clouds provide an exceptional opportunity for a reliable and robust understanding of the surrounding environment [ref]2.\nConsequently, point clouds have become an indispensable modality in various promising applications, including virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), robotics and autonomous driving (AD).\nThese practical applications explicitly impose stringent necessities on network processing, requiring low latency, high accuracy and acceptable energy consumption [ref]1. Unlike images, 3D point clouds exhibit randomly spatial sparsity, thus necessitating distinct processing pattern from 2D convolutional neural networks (CNN)[ref]3.\nTo address the sparsity and irregularity of point clouds, researchers commonly choose to voxelize them into a uniform tensor representation [ref]2 and introduce 3D sparse convolution (SpConv) as the network backbone   .\nWhile SpConv-based models deliver satisfactory accuracy, they often run at under 20 frames per second (fps) on powerful NVIDIA GPUs due to the inefficient map search and high computation cost.\nIn comparison, ResNet [ref]3 runs at more than 800 fps.\nThe high latency and unacceptable power consumption constrain the applicability of 3D SpConv models in common industrial solutions . The new operator, map search in SpConv, causes extreme memory inefficiency and large processing latency explicitly.\nSpConv requires serial traversing for each voxel‚Äôs neighbors to build the IN-OUT maps for matrix multiplication, leading to frequent and irregular external memory access.\nAlthough hash-table-based approach is commonly employed in GPU-based optimizations    to simplify search access, it consumes excessive overhead for edge devices and cannot be parallelized.\nThe state-of-the-art SpConv accelerators also remain stuck in the inevitable serial processing   or heavy logic consumption for parallel search circuits, confined to restricted acceleration and unsatisfactory logic simplification. Furthermore, it also faces great challenges on the substantial increase in computation cost and parameter size of 3D convolution compared to traditional 2D CNNs.\nThe SpConv kernel is cube-shaped with an additional zùëßz-axis rather than a 2D square, enlarging the kernel size as well as Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations exponentially.\nTypical SpConv-based networks  incur 5-30√ó\\times larger computation overhead than the widely-used ResNet[ref]3, which severely limits the performance of the previous works  . To tackle these dilemmas, we propose SpOctA, a customized 3D sparse convolution accelerator designed for high-throughput and energy-efficient point cloud processing.\nSpOctA leverages the fixed neighbor pattern in octree encoding to simplify the map search procedure, and fully utilizes the inherent sparsity and point distribution to improve the computation and memory efficiency.\nThe key contributions are summarized as follows: The octree-encoding-based table-aided map search strategy is adopted to boost the parallelism potential of map search with algorithm-architecture co-optimization.\nIt introduces octree encoding to avert O‚Äã(nv‚Äão‚Äãx‚Äãe‚Äãl2)ùëÇsubscriptsuperscriptùëõ2ùë£ùëúùë•ùëíùëôO(n^{2}_{voxel})-level traversing and improves hardware throughput with parallel query design.\nThis approach attains 88.6-95.3% reduction on search latency. A high-throughput sparsity-aware computing core is designed to eliminate the computing redundancy.\nBy fully exploiting the inherent sparsity of each voxel, our method saves 44.4-79.1% processing latency. A non-uniform caching memory management is proposed to apply different caching level for different parts of kernels. It achieves significant savings on on-chip storage and reduction in memory footprint. The SpOctA is implemented on a 40nm technology and fully evaluated with a set of widely-used SpConv-based models   on 4 typical datasets   .\nCompared with the prior state-of-the-art accelerators  , our work achieves 1.1-6.9√ó\\times speedup and 1.5-3.1√ó\\times improvement on energy efficiency, supporting all kinds of typical SpConv operators.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Point clouds, a collection of points obtained from a variety of 3D sensors such as LiDAR scanners and RGB-D cameras, contain extensive geometric, shape and depth information[ref]1.\nIn contrast to 2D images, point clouds provide an exceptional opportunity for a reliable and robust understanding of the surrounding environment [ref]2.\nConsequently, point clouds have become\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
