      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Enhanced Controllability of Diffusion Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGuidance:\nSome recent works have explored modeling the conditional density p‚Äã(xt|c)ùëùconditionalsubscriptùë•ùë°ùëêp(x_{t}|c) for controllability. Dhariwal et al.¬†[ref]8 proposed to use a pretrained classifier but finetuning a classifier that estimates gradients from noisy images, which increases the complexity of the overall process¬†9. Ho et al.¬†9 proposed to use an implicit classifier while Composable Diffusion Models¬†4 (CDM) extend the classifier free guidance approach to work with multiple conditions assuming conditional independence. Though guidance approaches help control the generation, they do not offer fine grained controllability or support applications such as reference based image translation. Conditional DMs:\nConditional Diffusion Models have been explored in diverse applications showing state‚Äìof‚Äìthe‚Äìart performance in text to image generation (DALLE2¬†, Imagen¬†, Parti¬†). These methods use pretrained CLIP or similar embeddings that support interpolation but not further editability. DiffAE¬† proposed to learn a semantic space that has nice properties making it suitable image manipulation. However, a single latent space capturing all the information makes it difficult to isolate attributes to manipulate. Inference only Editing:\nSeveral works have proposed inference-time editing techniques on top of pretrained diffusion models. SDEdit¬† enables structure preserving edits while Prompt-to-prompt¬† modifies the attention maps from cross-attention layers to add, remove or reweigh importance of an object in an image. DiffusionCLIP¬†, Imagic¬† and Unitune¬† propose optimization based techniques for text based image editing. Textual Inversion¬† and DreamBooth¬† finetunes pretrained models using few reference images to get personalized models. Though the above techniques are helpful with editing, most of these methods require computationally expensive optimization, modify the weights of pretrained model for each sample, and/or doesn‚Äôt support fine‚Äìgrained controllability for reference based image translation. The closest related work to ours is DiffuseIT¬†. They enabled reference and text guided image translation by leveraging Dino-VIT¬† to encode content and style. However, their approach requires costly optimization during inference and doesn‚Äôt support controlling the final generation. \nInductive Bias of Diffusion Models:\nOn top of the inductive bias¬†  of Diffusion Models, eDiffi¬† proposed to train models specialized to a subset of the timesteps to improve generations drastically. MagicMix¬†3 interpolates noise maps while providing different embeddings at different timesteps. Though these approaches show the advantages of the inductive bias, it hasn‚Äôt been used to provide more controllability for image manipulation.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Guidance:\nSome recent works have explored modeling the conditional density p‚Äã(xt|c)ùëùconditionalsubscriptùë•ùë°ùëêp(x_{t}|c) for controllability.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
