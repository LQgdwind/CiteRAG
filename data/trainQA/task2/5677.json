      "content": "Paper Title: SLCA: Slow Learner with Classifier Alignment for Continual Learning on a Pre-trained Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nContinual learning aims to learn effectively from sequentially arrived data, behaving as if they were observed simultaneously.\nCurrent efforts are mainly based on the premise of learning from scratch, attempting to mitigate catastrophic forgetting  of previously-learned knowledge when adapting to each incremental task.\nHowever, the success of large-scale pre-training has revolutionized the training paradigm of deep neural networks. The pre-training stage brings both strong knowledge transfer and robustness to catastrophic forgetting for downstream continual learning [ref]43, which tends to be more significant as the scale of pre-training increases  [ref]28.\nTherefore, continual learning on a pre-trained model (CLPM) turns out to be an emerging direction and receives growing attention. For CLPM, the pre-trained knowledge is usually expressed by the representation layer, adapted to a sequence of incremental tasks.\nThere are two major strategies to leverage the pre-trained knowledge [ref]43:\n(1) fine-tune the representations, or (2) keep the representations fixed while learning a few additional parameters (e.g., adaptor , prompt [ref]24, instruction , etc.).\nAlthough (2) is becoming dominant in natural language processing (NLP) , the choice of (1) and (2) remains an open question for continual learning in computer vision (CV).\nThe recently proposed prompt-based approaches, such as L2P  and DualPrompt , followed the second strategy and reported to be far superior to the traditional continual learning baselines of fine-tuning the representation layer.\nOn the other hand, since the large amount of pre-training data are typically unlabeled and may also arrive incrementally, it seems more reasonable to use self-supervised pre-training than supervised pre-training  [ref]43, also regarding that (upstream) continual learning in a self-supervised manner is generally more robust to catastrophic forgetting   . In this work, however, we present an extensive analysis to reconsider the current progress and technical route for CLPM in CV.\nSpecifically, CLPM poses a critical challenge for continual learning that the pre-trained knowledge should be adaptively exploited for the current task while maintaining generalizability for future tasks.\nFor traditional continual learning baselines that sequentially fine-tune (Seq FT) the entire model, a uniform learning rate is typically too large for the representation layer, leading to a progressive overfitting problem where the pre-trained representations overfit to each incremental task and gradually lose generalizability.\nThis is the major cause of their inferiority to the recent prompt-based approaches.\nSuch a phenomenon is further exacerbated by using the more realistic self-supervised pre-training, which generally requires larger updates of the pre-trained representations to adequately accommodate each incremental task. To address the above challenges, we propose a simple but extremely effective approach named Slow Learner with Classifier Alignment (SLCA).\nFirst, we observe that the progressive overfitting problem of the representation layer can be almost avoided by selectively reducing its learning rate (i.e., using a slow learner), which is sufficient to achieve a good trade-off between task specificity and generalizability in continually updating the pre-trained representations.\nBased on the proposed slow learner, we further improve the classification layer by modeling the class-wise distributions and aligning the classification predictions, so as to properly balance the relationships between different tasks. Across a variety of continual learning benchmarks under supervised or self-supervised pre-training, our proposal provides substantial improvements for CLPM in CV and dramatically fills the gap of current progress from the upper bound performance. For example, the naive Seq FT is improved by 49.76%, 50.05%, 44.69% and 40.16% on Split CIFAR-100, Split ImageNet-R, Split CUB-200 and Split Cars-196, respectively, thus outperforming the SOTA approaches by a large margin (summarized in Fig. 1). On Split CIFAR-100 and Split ImageNet-R, the performance gap is only less than 2% for supervised pre-training and less than 4% for self-supervised pre-training. Our contributions include three aspects: (1) We present an extensive analysis of continual learning on a pre-trained model (CLPM), and demonstrate that the progressive overfitting problem is the key challenge for traditional continual learning baselines.\n(2) We propose a simple but effective approach to address this problem, which provides substantial improvements for CLPM and clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, serving as a strong baseline to re-evaluate the current progress and technical route.\n(3) Our results further identify critical factors and promising directions for CLPM, such as pre-training paradigm and downstream granularity, so as to facilitate subsequent research.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: revolutionized the training paradigm of deep neural networks.
