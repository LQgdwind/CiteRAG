Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: NBC-Softmax : Darkweb Author fingerprinting and migration tracking\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany embedding models [ref]20 [ref]19 use contrastive objectives, which encourage representation of positive pairs (distinguish similar representations) to be similar, and make representations of negative pairs further apart in embedding space [ref]20.\nIn unsupervised settings, with no labels available, augmented samples are used as positives, and negatives are randomly drawn openly [ref]25. Maximizing agreement between such two augmented samples by assuming IID data is often used in vision, a method pioneered by SimCLR’s [ref]25 NCE approach. These discriminative approaches based on contrastive learning have been outstandingly successful in practice [ref]20, reporting state-of-the-art results [ref]25 as well as outperforming supervised learning  in multiple domains. In the text domain,  proposed QT, a SOTA contrastive language model which works in sentence-space rather than word-space, which is an order of magnitude faster than previous methods, achieving better performance simultaneously. [ref]19 proposed SCGC, a lean contrastive model based on MLP that could handle text, graph and image data. Recently, supervised contrastive learning  has been able to extend and improve on unsupervised contrastive learning by exploiting label information in order to choose positive and negative samples. It outperforms cross entropy loss achieving state-of-the-art results\non ImageNet.\n proposed a fine-tuning objective combining softmax with a supervised contrastive learning term to significantly improve the RoBERTa-Large (text) baseline, by pulling examples from the same class closer and pushing different classes further apart.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: Many embedding models [ref]20 [ref]19 use contrastive objectives, which encourage representation of positive pairs (distinguish similar representations) to be similar, and make representations of negative pairs further\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
