      "content": "Paper Title: Scalable Comparative Visualization of Ensembles of Call Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo reduce visual complexity and improve readability, graph data is often\nvisualized as trees  , including the\ncase of CCTs and call graphs    . Here, we discuss related work\nin the area of\ncall graphs, tree ensembles, and graphs in general. Visualization of CCTs and call graphs.\nInteractive visualization tools for analyzing the performance of large-scale\nsupercomputers have seen significant research and development efforts in recent\nyears 0.\nFocusing specifically on CCTs, one class of tools    8 visualize them as\ncollapsible trees, where the user can toggle to show/hide functions as well as\nsort by the attributes (e.g., inclusive runtime). Several call graph visualization tools employ a node-link layout technique\nusing a graph drawing software like GraphViz 6 and use\nadditional node encoding techniques to represent the data\nattributes  3 .\nHowever, it is well known that node-link layouts lack scalability when dealing\nwith large-scale graphs 9.\nAdditionally, the node-link layouts lack efficient user interactivity, since\nthe user might require to toggle functions several times for investigation,\nespecially for deep call stacks, and cannot directly support exploring\nensembles of CCTs. To address scalability and interactivity issues, HPCToolkit’s\nhpcviewer  employs additional strategies like\nautomatic hot path extraction within a chosen hierarchy, flattening of calling\nstructure, and zooming interactions to expand the relevant portion of the CCT.\nLikewise, CallFlow  integrates different graph\nsplitting operations to allow the user choose the granularity of the\nvisualization (i.e., CCT, call graph, or super graph).\nCallFlow employs a Sankey diagram to encode the net inclusive time a function\nor a module spends in an execution. Ensembles of call graphs.\nSupporting visual comparison of multiple call graphs that addresses the specific\nneeds of HPC experts would enable improved diagnosis of issues, especially with\nthe trend to use adaptive execution modes. Williams et al.  amplified\nthe importance of comparison, mainly for execution graphs (where each edge\nrepresents the dependency between tasks).\nThe authors also proposed a visualization tool that compare only two\nexecution graphs at any time by employing node-encodings to show the differences\nin the execution graphs.\nTo compare several call graphs, Trevis \nused a matrix view to visualize pairwise similarity between graphs using a\nvariety of distance measures. However, not only does the similarity matrix\nsuffer from scalability issues, it often requires the user to perform pairwise\ncomparisons  by matching individual runs.\nNevertheless, the more-general task of exploring ensembles of call graphs and\nstudy performance variability is not supported by existing tools.\nInstead, experts generally visualize the different call graphs individually to\nunderstand the general calling structure and use simple statistical measures to\nunderstand the distribution of runtimes.\n Visual comparison of graphs and trees.\nComparison is often a key component of data analysis, especially to form\nand validate hypotheses  .\nMultiple comparative visualization tools support comparison between two trees\n(e.g.,, the original Unix diff program, or specialized tools such as\nTreeJuxtaposer , Mizbee 9,\nCode flows ).\nThe challenges in identifying the differences between two trees were summarized\nby Graham and Kennedy 2, and later generalized\nby Gleicher et al. 1,\nwho provided a taxonomy of visualization designs to support comparison of two\ntrees.\nIn general, three approaches to comparative designs are juxtaposition\n(showing different objects separately) 7,\nsuperposition 7 (overlaying multiple objects),\nand explicit encoding  8 (using an\nalternate visual medium to show differences). A number of works have focused in comparing multiple trees, especially for\nphylogenetic trees 1 7 6.\nThese works support various analytical tasks using juxtaposed views combined\nwith user interactions to highlight similarities and differences between two\ntrees.\nHowever, these techniques cannot scale to a large number of trees and are designed to address the specific needs for phylogenetic trees.\nRecently, Barcodetree 5 suggest using a bar-code like\nvisualization for comparing a large number of trees.\nHowever, their approach is primarily suited for stable and shallow trees, and\ncannot be used for call graphs, which are significantly deeper.\nFocusing on Sankey diagrams in Business Intelligence applications, Vosough\net al. [ref]52 provided a novel approach to visualize uncertainty in\nflow diagrams by imposing gradient-based fading on the boundaries nodes of the\nSankey diagram. Although quite powerful, this approach is unable to show the\nvariability in the distribution of the Sankey flow (e.g., inclusive time in call\ngraph nodes).\n\nReference markers found: [52]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]52: primarily suited for stable and shallow trees, and\ncannot be used for call graphs, which are significantly deeper.\nFocusing on Sankey diagrams in Business Intelligence applications, Vosough\net al. [ref]52 provided a novel approach to visualize uncertainty in\nflow diagrams by imposing gradient-based fading on the boundaries nodes of the\nSankey diagram. Although quite powerful, this approach is\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
