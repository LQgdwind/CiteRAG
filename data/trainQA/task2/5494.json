      "content": "Paper Title: A Biomedical Knowledge Graph for Biomarker Discovery in Cancer\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe bio-entity extraction component involves two tasks: i) NER that recognizes the named entities in PubMed abstracts based on BioBERT [ref]14 and SciBERT [ref]15 models, ii) EL to link extracted named entities, and iii) RE. NER is about recognizing domain-specific proper nouns in a biomedical corpus. For example, for the sentence The main proteins regulating cell-cycle are BAD and PNCa, which have downstream effects, proteins, cell-cycle, BAD, and PNCa are 4 proper nouns. TP53 and FAS are the top two POTSF genes in terms of the number of associated cancer types, which are associated with 34 and 15 cancer types, is another example, where a NER model is able to identify that TP53, FAS, POTSF genes, and cancer are the named entities. Recent NER approaches extract such named entities based on learning frameworks that leverage lexical features such as POS tags, dependency parse trees, etc . While fine-tuning BioBERT and SciBERT, WordPiece tokenization is used in which any new words is represented by frequent sub-words .\nIn WordPiece embedding, a word is divided into masked tokens. For example, syndromes is represented as s ##yn ##dr ##om ##es.\nThe compatibility of BioBERT with BERT helps allows representing any new words and fine-tuned for the biomedical domain using the original WordPiece vocabulary of BERT [ref]14. Eventually, it helps mitigates the out-of-vocabulary issue.\nThe transformers in all the BERT variants connect the encoders and decoders through self-attention for greater parallelization and reduced training time  [ref]37. BioBERT and SciBERT are initialized with a case-sensitive version of BERT (i.e., BERT cased). Then SciBERT and BioBERT’s weights are pre-trained on PubMed abstracts. Each pre-trained model are further fine-tuned to perform the NER task based on the PubMed Central full-text articles collected based on the inclusion and the exclusion criteria in table II. Inspired by the NER model proposed by Kim et a. [ref]37, our SciBERT- and BioBERT-based NER models are trained to predict the following 7 tags [ref]37: [IOB tags] - Inside, Outside, and Begin. [X] - sub-token of WordPiece. [CLS] - leading token of a sequence for classification. [SEP] - a sentence delimiter. [PAD] - padding of each word in a sentence. BERT was originally pre-trained on English Wikipedia, news, and book corpus. Thus, it requires domain-specific finetuning for biomedical domain texts that contain a considerable number of domain-specific proper nouns and terms. Recently, BioBERT and SciBERT are recently finetuned for solving different biomedical tasks, as shown in fig. 4. Both variants for BERT are found to be very effective at recognizing known biomedical entities [ref]37. The NER models are fine-tuned as follows [ref]37: where k𝑘k represents the indexes of seven tags {B,I,O,X,[CLS],[SEP],PAD}BIOXdelimited-[]CLSdelimited-[]SEPPAD\\{\\mathrm{B},\\mathrm{I},\\mathrm{O},\\mathrm{X},[\\mathrm{CLS}],[\\mathrm{SEP}],\\mathrm{PAD}\\}; where p𝑝p is the probability distribution of assigning each k𝑘k to token i𝑖i, and Ti∈RHsubscript𝑇𝑖superscript𝑅𝐻T_{i}\\in R^{H} is the final hidden representation. The final hidden representation is calculated by BioBERT and SciBERT for each token i𝑖i, H𝐻H is the hidden size of Ti,W∈RK×Hsubscript𝑇𝑖𝑊superscript𝑅𝐾𝐻T_{i},W\\in R^{K\\times H} is a weight matrix between k𝑘k and Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i}; where K𝐾K represents the number of tags, and b𝑏b is a KK\\mathrm{K}-dimensional bias vector on each k𝑘k. The classification loss L𝐿L is calculated as follows [ref]37: where ΘΘ\\Theta represents model parameters and N𝑁N is the sequence length. SciBERT and BioBERT extract different entity types, where an entity or two with frequently-occurring token interaction is marked with more than one entity type span. Then, based on probability distribution, we choose the correct entity when they were tagged with more than two types w.r.t probability-based decision rules [ref]37.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: The bio-entity extraction component involves two tasks: i) NER that recognizes the named entities in PubMed abstracts based on BioBERT [ref]14 and SciBERT [ref]15 models, ii) EL to link extracted named entities, and iii) RE.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
