      "content": "Paper Title: Efficacy of Neural Prediction-Based Zero-Shot NAS\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA typical NAS procedure consists of three components: search space, search strategy, and performance estimation strategy. The search strategy instructs the performance estimation strategy to evaluate an architecture from the search space. Then, it receives the estimation results to determine the next steps. Initial NAS research focused on the search strategy, primarily on designing heuristics tailored for NAS   and deep learning-based methods . Efficient search space designs are also a popular NAS research topic   because it prevents NAS procedure to evaluate obviously bad architectures existing in the search space. In this section, we provide reviews and summaries of works relevant to Prediction-based NAS and Zero-Shot NAS, which are directly related to our work. Zero-Shot NAS are created to mitigate the computational burden of NAS. Traditional NAS procedures take prohibitively large computational resources, such as the one proposed by Zoph and Le  costing 1800 GPU-days on a Tesla P100 GPU. Reliable performance estimators for neural network architectures actually existed before the emergence of NAS. They are the number of parameters and the depth of deep neural architectures. The belief in the superiority of big deep models over small shallow models has been the very first motivation to develop early deep learning architectures. It gave rise to models like LeNet-5 , AlexNet , VGGNet . Expert knowledge about the architecture’s expressivity, capacity, and SGD trainability has led to the creation of more sophisticated architecture performance predictors. Mellor et al.  showed that NAS could be performed without actually optimizing the architecture. To estimate architecture performance at initialization, they measure the differences between binary codes of two different inputs. Their method uses the score as a performance evaluator for evolutionary algorithms. They achieved a moderate-to-strong correlation on NDS search spaces, on both CIFAR and ImageNet datasets. Chen et al.  rank architectures based on trainability and expressivity of architectures. Trainability of models refers to the ease of using gradient descent to optimize neural networks. They used condition number of neural tangent kernel (NTK) as an indicator of neural network trainability from the work of Xiao et al. . Expressivity of models refers to the complexity of models. To measure the complexity of models, they have used the number of linear regions, adapted from the work of Xiong et al. . Their contribution lies in being the early Zero-Shot NAS, how to ensemble the two indicators, and how to search using their indicator. They shown that condition number of NTK and number of linear regions favors different type of operations: trainability favors skip connection and expressivity favors learnable operations on NAS-Bench-201 [ref]15. As an effort to prevent one score completely dominate the other, they used the relative ranking instead of a linear combination because the search algorithm does not know the scale of two scores in the new search space. Their search algorithm is prune-based, called prune-by-importance. They have found SoTA on DARTS search space [ref]28 as well as having an infinitesimal search cost. Abdelfattah et al.  use metrics introduced by network pruning works to craft zero-shot performance estimators. The saliency-based metrics used in the paper are snip , grasp , fisher , and synflow . They use the sum of saliency scores of all parameters as the performance predictor. As a consequence, the behavior of their proxies is similar to the number of parameters, explored in . They have run extensive experiments on and their method outperforms many prior performance estimators NAS-Benchmarks, namely NAS-Bench-201 [ref]15, NAS-Bench-101 [ref]17, and NAS-Bench-ASR . Lin et al.  introduce a scale-insensitive version (Zen-Score) of their ΦΦ\\Phi-score as the expressivity of architecture. ΦΦ\\Phi-score is calculated via expected gaussian complexity at each linear region. To make Zen-Score scale-insensitive, they re-scale ΦΦ\\Phi-score by the product of the variance statistics of all the batch normalization (BN) layers in the network. They show an elegant method that maximizes architectural complexity and can discover high-performance networks in vanilla network space. Their method, however, cannot be used in irregular design spaces, such as the one covered in NDS design spaces . It discovered high-performance architectures in MobileNetV3  search space and is the first Zero-Shot NAS to outperform prediction-based NAS on ImageNet. Prediction-based NAS describes a class of methods leveraging architecture performance information obtained through training of architectures within a sample from the search space. Early works in prediction-based NAS revolve around learning curve extrapolation. Learning curve extrapolation can assist neural architecture search (NAS) and hyperparameter optimization (HPO) terminates the training process early, thus, reducing the computational cost. Klein et al.  propose a probabilistic approach to modeling training curves. Their method is similar to , which used basis functions to extrapolate learning curves from the architecture performance observed via the training process. The differences lie in the usage of the Bayesian neural network allowing their method can be hyperparameter-aware. This allows the sharing of knowledge between different learning curves, which is more data efficient than the previous method . They conduct experiments on small and large convolutional neural networks on CIFAR datasets . They surpassed previous methods on HPO and even show strong correlation between predicted accuracy and accuracy of unobserved learning curves. The above method can also be used in NAS if hyperparameters are architecture-related, such as the number of layers, the width of st​hsuperscript𝑠𝑡ℎs^{th} layer, etc. Kandasamy et al.  leverage GP as a surrogate model to predict the performance of architectures and employs Bayesian optimization to guide the search process efficiently. Their Bayesian procedure incorporates optimal transport based (pseudo-)distance for neural network graphs (OTMANN) to define the kernel function of architectures. With the assistance of GP as a surrogate model, NASBOT finds better MLP architectures for the regression problems: blog feedback , indoor location , slice localisation , naval propulsion , protein tertiary structure , news popularity  and CNN architecture for the classification task: CIFAR-10 , as compared to TreeBO, EA, RAND. While they deploy in more general spaces and consume less computational cost, NASBOT shows lower performance than prior work   . Advancements in neural graph processing techniques like Graph Convolutional Networks  have replaced complicated distance measurement methods for Bayesian optimization. Dudziak et al.’s work  is one of the early adopters of this technique in Neural Architecture Search. They introduced transfer learning from latency prediction task to assist accuracy prediction task. Note that, latency measurement is much cheaper than accuracy measurement, and deep learning scales with data; therefore, they can re-use the feature trained from a much larger dataset to solve accuracy prediction with limited data. Applying transfer learning robustifies their predictor’s performance from 0.834 to 0.890, calculated using Spearman correlation between predicted score and test-accuracy in NAS-Bench-201 [ref]15. In addition, their paper suggests an iterative method for choosing data. This method, called iterative data selection, aims to rank the top-K architectures instead of the low-performing ones. By using iterative data selection, their method performs better in an End-to-End NAS procedure in NAS-Bench-201 [ref]15 and NAS-Bench-101 [ref]17 benchmarks. Moreover, they successfully discovered 97.6%percent97.697.6\\% test-accuracy on CIFAR-10  within the DARTS search space [ref]28. Lu et al.  used a transformer instead of GCNs or MLP for structural encoding. Their main contribution lies in the method to process architecture graphs using a transformer, they use Laplacian matrix-based positional encoding. The Laplacian graph is transformed using a multi-layer perceptron. Then, it is combined with operational encoder to create positional encoding for the transformer. Their self-evolution uses historical validation accuracy to optimize their NAS procedure to guide the predictor to avoid overfitting. Their method achieved good results on both NAS-Benchmarks and 97.48%percent97.4897.48\\% on DARTS search space [ref]28.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: shown that condition number of NTK and number of linear regions favors different type of operations: trainability favors skip connection and expressivity favors learnable operations on NAS-Bench-201 [ref]15.
