      "content": "Paper Title: StereoSpike: Depth Learning with a Spiking Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDepth is an important feature of the surrounding space whose estimation finds its place in various tasks across many different fields . Potential applications can be as diverse as object manipulation in robotics  or collision avoidance for autonomous vehicles during navigation . In humans, depth processing is extremely well developed and relies on monocular (e.g., occlusions, perspectives or motion parallax) and binocular (retinal disparities) visual cues . This processing consumes very little energy as the visual system encodes retinal information under the form of action potentials, or spikes and it is believed that the brain only requires about 20 Watts to function . Over the last years, it has motivated the development of numerous bio-inspired approaches based on neuromorphic sensors and spiking neural networks to process depth in embedded systems. Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) have recently gathered the interest of scientists and industrial actors, thanks to a growing number of research papers explaining how to process their output [ref]11. Notable reasons for this recent popularity are their very high dynamic range and excellent temporal resolution which allow them to operate in extreme conditions (e.g., night, bright sun, rapid motion) where conventional frame-based cameras would suffer from severe saturation or motion blur.\nInstead of repeating redundant frame information (i.e., when the camera or the scene is not moving) at a fixed sampling rate, their pixels asynchronously emit an action potential –spike or event– whenever the change in log-luminance at this location since the last event, reaches a threshold. This sparse encoding scheme draws direct inspiration from retinal ganglion cells in animal models.\nFinally, event cameras’ unrivaled energy-efficiency also contribute to make them especially suitable in automotive scenarios with strong energy, memory and latency constraints. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a good fit for DVSs, as they can leverage the sparsity of their output event streams. Implemented on dedicated chips such as Intel Loihi , IBM TrueNorth , Brainchip Akida 0 or Tianjic [ref]34, these models could become a new paradigm for ultra-low power computation in the coming years. In addition, SNNs maintain the same level of biological plausibility as silicon retinae, making them new models of choice among computational neuroscientists. SNNs have recently attracted the deep learning community since the breakthrough of Surrogate Gradient (SG) learning 8 3, which enabled the training of networks with back-propagation despite the non-differentiable condition for spike emission. While SNNs generally remain less accurate than their analog counterpart (i.e., Analog Neural Networks or ANNs), the gap in accuracy is decreasing, even on challenging problems like ImageNet .\nIn this context, we bring the following contributions: We propose an ultra-low power spiking neural network for depth estimation, capable of dense depth predictions even at places without events and with high performances. In addition to its superior hardware-friendliness, our network is conceptually simpler than prior works and paves the way for using strictly spiking neural networks in other large-scale regression problems. We show that despite the dynamic nature of DVS data, the problem of depth estimation from such neuromorphic event streams can be treated as a non-temporal task. We leverage this feature by designing our model purely stateless in the sense that we reset all neurons to a membrane potential of zero at each timesteps. If this choice might not fully take advantage of the temporal processing abilities of SNNs, it drastically decreases the computational and energy footprint of our approach. We report, to the best of our knowledge, one of the first SNNs outperforming equivalent ANNs in a serious and applied engineering task. We accompany this network with a new data augmentation technique for sequential DVS data which we call time mirror. In section 2, we introduce several related works that inspired our approach. We explain our methodology in section 3, including the data pre-processing, network architecture, and training details. In section 4, we compare our method with prior studies in terms on performances. Very interestingly, we also show that StereoSpike surpasses equivalent analog Neural Networks (ANNs) with similar architectures. Finally, section 5 discusses the superiority of our model in terms of computational efficiency and energy-consumption.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: systems.
