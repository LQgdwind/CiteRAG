      "content": "Paper Title: Neighborhood Attention Transformer\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConvolutional neural networks (CNNs)  have been the de facto standard architecture for computer vision models across different applications for years.\nAlexNet  showed their usefulness on ImageNet , and many others followed suit with architectures such as VGG , ResNet , and EfficientNet .\nTransformers [ref]31 on the other hand, were originally proposed as attention-based models for natural language processing (NLP), trying to exploit the sequential structure of language.\nThey were the basis upon which BERT  and GPT    were built, and they continue to be the state of the art architecture in NLP. In late 2020, Vision Transformer (ViT)  was proposed as an image classifier using only a Transformer Encoder operating on an embedded space of image patches, mostly for large-scale training. A number of other methods followed, attempting to increase data efficiency 8  [ref]15, eventually making such Transformer-like models the state of the art in ImageNet-1K classification (without pre-training on large-scale datasets such as JFT-300M). These high-performing Transformer-like methods are all based on Self Attention (SA), the basic building block in the original Transformer [ref]31. SA has a linear complexity with respect to the embedding dimension (excluding linear projections), but a quadratic complexity with respect to the number of tokens.\nIn the scope of vision, the number of tokens is typically in linear correlation with image resolution.\nAs a result, higher image resolution results in a quadratic increase in complexity and memory usage in models strictly using SA, such as ViT.\nThe quadratic complexity has prevented such models from being easily applicable to downstream vision tasks, such as object detection and segmentation, in which image resolutions are usually much larger than classification.\nAnother problem is that convolutions benefit from inductive biases such as locality, and the 2-dimensional spatial structure, while dot-product self attention is a global 1-dimensional operation by definition.\nThis means that some of those inductive biases have to be learned with either large sums of data  or advanced training techniques and augmentations 8 [ref]15. Local attention modules were therefore proposed to alleviate these issues.\nStand-Alone Self-Attention (SASA) 5 was one of the earliest applications of local window-based attention to vision, where each pixel attends to a window around it.\nIts explicit sliding window pattern is identical to that of same convolutions, with zero paddings around and a simple 2-dimensional raster scan, therefore maintaining translational equivariance.\nSASA was aimed at replacing convolutions in a ResNet, and was shown to have a noticeable improvement over baselines.\nHowever, the authors noted SASA was limited in terms of speed due to the lack of an efficient implementation similar to that of convolutions.\nSwin 1 on the other hand was one of the first hierarchical vision transformers based on local self attention.\nIts design and the shifted-window self attention allowed it to be easily applicable to downstream tasks, as they made it computationally feasible, while also boosting performance through the additional biases injected. Swin’s localized attention, however, first applies self attention to non-overlapping windows and then shifts the windows, the motivation of which was sliding window methods such as SASA suffering throughput bottlenecks.\nHaloNet [ref]30 used a haloing mechanism that localizes self attention for blocks of pixels at a time, as opposed to pixel-wise. One of their key motivations for this was also noted to be the lack of an efficient sliding window attention. In this work, we revisit explicit sliding window attention mechanisms, and propose Neighborhood Attention (NA).\nNA localizes SA to each pixel’s nearest neighbors, which is not necessarily a fixed window around the pixel.\nThis change in definition allows all pixels to maintain an identical attention span, which would otherwise be reduced for corner pixels in zero-padded alternatives (SASA).\nNA also approaches SA as its neighborhood size grows, and is equivalent to SA at maximum neighborhood.\nAdditionally, NA has the added advantage of maintaining translational equivariance [ref]30, unlike blocked and window self attention.\nWe develop 𝒩​A​T​T​E​N𝒩𝐴𝑇𝑇𝐸𝑁\\mathcal{N}ATTEN, a Python package with efficient C++ and CUDA kernels that allow NA to run even faster than Swin’s WSA in practice, while using less memory.\nWe build Neighborhood Attention Transformer (NAT), which achieves competitive results across vision tasks. To summarize, our main contributions are: Proposing Neighborhood Attention (NA): A simple and flexible explicit sliding window attention mechanism that localizes each pixel’s attention span to its nearest neighborhood, approaches self attention as its span grows, and maintains translational equivariance.\nWe compare NA in terms of complexity and memory usage to self attention, window self attention, and convolutions. Developing efficient C++ and CUDA kernels for NA, including the tiled NA algorithm, which allow NA to run up to 40% faster than Swin’s WSA while using up to 25% less memory.\nWe release them under a new Python package for explicit sliding window attention mechanisms, 𝒩​𝒜​𝒯​𝒯​ℰ​𝒩𝒩𝒜𝒯𝒯ℰ𝒩\\mathbfcal{N}\\mathbf{ATTEN},\nto provide easy-to-use modules with autograd support that can be plugged into any existing PyTorch pipeline. Introducing Neighborhood Attention Transformer (NAT), a new efficient, accurate, and scalable hierarchical transformer based on NA.\nWe demonstrate its effectiveness on both classification and downstream tasks.\nFor instance, NAT-Tiny reaches 83.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with only 4.3 GFLOPs and 28M parameters, and 51.4% box mAP on MS-COCO and 48.4% mIoU on ADE20K, significantly outperforming both Swin Transformer and ConvNeXt 2.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: models across different applications for years.\nAlexNet  showed their usefulness on ImageNet , and many others followed suit with architectures such as VGG , ResNet , and EfficientNet .\nTransformers [ref]31 on the other hand, were originally proposed as attention-based models for natural language processing (NLP), trying to exploit the sequential structure of language.\nThey were the basis upon\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
