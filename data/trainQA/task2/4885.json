Liu et al.  propose EIGNN as a linear implicit GNNs where a closed-form solution is derived. Park et al. 1 construct an input-dependent linear iterative map for predicting the properties of a graph system.\nHowever, these implicit GNNs cannot model multiscale information in underlying graphs. In contrast, several explicit GNNs, such as JKNet [ref]30, MixHop , and N-GCN , have shown that multiscale information is helpful to improve the model capability.\nTo fill the gap, our model MGNNI brings multiscale modeling to implicit GNNs.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: GNNs have been widely used in different tasks for graph-structured data.\nEven with different aggregation schemes (e.g., skip connection [ref]30  and attention ), convolutional GNNs   [ref]30 generally involve finite aggregation layers (usually less than 20 layers) with different learnable weights, which makes them unable to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
