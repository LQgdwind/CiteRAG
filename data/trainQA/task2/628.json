      "content": "Paper Title: Reducing Language Biases in Visual Question Answering with Visually-Grounded Question Encoder\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisual Question Answering (VQA) is a good benchmark for context-specific reasoning and scene understanding that requires the combined skill of Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Given an image and a question in natural language, the task is to answer the question by understanding cues from both the question and the image. Tackling the VQA problem requires a variety of scene understanding capabilities such as object and activity recognition, enumerating objects, knowledge-based reasoning, fine-grained recognition, and common sense reasoning, etc. Thus, such a multi-domain problem yields a good measure of whether computers are reaching capabilities similar to humans. With the success of deep-learning in CV and NLP, many datasets  [ref]14    , and models     2 have been proposed to solve VQA. Most of these models perform well in the existing benchmark datasets where the train and test sets have similar answer distribution. However, recent studies show that these models often rely on the statistical correlations between the question patterns & the most frequent answer in the train set, and shows poor generalized performance (i.e., poor performance on a test set with different answer distributions than the train set [ref]1).\nIn other words, they are heavily biased on the language modality. E.g., most of the existing models overwhelmingly answer “tennis” by seeing the question pattern “what sport is.. ” or answer the question “what color of the banana?” as “yellow” even though it is a “green banana,” By definition and design, the VQA models need to merge the visual and textual modalities to answer the question. However, in practice, they often answer the question without considering the image modality, i.e., they tend to have less image grounding and rely more on the question. This undesirable behavior restricts the existing VQA models being applicable in practical scenarios. One reason for this behavior is the strong language biases that exist in the available VQA datasets  [ref]14. Hence, the models trained on these datasets will often rely on such biases [ref]1 3  5 1 . E.g., in the most popular and large VQAv2 dataset [ref]14, a majority of the “what sport is” question is linked to “tennis.” Hence, upon training, the model will blindly learn the superficial correlations between the “what sport is” language pattern from the question, and the most frequent answer “tennis.” Unfortunately, it is hard to avoid these biases from the train set when collecting real-world samples due to the annotation cost. Instead, we require methods that force the model to look at the image and question equally to predict the answer. Since the main source of bias is the over-dependency of the models on the language side, some approaches such as 3  , tried to overcome this by reducing the contribution from the language side. On the other hand, some approaches 5 [ref]1 1 tried to improve the visual-grounding of the model in order to reduce the language-bias. All of these existing bias reduction methods cause a performance reduction in the standard benchmark VQA datasets. A common pipeline in existing VQA models is to encode the image and question separately and then fuse them to predict the answer. Typically the image is encoded using a pre-trained CNN (e.g., ResNet , VGGNet 7, etc. ), and the question is encoded by sending the word-level features to an RNN (GRU  or LSTM ). In this approach, while encoding the question, it only considers the language modality, and such a question representation has not contained any distinguishable power based on the content in the image. In other words, the question representation is not grounded in the image. E.g., with this scheme, the question “what sport is this?” has the same encoded representation irrespective of whether the image contains “tennis,” “baseball,” or “skateboarding,” etc. Since the majority of such questions are linked to the answer “tennis” in the train set, the model will learn a strong correlation between the question pattern “what sport is” to the answer “tennis,” irrespective of the image. This leads to overfitting the question representation to the most frequent answer, and the model will ignore the image altogether. In this paper, we propose a generic question encoder for VQA, the Visually-Grounded Question Encoder (VGQE), that reduces this problem. VGQE encodes the question by considering not only the linguistic information from the question but also the visual information from the image. A visual comparison of a generic VQA model with a traditional question encoder and with VGQE is shown in Fig 1. The VGQE explicitly forces the model to look at the image while encoding the question. For each question word, VGQE finds the important visual feature from the image and generates a visually-grounded word-embedding vector. This word embedding vector contains the language information from the question word and the corresponding visual information from the image.\nThese visually-grounded word-embedding vectors are then passed to a sequence of RNN cells (inside VGQE) to encode the question.\nSince VGQE considers both the modalities equally, the encoded question representation will get sufficient distinguishing power based on the visual counterpart. For e.g., with VGQE, in the case of the “what sport is this” question, the model can easily distinguish the question for “baseball,” “tennis,” or “skateboarding,” etc. As a result, the question representation itself is heavily influenced by the image, and the learning of the correlation between specific language patterns and the most frequent answers in the train set can be reduced. The VGQE is generic and easily adaptable to any existing VQA models, i.e., replace the existing traditional language-based question encoder in the model with VGQE. In this paper, we demonstrate the ability of VGQE to reduce the language bias on three recent best performing baseline VQA models, i.e., MUREL , UpDn  and BAN 2. We did extensive experiments on the VQA-CPv2 dataset [ref]1 and demonstrate the ability of VGQE to push the baseline models to achieve state-of-the-art results. The VQA-CPv2 dataset is specifically designed to test the VQA model’s capacity to overcome the language biases from the train set. Further, we show the effect of VGQE in the standard VQAv2 benchmark as well. Unlike existing bias reduction techniques [ref]1 3   1, VGQE does not show any drop in the accuracy on the standard VQAv2 dataset; instead, it improves the performance.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: etc. Thus, such a multi-domain problem yields a good measure of whether computers are reaching capabilities similar to humans. With the success of deep-learning in CV and NLP, many datasets  [ref]14    , and models     2 have been proposed to solve VQA. Most of these models perform well in the existing benchmark datasets where the train and test sets have similar answer distribution.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
