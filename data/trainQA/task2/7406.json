      "content": "Paper Title: Formal Verification of the Sumcheck Protocol\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nProbabilistic proof systems are protocols in which a powerful but untrusted prover can convince a verifier that a given statement is true. They differ from traditional mathematical proofs by incorporating interaction, randomness and cryptographic assumptions. As a result, they offer benefits such as fast verification and zero-knowledge properties. Early research into interactive proofs   produced complexity theoretic results such as 𝖨𝖯=𝖯𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤𝖨𝖯𝖯𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤\\mathsf{IP}=\\mathsf{PSPACE}.\nToday, probabilistic proof systems enjoy a high degree of adoption and are increasingly deployed in applications such as verifiable computation, electronic voting, and cryptocurrencies. Errors in analysis.   Unfortunately, the designs and deployments of probabilistic proof systems often contain errors: The analysis of the proof system  for integer commitments contained errors, later addressed in ; The public setup information of the proof system  contained extra information which made the proof system insecure. This affected the ZCash cryptocurrency ; A significant gap in the security proof of  was found and fixed using three different methods in  [ref]9 0. The proof system described in 1 states a cheating probability lower than its actual value. A proper analysis was given in 2 3. The description of the Fiat-Shamir transformation in 4 neglects to hash certain values, which leads to the vulnerability described in 5. This affected multiple implementations of proof systems 6 7 8 9 0. Other researchers have raised concerns about errors in cryptographic analyses in general 1 2. As probabilistic proofs have become increasingly popular, their security analyses demand greater care and scrutiny. Formal verification of probabilistic proof systems.   In order to remedy these issues, researchers are starting to turn to machine-checkable security analyses using formal verification techniques.\nExisting formal verification work falls into two categories: formal verification of non-interactive proof systems, such as that of 3 by 4 5, and constant-round interactive proof systems, including Sigma protocols 6, protocols using the “MPC-in-the-head” paradigm of 7 in 8 9, and particular signature schemes 0 1. However, despite this growing body of work, interactive proof systems with a non-constant number of rounds have not yet been addressed. This category contains a large number of protocols, including proof systems based on the GKR protocol 2 for uniform circuits, proof systems for NP 3, “split-and-fold” proof systems such as 4 4, as well as protocols with optimal prover complexity 5 6 7 8 and interesting streaming properties 9 0  1. Note that while e.g. 6 does consider sequential composition of Sigma protocols, leading to a multi-round protocol, many of the protocols cited above have a significantly more complicated recursive structure. In fact, the multi-round protocols cited above are all based on a single protocol: the sumcheck protocol. Each protocol makes direct use of the sumcheck protocol, or its algebraic 2 or combinatorial 3 generalizations, as a subroutine. Moreover, the streaming properties of 0  1 are directly linked to those of the sumcheck protocol. The sumcheck protocol.   As the name suggests, the goal of the sumcheck protocol is to check that the evaluation of a sum corresponds to a certain value. More specifically, the verifier V’s objective is to use the prover P to confirm that where H is a subset of some field 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F}, p is a polynomial of arity n over 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F}, and v∈𝔽v𝔽\\isaid{v}\\in\\mathbb{F}. The protocol has n rounds of interaction between the prover and the verifier, and a recursive structure whereby statements about polynomials with arity n are reduced to statements about polynomials with smaller arity, repeatedly, until arity 00 is reached. As well as being used in many practical probabilistic proof systems, the sumcheck protocol and its generalizations are also a core component of many complexity-theoretic results, like 𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯⊆𝖨𝖯𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯𝖨𝖯\\mathsf{coNP}\\subseteq\\mathsf{IP}, 𝖯𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤=𝖨𝖯𝖯𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤𝖨𝖯\\mathsf{PSPACE}=\\mathsf{IP} 4 5, and results on 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖣𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖣\\mathsf{PPAD}-hardness 6 7 8. It is also one of few interactive proof systems that can be made non-interactive via the Fiat-Shamir transformation without relying on heuristics like the random oracle model 9. Given the versatility of the sumcheck protocol, it is clear that its formal analysis is highly desirable and constitutes the first step towards analysing a great many probabilistic proofs with unique and interesting properties.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: extra information which made the proof system insecure.
