To facilitate cross-domain generalization [ref]3 , researchers adapt encoder-decoder architecture  , reducing the requirement for specific domain knowledge via end-to-end training. These approaches require diverse and extensive training data to train the model, which is prohibitively expensive . Recent progress focuses on large language models (LLMs) (e.g., GPT-3 , Codex  and GPT-4 0) with prompt learning 1, which refers to using specific prompts or instructions to generate desired responses.\nRajkumar et al. 2 and Liu et al. 3 evaluate several prompt learning baselines for Text-to-SQL tasks.\nTheir findings show that though it is natural for LLMs to generate text sequences, generating SQL is still a challenge due to the SQL’s strict syntax requirements.\nTo address these issues, inspired by few-shot learning 1, existing work employs prompting the LLMs with a list of demonstration examples (i.e. question-SQL pairs) to generate SQL queries.\nHowever, they typically rely on manual labour to create static demonstration examples tailored to specific tasks.\nDIN-SQL 4 selects pre-defined samples from each category,\nSELF-DEBUGGING 5 explains the code to LLMs but without explanation demonstration.\nThese methods employ a static demonstration, meaning that the demonstration examples provided to LLMs are fixed and do not adapt or change across different examples.\nThese static demonstration examples hardly adapt to the scenarios where the semantic gap between retrieved demonstrations and the input question is large, which is called retrieval bias 6, commonly appearing in the retrieval-augmented generation. Inspired by 7, we argue that providing dynamic demonstrations can be adaptive to specific samples and schema for SQL generation.\nDynamic examples enable the SQL generation to accommodate various scenarios. By adjusting to specific instances, demonstrations can be customized to incorporate the necessary query structure, logical operations, and question semantics. This adaptability facilitates the SQL generation that are relevant and appropriate for different situations. In this paper, we propose retrieval-augmented prompts for an LLM-based Text-to-SQL model, which contains sample-aware prompting and a dynamic revision chain.\nSpecifically, we propose to retrieve similar SQL queries to construct prompts with sample-aware demonstration examples. Notice that users often ask questions in different expressions, even if they have the same intention and SQL query. It makes the model hard to retrieve helpful examples.\nTo solve this issue, we propose to extract the question’s real intention via two strategies:\nFirstly, we simplify original questions through LLMs to clarify the user’s intentions and unify the syntax for retrieval.\nSecondly, we extract question skeletons for retrieving items with similar question intents.\nTo produce executable and accurate SQL, we design a dynamic revision chain, generating SQL queries by iteratively adapting to fine-grained feedback according to the previous version of generated SQL. The feedback includes SQL execution results, SQL explanations, and related database contents.\nThis dynamic chain manages to generate executable and accurate SQL through automatic interaction between the language model and the database without human intervention.\n Our contributions are as follows:\n(1) We develop a retrieval-augmented framework for Text-to-SQL tasks by prompting LLMs with sample-aware demonstrations.\n(2) We propose a dynamic revision chain, which adapts to the previously generated SQL with fine-grained feedback.\n(3) Experimental results on three Text-to-SQL benchmarks show that our method surpasses the strong baseline models.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Text-to-SQL task aims to convert natural language question (NLQ) to structured query language (SQL), allowing non-expert users to obtain desired information from databases  [ref]2.\nAs databases are popular in various scenarios involving different domains (e.g., education and financial systems, etc.), it is desirable to train a model that generalizes well across multiple\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
