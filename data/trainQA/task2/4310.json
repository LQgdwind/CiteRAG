      "content": "Paper Title: Leveraging Log Instructions in Log-based Anomaly Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIT infrastructures in numerous application fields consist of thousands of networked software (microservices) and hardware (e.g., IoT, Edge) components. The uninterrupted and correct interaction is crucial for the functionality of the overall system and the deployed applications. However, this IT complexity combined with the required QoS guarantees (e.g. maximal latency) increasingly overwhelms the IT operators in charge. The current trends of agile software development with hundreds of updates and daily deployments further exacerbate the operational challenges. The holistic overview, operation, and maintenance of the IT infrastructure grow even more challenging when additionally it is affected by unforeseen factors such as failures, software errors, security breaches, or external environmental events. Companies react to these threats by employing additional site reliability engineers (SREs) as well as by deploying AI-enabled methods for IT operations (AIOps) . The AIOps methods collect and analyse plenty of IT system information – metric data (e.g., CPU utilization), logs, and traces (paths of function calls) to detect anomalies, locate their root causes and remediate them. The diverse AIOps techniques enable fast, efficient and effective prevention of upcoming failures, aiming to minimize their hazardous effects during the daily operational activities . In this paper, we focus on anomaly detection in the context of AIOps, as a core step towards enhancing fault tolerance: the earlier an anomaly is detected, the more time is available to prevent the failure and mitigate the impact on the QoS. We focus on system log messages (logs) as semantically rich data written by humans for humans. The logs allow a more insightful analysis and interpretation than, e.g., metric data . For example, a sharp increase in the network packet loss (a commonly used metric for network monitoring) only indicates a problem with the network, but it does not provide a clue why it happens. In comparison, logs give semantically meaningful clues for the anomaly. For example, when a switch generates the log “System is rebooting now.”, the operator detects that the switch is failing (potentially anomalous) and obtain a clue that the potential anomaly is caused by switch rebooting. Logs are generated from log instructions that developers insert in the source code (e.g., log.info(”VM took %f seconds to spawn.”, createSeconds)) to visualise important system events and to create hints for the operators that run the system as a black-box . The log instructions are commonly composed of static text (log template), variable parameters of the event (e.g., createSeconds), and log level giving information about the severity level of the event (e.g., ”info”, ”fatal”, ”error”). The log levels come at different granularity, conditioned on the used programming languages and logging libraries. The lower log levels such as ”info” are usually used when describing normal state or state transitions, e.g., ”Successful connection.”. In contrast, higher log levels such as ”error”, ”critical”, or ”fatal” commonly accompany events that describe abnormal states or state transitions, e.g., ”Machine failure”. Therefore, the log levels encode rich expert information for manual detection of anomalous events, frequently used in today’s operational practices . For example, to diagnose an anomaly, operators commonly use manual search for logs with higher levels such as ”error”, ”critical”, or ”fatal” . Owning to the ever-increasing IT system complexities, logs are constantly generated in large volumes (e.g., up to several TB per day ). The emergence of complexity makes the manual log-based anomaly detection time-consuming , prompting the need for automation [ref]6 . Thereby, automatic methods for log-based anomaly detection are increasingly researched and adopted   0 1 2 3 4. Current methods are commonly grouped into two families, i.e., supervised and unsupervised [ref]6. Existing supervised methods depend on manually labeled training data. Due to the constant evolution of the software systems 1, the supervised methods require a repetitive, time-expensive labeling process, which is oftentimes practically challenging and infeasible . The unsupervised methods mitigate the labeling problem by modeling with logs from normal system states and detecting any significant deviations from the modeled normality state as anomalies. However, the lack of explicit information about anomalous logs during modeling leads to limited input representation, reducing their detection performance, and questioning their practical usability [ref]6. To address the two challenges, we propose ADLILog. The central idea of the method is to use data from public code projects (e.g., GitHub) alongside the data from the system of interest (target system) when learning the anomaly detection model. Since the public code projects contain numerous log instructions for diverse normal and abnormal events, we assume that they may encode rich anomaly-related information. Following the usage of the log levels for manual log anomaly detection, we considered grouping the instructions based on the log levels to extract anomaly-related information. Specifically, we created two severity level groups from the log instructions based on their log levels – ”normal” (composed of ”info”) and ”abnormal” (composed of ”error”, ”fatal”, and ”critical”). To verify our assumption, we conducted a study to examine the anomaly-related language properties between the two groups (i.e., diversity in the vocabulary and the sentiment of the words). The study results show that the two groups extract anomaly-related information that can be used as a basis for anomaly detection. Based on this observation, we introduce ADLILog, which uses the anomaly-related information alongside the target system data to learn a deep learning anomaly detection model through a two-phase learning procedure. An important advantage of ADLILog is that, by having access to ”normal” and especially ”abnormal” event descriptions from many different software systems, it learns a model by supervised learning objectives, without the need for target-system log labels (i.e., its unsupervised method). Thereby, ADLILog eliminates the need for time-expensive labeling while preserving the advantage of supervised modeling. The latter addresses the challenge of limited input representation during modeling. To prove the quality of detection, we extensively evaluate ADLILog against seven related methods on two widely used benchmark datasets and demonstrate that our method outperforms the supervised methods by 5-24%, and the unsupervised by 40-63% on F1 score. The datasets111https://zenodo.org/record/6376763 and method implementation222https://github.com/ADLILog/ADLILog are available as open-source for fostering the research on this practically relevant problem. The remaining of the paper is structured as follows. Section II presents our study that examines the potential of the log instructions to aid anomaly detection. Section III introduces ADLILog. Section IV gives the experimental results. Section V discusses the related work. Section VI concludes the paper and gives directions for future work.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: constantly generated in large volumes (e.g., up to several TB per day ).
