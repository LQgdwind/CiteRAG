A well-established approach to finding such representatives from databases\nis the skyline operator \nbased on the concept of domination: a tuple p𝑝p dominates a tuple q𝑞q iff\np𝑝p is as good as q𝑞q on all attributes and strictly better than q𝑞q on at least one attribute.\nFor a given database, a skyline query returns its Pareto-optimal subset which\nconsists of all tuples that are not dominated by any tuple.\nIt is guaranteed that any user can find her/his best choice from the skyline\nbecause the top-ranked result according to any monotone function must not be dominated.\nUnfortunately, although skyline queries are effective for representing low-dimensional databases,\ntheir result sizes cannot be controlled\nand increase rapidly as the dimensionality (i.e., number of attributes in a tuple) grows,\nparticularly so for databases with anti-correlated attributes. Recently, the k𝑘k-regret minimizing set (k𝑘k-RMS)\nproblem     0 1 2 3\nwas proposed to alleviate the deficiency of skyline queries.\nSpecifically, given a database P𝑃P of tuples with d𝑑d numeric attributes,\nthe k𝑘k-RMS problem aims to find a subset Q⊆P𝑄𝑃Q\\subseteq P such that, for any possible utility function,\nthe top-111 tuple in Q𝑄Q can approximate the top-k𝑘k tuples in P𝑃P within a small error.\nHere, the maximum k𝑘k-regret ratio  (𝚖𝚛𝚛ksubscript𝚖𝚛𝚛𝑘\\mathtt{mrr}_{k})\nis used to measure how well Q𝑄Q can represent P𝑃P.\nFor a utility function f𝑓f, the k𝑘k-regret ratio (𝚛𝚛ksubscript𝚛𝚛𝑘\\mathtt{rr}_{k}) of Q𝑄Q over P𝑃P\nis defined to be 00 if the top-111 tuple in Q𝑄Q is among the top-k𝑘k tuples in P𝑃P w.r.t. f𝑓f,\nor otherwise, to be one minus the ratio between the score of the top-111 tuple in Q𝑄Q\nand the score of the k𝑘kth-ranked tuple in P𝑃P w.r.t. f𝑓f.\nThen, the maximum k𝑘k-regret ratio (𝚖𝚛𝚛ksubscript𝚖𝚛𝚛𝑘\\mathtt{mrr}_{k}) is\ndefined by the maximum of 𝚛𝚛ksubscript𝚛𝚛𝑘\\mathtt{rr}_{k} over a class of (possibly infinite) utility functions.\nGiven a positive integer r𝑟r,\na k𝑘k-RMS on a database P𝑃P returns a subset Q⊆P𝑄𝑃Q\\subseteq P of size r𝑟r to minimize 𝚖𝚛𝚛ksubscript𝚖𝚛𝚛𝑘\\mathtt{mrr}_{k}.\nAs an illustrative example, the website could run a k𝑘k-RMS on all available hotels to\npick a set of r𝑟r candidates from which all users can find at least one close to her/his top-k𝑘k choices. The k𝑘k-RMS problem has been extensively studied recently.\nTheoretically, it is\nNP-hard   0\non any database with d≥3𝑑3d\\geq 3.\nIn general, we categorize existing k𝑘k-RMS algorithms into three types.\nThe first type is dynamic programming\nalgorithms 1  0\nfor k𝑘k-RMS on two-dimensional data.\nAlthough they can provide optimal solutions when d=2𝑑2d=2,\nthey are not suitable for higher dimensions due to the NP-hardness of k𝑘k-RMS.\nThe second type is the greedy\nheuristic   ,\nwhich always adds a tuple that maximally reduces 𝚖𝚛𝚛ksubscript𝚖𝚛𝚛𝑘\\mathtt{mrr}_{k} at each iteration.\nAlthough these algorithms can provide high-quality results empirically,\nthey have no theoretical guarantee and suffer from low efficiency on high-dimensional data.\nThe third type is to transform k𝑘k-RMS into another problem\nsuch as ε𝜀\\varepsilon-kernel 3 2  0,\ndiscretized matrix min-max 1,\nhitting set 2 ,\nand k𝑘k-medoid clustering 4,\nand then to utilize existing solutions of the transformed problem for k𝑘k-RMS computation.\nAlthough these algorithms are more efficient than greedy heuristics while having theoretical bounds,\nthey are designed for the static setting and\ncannot process database updates efficiently.\nTypically, most of them precompute the skyline as an input to compute the result of\nk𝑘k-RMS. Once a tuple insertion or deletion triggers any change in the skyline,\nthey are unable to maintain the result without re-running from scratch.\nHence, existing k𝑘k-RMS algorithms become very inefficient in highly dynamic environments\nwhere tuples in the databases are frequently inserted and deleted.\nHowever, dynamic databases are very common in real-world scenarios, especially for online services.\nFor example, in a hotel booking system,\nthe prices and availabilities of rooms are frequently changed over time.\nAs another example, in an IoT network,\na large number of sensors may often connect or disconnect with the server.\nMoreover, sensors also update their statistics regularly.\nTherefore, it is essential to address the problem of maintaining an up-to-date\nresult for k𝑘k-RMS when the database is frequently updated. In this paper, we propose the first fully-dynamic k𝑘k-RMS algorithm that\ncan efficiently maintain the result of k𝑘k-RMS w.r.t. any tuple\ninsertion and deletion in the database with both theoretical guarantee and good empirical performance.\nOur main contributions are summarized as follows. We formally define the notion of maximum k𝑘k-regret ratio\nand the k𝑘k-regret minimizing set (k𝑘k-RMS) problem in a fully-dynamic setting.\n(Section II) We propose the first fully-dynamic algorithm called FD-RMS\nto maintain the k𝑘k-RMS result over tuple insertions and deletions in a database.\nOur basic idea is to transform fully-dynamic k𝑘k-RMS into\na dynamic set cover problem. Specifically, FD-RMS computes the (approximate)\ntop-k𝑘k tuples for a set of randomly sampled utility functions\nand builds a set system based on the top-k𝑘k results.\nThen, the k𝑘k-RMS result can be retrieved from an approximate solution\nfor set cover on the set system.\nFurthermore, we devise a novel algorithm for dynamic set cover by introducing\nthe notion of stable solution,\nwhich is used to efficiently update the k𝑘k-RMS result\nwhenever an insertion or deletion triggers some changes\nin top-k𝑘k results as well as the set system.\nWe also provide detailed theoretical analyses of FD-RMS.\n(Section III) We conduct extensive experiments on several real-world and synthetic datasets\nto evaluate the performance of FD-RMS.\nThe results show that FD-RMS achieves up to four orders of magnitude speedup over existing\nk𝑘k-RMS algorithms while providing results of nearly equal quality in a fully dynamic setting.\n(Section IV)\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: In many real-world applications such as multi-criteria decision\nmaking ,\nweb search ,\nrecommendation [ref]3 ,\nand data description [ref]5,\nit is crucial to find a succinct representative subset from a large database\nto meet the requirements of various users.\nFor example, when a user queries for a\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
