      "content": "Paper Title: Transferable Interactiveness Knowledge for Human-Object Interaction Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe mainly adopt three HOI datasets: HICO-DET , V-COCO  and HAKE . HICO-DET  includes 47,776 images (38,118 in train set and 9,658 in test set), 600 HOI categories on 80 object categories (same with  [ref]47) and 117 verbs, and provides more than 150k annotated human-object pairs. V-COCO  provides 10,346 images (2,533 for training, 2,867 for validating and 4,946 for testing) and 16,199 person instances. Each person has annotations for 29 action categories (five of them have no paired object).\nThe objects are divided into two types: “object” and “instrument”. HAKE  provides 118K+ images, which include 285K human instances, 250K interacted objects, and 724K HOI pairs with human body part states [ref]5. The abundance of HOI samples can help our model achieve better performance on interactiveness discrimination. PaStaNet-HOI \nTo better evaluate our method, we re-split HAKE  and construct a much larger benchmark: PaStaNet-HOI. It provides 110K+ images (77,260 images in train set, 11,298 images in validation set, and 22,156 images in test set). Compared with HICO-DET , PaStaNet-HOI dataset has much larger train and test sets. The interaction categories are similar to the settings of HICO-DET , but we exclude the 80 “non-interaction” categories and only define 520 HOI categories. This can help to alleviate the annotation missing problem in HICO-DET . Metrics. We follow the settings adopted in , i.e., a prediction is a true positive only when the human and object bounding boxes both have IoU larger than 0.5 with reference to ground truth, and the HOI classification result is accurate. The role mean average precision  is used to measure the performance. Additionally, we measure the interactiveness detection in a similar setting. The only difference is that HOI classification is multi-label while the interactiveness classification is binary.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: We mainly adopt three HOI datasets: HICO-DET , V-COCO  and HAKE .
