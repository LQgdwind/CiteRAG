      "content": "Paper Title: Heuristics for Vehicle Routing Problem: A Survey and Recent Advances\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDespite the popularity of vehicle routing heuristics, designing an efficient heuristic consumes a large amount of time, and requires extensive expert knowledge. Automatic algorithm design (AAD) , also termed as hyper-heuristics [ref]36  or automatic design of heuristics , is used to tackle the challenge. It is able to automatically design a problem-tailored algorithm with the help of the knowledge learned from offline or online data. The works along this line of automatic heuristic design can be categorized into three levels: Automatic algorithm configuration focuses on automatically tuning the parameters of algorithms. Adjusting the weights of the ruin and recreate operations in ALNS  can be regarded as an online configuration. The online configuration can be found in many other heuristics. For example, a self-tuning heuristics, which dynamically tunes the parameters of the local search method during the optimization process, was proposed in . It was validated to be effective on the tested multiobjective routing problems.  designed decision rules to predict solution quality to adaptively guide the search neighborhood of a tabu algorithm. [ref]200 adaptively adjusted the population size, the child solution size, and the selection method in a memetic algorithm framework and satisfying results were observed on VRPTW instances. More recently,  used reinforcement learning to select the improvement heuristics. There are also offline approaches such as  used different tuning methods to configure the local search framework proposed in  and verify the advantages of automatic configuration. Different from configuring the parameters for a fixed algorithm framework, automatic algorithm selection chooses the most suitable algorithm from a bunch of alternatives. These works typically utilize a class of classical heuristics and apply machine learning techniques to select the best algorithm.  used an online heuristic selection technique that uses a dynamic multi-armed bandit with an extreme value-based reward to choose the best heuristic to use at each iteration. The results are demonstrated on various combinatorial optimization problems including dynamic VRP.  built both classification and regression models using artificial neural networks to select the best algorithm for dynamic VRPs.  used meta-learning to train a classifier to select the algorithm. It achieved an accuracy of more than 50% in selecting the best algorithm and generated the best average performance compared to the four heuristic algorithms.  created a new group of graph features to extract the hidden information. The experiments were carried out on real-world test instances and the method was used to predict the best algorithm from six heuristic algorithms. The results outperformed other algorithm selection methods for VRPs and the effectiveness of the new features was verified. Automatic algorithm composition builds the algorithm from algorithmic components rather than using existing algorithm framework . This component-based approach outperforms other approaches in the flexibility of constructing algorithms and the ability to generate novel algorithms. To our best knowledge, there is no method specially developed for VRP. Several related works can be found on other combinatorial optimization problems. For example,  proposed an algorithm composition method based on a multiobjective ant colony algorithm for TSP.  and  designed iterated greedy algorithm and simulated annealing for flow shop problems. Recently, more general frameworks are developed. Typical works include a component-wise framework AutoEMOA  for multiobjective optimization and a general local search algorithm design framework AutoGCOP  for combinatorial optimization. The success of the learning process in AAD depends on the problem features. Various vehicle routing features have been used in the past decades. The most commonly-used and easy-to-generate features are the geometric features . The second category of features is probing features  , which are the measurements of the behavior of some simple heuristics on the test set. The probing features reflect additional landscape information of the corresponding search heuristics compared to the basic problem features. Except for the geometric and probing features,  recently presented the first attempt to use graph features, which are extracted using deep learning techniques, for automatic vehicle routing algorithm selection. For future works, as we’ve mentioned, despite the existence of several general-purpose combinatorial optimization solvers  , a composition-based automatic heuristic design method specifically for vehicle routing is still lacking. Additionally, new ways of extracting problem features are waiting to be applied. Except for the classical geometric features, deep learning  and landscape analysis techniques , which can dig deeper and optimization-related information, are some promising approaches that have been rarely studied yet.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: routing heuristics, designing an efficient heuristic consumes a large amount of time, and requires extensive expert knowledge.
