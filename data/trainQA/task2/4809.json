      "content": "Paper Title: Boosting Adversarial Robustness From The Perspective of Effective Margin Regularization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAdversarial Defense. The standard way to train an adversarially robust DNN is to use adversarial training [ref]33. The clean examples are deliberately perturbed to approach the desired margin distance, so that the effective margin is produced during training.\nBased on adversarial training, regularization approaches are proposed to learn a DNN with desired properties. [ref]41 proposes to regularize the norm of the loss gradient with respect to input (IGR). In contrast, our work proposes to regularize the gradient of logit with respect to input to maximize the effective margin. Locally Linear Regularization (LLR)  is proposed to learn a more linear loss function at each training sample, while our paper controls the local logit functionâ€™s weight norm for training samples. Hypersphere embedding (HE)  proposes to normalize the features and classification layer to alleviate the influence of weight norms. In our empirical study, we demonstrate that EMR achieves better robustness than IGR and HE on large-scale neural networks. Margin Regularization. The hinge loss [ref]7 is a classical loss to induce a large margin in SVM [ref]7. On DNNs, several losses are proposed to induce large margins, such as\nLarge-Margin Softmax , A-Softmax  and AM-Softmax\n. These large-margin losses still have problems to learn large effective margins since the scale of features and weights affects the loss values. On both MLP and CNN, we demonstrate that training with L-Softmax loss improves the effective margin compared with the standard cross-entropy loss, while EMR learns a larger effective margin than L-Softmax since EMR considers the scale problem in the loss function.   study the normalized margin of homogeneous DNNs trained with gradient descent from a theoretical perspective and prove that the normalized margin is maximized by the gradient descent. Our work empirically investigates the normalized margin in DNNs trained with stochastic gradient descent and its influence on the adversarial robustness. We show that by controlling the effective weight norm and increasing the effective margin, the adversarial robustness can be improved over vanilla training with SGD and WD. The attack method DeepFool  moves an input sample to cross its decision boundary by treating the model as a linear classifier at each optimization step, which is related to the margin of a classifier. In contrast, our paper proposes to defend against adversarial attacks by increase the effective margin during training. We did not evaluate the DeepFool since it is not a standard attack method in adversarial defense literature  and our experiment shows that DeepFool is not as effective as PGD at attacking large-scale models. Max-Margin Adversarial training (MMA)  proposes to approximate the margin by pushing input samples to cross the classification boundary with PGD and recording the moved distance.\nIn contrast, EMR proposed to maximize the effective margin by regularizing the effective weight matrix norm, and can boost the adversarial robustness of both standard training and adversarial training. Since the performance of MMA is worse than vanilla PGD and TRADES according to AutoAttack benchmark , we do not include the comparison with MMA in the experiment.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: Adversarial Defense.
