      "content": "Paper Title: MS-DARTS: Mean-Shift Based Differentiable Architecture Search\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs aforementioned, DARTS-based methods are advantageous for their fast gradient-based architecture search, however the conversion from the found continuous architecture back to discrete one can cause significant performance drop.\nAlthough DARTS-based methods can reduce the validation loss in the training stage, it can still be unstable in terms of numerical blow-up in computing the final architecture evaluation [ref]11 .\nSuch instability is caused by the selection of SGD to train over-parameterized deep neural networks due to the problem of sharp minima . Sharp minima will make the found solution highly sensitive to perturbations (or noise) and have bad generalization due to their high over-fitting to training data [ref]37. In DARTS the problem of sharp minima of ℒv​a​l​i​dsubscriptℒ𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑑\\mathcal{L}_{valid} can explain why a small perturbation δ𝛿\\delta on an architecture A will cause a significant reduction of the validation accuracy (e.g., from over 90%percent\\% to less than 10 %percent\\% ). It becomes an open question whether escaping sharp minima can improve the generalization. In this paper, the proposed MS-based DARTS is a solution to address the above issue by smoothing out the landscape of ℒv​a​l​i​dsubscriptℒ𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑑{\\mathcal{L}_{valid}}. We compare a relevant work  using our formulation in the following. In , the optimal weight W∗​(𝑨)superscript𝑊𝑨W^{*}(\\boldsymbol{A}) in Eq.(1) is re-defined to be W¯​(𝑨)¯𝑊𝑨\\overline{W}(\\boldsymbol{A}) as: The best architecture 𝑨∗superscript𝑨\\boldsymbol{A}^{*} can then be obtained by solving Eq.(7) solves the robust optimization problem  minimizing the worst-case loss around a neighborhood of an architecture 𝑨𝑨\\boldsymbol{A}. In fact, at each sampled iteration, W𝑊W is re-estimated by changing the original architecture only once. However, this cannot provide enough a solution to flat the loss landscape of ℒt​r​a​i​nsubscriptℒ𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛\\mathcal{L}_{train}, which is crucial for stability control. In comparison, we propose MS-DARTS, the recursive update of the architecture 𝑨𝑨\\boldsymbol{A} with the mean-shift algorithm in Eq.(7) before minimizing ℒt​r​a​i​nsubscriptℒ𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛\\mathcal{L}_{train} can effectively smooth the landscape, such that better accuracy and stability can be obtained. One additional advantage of this recursive updating of 𝑨𝑨\\boldsymbol{A} is efficiency, since less iterations are needed to find W𝑊W by minimizing ℒt​r​a​i​nsubscriptℒ𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛\\mathcal{L}_{train}. In addition, MS-DARTS also can address the flatness of minima. During training, flatter minima [ref]37, and thus better stability in architecture performance.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: drop.\nAlthough DARTS-based methods can reduce the validation loss in the training stage, it can still be unstable in terms of numerical blow-up in computing the final architecture evaluation [ref]11 .\nSuch instability is caused by the selection of SGD to train over-parameterized deep neural networks due to the problem of sharp minima . Sharp minima will make the found solution highly\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
