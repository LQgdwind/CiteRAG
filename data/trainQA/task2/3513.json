      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Stochastic Dynamics with Statistics-Informed Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecurrent neural network (RNN) is a good candidate architecture for learning the unknown dynamics of a physical system since there is a natural correspondence between the recurrent internal structure of RNN and the time-recursive update rule that quantifies the dynamics. In this section, we discuss the universal approximation properties of RNN for stochastic processes, in particular, discrete stochastic processes corresponding to the numerical solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We consider a one-layer deterministic RNN with stochastic input and show that if the model is wide enough, i.e. has a large number of hidden states, it can accurately approximate the finite-difference scheme of a time-homogeneous Markovian SDEs driven by Gaussian white noise. We first review the universal approximation theorem (UAT) of RNN for deterministic dynamical systems established by Schäfer and Zimmermann in . To this end, let us consider a one-layer RNN model given by the update rule: where st∈ℝHsubscript𝑠𝑡superscriptℝ𝐻s_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{H} is the state vector of the RNN, xt∈ℝIsubscript𝑥𝑡superscriptℝ𝐼x_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{I} is the input, σ𝜎\\sigma is the activation function of the network, and yt∈ℝNsubscript𝑦𝑡superscriptℝ𝑁y_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N} is the output. The modeling parameters of this simple, one-layer RNN are the weight matrices A∈ℝH×H𝐴superscriptℝ𝐻𝐻A\\in\\mathbb{R}^{H\\times H}, B∈ℝH×I𝐵superscriptℝ𝐻𝐼B\\in\\mathbb{R}^{H\\times I}, C∈ℝN×H𝐶superscriptℝ𝑁𝐻C\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times H}, and the bias vector θ∈ℝH𝜃superscriptℝ𝐻\\theta\\in\\mathbb{R}^{H}. An immediate observation is that this update rule is very similar to the structure of a discrete, open dynamical system of the form: where st∈ℝJsubscript𝑠𝑡superscriptℝ𝐽s_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{J}, xt∈ℝIsubscript𝑥𝑡superscriptℝ𝐼x_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{I}, yt∈ℝNsubscript𝑦𝑡superscriptℝ𝑁y_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N}, and the functions g​(⋅):ℝJ×ℝI→ℝJ:𝑔⋅→superscriptℝ𝐽superscriptℝ𝐼superscriptℝ𝐽g(\\cdot):\\mathbb{R}^{J}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{I}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{J}, h​(⋅):ℝJ→ℝN:ℎ⋅→superscriptℝ𝐽superscriptℝ𝑁h(\\cdot):\\mathbb{R}^{J}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{N}. In fact, Schäfer and Zimmermann in  proved that a one-layer RNN with update rule (3) can universally approximate the dynamics of open dynamical system (4) with arbitrary accuracy. Their result can be restated as: (Schäfer & Zimmermann , UAT for the deterministic RNN). Let g​(⋅):ℝJ×ℝI→ℝJ:𝑔⋅→superscriptℝ𝐽superscriptℝ𝐼superscriptℝ𝐽g(\\cdot):\\mathbb{R}^{J}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{I}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{J} be measurable and h​(⋅):ℝJ→ℝN:ℎ⋅→superscriptℝ𝐽superscriptℝ𝑁h(\\cdot):\\mathbb{R}^{J}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{N} be continuous, the external input xt∈ℝIsubscript𝑥𝑡superscriptℝ𝐼x_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{I}, the inner state st∈ℝJsubscript𝑠𝑡superscriptℝ𝐽s_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{J}, and the outputs yt∈ℝNsubscript𝑦𝑡superscriptℝ𝑁y_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N} (t=1,⋯,T)𝑡1⋯𝑇(t=1,\\cdots,T). Then any discrete, open dynamical system of form (4) can be approximated by an RNN model of type (3) to an arbitrary accuracy. The exact definition of an RNN model of type (3) and the meaning of the arbitrarily accurate approximation are provided in Appendix A.\nThe proof of this theorem was established based on the UAT for the feedforward neural networks. Here we mention some key points of Theorem 1. The state vector st∈ℝJsubscript𝑠𝑡superscriptℝ𝐽s_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{J} in the dynamical system (4) is not the same as the state vector st∈ℝHsubscript𝑠𝑡superscriptℝ𝐻s_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{H} in RNN (3). In fact, to guarantee the accuracy of the approximation, there normally is an enlargement of the state space in RNN, i.e. H>J𝐻𝐽H>J. This has also to do with the next point. The universal approximation is in the sense of matching the input xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x_{t} and the output ytsubscript𝑦𝑡y_{t}. This means that with the exact same input xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x_{t}, the output ytsubscript𝑦𝑡y_{t} of the RNN should match closely with the output ytsubscript𝑦𝑡y_{t} of the dynamical system, while the state vectors stsubscript𝑠𝑡s_{t} of these two systems may be different. The UAT assumes finite-step input/output, i.e. T<+∞𝑇T<+\\infty. The above UAT clearly indicates that even with a simple architecture such as the one-layer RNN, one can universally approximate any open dynamical system of the general form (4). However, the theorem itself provides little guidance on how to construct such an RNN model for a specific dynamical system. In practice, we rarely use a wide-enough RNN to complete the computing task. Nevertheless, the theorem indubitably shows the potential of the RNN architecture in modeling/learning dynamical systems. We now show that a similar UAT holds for the resulting stochastic RNN by simply replacing the input vector xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x_{t} with i.i.d. Gaussian random variables while leaving all other structures unchanged. This result can be stated as: (UAT for RNN with Gaussian inputs). Let g​(⋅):ℝM×ℝI→ℝM:𝑔⋅→superscriptℝ𝑀superscriptℝ𝐼superscriptℝ𝑀g(\\cdot):\\mathbb{R}^{M}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{I}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{M} be locally Lipschitz and h​(⋅):ℝM→ℝN:ℎ⋅→superscriptℝ𝑀superscriptℝ𝑁h(\\cdot):\\mathbb{R}^{M}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{N} be continuous, the external input xt∈ℝIsubscript𝑥𝑡superscriptℝ𝐼x_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{I} be i.i.d. Gaussian random variables, the state vector st∈ℝMsubscript𝑠𝑡superscriptℝ𝑀s_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{M}, and the outputs yt∈ℝNsubscript𝑦𝑡superscriptℝ𝑁y_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N} (t=1,⋯,T)𝑡1⋯𝑇(t=1,\\cdots,T). Then any discrete, stochastic dynamical system of form (4) can be pathwisely approximated to an arbitrary accuracy by an RNN model of type (3) asymptotically almost surely. A mathematically rigorous statement of Proposition 1 is given as Theorem 3 in Appendix A, which can be proved using a probabilistic variant of the method proposed by Schäfer and Zimmermann . The detailed proof is rather technical, hence will also be deferred to Appendix A. An intuitive explanation of why the probability of finding a suitable RNN that approximates (4) is only asymptotically 1 is that the key estimate which leads to Schäfer and Zimmermann’s deterministic UAT (Theorem 1 in Appendix A) is based on the fact that the finite-step input vector xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x_{t} can be bounded in a compact domain of ℝIsuperscriptℝ𝐼\\mathbb{R}^{I}. Since the Gaussian random input xt∈ℝIsubscript𝑥𝑡superscriptℝ𝐼x_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{I} is not compactly supported, but only asymptotically compactly supported, we can only find its universal approximation asymptotically almost surely. This discussion also implies the following corollary: (UAT for RNN with compactly supported stochastic input). Let g​(⋅):ℝM×ℝI→ℝM:𝑔⋅→superscriptℝ𝑀superscriptℝ𝐼superscriptℝ𝑀g(\\cdot):\\mathbb{R}^{M}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{I}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{M} be continuously differentiable, h​(⋅):ℝM→ℝN:ℎ⋅→superscriptℝ𝑀superscriptℝ𝑁h(\\cdot):\\mathbb{R}^{M}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{N} be continuous, the external input xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x_{t} be i.i.d. random variables with compact support, the inner state st∈ℝMsubscript𝑠𝑡superscriptℝ𝑀s_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{M}, and the outputs yt∈ℝNsubscript𝑦𝑡superscriptℝ𝑁y_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N} (t=1,⋯,T)𝑡1⋯𝑇(t=1,\\cdots,T). Then any discrete, stochastic dynamical system of form (4) can be pathwisely approximated to an arbitrary accuracy by an RNN model of type (3) almost surely. The proof is easy to obtain following the above arguments and Appendix A.\n∎ As an example, consider i.i.d. stochastic input xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x_{t} being uniformly distributed in [a,b]Isuperscript𝑎𝑏𝐼[a,b]^{I}. Then, with probability 1 one can find an RNN model of type (3) that accurately approximates open stochastic dynamics (4). For the proposed RNN with stochastic inputs, what the RNN learns is the deterministic update rule that matches the input xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x_{t} with the output ytsubscript𝑦𝑡y_{t}. This is the fundamental reason why the proof of the UAT for RNN with deterministic inputs can be modified to obtain the UAT for RNN with stochastic inputs. The above UATs for RNN with stochastic input can be immediately applied to address the learning and approximation problem of SDEs. Consider Itô’s diffusion on ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}: where b​(X​(t))∈ℝd𝑏𝑋𝑡superscriptℝ𝑑b(X(t))\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d} is the vector field, σ​(X​(t))∈ℝd×m𝜎𝑋𝑡superscriptℝ𝑑𝑚\\sigma(X(t))\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times m} is the diffusion matrix, and 𝒲​(t)∈ℝm𝒲𝑡superscriptℝ𝑚\\mathcal{W}(t)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m} is the standard Wiener process. Any (explicit) finite difference scheme corresponding to Itô’s diffusion can be written in the form of (4) with i.i.d. Gaussian input. For instance, the Euler–Maruyama scheme is given by where ξ​(t)𝜉𝑡\\xi(t) are i.i.d. standard normal random variables. For a fixed Δ​tΔ𝑡\\Delta t, (2) corresponds to the update rule for the state vector in (4) where xt=ξ​(t)subscript𝑥𝑡𝜉𝑡x_{t}=\\xi(t). Any phase space observables of the stochastic system yt=h​(Xt)subscript𝑦𝑡ℎsubscript𝑋𝑡y_{t}=h(X_{t}) can be the output. Under some mild conditions, the Euler–Maruyama scheme (2) is proven to be pathwise convergent to the exact solution of SDE (5) as Δ​t→0→Δ𝑡0\\Delta t\\rightarrow 0  [ref]36. With this result, we can actually obtain the following UAT for Itô’s diffusion: (UAT for the RNN approximation of Itô’s diffusion) Suppose b​(x)𝑏𝑥b(x) and σ​(x)𝜎𝑥\\sigma(x) are locally Lipschitz, then the exact solution in a finite time grid to Itô’s diffusion (5) can be pathwisely approximated to an arbitrary accuracy by an RNN model of the type (3) asymptotically almost surely, if we replace xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x_{t} by ξ​(t)𝜉𝑡\\xi(t). A formal statement of Proposition 3, i.e. Theorem 4, and its proof are again provided in Appendix A. Since any time-inhomogeneous SDE admits a time-homogeneous extended dynamics by choosing t=Y​(t)𝑡𝑌𝑡t=Y(t) as another state variable. Therefore, the universal approximation result naturally extends to time-inhomogeneous SDEs. Similarly, if a non-Markovian SDE admits a suitable embedded Markovian dynamics representation, one can approximate it with RNN model (3) by using the latter representation. As an example, consider the generalized Langevin equation (GLE) [ref]13 that is frequently used in the coarse-grained modeling of large-scale molecular systems: where q​(t)𝑞𝑡q(t), p​(t)𝑝𝑡p(t) are the effective position and momentum of a coarse-grained particle of unit mass, F​(q)𝐹𝑞F(q) is the effective potential energy force, f​(t)𝑓𝑡f(t) is the fluctuation force which is often assumed to be a colored Gaussian stochastic process, and the time autocorrelation function of f​(t)𝑓𝑡f(t) yields the memory kernel K​(t)=⟨f​(t)​f​(0)⟩𝐾𝑡delimited-⟨⟩𝑓𝑡𝑓0K(t)=\\langle f(t)f(0)\\rangle. GLE (7) is a non-Markovian stochastic system because of the time-convolution term ∫0tK​(t−s)​p​(s)​dssuperscriptsubscript0𝑡𝐾𝑡𝑠𝑝𝑠differential-d𝑠\\int_{0}^{t}K(t-s)\\,p(s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s. It is shown in [ref]13 and many recent works that for many molecular dynamical systems, GLE (7) for a coarse-grained particle often admits a Markovian embedded approximation: where the vector s𝑠s consists of auxiliary variables whose length depends on the order of approximation, and Z,B,Q𝑍𝐵𝑄Z,B,Q are the corresponding auxiliary matrices. For such Markovian embedded dynamics, the proposed RNN has the capacity to approximate its output q​(t)𝑞𝑡q(t) and p​(t)𝑝𝑡p(t) according to Proposition 3.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: can be the output.
