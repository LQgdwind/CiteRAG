A large number of pixel methods, such as SLIC¬†, VCells¬†, TurboPixel¬†3, and SEEDS¬†, employ clustering algorithms refining the clusterings until a convergence criterion is satisfied. SLIC, and variants such as SLIC0¬†, SNIC¬†, Manifold-SLIC¬†5, and Intrinsic Manifold-SLIC¬†6, are particularly popular due to their simplicity and high performance. Other algorithms, such as ERS¬†4 and Normalized Cuts¬†2, formulate the superpixel generation task as an optimization problem on a graph structure. It has been noted several times (e.g., in¬† 3 5) that the performance of superpixel algorithms degrades severely as noise levels increase. To address this issue,¬†3 proposes a Mahalanobis-based kùëòk-means variant (NR-SLIC). The Mahalanobis distance is also used in  and 1, which introduce a Gaussian mixture model (GMMSP) and a unimodular Gaussian generative model, respectively. Gaussian mixture models based on Bayesian or Normal-Inverse Wishart priors for the covariances are given in¬†7 8. Common to these approaches is that they consider Mahalanobis distances for both the pixels‚Äô spatial and color components. Their clusterings in 5D can be viewed as resulting from five-dimensional generalized balanced power diagrams (GBPDs)¬†[ref]4. As projections from 5D into 2D, their spatial cell boundaries are, however, rather irregular; see GMMSP and NR-SLIC in¬†Fig.¬†5. Our approach utilizes the Mahalanobis distance only for the spatial components of the pixels, resulting, as we will demonstrate, in two-dimensional GBPDs with smooth, quadratic cell boundaries.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: consider Mahalanobis distances for both the pixels‚Äô spatial and color components.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
