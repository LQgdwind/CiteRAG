      "content": "Paper Title: ABCP: Automatic Block-wise and Channel-wise Network Pruning via Joint Search\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, the deep learning methods are widely applied to machine learning tasks such as speech recognition , image processing , and structured output . However, the large computational costs of the deep learning models are unaffordable for many resource-constrained devices and make the inference very slow. To tackle these problems, a large number of approaches have been proposed  . Network pruning is a typical rule-based model compression method to reduce the redundant weights or structures in the network. There are two main types of network pruning: the non-structured pruning  and the structured pruning . Since the structured pruning methods utilize structures as the pruning units, such as channels [ref]8, blocks , groups  as well as both channels and blocks 0, so that the structured pruning is much more hardware-friendly than the non-structured pruning. Hence, most of the researchers tend to pay attention to structured model pruning currently, which is also the focus of this paper. Nevertheless, the existing structured pruning methods still have some problems. Firstly, fine-tuning the hyperparameters like the pruning threshold increases the workload and it is hard to prove which threshold is optimal [ref]8 . Secondly, the traditional rule-based pruning method always cannot reach a sufficient compression ratio with low accuracy loss. Finally, the iterative pruning has been recommended 01, making the “sparse training – pruning – fine-tuning” pipeline be processed several times, which is time-consuming. At present, the Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods which can automatically search the network structure have gained ground 2 3. In this way, the networks with promising performance can be obtained efficiently with little human labor. To this end, we attempt to combine NAS and network pruning to achieve an automated process for the model pruning tasks. Some recent works have introduced the NAS methods into the model pruning procedure. Since AMC 4 utilized the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to search each pruning ratio of each convolutional layer, several researchers realize the automated network pruning by DRL 5 or the evolutionary computation 6. However, most of these works 4 only prune the channels and even can not prune the channels of the layers which belong to the residual blocks, making a very limited compression. The depth reduction of the network (e.g. residual block pruning) is also required to achieve high model pruning rates. Meanwhile, the discrete search space in some works 7 also results in the confined compression ratio. In addition, the layers in the model are so sensitive to be pruned by different ratios that it is more suitable to utilize continuous search space. Therefore, we propose Automatic Block-wise and Channel-wise Network Pruning (ABCP) to jointly search the channel-wise and block-wise pruning action by DRL. The action of DRL is a list consisting of the pruning choice of each residual block and the channel pruning ratio of each convolutional layer. The reward for DRL takes both the accuracy and complexity of the pruned model into account. Specifically, we propose a joint sample algorithm to generate the block-wise and channel-wise pruning action. We combine the discrete space and continuous space to sample the block pruning choice and the layer pruning ratio respectively. In addition, we also offer another choice to use the discrete space for sampling the layer pruning ratio. The joint sample algorithm is trained by the policy gradient method 8. Extensive experiments suggest that ABCP has a very promising performance. We collect three datasets, two of them are proposed by ourselves for the fast and lightweights detection algorithm for the mobile robots, and the third is captured from the videos collected by University of California San Diego (UCSD). Based on these three datasets, we evaluate ABCP on YOLOv3 9. Results show that our method achieves better accuracy than the traditional rule-based pruning method with fewer floating point operations (FLOPs). Furthermore, the results also demonstrate that the pruned model via ABCP has much better robustness performance. To summarize, our contributions are listed as the following: We propose ABCP, a pipeline to jointly search the block-wise and channel-wise network pruning action by DRL. We propose a joint sample algorithm to jointly sample the pruning choice of each residual block and the channel pruning ratio of each convolutional layer from the discrete and continuous space respectively. We test ABCP on YOLOv3 9 based on three datasets. The results show that ABCP outperforms the traditional rule-based pruning methods. On the mobile robot detection dataset, the pruned model saves 99.5% FLOPs, reduces 99.5% parameters, and achieves 37.3×\\times speed up with only 2.8% mAP loss. On the sim2real detection dataset, the pruned model has better robustness performance, achieving 9.6% better mAP in the transfer task.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: There are two main types of network pruning: the non-structured pruning  and the structured pruning .
