      "content": "Paper Title: A Continuous Benchmarking Infrastructure for High-Performance Computing Applications\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nci is a common practice often among software engineers.\nIt involves teams of developers regularly contributing their changes to a shared codebase.\nEach contribution is integrated into the source code and the software is then automatically built, checked, and tested.\nThis ensures that errors are detected more quickly, and prevents each developer from having their own version of the software .\nIn practice, developers submit their code changes to a shared repository of a \\aclvcs.\nThis keeps track of all the changes and versions of the source code, and helps coordinate the integration of new contributions.\nGit  is a widely used \\aclvcs, and platforms such as GitLab  or GitHub  offer hosted Git repositories as a web service.\nThey also provide a graphical user interface in a web browser, bug trackers, and other features that make it easier for teams and communities to work together.\nAll of these platforms support \\aclci workflows so that each new version of the software can be automatically built, tested, and deployed. In scientific or \\achpc software, these software engineering principles have been used less frequently. There are various reasons for this, one of which could be that scientific software developers have an application background rather than a software engineering background.\nThis changed in the last decades as communities and initiatives like\n\\acbssw, de-RSE or SURESOFT [ref]43\nadvocate the use of the software engineering techniques for scientific software [ref]44 under the term \\aclrse.\nAnother initiative that has similar goals is \\acxSDK , which defines common interfaces, conventions and best practices\nfor extreme-scale scientific software.\nThis should provide the infrastructure that helps \\achpc software developers to write more sustainable, portable, maintainable, and interoperable codes.\nWell-known software packages that are part of the consortium are PETSc, Trilinos, Hypre[ref]47, and the GINKGO library.\nThus, nowadays the use of \\aclci tools that are offered by the \\aclvcs platforms is widely used for scientific software packages. As mentioned in the introduction, computational performance is an important aspect of scientific software used for large-scale simulations.\nIn some cases, it is also the aspect that is the subject of research.\nContinuous testing of performance in the target environment is also important.\nThus, the concept of \\aclci has been extended to \\aclcb. The concept of \\accb is visualized in Fig. 4.\nSimilar to other \\aclci applications, it means that with every change tracked by the \\aclvcs, the code gets automatically benchmarked.\nTo get meaningful results that yield insights about the production use of the software, these automatic benchmarks should run on \\iachpc system.\nVarious metrics, such as timings and hardware performance counters, are collected for analysis.\nThese metrics are subsequently stored for later review and comparison.\nFinally, they are visualized to provide feedback to the developers. With our \\accb pipeline, which we present in the Sec. 4, we aim to reduce the overhead for developers when running benchmarks on a \\achpc cluster.\nTherefore, we automate the benchmarking of specific code revisions on different hardware architectures or parameter configurations.\nThis would be tedious and time-consuming if done by manually.\nAdditionally, the collected results are stored in a structured manner and are visualised interactively.\nIn the short term, this provides developers with prompt feedback on how a code change impacts performance across various architectures or configurations.\nIn the long term, this allows for tracking of the evolution of performance and tracing of the impact of code changes on performance characteristics.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: software developers have an application background rather than a software engineering background.\nThis changed in the last decades as communities and initiatives like\n\\acbssw, de-RSE or SURESOFT [ref]43\nadvocate the use of the software engineering techniques for scientific software [ref]44 under the term \\aclrse.\nAnother initiative that has similar goals is \\acxSDK , which defines common\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
