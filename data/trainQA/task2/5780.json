      "content": "Paper Title: Better Understanding Differences in Attribution Methods via Systematic Evaluations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDataset and Architectures:\nWe run our experiments on VGG19 and Resnet152 trained on Imagenet6; similar results on other architectures and on CIFAR107 can be found in the supplement.\nFor each model, we separately select images from the validation set that were classified with a confidence score of at least 0.99. By only using highly confidently classified images1 5, we ensure that the features within each grid cell constitute positive evidence of its class for the model, and features outside it contain low positive evidence since they get confidently classified to a different class. Evaluation on GridPG, DiFull, and DiPart:\nWe evaluate on 2×2222\\mkern 1.25mu{\\times}\\mkern 1.25mu2 grids constructed by randomly sampling images from the set of confidently classified images (see above). Specifically, we generate 2000 attributions per method for each of GridPG, DiFull, and DiPart. For GridPG, we use images from distinct classes, while for DiFull and DiPart we use distinct classes except in the bottom right corner, where we use the same class as the top left. By repeating the same class twice, we can test whether an attribution method simply highlights class-related features, irrespective of them being used by the model.\nSince subimages are disconnected from the classification heads of other locations in DiFull and DiPart, the use of repeating classes does not change which regions should be attributed (Sec. 3.1.2). Evaluation at Intermediate Layers:\nWe evaluate each method at the input (image), middle333We show a single intermediate layer to visualize trends from the input to the final layer; for results on all layers, see supplement.\n (Conv9 for VGG19, Conv3_x for Resnet152), and final spatial layer (Conv16 for VGG19, Conv5_x for Resnet152) of each network, see Sec. 3.3. Evaluating beyond the input layer leads to lower dimensional attribution maps, given by the dimensions of the activation maps at those layers.\nThus, as is common practice [ref]17, we upsample those maps to the dimensions of the image (448×448448448448\\times 448) using bilinear interpolation. Qualitative Evaluation on AggAtt:\nAs discussed, for AggAtt we use bins of unequal sizes (Sec. 3.2). In particular, we bin the attribution maps into the following percentile ranges: 0–2%, 2–5%, 5–50%, 50–95%, 95–98%, and 98–100%; cf. Fig. 1. Further, in our experiments we evaluate the attributions for classes at the top-left grid location. Attribution Methods:\nWe evaluate a diverse set of attribution methods, for an overview see Sec. 2. As discussed in Sec. 3.3, to apply those methods to intermediate network layers, we divide the full model into two virtual parts 𝐟presubscript𝐟pre\\mathbf{f}_{\\text{pre}} and 𝐟explainsubscript𝐟explain\\mathbf{f}_{\\text{explain}} and treat the output of 𝐟presubscript𝐟pre\\mathbf{f}_{\\text{pre}} as the input to 𝐟explainsubscript𝐟explain\\mathbf{f}_{\\text{explain}} to obtain importance attributions for those ‘pre-processed’ inputs. In particular, we evaluate the following methods.\nFrom the set of backpropagation-based methods, we evaluate on Guided Backpropagation , Gradient , IntGrad [ref]11, IxG , and LRP .\nFrom the set of activation-based methods, we evaluate on Grad-CAM [ref]17, Grad-CAM++ , Ablation-CAM , Score-CAM 0, and Layer-CAM 1.\nNote that in our framework, these methods can be regarded as using the classification head only (except 1) for 𝐟explainsubscript𝐟explain\\mathbf{f}_{\\text{explain}}, see Sec. 3.3. In order to evaluate them at earlier layers, we simply expand 𝐟explainsubscript𝐟explain\\mathbf{f}_{\\text{explain}} accordingly to include more network layers.\nFrom the set of perturbation-based methods, we evaluate Occlusion 4 and RISE 3. These are typically evaluated on the input layer, and measure output changes when perturbing (occluding) the input (Fig. 3, left).\nNote that Occlusion involves sliding an occlusion kernel of size K𝐾K with stride s𝑠s over the input.\nWe use K=16,s=8formulae-sequence𝐾16𝑠8K\\mkern 1.25mu{=}\\mkern 1.25mu16,s\\mkern 1.25mu{=}\\mkern 1.25mu8 for the input, and K=5,s=2formulae-sequence𝐾5𝑠2K\\mkern 1.25mu{=}\\mkern 1.25mu5,s\\mkern 1.25mu{=}\\mkern 1.25mu2 at the middle and final layers to account for the lower dimensionality of the feature maps.\nFor RISE, we use M=1000𝑀1000M\\mkern 1.25mu{=}\\mkern 1.25mu1000 random masks, generated separately for evaluations at different network layers. For LRP, following 5 8,\nwe primarily use a configuration that applies the ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-rule with ϵ=0.25italic-ϵ0.25\\epsilon\\mkern 1.25mu{=}\\mkern 1.25mu0.25 for the fully connected layers in the network, the z+superscript𝑧z^{+}-rule for the convolutional layers except the first convolutional layer, and the zℬsuperscript𝑧ℬz^{\\mathcal{B}}-rule for the first convolutional layer. We discuss the performance across other configurations, including the composite configuration proposed by , in Sec. 5.5. Note that since certain LRP rules, such as the z+superscript𝑧z^{+}-rule, are not implementation invariant ([ref]11), relevance may be distributed differently for functionally equivalent models. In particular, relevance propagation through batch normalization layers can be handled in multiple ways, such as by replacing them with 1×1111\\mkern 1.25mu{\\times}\\mkern 1.25mu1 convolutions or by merging them with adjacent linear layers. In our experiments, as in\n,\nbatch normalization layers are handled by merging them with adjacent convolutional or fully connected layers. We further discuss some ramifications of the lack of implementation invariance to attribution localization in Sec. 5.5 and the supplement.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: each network, see Sec. 3.3. Evaluating beyond the input layer leads to lower dimensional attribution maps, given by the dimensions of the activation maps at those layers.\nThus, as is common practice [ref]17, we upsample those maps to the dimensions of the image (448×448448448448\\times 448) using bilinear interpolation. Qualitative Evaluation on AggAtt:\nAs discussed, for AggAtt we use bins of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
