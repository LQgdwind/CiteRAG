      "content": "Paper Title: Do We Fully Understand Students’ Knowledge States? Identifying and Mitigating Answer Bias in Knowledge Tracing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has compelled millions of students to stay home and pursue their studies online in recent years.\nIn online learning environments, it is crucial to automatically assess students’ knowledge states, which refers to their mastery levels of various knowledge concepts, such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication in math .\nBy leveraging this functionality, it becomes possible to offer tailored learning experiences to students, including learning resource recommendation [ref]2, adaptive testing , and academic performance prediction . Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to track students’ evolving knowledge states through their engagement with concept-related questions  .\nAs shown in Fig. 1, students are presented with a sequence of questions related to a set of knowledge concepts and are required to provide answers to these questions.\nThroughout the learning process, a KT system dynamically assesses the students’ knowledge states over the concepts.\nIn the literature, KT is commonly framed as a sequence modeling problem and has been extensively investigated for decades  .\nWith the advent of deep learning, deep knowledge tracing (DKT)  was proposed to apply recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to capture the long-term dependencies among a student’s learning interactions.\nAfter that, more types of neural networks were developed for KT, such as the dynamic key-value memory networks (DKVMN) 0 and self-attentive knowledge tracing networks (AKT) 1. It is worth noting that the actual knowledge states of students during the learning process cannot be directly observed.\nTherefore, the performance of KT models needs to be indirectly evaluated by predicting how students will perform on future questions 2.\nThis is based on the underlying assumption that only by comprehending students’ knowledge states can we estimate their future responses.\nIn general, KT models  0 1 simplify the student-question interactions by assuming that students’ responses are binary, that is, they can either provide a correct or incorrect answer.\nHowever, we have observed a strong answer bias of questions, suggesting that there is often a significant imbalance between the number of correct and incorrect answers for each question.\nIn Fig. 2, we plot the percentage stacked area charts of correct and incorrect answers across various questions on three benchmark datasets for KT.\nThe charts reveal that most questions exhibit significantly imbalanced proportions.\nThe answer bias can be naturally explained in terms of the differences in difficulty between questions 3.\nNevertheless, it also provides a shortcut for achieving good prediction performance in KT.\nAfter a preliminary analysis, we found that blindly selecting the answer that occurs more frequently for each question yields a decent accuracy in testing, even without taking into account any of the students’ past learning interactions!\n In the face of such surprising results, we inevitably raise the issue: Do existing KT models heavily leverage the answer bias of questions to yield good prediction results?\nTo address the issue, we establish a new unbiased evaluation on top of benchmark datasets for KT, in which all students’ question-answering interactions in the test set are resampled in such a way that the distribution of correct and incorrect answers per question is balanced (see details in Section 3.3).\nFig. 3 displays the accuracy of DKT, DKVMN, and AKT on both the original biased test set and the new unbiased test set of different datasets.\nOur key finding is that the performance of all methods drops significantly when evaluated on the new unbiased test sets.\nThe finding suggests that the effectiveness of these state-of-the-art KT models largely stems from their capacity to memorize the strong answer bias of questions in the dataset.\nThis poses a significant problem because these models may create a misleading impression that they are advancing towards the goal of understanding students’ knowledge states in KT, whereas in reality, they are merely exploiting the answer bias to achieve a high prediction accuracy. One straightforward solution to mitigate answer bias is to balance the training set by resampling as well.\nHowever, resampling techniques may reduce the sample diversity for training and make models prone to overfitting.\nIn fact, the answer bias is hard to avoid when collecting real datasets for KT, and our focus should be how to build unbiased KT models under biased training.\nIn this paper, we approach the KT task from a causality perspective 4 5, which has not received sufficient attention in prior research.\nA causal graph 6 is first constructed to formulate the cause-effect relationships among the fundamental components in KT: a student S𝑆S, a question Q𝑄Q, the student’s knowledge state K𝐾K, and the student’s response R𝑅R.\nFrom the causal graph as shown in Fig. 4LABEL:sub@subfig:_SCM, we identify that the impact of answer bias lies in the direct causal effect of Q𝑄Q on R𝑅R and can be mitigated by subtracting this direct effect from the total causal effect.\nTo this end, we propose a novel COunterfactual REasoning (CORE) framework 7 8 for KT, which introduces two scenarios, i.e., the conventional KT and counterfactual KT, to estimate the total causal effect and direct causal effect, respectively.\nThe two scenarios can be described as follows: In the conventional KT scenario, a KT model predicts whether a student’s response R𝑅R to a question Q𝑄Q will be correct or not, if the model recognizes the student S𝑆S based on their past learning sequences, sees the question Q𝑄Q, and understands the knowledge state K𝐾K of S𝑆S regarding Q𝑄Q; In the counterfactual KT scenario, a KT model predicts what the student’s response R𝑅R would be, if the model only had access to Q𝑄Q, but had neither obtained S𝑆S nor understood K𝐾K. Intuitively, the conventional KT reflects the actual scenario in existing KT studies, where both S𝑆S and Q𝑄Q are available, and K𝐾K can be modeled by matching S𝑆S and Q𝑄Q 0.\nIn this case, we can estimate the total causal effect on R𝑅R.\nOn the other hand, the counterfactual KT involves an imaginary scenario, where S𝑆S and K𝐾K had not been accessible, and R𝑅R would be determined solely by Q𝑄Q.\nTherefore, the counterfactual KT allows for the estimation of the direct causal effect of Q𝑄Q on R𝑅R, which represents the pure impact of answer bias. Our CORE framework is model-agnostic, and we instantiate it based upon DKT , DKVMN 0, and AKT 1 models, respectively.\nDuring training, an ensemble model is developed to simulate the total causal effect, which consists of an existing KT model and additional network branches capturing the direct causal effects.\nThe training is performed with a multi-task learning objective, which provides supervision to the learning of different causal effects simultaneously 7 8.\nIn testing, CORE uses the debiased causal effect for inference, which is obtained by subtracting the direct effect related to answer bias from the total effect.\nExperimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that CORE outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by large margins in the unbiased evaluation for KT. In a nutshell, this work makes three main contributions: We introduce an unbiased evaluation for KT and reveal that the success of many existing models is largely driven by memorizing the answer bias of questions present in datasets, rather than by fully understanding students’ knowledge states. We identify the impact of answer bias as the direct causal effect of questions on students’ responses from a causality perspective, and propose a model-agnostic counterfactual reasoning framework CORE to eliminate the impact by making the debiased causal inference for KT. We instantiate CORE based upon different prevailing KT models and demonstrate its effectiveness and rationality on three benchmark datasets. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows:\nSection 2 reviews the related work.\nSection 3 provides a detailed analysis of the phenomenon of answer bias in KT.\nSection 4 presents our counterfactual reasoning framework that reduces the impact of answer bias for KT.\nExperimental results and analysis are reported in Section 5, followed by the conclusions in Section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: subtraction, and multiplication in math .\nBy leveraging this functionality, it becomes possible to offer tailored learning experiences to students, including learning resource recommendation [ref]2, adaptive testing , and academic performance prediction .
