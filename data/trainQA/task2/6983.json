Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

To be precise, this means using PSPNets  with different backbones as student and teacher models. The teacher model has a ResNet101  backbone and for the student we test a ResNet18 and an EfficientNet-B0  backbone. For simplicity we will refer to the two student models as ResNet and EffNet students.\nThe learning rate Œº‚Äã(i)ùúáùëñ\\mu(i) decays over training steps according to Eq. 4. Œ∑ùúÇ\\eta is the total number of training batches and i is the current batch.\nUnless otherwise stated the ResNet and EffNet student backbones are initialized with weights pre-trained on ImageNet. The pre-trained student weights were obtained from the torchvision package (v0.12) of the PyTorch library [ref]22 for both backbones and the teacher weights were taken from [ref]16 for Cityscapes and from [ref]42 for the other datasets. All experiments are conducted with a batch size of 8 and students are trained with crops of size 512√ó512512512512\\times 512 on Cityscapes and 473√ó473473473473\\times 473 on ADE20K and PascalVOC. All experimental results are calculated on the validation datasets of Cityscapes, PascalVOC and ADE20K.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: As most other relevant methods (Table 1), we follow the architectural setup and training procedure of SKD [ref]16.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
