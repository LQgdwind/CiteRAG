      "content": "Paper Title: Fine-tuned CLIP Models are Efficient Video Learners\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs training vision-language (VL) models on video-caption pairs is expensive, the availability of large-scale pretrained video VL models is limited. A reliable alternative explored in literature is adaptation of large-scale pretrained image-based VL models, such as CLIP , for video downstream tasks. Considering the modality gap, prior methods have explored the use of various specialized attention-based components that instill communication across frames and modules to integrate the information from multiple frames [ref]40 [ref]30 [ref]17. On the contrary, we explore the capability of a simple baseline called ViFi-CLIP (Video Fine-tuned CLIP) for adapting CLIP  to video domain. Fig. 3 illustrates an overview of the proposed baseline ViFi-CLIP. With the additional temporal information in videos, the important question is how to leverage this information into image-based CLIP model. We explore the capability of full fine-tuning of CLIP to bridge the modality gap in video domain. ViFi-CLIP fine-tunes both image and text encoder. Given a video sample Vi∈ℝT×H×W×Csubscript𝑉𝑖superscriptℝ𝑇𝐻𝑊𝐶V_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{T\\times H\\times W\\times C} with T𝑇T frames, and corresponding text label Y𝑌Y, the CLIP image encoder encodes the T𝑇T frames independently as a batch of images and produce frame level embeddings xi∈ℝT×Dsubscript𝑥𝑖superscriptℝ𝑇𝐷x_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{T\\times D}. These frame-level embeddings are average-pooled to obtain a video-level representation vi∈ℝDsubscript𝑣𝑖superscriptℝ𝐷v_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D}. We refer to this as temporal pooling as this operation implicitly incorporates temporal learning via aggregation of multiple frames. The CLIP text encoder encodes the class Y𝑌Y, wrapped in a prompt template such as ‘a photo of a <<category>>’ to produce text embedding t∈ℝD𝑡superscriptℝ𝐷t\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D}.\nFor a batch of videos, the cosine similarity sim(.)sim(.), between all the video-level embeddings visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} and the corresponding text embeddings tisubscript𝑡𝑖t_{i} is maximized to fine-tune the CLIP model via cross-entropy (CE) objective with a temperature parameter τ𝜏\\tau, Experimental setup:\nWe use ViT-B/16 based CLIP model for our experiments. For zero-shot, base-to-novel and few-shot settings, we use 32 sparsely sampled frames with single view evaluation. In fully supervised setting, we use 16 frames and multi-view inference with 4 spatial crops and 3 temporal views. We conduct our analysis on five action recognition benchmarks: Kinetics-400 and 600  , HMDB-51 , UCF-101  and Something Something V2 (SSv2) . See Appendix B and D for more details.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: gap, prior methods have explored the use of various specialized attention-based components that instill communication across frames and modules to integrate the information from multiple frames [ref]40 [ref]30 [ref]17.
