This is especially true for the new generation of MCU-class devices focusing on AI applications. In contrast to their predecessors, these MCUs feature multi-core compute clusters, DNN accelerators, and on-chip memory of up to 10¬†MiB/times10dividemebibyteabsent10\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{MiB}\\text{/}, split into multiple software-managed memory hierarchy levels¬† [ref]27 . To optimally leverage the compute capabilities of such complex systems, network deployment must simultaneously optimize the execution schedule and tiling of operators and orchestrate overlapping memory transfers using DMAs to achieve low data marshaling overheads and high compute utilization.\nWhile modern top-down compilers like MLIR and TVM¬†  allow integration of most common Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs) and accelerator APIs, their focus is not on meeting the stringent memory constraints of this class of tinyML devices.\nPrior work like Dory¬†[ref]28, CoSa¬†, and others have addressed these challenges for CNNs by focusing on operator tiling to fit the target‚Äôs memory constraints. However, these approaches assume a single-cluster memory hierarchy, with undivided memory at each level, and a simple lifetime model for network tensors, which are fundamentally stateless across inference rounds. These simplifying assumptions do not hold for complex heterogeneous multi-accelerator hardware and advanced SLM networks¬† . Moving beyond these prior works, we propose a novel constraint programming algorithm that enables co-optimizing tiling and memory allocation, which overcomes the limitations of previous approaches by supporting data flows with complex lifetimes (e.g. K‚ÄãVùêæùëâKV caching) as required by EFMs.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: compute clusters, DNN accelerators, and on-chip memory of up to 10¬†MiB/times10dividemebibyteabsent10\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{MiB}\\text{/}, split into multiple software-managed memory hierarchy levels¬† [ref]27 .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
