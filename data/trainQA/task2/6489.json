Our emphasis here is on the practical implications of each result. For more details, we refer the reader to the cited papers. The Trace Ratio Problem.\nMin​𝐔T​△​𝐔Minsuperscript𝐔𝑇△𝐔\\text{Min}\\;\\mathbf{U}^{T}\\triangle\\mathbf{U} is achieved by 𝐕n×psubscript𝐕𝑛𝑝\\mathbf{V}_{n\\times p} whose p𝑝p columns are given by the eigenvectors of the p𝑝p smallest eigenvalues λ1≤λ2≤…≤λpsubscript𝜆1subscript𝜆2…subscript𝜆𝑝\\lambda_{1}\\leq\\lambda_{2}\\leq\\ldots\\leq\\lambda_{p} of the Laplacian △△\\triangle. Then, Tr​[𝐕T​△​𝐕]=λ2+…+λpTrdelimited-[]superscript𝐕𝑇△𝐕subscript𝜆2…subscript𝜆𝑝\\text{Tr}[\\mathbf{V}^{T}\\triangle\\mathbf{V}]=\\lambda_{2}+\\ldots+\\lambda_{p}, when the graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) with adjacency matrix 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} is connected. However, 𝐕𝐕\\mathbf{V} does not necessarily minimize Tr​[𝐕T​𝐃𝐕]Trdelimited-[]superscript𝐕𝑇𝐃𝐕\\text{Tr}[\\mathbf{V}^{T}\\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{V}]. As a result, we have that where d1≤d2≤…≤dnsubscript𝑑1subscript𝑑2…subscript𝑑𝑛d_{1}\\leq d_{2}\\leq\\ldots\\leq d_{n} are the sorted degrees. As a result, we have the following bounds: The definition of ρ∗superscript𝜌∗\\rho^{\\ast} plays a key role in the original trace-ratio optimization. Following [ref]28, such a problem is formulated in scalar terms, i.e. in terms of finding Actually, for ρ∗superscript𝜌∗\\rho^{\\ast} we have have that Therefore, the trace-ratio problem can be solved by alternating two updating steps: : Given ρ𝜌\\rho, apply the Lanczos method to obtain the p𝑝p largest eigenvalues of the transition matrix 𝐏−ρ​𝐃𝐏𝜌𝐃\\mathbf{P}-\\rho\\mathbf{D} (the smallest of △−ρ​𝐃△𝜌𝐃\\triangle-\\rho\\mathbf{D}) and their associated eigenvectors 𝐔𝐔\\mathbf{U}. : Given the current eigenvectors 𝐔𝐔\\mathbf{U}, update ρ=Tr​[𝐔T​△​𝐔]Tr​[𝐔T​𝐃𝐔]𝜌Trdelimited-[]superscript𝐔𝑇△𝐔Trdelimited-[]superscript𝐔𝑇𝐃𝐔\\rho=\\frac{\\text{Tr}[\\mathbf{U}^{T}\\triangle\\mathbf{U}]}{\\text{Tr}[\\mathbf{U}^{T}\\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{U}]} In the above process, the update of 𝐔𝐔\\mathbf{U} ensures the orthogonality constraint. The Trace Ratio and SGD.\nHowever, solving the trace-ratio problem through gradient descent drives us to a different solution from the eigenvectors of △−ρ∗​𝐃△superscript𝜌∗𝐃\\triangle-\\rho^{\\ast}\\mathbf{D}. For instance, consider the Dirichlet loss ℒD=Tr​[𝐔T​△​𝐔]Tr​[𝐔T​𝐃𝐔]subscriptℒ𝐷Trdelimited-[]superscript𝐔𝑇△𝐔Trdelimited-[]superscript𝐔𝑇𝐃𝐔{\\cal L}_{D}=\\frac{\\text{Tr}[\\mathbf{U}^{T}\\triangle\\mathbf{U}]}{\\text{Tr}[\\mathbf{U}^{T}\\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{U}]}. Then, its gradient (supposing that the orthogonality is enforced by a complementary loss) is given by: Therefore, ∇ℒD=0∇subscriptℒ𝐷0{\\nabla{\\cal L}_{D}}=0 implies △​𝐔=ρ∗​𝐃𝐔△𝐔superscript𝜌∗𝐃𝐔\\triangle\\mathbf{U}=\\rho^{\\ast}\\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{U}, where ρ∗→0→superscript𝜌∗0\\rho^{\\ast}\\rightarrow 0 is the asymptotic value of the trace ratio. As a result, we have that the optimal 𝐔𝐔\\mathbf{U} satisfy △~​𝐔=ρ∗​𝐔~△𝐔superscript𝜌∗𝐔\\tilde{\\triangle}\\mathbf{U}=\\rho^{\\ast}\\mathbf{U}, i.e. the gradient descent converges to the (orthonormal) functions of the normalized Laplacian △~~△\\tilde{\\triangle} associated with the value ρ∗superscript𝜌∗\\rho^{\\ast}. However, as ρ∗superscript𝜌∗\\rho^{\\ast} is not necessarily an eigenvalue of △~~△\\tilde{\\triangle}, but it is close to the Fiedler value λ2subscript𝜆2\\lambda_{2}, we denote 𝐔𝐔\\mathbf{U} as a Fiedler environment. It is an environment since the p𝑝p columns 𝐮:jsubscript𝐮:absent𝑗\\mathbf{u}_{:j} are mutually orthonormal and close to the Fiedler vector ϕ2subscriptitalic-ϕ2\\phi_{2} insofar their Dirichlet energies ρj∗=𝐮:jT​△~​𝐮:jsubscriptsuperscript𝜌∗𝑗superscriptsubscript𝐮:absent𝑗𝑇~△subscript𝐮:absent𝑗\\rho^{\\ast}_{j}={\\mathbf{u}_{:j}}^{T}\\tilde{\\triangle}\\mathbf{u}_{:j} satisfy |λ2−ρj∗|<ϵsubscript𝜆2subscriptsuperscript𝜌∗𝑗italic-ϵ|\\lambda_{2}-\\rho^{\\ast}_{j}|<\\epsilon with ϵ→0→italic-ϵ0\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0 (Theorem 4.1). In our experiments, we have chosen the trace-ratio formulation because: It leads an implicit normalization of the gradient ∇ℒD∇subscriptℒ𝐷{\\nabla{\\cal L}_{D}}, namely Tr​[𝐔T​𝐃𝐔]Trdelimited-[]superscript𝐔𝑇𝐃𝐔\\text{Tr}[\\mathbf{U}^{T}\\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{U}]. The gradient is more structured when we apply the constrain 𝐔=fθ​(𝐀)𝐔subscript𝑓𝜃𝐀\\mathbf{U}=f_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{A}), where 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} is the adjacency matrix. Regarding a), our implicit normalization alleviates the problem of landing in local minima due to the orthonormalization constraint (that we also enforce in the global loss). As noted , constraints of the form 𝐔T​𝐔=𝐈superscript𝐔𝑇𝐔𝐈\\mathbf{U}^{T}\\mathbf{U}=\\mathbf{I} define a Riemannian manifold and the trace problem s.t. them is not geodesically convex. In [ref]49 this is addressed by introducing a Riemannian gradient and retraction normalization. However, our main gain in performance is achieved when we address b) via the joint effect of normalization and 𝐔=fθ​(𝐀)𝐔subscript𝑓𝜃𝐀\\mathbf{U}=f_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{A}). In our preliminary experiments, we compared the gradient when applying the constraint 𝐔=fθ​(𝐀)𝐔subscript𝑓𝜃𝐀\\mathbf{U}=f_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{A}) vs the one when doing only 𝐔=fθ​(𝐈)𝐔subscript𝑓𝜃𝐈\\mathbf{U}=f_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{I}). Discarding the biases, and the non-linearities in both cases, we have 𝐔=𝐀𝐖𝐔𝐀𝐖\\mathbf{U}=\\mathbf{AW} vs 𝐔=𝐖𝐔𝐖\\mathbf{U}=\\mathbf{W}. For simplicity, we consider the gradient wrt a single column, i.e. we analyze 𝐮=𝐀𝐰𝐮𝐀𝐰\\mathbf{u}=\\mathbf{Aw} vs 𝐮=𝐰𝐮𝐰\\mathbf{u}=\\mathbf{w} Given a random initialization of 𝐰𝐰\\mathbf{w}, this vector plays the role of a random projector of the rows in 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}. Following, the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma, 𝐰^=𝐀𝐰^𝐰𝐀𝐰\\hat{\\mathbf{w}}=\\mathbf{Aw} tends to replicate the structure of the adjacency. Actually, if the entries of 𝐰i∼𝒩​(0,1)similar-tosubscript𝐰𝑖𝒩01\\mathbf{w}_{i}\\sim{\\cal N}(0,1) then, those of the projection satisfy 𝐰^i∼𝒩​(0,di2)similar-tosubscript^𝐰𝑖𝒩0superscriptsubscript𝑑𝑖2\\hat{\\mathbf{w}}_{i}\\sim{\\cal N}(0,d_{i}^{2}), where disubscript𝑑𝑖d_{i} is the degree of node i𝑖i. As a result, if we have c𝑐c well-defined communities in the graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) with adjacency matrix 𝐀𝐰𝐀𝐰\\mathbf{Aw}, then the projection 𝐰^^𝐰\\hat{\\mathbf{w}} is near piecewise constant (actually the norm of the i−limit-from𝑖i-th row is preserved: ‖𝐀i:‖≈‖𝐰^‖normsubscript𝐀:𝑖absentnorm^𝐰\\|\\mathbf{A}_{i:}\\|\\approx\\|\\hat{\\mathbf{\\mathbf{w}}}\\|). As a result, the projection 𝐰^^𝐰\\hat{\\mathbf{w}} is more structured than 𝐰𝐰\\mathbf{w} and this is propagated and even amplified during gradient descent. In addition, the normalization of ∇ℒD,θ′∇subscriptsuperscriptℒ′𝐷𝜃{\\nabla{\\cal L}^{\\prime}_{D,\\theta}} is stronger than that of ∇ℒD,θ∇subscriptℒ𝐷𝜃{\\nabla{\\cal L}_{D,\\theta}}. Overall, when evaluating the performance in Squirrel and Chameleon using only 𝐔=fθ​(𝐈)𝐔subscript𝑓𝜃𝐈\\mathbf{U}=f_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{I}) (i.e. using ∇ℒD,θ∇subscriptℒ𝐷𝜃{\\nabla{\\cal L}_{D,\\theta}}) we only obtain 41.38±2.98plus-or-minus41.382.9841.38\\pm{2.98} and 58.48±4.69plus-or-minus58.484.6958.48\\pm{4.69}. However, using 𝐔=fθ​(𝐀)𝐔subscript𝑓𝜃𝐀\\mathbf{U}=f_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{A}) (gradient\n∇ℒD,θ′∇subscriptsuperscriptℒ′𝐷𝜃{\\nabla{\\cal L}^{\\prime}_{D,\\theta}}) leads to 73.48±1.59plus-or-minus73.481.5973.48\\pm{1.59} and 80.48±1.46plus-or-minus80.481.4680.48\\pm{1.46} respectively. Finally, a detailed impact of the two above formulations in the variance of the SGD as in  is beyond the scope of this paper. Assymptotic Diffusions. As explained above, optimizing the Dirichlet loss leads to Fiedler environments, i.e. the rows 𝐔i:subscript𝐔:𝑖absent\\mathbf{U}_{i:} contain the p𝑝p nearly orthogonal eigenvectors with eigenvalues γ1=1>γ2≥…≥γpsubscript𝛾11subscript𝛾2…subscript𝛾𝑝\\gamma_{1}=1>\\gamma_{2}\\geq\\ldots\\geq\\gamma_{p}. Following , the diffusion distance Dj​(i,j)subscript𝐷𝑗𝑖𝑗D_{j}(i,j) at time t𝑡t between two nodes i𝑖i and j𝑗j is defined spectrally as: where π(k):=dk/vol(G)\\pi(k)\\mathrel{\\mathop{:}}=d_{k}/vol(G) are the components from the stationary probability distribution limt→∞p​(j,t|i)=πsubscript→𝑡𝑝𝑗conditional𝑡𝑖𝜋\\lim_{t\\rightarrow\\infty}p(j,t|i)={\\mathbf{\\pi}}, i.e. the eigenvector 𝐔:1∗subscriptsuperscript𝐔∗:absent1\\mathbf{U}^{\\ast}_{:1} corresponding to γ1=1subscript𝛾11\\gamma_{1}=1. In the above equation, 𝐔∗superscript𝐔∗\\mathbf{U}^{\\ast} denote the true eigenvectors of the transition matrix 𝐏𝐏\\mathbf{P}, and Γ:=diag(γ1,γ2,…,γp)\\Gamma\\mathrel{\\mathop{:}}=\\text{diag}(\\gamma_{1},\\gamma_{2},\\ldots,\\gamma_{p}) is the diagonal matrix with the corresponding eigenvalues. Thus, Eq. 11 can be explained in the following terms: Dt2​(i,j)subscriptsuperscript𝐷2𝑡𝑖𝑗D^{2}_{t}(i,j) compare the probabilities that two random walks (one starting in i𝑖i and another one in j𝑗j) reach any other node k𝑘k in time t𝑡t. The spectral interpretation relies on the spectral theorem applied to the transition matrix 𝐏=𝐔∗​Λ​𝐔∗T𝐏superscript𝐔∗Λsuperscriptsuperscript𝐔∗𝑇\\mathbf{P}=\\mathbf{U}^{\\ast}\\Lambda{\\mathbf{U}^{\\ast}}^{T}. As a result, 𝐏t=𝐔∗​Γt​𝐔∗T=∑r=1nγrt​𝐔:r∗​𝐔:r∗Tsuperscript𝐏𝑡superscript𝐔∗superscriptΓ𝑡superscriptsuperscript𝐔∗𝑇superscriptsubscript𝑟1𝑛superscriptsubscript𝛾𝑟𝑡subscriptsuperscript𝐔∗:absent𝑟superscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝐔∗:absent𝑟𝑇\\mathbf{P}^{t}=\\mathbf{U}^{\\ast}{\\Gamma}^{t}{\\mathbf{U}^{\\ast}}^{T}=\\sum_{r=1}^{n}\\gamma_{r}^{t}\\mathbf{U}^{\\ast}_{:r}{\\mathbf{U}^{\\ast}_{:r}}^{T}, with n=|V|𝑛𝑉n=|V|. However, since determining what is the correct diffusion time is very hard (it is usually a hyperparameter in some GNNs), we are interested in the asymptotic diffusion distance Dt→∞2subscriptsuperscript𝐷2→𝑡D^{2}_{t\\rightarrow\\infty}. Qiu and Hancock  determined that i.e. eigenvalues {1−γr}1subscript𝛾𝑟\\{1-\\gamma_{r}\\} of the normalized Laplacian △~~△\\tilde{\\triangle} are used instead of those of 𝐏𝐏\\mathbf{P}. Actually, the right side of the above equation is the well-known commute times  distance CT​(i,j)CT𝑖𝑗\\text{CT}(i,j). Note that such a distance is dominated by the Fiedler value and vector: λ2=(1−γ2)subscript𝜆21subscript𝛾2\\lambda_{2}=(1-\\gamma_{2}) and 𝐔:2∗subscriptsuperscript𝐔∗:absent2\\mathbf{U}^{\\ast}_{:2}, respectively. This fact simplifies the interpretation of our approximate diffusion distance as follows: Our approximated eigenvectors, contained in the p𝑝p columns of 𝐔𝐔\\mathbf{U} have eigenvalues (Dirichlet energies) ρr∗subscriptsuperscript𝜌∗𝑟\\rho^{\\ast}_{r} close to ρ∗superscript𝜌∗\\rho^{\\ast} (the optimal trace ratio achieved by the Dirichlet loss). Theorethically, we have that the smallest ρrmin∗subscriptsuperscript𝜌∗subscript𝑟min\\rho^{\\ast}_{r_{\\text{min}}} satisfies λ2≤ρrmin∗subscript𝜆2subscriptsuperscript𝜌∗subscript𝑟min\\lambda_{2}\\leq\\rho^{\\ast}_{r_{\\text{min}}}. Therefore, if we order ρr∗subscriptsuperscript𝜌∗𝑟\\rho^{\\ast}_{r} in ascending order, then we obtain However, in the heterophilic regime (where the labels break the structure) we usually have λ2≪ρrmin∗much-less-thansubscript𝜆2subscriptsuperscript𝜌∗subscript𝑟min\\lambda_{2}\\ll\\rho^{\\ast}_{r_{\\text{min}}}. See for instance the Fiedler environments obtained for SBMs in Figure 4 and the discussion below (Appendix B). As a result, in practice we have This proofs Corollary 4.2. Escape Probabilities. Approximating commute times distances is very convenient for our jump-based analysis, since it is well known that the escape probability is related to the commute times distance : pe​s​c=1CT​(i,j)subscript𝑝𝑒𝑠𝑐1CT𝑖𝑗p_{esc}=\\frac{1}{\\text{CT}(i,j)}. Escape probabilities are actually dependent on the spectral gap (approximated by the Fiedler value λ2subscript𝜆2\\lambda_{2}). This is illustrated in the very first Figure of this paper (Figure 1), where a random walker tries to escape from the community A¯¯𝐴\\bar{A}. A classic result  shows that the probability that a random walk started in its asymptotic (t→∞→𝑡t\\rightarrow\\infty) distribution π𝜋\\pi is transitioning from i∈A¯𝑖¯𝐴i\\in\\bar{A} to j∈A𝑗𝐴j\\in A in one step is pe​s​c​(A¯,A)=cut​(A¯,A)vol​(A¯)subscript𝑝𝑒𝑠𝑐¯𝐴𝐴cut¯𝐴𝐴vol¯𝐴p_{esc}(\\bar{A},A)=\\frac{\\text{cut}(\\bar{A},A)}{\\text{vol}(\\bar{A})}, where cut​(A¯,A)=∑i∈A¯,j∈Aei​jcut¯𝐴𝐴subscriptformulae-sequence𝑖¯𝐴𝑗𝐴subscript𝑒𝑖𝑗\\text{cut}(\\bar{A},A)=\\sum_{i\\in\\bar{A},j\\in A}e_{ij} (in the Figure we have that cut​(A¯,A)=1cut¯𝐴𝐴1\\text{cut}(\\bar{A},A)=1). Therefore, as dt→∞​(i,j)=α​CT​(i,j)superscript𝑑→𝑡𝑖𝑗𝛼CT𝑖𝑗d^{t\\rightarrow\\infty}(i,j)=\\alpha\\text{CT}(i,j), with α≪1much-less-than𝛼1\\alpha\\ll 1 our jump-hierarchy is closer to that of the escape probability than choosing CT​(i,j)CT𝑖𝑗\\text{CT}(i,j) as asymptotic diffusion distance. In addition, we are sensitive to the spectral gap since the Fiedler environment contains approximations of the Fiedler vector, and the spectral gap is approximated in turn by the Dirichlet energy of the Fiedler vector. Clustering and Metastable States. Minimizing the Dirichlet loss in conjunction with the classification loss (see Eq 3) leads to a trade-off between two clustering problems. On the one hand, we infer a piecewise-smooth latent space. On the other hand, we simultaneously try to preserve the structure of the input graph as much as possible. In both cases, we try to find metastable states. A metastable state is a concept borrowed from dynamical systems but basically, it is an equilibrium state in a random process (for instance the one defined by a random walk that tries to escape from a community in Figure 1). Metastable states are also characterized by wells in potential functions U​(𝐱)𝑈𝐱U(\\mathbf{x}), where 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} is a state and its probability is given by the Boltzmann distribution p​(𝐱)=e−U​(𝐱)𝑝𝐱superscript𝑒𝑈𝐱p(\\mathbf{x})=e^{-U(\\mathbf{x})}.\nThen, the characteristic relaxation processes and time scales of a given space are usually described by a Stochastic Diffusion Equation (SDE): where 𝐰𝐰\\mathbf{w} denotes Brownian motion. In the above equation, we have a drag term (the gradient) that drives the process to a deep well, and a random term (the Brownian motion) that allows us to escape from local minima. During this process, we find different time scales: fast scales while we are moving through a given well, and slow scales when we try to escape from it. For instance, escaping from the right community in Figure 1 takes a long time which depends on the difference between the potential at the well U​(𝐱m​i​n)𝑈subscript𝐱𝑚𝑖𝑛U(\\mathbf{x}_{min}) and that of the saddle point U​(𝐱m​a​x)𝑈subscript𝐱𝑚𝑎𝑥U(\\mathbf{x}_{max}) . This time is in turn the inverse of the spectral gap, i.e. there is a spectral interpretation of the SDE. Such interpretation comes from the analysis of the Fokker-Planck equation: This equation leads to the pdf of the SDE and it has a spectral interpretation. More precisely, the eigenvectors of 𝐏𝐏\\mathbf{P} converge to the eigenfunctions Ψ​(𝐱)Ψ𝐱\\Psi(\\mathbf{x}) of the Fokker-Planck equation as follows [ref]53: where △=∇⋅∇△⋅∇∇\\triangle=\\nabla\\cdot\\nabla is the Laplacian and μ𝜇\\mu the eigenstates (eigenvalues). As a result, we may use the Fiedler vector to characterize the separation between two clusters. The steepest the Fiedler vector, the better the separation (Theorem 4.4). Interestingly, the third eigenvector ∇~~∇\\tilde{\\nabla} may not work well as a state separator when we have different spatial scales, as we will see in Appendix B. Dirichlet Label Propagation. As we mentioned in the main paper, our Dirichlet formulation is inspired by classical graph-based semi-supervised methods. The work in  poses the problem of propagating known labels ℓ​(B)ℓ𝐵\\ell(B) to unknown nodes u∈U𝑢𝑈u\\in U. Let 𝐘𝐘\\mathbf{Y} be a n×c𝑛𝑐n\\times c matrix where 𝐘​(i,j)=1𝐘𝑖𝑗1\\mathbf{Y}(i,j)=1 means that node i∈B𝑖𝐵i\\in B has label j𝑗j and 𝐘​(i,j)=0𝐘𝑖𝑗0\\mathbf{Y}(i,j)=0 otherwise. Then, the optimal label of each node i𝑖i is given by 𝐲​(i)=arg⁡maxj≤c⁡𝐅​(i,j)𝐲𝑖subscript𝑗𝑐𝐅𝑖𝑗\\mathbf{y}(i)=\\arg\\max_{j\\leq c}\\mathbf{F}(i,j), where being 𝐏𝐏\\mathbf{P} the transition matrix and α+β=1𝛼𝛽1\\alpha+\\beta=1. The n×c𝑛𝑐n\\times c matrix 𝐅𝐅\\mathbf{F} works as a basic node representation (not exactly a latent space) since each of is c𝑐c rows is stochastic. However, its construction exploits the powers of 𝐏𝐏\\mathbf{P} as follows: and In addition, we also noted that 𝐅𝐅\\mathbf{F} is also the solution of the Dirichlet problem: where μ>0𝜇0\\mu>0 is a regularization parameter satisfying α=1/(1+μ)𝛼11𝜇\\alpha=1/(1+\\mu). The proof is obtained by setting the gradient to zero: which leads to Eq. 19. Concerning the relationship of this formulation with absorbing random walks ,\nthe main idea is to extend the n×n𝑛𝑛n\\times n transition matrix 𝐏𝐏\\mathbf{P} so that: We include an upper block with the p×p𝑝𝑝p\\times p identity matrix 𝐈𝐈\\mathbf{I}. This block represents the p𝑝p absorbing states, where p=|ℓ​(B)|𝑝ℓ𝐵p=|\\ell(B)|. Then the n×p𝑛𝑝n\\times p block 𝐑𝐑\\mathbf{R} encodes the prior probabilities of reaching an absorbing state from a non-absorbing one. The absorbing probabilities are given by 𝐁:=(𝐈n×n−𝐏)−1𝐑\\mathbf{B}\\mathrel{\\mathop{:}}=(\\mathbf{I}_{n\\times n}-\\mathbf{P})^{-1}\\mathbf{R} . Finally, the random-walker version  is quite similar to the above one, but reorganizes the Laplacian matrix (Theorem 4.3).\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: d_{n} are the sorted degrees. As a result, we have the following bounds: The definition of ρ∗superscript𝜌∗\\rho^{\\ast} plays a key role in the original trace-ratio optimization. Following [ref]28, such a problem is formulated in scalar terms, i.e. in terms of finding Actually, for ρ∗superscript𝜌∗\\rho^{\\ast} we have have that Therefore, the trace-ratio problem can be solved by\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
