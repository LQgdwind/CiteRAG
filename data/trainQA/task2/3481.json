      "content": "Paper Title: It’s Raw! Audio Generation with State-Space Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis work focuses primarily on the task of generating raw audio waveforms without conditioning information.\nMost past work on waveform generation involves conditioning on localized intermediate representations like\nspectrograms [ref]38  [ref]34,\nlinguistic features [ref]39  ,\nor discrete audio codes    .\nSuch intermediaries provide copious information about the underlying content of a waveform, enabling generative models to produce globally-coherent waveforms while only modeling local structure. In contrast, modeling waveforms in an unconditional fashion requires learning both local and global structure with a single model, and is thus more challenging.\nPast work in this setting can be categorized into\nAR approaches [ref]39  , where audio samples are generated one at a time given previous audio samples,\nand non-AR approaches 0 , where entire waveforms are generated in a single pass.\nWhile non-AR approaches tend to generate waveforms more efficiently,\nAR approaches have two key advantages.\nFirst, unlike non-AR approaches, they can generate waveforms of unbounded length.\nSecond, they can tractably compute exact likelihoods,\nallowing them to be used for compression  and posterior sampling 9. In addition to these two advantages, new architectures for AR modeling of audio have the potential to bring about a cascade of improvements in audio generation more broadly.\nFor example, while the WaveNet architecture was originally developed for AR modeling (in both conditional and unconditional settings),\nit has since become a fundamental piece of infrastructure in numerous audio generation systems.\nFor instance,\nWaveNet is\ncommonly used to vocode\nintermediaries such as spectrograms [ref]38 or discrete audio codes  into waveforms, often in the context of text-to-speech (TTS) systems.\nAdditionally, it serves as the backbone for several families of non-AR generative models of audio in both the conditional and unconditional settings: Distillation: Parallel WaveNet  and ClariNet  distill parallelizable flow models from a teacher WaveNet model. Likelihood-based flow models: WaveFlow , WaveGlow [ref]34, and FloWaveNet  all use WaveNet as a core component of reversible flow architectures. Autoencoders: WaveNet Autoencoder 1 and WaveVAE , which use WaveNets in their encoders. Generative adversarial networks (GAN): Parallel WaveGAN  and GAN-TTS , which use WaveNets in their discriminators. Diffusion probabilistic models: WaveGrad  and DiffWave  learn a reversible noise diffusion process on top of dilated convolutional architectures. In particular, we point out that DiffWave represents the state-of-the-art for unconditional waveform generation, and incorporates\nWaveNet as a black box. Despite its prevalence,\nWaveNet is unable to model long-term structure beyond the length of its receptive field (up to 333s), and in practice, may even fail to leverage available information beyond a few tens of milliseconds [ref]38.\nHence,\nwe develop an alternative to WaveNet which can leverage unbounded context.\nWe focus primarily on evaluating our proposed architecture SaShiMi in the fundamental AR setting,\nand additionally demonstrate that, like WaveNet,\nSaShiMi can also transfer to non-AR settings.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: the task of generating raw audio waveforms without conditioning information.\nMost past work on waveform generation involves conditioning on localized intermediate representations like\nspectrograms [ref]38  [ref]34,\nlinguistic features [ref]39  ,\nor discrete audio codes    .\nSuch intermediaries provide copious information about the underlying content of a waveform, enabling generative models to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
