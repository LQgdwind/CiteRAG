      "content": "Paper Title: Graph Decoupling Attention Markov Networks for Semi-supervised Graph Node Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare our method with three non-GNN models and GNN based methods.\nThe baseline models are logistic regression (LogReg), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and label propagation (LPA) . The first two methods are attribute-based models that only use the feature representation of each node for prediction. LPA is a graph-based method that only uses the graph structure for prediction. The other GNNs can be divided into three types: Classical GNNs GCN [ref]8: GCN is the pioneer to perform linear approximation to spectral graph convolutions. SGC : SGC reduces GCNs’ complexity by removing nonlinearities and collapsing weight matrices between consecutive layers. This method can also be regarded as decoupling the feature transformation and propagation. APPNP  : APPNP combines GNN with personalized PageRank to separate the neural network from the propagation scheme. GraphSAGE : GraphSAGE learns a function that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node’s local neighborhood. GAT : GAT is a graph neural network that applies the attention mechanism on node feature to learn edge weights. Label Information GNNs CS-GNN :\nCS-GNN uses the feature and label smoothness to help the attention mechanism selectively aggregate neighborhood information and reduce negative disturbance. ALaGCN and ALaGAT [ref]17: ALaGCN and ALaGAT propose a novel metric and integrate them into an adaptive-layer module to make individual decision at each round of neighborhood aggregation. \n\nThey estimate whether neighborhood aggregation is harmful or unnecessary by calculating the metric based on label information. GMNN [ref]25: GMNN is also an EM-based method, it models the joint distribution of nodes and labels with a conditional random field and\nuses two GCNs to propagate features and labels under the original structure. GCN-LPA :GCN-LPA can also be seen as learning attention weights based on training set labels.\nHowever, the input of attention remains node features and it uses the LPA as regularization to assist in learning proper edge weights. GCN-C&S :C&S combines the label propagation with a basic predictor to learn the residual. In order for a fair comparison, we choose the GCN as the basic model, since our GDAMN also uses the GCN as a predictor. For the scaling strategy of C&S, we choose the Autoscale that works more reliably than FDiff-scale, which is also mentioned from their official code. Deep GNNs DeeperGCN :\nIt combines residual/dense connections and dilated convolutions, and adapts them to GCN architectures to successfully train very deep GCNS. DAGNN :\nDAGNN decouples the feature transformation and propagation to learn node representation from larger receptive fields. Moreover, it proposes an adaptive adjustment to balance the information from local and global neighbors for each node. For ease of comparison, we use the main reported results from [ref]25  [ref]17. Moreover, for the missing results of most baselines on coauthor and arXiv datasets, we rerun their official code over 20 runs.\nNotice that, for the GCN-LPA and GCN-C&S, the original papers use the full-supervised data splits which use the train/val/test as 60%/20%/20% for citation and coauthor datasets. For a fair comparison, we also rerun their codes under our semi-supervised data splits that only 20 labeled per class is used for training.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: feature representation of each node for prediction.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
