      "content": "Paper Title: Decision-Making with Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGiven a model pθsubscript𝑝𝜃p_{\\theta}, an action set 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}, and a loss L𝐿L, the optimal decision a∗​(x)superscript𝑎𝑥a^{*}(x) for observation x𝑥x is an expectation taken with respect to the posterior:\n𝒬​(f,x)=𝔼pθ​(z∣x)​f​(z).𝒬𝑓𝑥subscript𝔼subscript𝑝𝜃conditional𝑧𝑥𝑓𝑧\\mathcal{Q}(f,x)=\\mathbb{E}_{p_{\\theta}(z\\mid x)}f(z).\nHere f𝑓f depends on the loss [ref]9. We therefore focus on numerical methods for estimating 𝒬​(f,x)𝒬𝑓𝑥\\mathcal{Q}(f,x). Evaluating these expectations is the aim of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), annealed importance sampling (AIS) , and variational methods . Although we typically lack direct access to the posterior pθ​(z∣x)subscript𝑝𝜃conditional𝑧𝑥p_{\\theta}(z\\mid x), we can, however, sample (zi)1≤i≤nsubscriptsubscript𝑧𝑖1𝑖𝑛(z_{i})_{1\\leq i\\leq n} from the variational distribution qϕ​(z∣x)subscript𝑞italic-ϕconditional𝑧𝑥q_{\\phi}(z\\mid x). A naive but practical approach is to consider a plugin estimator    : This estimator replaces the exact posterior by sampling z1,…,znsubscript𝑧1…subscript𝑧𝑛z_{1},\\ldots,z_{n} from qϕ​(z∣x)subscript𝑞italic-ϕconditional𝑧𝑥q_{\\phi}(z\\mid x). A less naive approach is to use\nself-normalized importance sampling (SNIS): Here the importance weights are\nw​(x,z):=pθ​(x,z)/qϕ​(z∣x).assign𝑤𝑥𝑧subscript𝑝𝜃𝑥𝑧subscript𝑞italic-ϕconditional𝑧𝑥w(x,z):=\\nicefrac{{p_{\\theta}(x,z)}}{{q_{\\phi}(z\\mid x)}}.\nThe non-asymptotic behavior of both estimators and their variants is well understood  [ref]17 . Moreover, each upper bound on the error motivates an alternative inference procedure in which the upper bound is used as a surrogate for the error. For example,  bounds the error of the IS estimator with a function of forward KL divergence ΔKL​(pθ∥qϕ)subscriptΔKLconditionalsubscript𝑝𝜃subscript𝑞italic-ϕ\\Delta_{\\textrm{KL}}(p_{\\theta}\\;\\|\\;q_{\\phi}), which motivates the WW algorithm in . Similarly, [ref]17 provides an upper bound of the error based on the χ2superscript𝜒2{\\mathchoice{\\raisebox{0.0pt}{$\\displaystyle\\chi$}}{\\raisebox{0.0pt}{$\\textstyle\\chi$}}{\\raisebox{0.0pt}{$\\scriptstyle\\chi$}}{\\raisebox{0.0pt}{$\\scriptscriptstyle\\chi$}}}^{2} divergence, which motivates our investigation of the χ𝜒\\textstyle\\chi-VAE. However, these upper bounds are too loose to explicitly compare, for example, the worst-case performance of χ𝜒\\textstyle\\chi-VAE and WW when f𝑓f belongs to a function class (for further details, see Appendix C).\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: an expectation taken with respect to the posterior:\n𝒬​(f,x)=𝔼pθ​(z∣x)​f​(z).𝒬𝑓𝑥subscript𝔼subscript𝑝𝜃conditional𝑧𝑥𝑓𝑧\\mathcal{Q}(f,x)=\\mathbb{E}_{p_{\\theta}(z\\mid x)}f(z).\nHere f𝑓f depends on the loss [ref]9.
