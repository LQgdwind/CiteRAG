We formally define homogeneous graphs in Definition 4, characterized by the presence of a single node type and a single relationship type. Homogeneous graphs represent the most basic and extensively studied graph type. In contemporary research, a predominant focus has shifted towards employing deep learning techniques as opposed to traditional data mining methods. Notably, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)  has emerged as one of the most successful models for handling homogeneous graphs, utilizing the adjacency matrix to perform convolution on a given graph. The message propagation process in GCN is expressed as: where A~=A+IN~𝐴𝐴subscript𝐼𝑁\\tilde{A}=A+I_{N} denotes the adjacency matrix with self-connections, D~i​i=∑jA~i​jsubscript~𝐷𝑖𝑖subscript𝑗subscript~𝐴𝑖𝑗\\tilde{D}_{ii}=\\sum_{j}\\tilde{A}_{ij}, and Wlsuperscript𝑊𝑙W^{l} is a trainable weight matrix. Here, H(l)superscript𝐻𝑙H^{(l)} and H(l+1)superscript𝐻𝑙1H^{(l+1)} represent the representations of nodes in the l𝑙l-th and l+1𝑙1l+1-th layers, respectively. Inspired by GCN , Hamilton et al. [ref]38 present GraphSAGE, offering a scalable approach for semi-supervised learning on graph-structured data. Additionally, Velivckovic et al. [ref]40 propose Graph Attention Networks (GAT), introducing different weights to neighbors’ information during the message passing process. The weight learning and aggregation calculations are expressed as: where a→→𝑎\\vec{a} and 𝐖𝐖\\bf W are the weight vector and trainable weight matrix, respectively. αi​jsubscript𝛼𝑖𝑗\\alpha_{ij} is the learned weight for the target node i𝑖i and neighbor node j𝑗j. However, real-world graphs are naturally modeled as heterogeneous graphs, as illustrated in Definition 4, wherein a graph contains more than one node type or relationship type. The presence of multiple node types, edges, and rich attribute information presents significant challenges in modeling heterogeneous graphs. Current methods addressing heterogeneous graphs can be broadly categorized based on their utilization of heterogeneous edges: (1) Link-based Heterogeneous Graph Embedding:\nSchlichtkrull et al. [ref]17 propose RGCN, which accounts for multiple relationships by assigning relation-specific transformation matrices in the aggregation process. The propagation model is expressed as: where 𝒩irsuperscriptsubscript𝒩𝑖𝑟\\mathcal{N}_{i}^{r} denotes the set of neighbors regarding node i𝑖i under relationship r∈ℛ𝑟ℛr\\in{\\mathcal{R}}. ci,rsubscript𝑐𝑖𝑟c_{i,r} is a normalization term that can be learned or set in advance. Furthermore, Zhang et al.  propose a comprehensive approach to capture heterogeneous information by incorporating special designs in sampling heterogeneous neighbors, encoding heterogeneous contents, and aggregating heterogeneous neighbors. (2) Path-based Heterogeneous Network Representation:\nA meta-path is a path containing a sequence of relations defined on different types of objects. Wang et al.  advocate for utilizing a hierarchical attention mechanism to model path-based heterogeneous information. Specifically, they employ an attention mechanism to learn node-level representations for nodes under different relationships and aggregate the node-level representations with learned relation weights to obtain final semantic-level representations. \n B. Static Graph vs. Dynamic Graph Discrete-time dynamic graph.\nA discrete-time dynamic graph (DTDG) can be defined as a set: {𝒢1,𝒢2,…,𝒢T}superscript𝒢1superscript𝒢2…superscript𝒢T\\{\\mathcal{G}^{1},\\mathcal{G}^{2},...,\\mathcal{G}^{T}\\} in which 𝒢t={𝒱t,ℰt}superscript𝒢tsuperscript𝒱tsuperscriptℰt{\\mathcal{G}^{t}=\\{\\mathcal{V}^{t},\\mathcal{E}^{t}\\}}, 𝒢tsuperscript𝒢t\\mathcal{G}^{t} is a snapshot in time t, 𝒱tsuperscript𝒱t\\mathcal{V}^{t} is the node set in 𝒢tsuperscript𝒢t\\mathcal{G}^{t} and the ℰtsuperscriptℰt\\mathcal{E}^{t} is the edge set in 𝒢tsuperscript𝒢t\\mathcal{G}^{t}. Continuous-time dynamic graph.\nA continuous-time dynamic graph (CTDG) can be defined as a set of event quadruples {q1,q2,…,qN}superscriptq1superscriptq2…superscriptqN\\{q^{1},q^{2},...,q^{N}\\}, where qn=(un,vn,rn,tn)superscriptqnsubscriptunsubscriptvnsubscriptrnsubscripttnq^{n}=(u_{n},v_{n},r_{n},t_{n}) means that node unsubscriptunu_{n} links to node vnsubscriptvnv_{n} with relation rnsubscriptrnr_{n} in time tnsubscripttnt_{n}. Each time 𝐭nsubscript𝐭n{\\bf t}_{n} is only assigned with corresponding event quadruple qnsubscriptqnq_{n}. Dynamic hypergraph.\nA Dynamic hypergraph can be defined as 𝒢=(𝒱,ℰt,𝒯)𝒢𝒱superscriptℰt𝒯{\\mathcal{G}}=({\\mathcal{V}},{\\mathcal{E}}^{t},{\\mathcal{T}}). Here, 𝒱𝒱{\\mathcal{V}} denotes the set of nodes.\nℰt={e1,e2,⋅,eE}superscriptℰtsubscripte1subscripte2⋅subscripteE{\\mathcal{E}}^{t}=\\{e_{1},e_{2},\\cdot,e_{E}\\}\ndenotes hyperedge set. 𝒯={Ω1,Ω2,…,ΩM}𝒯subscriptΩ1subscriptΩ2…subscriptΩM{\\mathcal{T}}=\\{\\Omega_{1},\\Omega_{2},...,\\Omega_{M}\\} denotes hyperedge type set. Hyperedge type map function ψψ\\psi: ψ​(e)∈𝒯ψe𝒯\\psi(e)\\in{\\mathcal{T}}, Hyperedge time map function ψψ\\psi: Ψ​(ei)∈𝐓={t1,t2,⋯,tT}Ψsubscriptei𝐓subscriptt1subscriptt2⋯subscripttT\\Psi(e_{i})\\in{\\bf T}=\\{t_{1},t_{2},\\cdots,t_{T}\\}. Static graphs do not show any state changes over time.\nResearch related to static graphs can be divided into two categories based on the convolution method used:\n(1) Spectral-based Graph Convolutional Networks:\nSpectral convolution involves replacing the convolution kernel in the spectral domain with a diagonal matrix. For example, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)  is essentially a localized first-order approximation of spectral graph convolution.\n(2) Spatial-based Graph Convolutional Networks:\nThe spatial-based approach characterizes graph convolution by considering the spatial relationships among nodes. Spatial-based Graph Convolutional Networks fundamentally propagate node information along the edges. In this context, Niepert et al. (2016) introduced a framework for acquiring convolutional neural networks tailored for arbitrary graphs. Their approach offers a general methodology for extracting locally connected regions within graphs. Dynamic graphs pose increased complexity due to the inclusion of crucial temporal information, wherein links and nodes may manifest and vanish over time. The temporal granularity categorizes dynamic graphs into discrete dynamic graphs (DTDG, see Definition 5) and continuous dynamic graphs (CTDG, see Definition 6). Discrete dynamic graphs are commonly characterized by multiple network snapshots captured at distinct time intervals. In this context, two distinct types of discrete dynamic graph neural networks (DGNN) for Discrete Time Dynamic Graphs (DTDG) can be identified. (1) Stacked DGNNs employ a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to model each snapshot, followed by the stacking of the outputs of previous GNNs into a time series model. For instance, Sankar et al.  introduced DySAT, a method for computing node representations through joint self-attention across two dimensions, namely structural neighborhood and temporal dynamics. The structural self-attention operation adopts a similar approach to Graph Attention Networks (GAT) [ref]40, facilitating the aggregation of neighbors’ information. In the temporal self-attention operation, DySAT utilizes a transformer-style attention mechanism  to capture patterns in temporal changes. Specifically, it computes the output representation of node v𝑣v at time step t𝑡t as described by the following equation: where 𝜷v∈ℝT×Tsubscript𝜷𝑣superscriptℝ𝑇𝑇\\bm{\\beta}_{v}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{T\\times T} represents the learned attention weight matrix, and 𝑴∈ℝT×T𝑴superscriptℝ𝑇𝑇\\bm{M}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{T\\times T} is a mask matrix with each entry Mi​j∈{−∞,0}subscript𝑀𝑖𝑗0M_{ij}\\in\\{-\\infty,0\\} enforcing the auto-regressive property. In a recent study , researchers explore methods to model the evolutionary and multi-scale interactions of time series data. (2) Integrated DGNNs integrate the Graph Neural Network (GNN) and the time series model into a single layer, forming the encoder. Addressing the challenge of frequent changes in the node set, Pareja et al.  introduce EvolveGCN, a method that adapts the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model along the temporal dimension without relying on node embeddings. In reality, Discrete Time Dynamic Graphs (DTDG) can be viewed as a simplified manifestation of Continuous Time Dynamic Graphs (CTDG), as we can systematically convert a CTDG with fine granularity into graph snapshots with coarse granularity. Presently, three primary CTDG methodologies are available for continuous modeling. (1) Time encoding methods represent temporal information as a vector, akin to position embedding in language models . Previous approaches involved learning positional embeddings to capture the absolute position of nodes or edges. In current research, sinusoidal position encoding is commonly employed to represent the relative time distances between nodes . (2) Random process methods can also be parameterized by neural networks. For instance, Trivedi et al.  propose a dynamic graph framework that frames representation learning as a latent mediation process, bridging two observed processes: the dynamics of the network (topological evolution) and dynamics on the network (activities between nodes). (3) RNN-based methods maintain node embeddings through Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based architectures. For example, DyGNN  updates node information by capturing sequential information regarding edges (interactions), the time intervals between edges, and coherent information propagation. DyGNN comprises two components: the update component and the propagation component. Both components include an interact unit, an update unit, and a merge unit, albeit with subtle distinctions. The update component refines the interaction information of involved nodes, aiming to capture the direct influence of an interaction. Subsequently, the propagation component disseminates interaction information to more related nodes, capturing indirect influence. The update unit employs an LSTM-style operation, considering the time-related weight decay. Additionally, dynamic hypergraphs (refer to Definition 7) have garnered considerable attention in recent research. For instance, Zhang et al.  introduced the first dynamic hypergraph structure learning method. This method aims to optimize both the label projection matrix (a common task in hypergraph learning) and the hypergraph structure concurrently. The objective function for dynamic hypergraph structure learning can be expressed as a dual optimization problem: where β𝛽\\beta and λ𝜆\\lambda are parameters that balance different components in the objective function. Ψ​(𝐅,𝐇)Ψ𝐅𝐇\\Psi(\\mathbf{F},\\mathbf{H}) serves as a commonly used hypergraph regularizer for the label projection matrix 𝐅𝐅\\mathbf{F}, emphasizing its smoothness on the hypergraph structure 𝐇𝐇\\mathbf{H}. Ω​(𝐇)Ω𝐇\\Omega(\\mathbf{H}) imposes a constraint on 𝐇𝐇\\mathbf{H} based on the input features 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X}. ℛemp​(𝐅)subscriptℛemp𝐅\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{emp}}(\\mathbf{F}) represents the empirical loss. A limitation of existing methods is that the hypergraph structure remains fixed during training, lacking flexibility. Consequently, Jiang et al.  propose DHGNN, comprising stacked layers of two modules: dynamic hypergraph construction and hypergraph convolution. Moreover, Zhu et al.  introduce a novel feature selection method involving the dynamic construction of a hypergraph Laplacian matrix within the framework of sparse feature selection.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: matrix.
