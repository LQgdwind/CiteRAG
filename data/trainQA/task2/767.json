For the planning phase, we implemented HTB based on constraint-satisfaction heuristics\n    \nand LG based on tree-decomposition tools   .\nOur empirical work indicates that tree-decomposition tools tend to produce project-join trees of lower widths in shorter times.\nThis is a significant finding with applications beyond model counting, e.g., in Boolean functional synthesis . For the execution phase, we implemented DMC based on ADDs [ref]26  and tensor based on tensors [ref]25 .\nEmpirically, we observed that (sparse) ADDs outperform (dense) tensors on single CPU cores.\nWhether this holds for richer architectures as well is a subject for future work.\nWe will also consider adding to our framework an executor based on databases (e.g., ). We showed that our dynamic-programming model-counting framework DPMC is competitive with state-of-the-art tools (Cachet , c2d 9, d4 , and miniC2D ).\nAlthough no single model counter dominates,\nDPMC considerably improves the virtual best solver and thus is valuable as part of the portfolio. In this work, we did not consider preprocessing of benchmarks.\nFor example, [ref]25 found that preprocessing (called FT, based on a technique to reduce variable occurrences using tree decompositions of the incidence graph ) significantly improved tensor-network-based approaches for weighted model counting.\nMoreover,  and  observed that the pmc preprocessor  notably improved the running time of some dynamic-programming-based model counters.\nWe expect these techniques to also improve DPMC. A promising future research direction is multicore programming.\nOur planning tool LG can be improved to run back-end tree-decomposition solvers in parallel, as in .\nWe can also make the execution tool DMC support multicore ADD packages (e.g., Sylvan ).\nOur other executor, tensor, is built on top of NumPy  and should be readily parallelizable (e.g., using techniques from ).\nWe can then compare DPMC to parallel solvers (e.g., 6 0). Finally, decision diagrams have been widely used in artificial intelligence in the context of knowledge compilation, where formulas are compiled into a tractable form in an early phase to support efficient query processing   9 .\nOur work opens up an investigation into the combination of knowledge compilation and dynamic programming.\nThe focus here is on processing a single model-counting query.\nExploring how dynamic programming can also be leveraged to handle several queries is another promising research direction.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: trees for weighted model counting.\nThese trees are at the center of a dynamic-programming framework that unifies and generalizes several model counting algorithms, including those based on ADDs [ref]26, tensors [ref]25, and database management systems .\nThis framework performs model counting in two phases.\nFirst, the planning phase produces a project-join tree from a CNF formula.\nSecond,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
