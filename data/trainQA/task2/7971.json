      "content": "Paper Title: A Spectrum of Approximate Probabilistic Bisimulations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe start with the seminal notion of ε𝜀\\varepsilon-bisimulations of Desharnais et al. . While originally introduced for labeled Markov processes  , ε𝜀\\varepsilon-bisimulations were later adapted to other models like LMCs 4 [ref]38 or Segala’s probabilistic automata  . A reflexive111In contrast to  4 we require reflexivity of ε𝜀\\varepsilon-bisimulations. This is a rather natural assumption (a state should always simulate itself) that does not affect ∼εsubscriptsimilar-to𝜀\\sim_{\\varepsilon}. and symmetric relation R⊆S×S𝑅𝑆𝑆R\\subseteq S\\times S is an ε𝜀\\varepsilon-bisimulation if for all (s,t)∈R𝑠𝑡𝑅(s,t)\\in R and any A⊆S𝐴𝑆A\\subseteq S it holds that States s,t𝑠𝑡s,t are ε𝜀\\varepsilon-bisimilar, denoted s∼εtsubscriptsimilar-to𝜀𝑠𝑡s\\sim_{\\varepsilon}t, if there is an ε𝜀\\varepsilon-bisimulation R𝑅R with (s,t)∈R𝑠𝑡𝑅(s,t)\\in R. LMCs ℳ,𝒩ℳ𝒩\\mathcal{M},\\mathcal{N} are ε𝜀\\varepsilon-bisimilar, denoted ℳ∼ε𝒩subscriptsimilar-to𝜀ℳ𝒩\\mathcal{M}\\sim_{\\varepsilon}\\mathcal{N}, if si​n​i​tℳ∼εsi​n​i​t𝒩subscriptsimilar-to𝜀superscriptsubscript𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡ℳsuperscriptsubscript𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡𝒩s_{init}^{\\mathcal{M}}\\sim_{\\varepsilon}s_{init}^{\\mathcal{N}} in ℳ⊕𝒩direct-sumℳ𝒩\\mathcal{M}\\oplus\\mathcal{N}. Intuitively, s∼εtsubscriptsimilar-to𝜀𝑠𝑡s\\sim_{\\varepsilon}t if both states can mimic the other’s transition probabilities to any A⊆S𝐴𝑆A\\subseteq S by transitioning to the (potentially bigger) set ∼ε(A)subscriptsimilar-to𝜀absent𝐴{\\sim_{\\varepsilon}}(A) with a probability that is smaller by at most ε𝜀\\varepsilon than the original one. The parameter ε𝜀\\varepsilon describes how much the behavior of related states may differ: for ε𝜀\\varepsilon close to 111 more states can be related, while for ε≈0𝜀0\\varepsilon\\approx 0 related states behave almost equivalently. In the extreme case of ε=0𝜀0\\varepsilon=0, we have ∼0⁣=⁣∼subscriptsimilar-to0similar-to{\\sim_{0}}={\\sim}  4. Instead of being transitive, ε𝜀\\varepsilon-bisimulations are additive in their tolerances: s∼ε1tsubscriptsimilar-tosubscript𝜀1𝑠𝑡s\\sim_{\\varepsilon_{1}}t and t∼ε2usubscriptsimilar-tosubscript𝜀2𝑡𝑢t\\sim_{\\varepsilon_{2}}u implies s∼ε′usubscriptsimilar-tosuperscript𝜀′𝑠𝑢s\\sim_{\\varepsilon^{\\prime}}u for some 0≤ε′≤min⁡{1,ε1+ε2}0superscript𝜀′1subscript𝜀1subscript𝜀20\\leq\\varepsilon^{\\prime}\\leq\\min\\{1,\\varepsilon_{1}+\\varepsilon_{2}\\} .\nAs the next example suggests, transitivity is not always desirable for ε𝜀\\varepsilon-bisimulations if ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0. Let ε=1n𝜀1𝑛\\varepsilon=\\frac{1}{n} for n≥1𝑛1n\\geq 1 and consider the LMC of Figure 2. There, the reflexive and symmetric closure of R={(si,si+1)∣0≤i≤n−1}𝑅conditional-setsubscript𝑠𝑖subscript𝑠𝑖10𝑖𝑛1R=\\{(s_{i},s_{i+1})\\mid 0\\leq i\\leq n-1\\} is an ε𝜀\\varepsilon-bisimulation.\nHence, s0subscript𝑠0s_{0} and snsubscript𝑠𝑛s_{n} are related by a chain of ε𝜀\\varepsilon-bisimilar states, even though they behave completely different: s0subscript𝑠0s_{0} transitions to the {a}𝑎\\{a\\}-labeled state x𝑥x with probability 00, snsubscript𝑠𝑛s_{n} does so with probability 111. There are different ways to characterize ε𝜀\\varepsilon-bisimulations. For example, Desharnais et al.  provide a characterization in terms of the values of maximum flows in specific flow networks. Their result is well-suited for algorithmic purposes, but is restricted to finite models. Another way to express condition (ii) of Definition 3.1 is via the existence of weight functions Δ:S→D​i​s​t​r​(S):Δ→𝑆𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑆\\Delta\\colon S\\to Distr(S) that describe how to split the successor probabilities of related states. This approach is used in, e.g.,  [ref]38  [ref]31. The following lemma describes one possible way to define such weight functions in order to characterize ε𝜀\\varepsilon-bisimulations. A reflexive and symmetric relation R⊆S×S𝑅𝑆𝑆R\\subseteq S\\times S that only relates states with the same label is an ε𝜀\\varepsilon-bisimulation iff for all (s,t)∈R𝑠𝑡𝑅(s,t)\\in R there is a map Δ:𝑆𝑢𝑐𝑐​(s)→𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑟​(𝑆𝑢𝑐𝑐​(t)):Δ→𝑆𝑢𝑐𝑐𝑠𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑆𝑢𝑐𝑐𝑡\\Delta\\colon\\mathit{Succ}(s)\\to\\mathit{Distr}(\\mathit{Succ}(t)) such that for all t′∈𝑆𝑢𝑐𝑐​(t)superscript𝑡′𝑆𝑢𝑐𝑐𝑡t^{\\prime}\\in\\mathit{Succ}(t) we have , and ∑s′∈𝑆𝑢𝑐𝑐​(s)subscriptsuperscript𝑠′𝑆𝑢𝑐𝑐𝑠\\sum_{s^{\\prime}\\in\\mathit{Succ}(s)}. Intuitively, Lemma 3.3 tells us that, if s∼εtsubscriptsimilar-to𝜀𝑠𝑡s\\sim_{\\varepsilon}t, the successors s′superscript𝑠′s^{\\prime} of s𝑠s can be mapped to distributions Δ​(s′)Δsuperscript𝑠′\\Delta(s^{\\prime}), i.e., convex combinations, of successors of t𝑡t. More precisely, it shows that (i) if we move from s𝑠s to a successor s′superscript𝑠′s^{\\prime} with probability  and, afterwards, from s′superscript𝑠′s^{\\prime} to a successor t′superscript𝑡′t^{\\prime} of t𝑡t with probability Δ​(s′)​(t′)Δsuperscript𝑠′superscript𝑡′\\Delta(s^{\\prime})(t^{\\prime}), then we reach t′superscript𝑡′t^{\\prime} with probability , and that (ii) the overall probability that the states s′superscript𝑠′s^{\\prime} and t′superscript𝑡′t^{\\prime} are ε𝜀\\varepsilon-bisimilar is at least 1−ε1𝜀1-\\varepsilon. A second notion of approximate probabilistic bisimulation are ε𝜀\\varepsilon-APBs, which stands short for approximate probabilistic bisimulations with precision ε𝜀\\varepsilon   . In contrast to ε𝜀\\varepsilon-bisimulations, where the differences in transition probabilities of related states are bounded w.r.t. all subsets A⊆S𝐴𝑆A\\subseteq S, an ε𝜀\\varepsilon-APB R𝑅R only requires a difference of at most ε𝜀\\varepsilon for the probabilities of related states to transition to R𝑅R-closed subsets of S𝑆S. A reflexive and symmetric relation R⊆S×S𝑅𝑆𝑆R\\subseteq S\\times S is an ε𝜀\\varepsilon-APB if for all (s,t)∈R𝑠𝑡𝑅(s,t)\\in R and any R𝑅R-closed set A⊆S𝐴𝑆A\\subseteq S it holds that We write s≡εtsubscript𝜀𝑠𝑡s\\equiv_{\\varepsilon}t if s𝑠s and t𝑡t are related by any ε𝜀\\varepsilon-APB, and ℳ≡ε𝒩subscript𝜀ℳ𝒩\\mathcal{M}\\equiv_{\\varepsilon}\\mathcal{N} if si​n​i​tℳ≡εsi​n​i​t𝒩subscript𝜀superscriptsubscript𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡ℳsuperscriptsubscript𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡𝒩s_{init}^{\\mathcal{M}}\\equiv_{\\varepsilon}s_{init}^{\\mathcal{N}} in ℳ⊕𝒩direct-sumℳ𝒩\\mathcal{M}\\oplus\\mathcal{N}. Like ∼εsubscriptsimilar-to𝜀\\sim_{\\varepsilon}, ε𝜀\\varepsilon-APBs are additive in their tolerances, and we have ≡0⁣=⁣∼⁣=⁣∼0subscript0similar-tosubscriptsimilar-to0{\\equiv_{0}}={\\sim}={\\sim_{0}}  . Let ε∈(0,1]𝜀01\\varepsilon\\in(0,1] and n=⌈1ε⌉∈ℕ𝑛1𝜀ℕn=\\left\\lceil\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right\\rceil\\in\\mathbb{N}. Consider ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} as in Figure 3, and let R𝑅R be the reflexive and symmetric closure of {(s,t),(x,x),(y,y)}∪{(ui,ui+1)∣0≤i≤n−1}𝑠𝑡𝑥𝑥𝑦𝑦conditional-setsubscript𝑢𝑖subscript𝑢𝑖10𝑖𝑛1\\{(s,t),(x,x),(y,y)\\}\\cup\\{(u_{i},u_{i+1})\\mid 0\\leq i\\leq n-1\\}.\nThe R𝑅R-closed sets in ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} are {s,t},{x},{y},{ui∣0≤i≤n}𝑠𝑡𝑥𝑦conditional-setsubscript𝑢𝑖0𝑖𝑛\\{s,t\\},\\{x\\},\\{y\\},\\{u_{i}\\mid 0\\leq i\\leq n\\} and their unions. For all (p,q)∈R𝑝𝑞𝑅(p,q)\\in R and R𝑅R-closed sets A𝐴A it holds that |||,\nso R𝑅R is an ε𝜀\\varepsilon-APB. Example 3.5 illustrates that the use of ε𝜀\\varepsilon-APBs as a notion that relates states with almost equivalent behavior is questionable: even though states s𝑠s and t𝑡t in Figure 3 are related by ≡εsubscript𝜀\\equiv_{\\varepsilon}, they behave completely different. This is caused by the set {u0,…,un}subscript𝑢0…subscript𝑢𝑛\\{u_{0},\\dots,u_{n}\\} of (unreachable) states being R𝑅R-closed, which in turn allows to relate s𝑠s and t𝑡t by the relation R𝑅R from the example. Such an anomaly cannot occur for ∼εsubscriptsimilar-to𝜀\\sim_{\\varepsilon}, and we in fact have s≁εtsubscriptnot-similar-to𝜀𝑠𝑡s\\nsim_{\\varepsilon}t in Figure 3 for every ε∈(0,1)𝜀01\\varepsilon\\in(0,1). In particular, this shows that ∼εsubscriptsimilar-to𝜀\\sim_{\\varepsilon} can be strictly finer than ≡εsubscript𝜀\\equiv_{\\varepsilon} for ε∈(0,1)𝜀01\\varepsilon\\in(0,1). Lastly, we introduce up-to-(n,ε)𝑛𝜀(n,\\varepsilon)-bisimulations  3, which are relations that require the behaviors of related states to differ by at most ε𝜀\\varepsilon for at least n𝑛n steps. The up-to-(n,ε)𝑛𝜀(n,\\varepsilon)-bisimulation ∼εn⊆S×S{\\sim_{\\varepsilon}^{n}}\\subseteq S\\times S is inductively defined on n𝑛n via s∼ε0tsuperscriptsubscriptsimilar-to𝜀0𝑠𝑡s\\sim_{\\varepsilon}^{0}t for all s,t∈S𝑠𝑡𝑆s,t\\in S and, for n≥0𝑛0n\\geq 0, s∼εn+1tsuperscriptsubscriptsimilar-to𝜀𝑛1𝑠𝑡s\\sim_{\\varepsilon}^{n+1}t iff for all A⊆S𝐴𝑆A\\subseteq S States s,t𝑠𝑡s,t are (n,ε)𝑛𝜀(n,\\varepsilon)-bisimilar if s∼εntsuperscriptsubscriptsimilar-to𝜀𝑛𝑠𝑡s\\sim_{\\varepsilon}^{n}t, and the notion is lifted to LMCs as usual. Similar to ∼εsubscriptsimilar-to𝜀\\sim_{\\varepsilon} and ≡εsubscript𝜀\\equiv_{\\varepsilon}, ∼εnsuperscriptsubscriptsimilar-to𝜀𝑛\\sim_{\\varepsilon}^{n} is reflexive and symmetric, but not transitive. Instead, it is additive in the tolerances and monotonic in n𝑛n and ε𝜀\\varepsilon, i.e., for n≥n′𝑛superscript𝑛′n\\geq n^{\\prime} and ε≤ε′𝜀superscript𝜀′\\varepsilon\\leq\\varepsilon^{\\prime}, s∼εntsuperscriptsubscriptsimilar-to𝜀𝑛𝑠𝑡s\\sim_{\\varepsilon}^{n}t implies s∼ε′n′tsuperscriptsubscriptsimilar-tosuperscript𝜀′superscript𝑛′𝑠𝑡s\\sim_{\\varepsilon^{\\prime}}^{n^{\\prime}}t 3. It is clear that s∼εntsuperscriptsubscriptsimilar-to𝜀𝑛𝑠𝑡s\\sim_{\\varepsilon}^{n}t for a fixed n𝑛n does not necessarily imply s∼εtsubscriptsimilar-to𝜀𝑠𝑡s\\sim_{\\varepsilon}t or s≡εtsubscript𝜀𝑠𝑡s\\equiv_{\\varepsilon}t, as (n,ε)𝑛𝜀(n,\\varepsilon)-bisimilarity only restricts the behavior of related states for n𝑛n steps. However, considering the limit n→∞→𝑛n\\to\\infty makes ∼εsubscriptsimilar-to𝜀\\sim_{\\varepsilon} and ∼εnsuperscriptsubscriptsimilar-to𝜀𝑛\\sim_{\\varepsilon}^{n} coincide, i.e., s∼εtsubscriptsimilar-to𝜀𝑠𝑡s\\sim_{\\varepsilon}t iff s∼εntsuperscriptsubscriptsimilar-to𝜀𝑛𝑠𝑡s\\sim_{\\varepsilon}^{n}t for all n∈ℕ𝑛ℕn\\in\\mathbb{N} . We now make precise the relationship between ε𝜀\\varepsilon-APBs and up-to-(n,ε)𝑛𝜀(n,\\varepsilon)-bisimulations. If ε∈(0,1)𝜀01\\varepsilon\\in(0,1), s≡εtsubscript𝜀𝑠𝑡s\\equiv_{\\varepsilon}t implies s∼εntsuperscriptsubscriptsimilar-to𝜀𝑛𝑠𝑡s\\sim_{\\varepsilon}^{n}t if n≤2𝑛2n\\leq 2, but not necessarily if n≥3𝑛3n\\geq 3.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: notion of ε𝜀\\varepsilon-bisimulations of Desharnais et al. .
