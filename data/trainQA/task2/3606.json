      "content": "Paper Title: Noisy Tensor Completion via Low-Rank Tensor Ring\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAtensor is an array of numbers, giving a faithful and effective representation to maintain the intrinsic structure of multi-dimensional data . Many data collected in real-world applications can be naturally expressed as high-order tensors. For example, a color video sequence can be viewed as a fourth-order tensor due to its spatial, color and temporal variables; a light field image can be formulated as a fifth-order tensor indexed by one color, two spatial, and two angular variables. For this reason, numerous theoretical and numerical tools for tensor data analysis have been developed and applied in many fields, including computer vision [ref]2, multi-view clustering  , blind source separation , bio-informatics , pattern recognition , etc.\nAmong them, tensor completion is one of the most practical and significant problems, which aims at predicting the missing entries of a low-rank tensor with partial observations. Recent works have demonstrated that the incomplete low-rank tensor can be exactly or approximately recovered under some appropriate assumptions, and have been successfully implemented to broad tensor completion applications [ref]8  0, such as, images and videos inpainting 1 2 3, multi-relational link prediction 4 5, and achieve promising performance. Low-rank tensor completion (LRTC) can be viewed as a multi-dimensional extension of low-rank matrix completion (LRMC) which aims at recovering the intrinsic low-rank matrix with incomplete observations 6 7 8 9 .\nHowever, this extension is rather nontrivial since it is difficult to find a well-defined tensor rank for complex multilinear structure. Two most popular tensor rank definitions are CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) rank  and Tucker rank . For a given tensor, CP decomposition factorizes a tensor into the sum of rank-1 components, and the minimum number of these rank-1 components is defined as the CP rank. However, CP decomposition often suffers from the issue of ill-posedness, i.e., the optimal low-rank approximation does not always exist, which may lead to a poor fit in practical applications  .\nCompared with CP rank, Tucker rank is a more promising alternative, which is defined on the rank of unfolding matrices along each mode .\nSuch treatment is often convenient and reasonable, since it can obtain multi-dimensional low-rank structure maintained in high-order tensors   .\nHowever, this unbalanced (i.e., one versus the others) unfolding scheme often yields fat matrices that have been blamed for their poor restoration performance in LRMC problem. As a result, the performance of Tucker rank based tensor completion methods often tends to degrade due to this inevitable issue  [ref]8. In recent years, several novel tensor rank definitions have been proposed to achieve state-of-the-art tensor completion performance, e.g., tensor train (TT) rank , tensor tree rank 0, and tensor ring (TR) rank 1. Particularly, TR rank is one of the most promising methods. According to the circular structure of TR decomposition, given a high-order tensor, the TR rank minimization problem can be squared to multiple rank minimization subproblems of square unfolding matrix 2, which can conceptually solve the existing issues of Tucker and TT rank. Fig. 1 shows the intuitive representation of TR decomposition and differences between three unfolding schemes. In 3, Wang et al. first introduced a low-rank TR completion model by alternatively minimizing the core tensors. To avoid manually adjusting TR rank, Yuan et al. 4 established a new TR rank minimization scheme by minimizing nuclear norm on all core tensors.\nIn 2, Yu et al. proposed a tensor ring nuclear norm (TRNN) minimization model for LRTC. To guarantee the completion performance of TRNN, Huang et al. 0 further demonstrated that given a tensor satisfied strong TR incoherence condition, it can be exactly recovered with high probability. In 5, Yu et al. proposed a parallel matrix factorization based method for low-TR-rank tensor completion. Most LRTC methods mentioned above assume that the observed entries are noiseless.\nHowever, in real-world applications, data with missing issue caused by sensor failures, storage errors, or other mistakes also usually suffers from noise corruptions.\nThus, it is rather desirable to predict tensor data from both noisy and incomplete observations. Although noisy tensor completion problem is more practical and worthwhile, there is very limited literature and only a few related works on this aspect.\nTensor decomposition or total variation regularization based models have been proposed to alleviate the noisy completion problems 6 2 7, however the statistical performance of all these methods is still unclear. For this reason, Wang et. al introduced several tensor tubal rank based methods to solve third-order noisy tensor completion problem with theoretical guarantee 8 9 0.\nAlbeit interesting and promising, tensor tubal rank is very sensitive to the choice of the third-mode, and particularly difficult to capture complex intra-mode and inter-mode correlations for high-order tensors. In this paper, we propose to recover tensor data from incomplete noisy observations, which substantially generalize noisy matrix completion problem by not only deriving theoretical results and practical applications of noisy completion to high-order tensors, but also providing more scalable and efficient algorithms. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as following. We propose a novel tensor completion model to predict the missing entries with noisy observations based on low-rank TR model, which complements the incompetence of existing works in handling the degeneration of high-order and noisy observations. We analyze a non-asymptotic upper bound of the estimation error to reveal the statistical performance of the proposed model, which has been further proved to be optimal up to a logarithm factor in a minimax sense. We derive two algorithms based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the optimization problem with convergence guarantee, namely, noisy tensor ring completion (NTRC) and Fast NTRC (FaNTRC). For FaNTRC, we minimize the TRNN equivalently on a much smaller tensor in a heterogeneous tensor decomposition framework, which has been shown to significantly improve the computational efficiency, especially dealing with large-scale low-TR-rank tensor data. The proposed NTRC and FaNTRC are successfully implemented in various noisy tensor data completion problems, the experimental results demonstrate their superiority compared with state-of-the-art LRTC methods. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.\nSection II presents a brief review on some notations and preliminaries. In Section III, we introduce the noisy tensor ring completion model, and analyze its non-asymptotic upper bound on Frobenius norm, which has been further proved to be near-optimal in a minimax sense. In Section IV, we develop two efficient algorithms to solve the optimization problem with convergence guarantee. Section V gives experimental results of noisy tensor completion tasks on both synthetic and real-world tensor data.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: two spatial, and two angular variables.
