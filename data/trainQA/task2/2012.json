      "content": "Paper Title: Continual World: A Robotic Benchmark For Continual Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe field of continual learning has grown considerably in the past years, with numerous works forming new subfields 3 and finding novel applications [ref]48. For brevity, we focus only on the papers proposing RL-based benchmarks and point to selected surveys of the entire field.  provide a high-level overview of CL and argue that learning in a non-stationary setting is a fundamental problem for the development of AI, highlighting the frequent connections to neuroscience. On the other hand, [ref]13  focus on describing, evaluating, and relating CL methods to each other, providing a taxonomy of CL solutions that we use in this work. The possibility of applying CL methods in reinforcement learning scenarios has been explored for a long time, see  for a recent review. However, no benchmark has been widely accepted by the community so far, which is the aim of this work. Below we discuss various benchmarks and environments considered in the literature. Supervised settings MNIST has been widely used to benchmark CL algorithms in two forms . In the permuted MNIST, the pixels of images are randomly permuted to form new tasks. In the split MNIST, tasks are defined by classifying non-overlapping subsets of classes, e.g. 00 vs. 111 followed by 222 vs. 333. A similar procedure has been applied to various image classification tasks like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Omniglot or mini-ImageNet   . Another benchmark is CORe50 , a dataset for continuous object recognition. Recent work 9 proposes a benchmark based on language modeling. We find that many of these benchmarks are challenging and allow to measure forgetting. However, we argue they are not geared towards measuring forward transfer or for highlighting important RL-specific characteristics of the CL problem. Atari The Atari 2600 suite  is a widely accepted RL benchmark. Sequences of different Atari games have been used for evaluating continual learning approaches  . Using Atari can be computationally expensive, e.g., training a sequence of ten games typically requires 100100100M steps or more. More importantly, as  notes, these games lack a meaningful overlap, limiting their relevance for studying transfers. Continuous control  4 use continuous control tasks such as Humanoid or Walker2D. However, the considered sequences are short, and the range of experiments is limited.  use Meta-World tasks, similarly to us, for evaluations of their continual learning method, but the work is not aimed at building a benchmark. As such, it uses the Meta-World’s MT10 preset and does not provide an in-depth analysis of the tasks or other CL methods. Maze navigation A set of 3D maze environments is used in . The map structure and objects that the agent needs to collect change between tasks. It is not clear, though, if the tasks provide enough diversity.  propose CRLMaze, 3D navigation scenarios for continual learning, which solely concentrate on changes of the visual aspects. StarCraft  present a StarCraft campaign (111111 tasks) to evaluate a high-level transfer of skills. The main drawback of this benchmark is excessive computational demand (often more than 111B frames). Minecraft 0 propose simple scenarios within the Minecraft domain along with a hierarchical learning method. The authors phrase the problem as lifelong learning and do not use typical CL methods.\nLifelong Hanabi  consider a multi-agent reinforcement learning setting based on Hanabi, a cooperative game requiring significant coordination between agents. On the other hand, we focus on the single agent setting with changing environment, which allows us to bypass the computational complexity needed to model interactions between agents and highlight issues connected to learning in a changing world. Causal World  propose an environment for robotic manipulation tasks which share causal structure. Although they investigate issues deeply connected to learning in a changing world, such as generalization to new tasks and curricula, they do not directly consider continual learning.\nJelly Bean World 9 provide interesting procedurally generated grid world environments. The suite is configurable and can host a non-stationary setting. It is unclear, however, if such environments reflect the characteristics of real-world challenges.\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: The field of continual learning has grown considerably in the past years, with numerous works forming new subfields 3 and finding novel applications [ref]48.
