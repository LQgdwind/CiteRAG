      "content": "Paper Title: Distributed Pruning Towards Tiny Neural Networks in Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe involve the following baseline approaches in the study. We include SNIP, SynFlow, and FL-PQSU to confirm that pruning at initialization is not the optimal design choice when the local data are invisible.111We implement these frameworks based on their open-source implementations https://github.com/ganguli-lab/Synaptic-Flow.We choose well-known baselines, PruneFL , FedDST [ref]29 and LotteryFL [ref]10, to compare the performance of the FedTiny. We exclude the FL pruning approaches that are infeasible for memory-constrained FL. For example, FedPrune  and ZeroFL [ref]28 require powerful devices to continuously process the dense models. SNIP  prunes model by connection sensitivity at initialization with a small public dataset on the server. SynFlow  prunes model by iteratively conserving synaptic flow on the server before training. FL-PQSU  prunes model in a one-shot manner based on l1subscript𝑙1l_{1}-norm on the server before training. FL-PQSU also includes quantization and selective update parts, but we only use the pruning part in FL-PQSU. PruneFL  uses a powerful device to initially prune the model and applies finer pruning (adaptive pruning) on the sparse model based on full-size averaged gradients. But all devices are resource-constrained in our setting. Therefore, we let PruneFL get the initial pruned model on the server with a small public dataset. LotteryFL [ref]10 iteratively prunes dense model with a fixed pruning rate on devices and re-initializes the pruned model with the initial values. FedDST [ref]29 first random prunes an initial pruned model on the server, then it deploys the mask adjustment on the devices, and the server uses sparse aggregation and magnitude pruning to obtain a new global model. Since SNIP  and PruneFL  require some data for coarse pruning, we assume that the server provides a public one-shot dataset 𝒟ssubscript𝒟𝑠\\mathcal{D}_{s} for pretraining. All baselines start with a model pre-trained with the one-shot dataset 𝒟ssubscript𝒟𝑠\\mathcal{D}_{s} on the server.\nFor SNIP, we apply iterative pruning instead of one-shot pruning as  shown. Similarly, we let SynFlow prune the model at initialization to the target density in an iterative manner.\nFor SNIP and SynFlow, we set 100 pruning epochs on the server at initialization; refer to .\nFor FL-PQSU, which is originally structured pruning, we change it to unstructured pruning since all the other baselines are unstructured pruning frameworks.\nLotteryFL [ref]10 is designed for personalized federated learning, so the model structures are different among devices. Since we attempt to find an optimal structure for all devices as in Eq. 1, we let LotteryFL iteratively prune the global model instead of on-device models to ensure the same model structure for each device.\nFedDST [ref]29 deploys mask adjustment on devices and fine-tunes the parameters before uploading. We let FedDST adjust the masks after 3 epochs of local training, followed by 2 epochs of fine-tuning.\nSince LotteryFL, PruneFL, FedDST, and our FedTiny are iteratively pruning during training, we use the same pruning schedule for these frameworks, where the framework does Δ​R=10Δ𝑅10\\Delta R=10 rounds of fine-tuning between two finer pruning. And framework stops pruning and continues fine-tuning after Rs​t​o​p=100subscript𝑅𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑝100R_{stop}=100 rounds. For PruneFL and FedDST, we set the pruning number atlsubscriptsuperscript𝑎𝑙𝑡a^{l}_{t} to be the same as in FedTiny. All baselines will apply uniform sparsity distribution for layer-wise pruning rate setting.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: the local data are invisible.111We implement these frameworks based on their open-source implementations https://github.com/ganguli-lab/Synaptic-Flow.We choose well-known baselines, PruneFL , FedDST [ref]29 and LotteryFL [ref]10, to compare the performance of the FedTiny. We exclude the FL pruning approaches that are infeasible for memory-constrained FL.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
