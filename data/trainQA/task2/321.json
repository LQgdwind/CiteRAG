It works by modelling the relation between a head entity and a tail entity as a translation in vector space, and embeds KG information by optimising the positions of entities and relations globally across the embedding space. Figure 1 (\\autopagereffig:translational) includes a depiction of how entities and relations are represented in the TransE model. The TransE model was however found to be too restrictive in representing relations. While it is suitable for embedding KGs with one-to-one relations, it is unable to sufficiently embed the full properties of KGs that contain one-to-many, many-to-one and many-to-many relations  . Models extending the capabilities of TransE have been proposed, these include TransH  and TransR , as well as more recent models which seek to extend specific aspects of each of these three models. TransH, proposed in  casts the representation of each relation as a hyperplane in the vector space. Relations between entities are then translations across these hyperplanes. In doing so, TransH expands the capability of TransE to represent multiple relations between entities. An illustration of the approach taken in TransH can be found in Figure 1 (\\autopagereffig:translational). The TransR model in  adopts a different approach by embedding relations and entities in separate vector spaces. Specifically, each relation in TransR is represented by a projection matrix. An application of the projection matrix of relation r on the entities embedding space will project the entities onto r’s embedding space. Therefore, a translation of r on the head entity in this r-projected space will identify tail entities it is related to by r, within a neighbourhood of the translation. In doing so, TransE extends the representational power of TransH by allow translations beyond hyperplanes, in higher dimensional vector spaces. While these extensions increase the expressivity of the initial TransE model, the expressivity comes at the expense of higher complexity . For instance, TransR requires a projection matrix for each relation in the KG, thereby increasing significantly the training and memory requirement for the model.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: The TransE model proposed in [ref]4 is the earliest member of the translational class of KG embedding models.
