      "content": "Paper Title: SDGMNet: Statistic-based Dynamic Gradient Modulation for Local Descriptor Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTriplet sampling. Triplet sampling strategy proposed by HardNet [ref]24 has become the de-facto standard for local descriptor learning. Briefly, HardNet follows L2Net [ref]44 to sample N𝑁N matching pairs. For a matching pair, HardNet mines the nearest negative neighbor as the negative example in the triplet. We follow the strategy and employ the anti-noise threshold for hard negative mining. The threshold in angular distance is set to 0.6. Network architecture. L2Net [ref]44 proposes a classic encoder, in which batch normalization  and ReLU are employed after each convolution layer except for the last one. HyNet  replaces these normalization layers to learnable Filter Response Normalization (FRN) and TLU . Moreover, it introduces an additional normalization layer at the input of the encoder. These modifications remarkably improve local deep descriptor learning with little cost. We adopt this network architecture and illustrate it in Fig. 3. Statistics estimation. There are some statistical arguments varying over time in SDGMNet, which make the modulation dynamic. We employ rough Bayesian sequential update [ref]3 to estimate these arguments as: where 𝜷tsubscript𝜷𝑡\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{t} is the vector of approximated global statistics and 𝝁tsubscript𝝁𝑡\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{t} is the estimation in batch at t𝑡tth iteration. The past data provide a priori to current training. A fixed replacement rate 0.0010.0010.001 is sensitive enough for the former stage and stable for the latter stage of training. Input: SDGMNet hyperparameters m𝑚m and α𝛼\\alpha, vector of initial statistics 𝜷0subscript𝜷0\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{0}, raw model, dataset, optimizer. t=1𝑡1t=1; Output: Well-trained model. Pseudo loss. We avoid an explicit loss that owns the gradient shown in Eqn. (13). Motivated by general pair weighting framework , we define pseudo loss as: where α𝛼\\alpha, w𝑤w, Et​[P+]subscript𝐸𝑡delimited-[]superscript𝑃E_{t}[P^{+}] and Et​[P−]subscript𝐸𝑡delimited-[]superscript𝑃E_{t}[P^{-}] are all constant with regard to the model parameter 𝛀𝛀\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}. The gradient of pseudo loss is the same as Eqn. (13) so it can be used to exercise the SDGMNet. Pseudo loss holds an ambiguous optimum and does not satisfy the conditions to be a loss. It is a more general tool to guide the training with arbitrary gradient modulation strategies. Settings. We implement SDGMNet in PyTorch . The procedure of SDGMNet is shown in Algorithm 1, where we set m=0.6𝑚0.6m=0.6 and α=0.9𝛼0.9\\alpha=0.9 for the best performance. The network is trained for 200200200 epochs (200200200K iterations) with batch size of 1024 and SGD optimizer. Data augmentation is achieved by random rotation, flipping and cropping   . Momentum and weight decay of the optimizer are set to 0.90.90.9 and 0.00010.00010.0001, respectively. The learning rate is initialized with 1 and divided by 2 after each 10%percent1010\\% of iterations. Moreover, the training is warmed up with w=1𝑤1w=1 in the first 10%percent1010\\% of iterations. During warming, only E​[P+]𝐸delimited-[]superscript𝑃E[P^{+}] and E​[P−]𝐸delimited-[]superscript𝑃E[P^{-}] function but all statistics are estimated in every iteration. As a result, only the initial values of E​[P+]𝐸delimited-[]superscript𝑃E[P^{+}] and E​[P−]𝐸delimited-[]superscript𝑃E[P^{-}] contribute to the full SDGMNet training. We set them to 10000 so that the equivalent learning rate could act similarly as one cycle learning rate policy .\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: Triplet sampling.
