      "content": "Paper Title: Masked Autoencoding for Scalable and Generalizable Decision Making\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSelf-supervised pretraining has made tremendous successes for unsupervised representation learning in natural language processing (NLP) and vision¬† [ref]9  [ref]4.\nThese methods work by predicting a removed portion of the data, which is often referred to as masked token prediction.\nBy varying the masking patterns and architectures, different methods have been developed for NLP and vision, e.g.formulae-sequenceùëíùëîe.g., Transformer¬†4, GPT¬†[ref]4, BERT¬†[ref]9, and MAE¬†.\nThese methods are simple to implement and scalable to large Internet-scale datasets and deep neural networks, leading to excellent flexibility and generalization for downstream tasks¬†[ref]9  . In this work, we explore the generality of masked token prediction for generalizable and flexible reinforcement learning (RL).\nPrior work has explored sequence modeling for sequential decision making in the context of offline RL e.g.formulae-sequenceùëíùëîe.g. decision transformer (DT)¬† and trajectory transformer (TT)¬†4, and black-box optimization e.g.formulae-sequenceùëíùëîe.g. transformer neural processes (TNP)¬†.\nThese methods are based on autoregressive next token prediction, similar to GPT¬†[ref]4.\nWhile promising, these works do not leverage diverse unlabeled data for generalization across various downstream tasks.\nIn addition, DT¬† needs reward-labeled high quality datasets, while TT¬†4 requires discretizing states and actions, further limiting its applicability.\nThe flexibility of applying arbitrary masks for executing various task specifications in RL significantly lags behind NLP and vision. We propose Masked Decision Prediction (MaskDP), a pretraining method to learn generalizable models that achieve data-efficient adaptation to various downstream tasks.\nMaskDP is a self-supervised pretraining method that can leverage unlabeled diverse data. With MaskDP pretraining, the model can generalize well to both goal reaching and offline RL, two distinctive and popular RL paradigms. Our first key observation is that masked token prediction with random masking similar to BERT¬†[ref]9 and MAE¬† provides a general and flexible way for learning from unsupervised data.\nUnlike autoregressive action prediction used in prior works, random masking is strictly more general and requires the model to infer masked out states and actions, and thus leads to a single model that can reason about both the forward and inverse dynamics from each sample. Our second key observation\nis that since states and actions are highly correlated temporally, trajectories have significantly lower information density, i.eformulae-sequenceùëñùëíi.e, it is easier to predict action or state based on nearby states and actions.\nConsequently, a high mask ratio (95%percent9595\\%) is necessary to make reconstruction task meaningful.\nUnlike in MAE¬† and BERT¬†[ref]9 where the goal is learning representations, we want to directly apply MaskDP to various downstream tasks, and different mask ratios induce different pre-train and downstream gaps. For example, consider the goal-reaching task within certain time limit. Given current state, future goal and mask tokens between them, the model should be able to inpaint intermediate actions as the goal-reaching plan. The mask ratio varies from short-term plans to long-term plans. Therefore, we combine multiple different mask ratios (e.g.formulae-sequenceùëíùëîe.g. 15%percent1515\\%, 35%percent3535\\%, 75%percent7575\\%, and 95%percent9595\\%), and mask a portion of data using a randomly sampled mask ratio.\nOur experiments show that doing so is crucial to achieving high performance. We show that self-supervised pretrained MaskDP achieves high performance in challenging multiple goals reaching setting, outperforming strong baselines in a zero-shot manner. We highlight our key results here: Single goal reaching: MaskDP achieves performance that exceeds or matches both training from scratch task-specific methods and other pretraining based methods. Sequential multiple goal reaching: MaskDP can reach a sequence of goals effectively, even without closed-loop execution, while outperforming iterative baselines significantly. Offline RL: MaskDP achieves competitive results as specialized approaches. Notably, we demonstrate that non-autoregressive architecture works well for offline RL tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: Self-supervised pretraining has made tremendous successes for unsupervised representation learning in natural language processing (NLP) and vision¬† [ref]9  [ref]4.\nThese methods work by predicting a removed portion of the data, which is often referred to as masked token prediction.\nBy varying the masking patterns and architectures, different\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
