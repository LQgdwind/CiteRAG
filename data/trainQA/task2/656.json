      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning in Bayesian Stackelberg Markov Games for Adaptive Moving Target Defense\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe complexity of modern-day software technology has made the goal of deploying fully secure cyber-systems impossible. Furthermore, an attacker often has ample time to explore a deployed system before exploiting it. To level the playing field, researchers have introduced the idea of proactive cyber defenses such as Moving Target Defense.\nIn Moving Target Defense (MTD), the defender shifts between various configurations of the cyber-system . This makes the attacker’s knowledge, gathered during the reconnaissance phase, useless at attack time as the system may have shifted to a new configuration in the window between reconnaissance and attack. To ensure that an MTD system is effective at maximizing security and minimizing the impact on the system’s performance, the consideration of an optimal movement strategy is important [ref]2 . MTD systems render themselves naturally to a game-theoretic formulation– modeling the cyber-system as a two-player game between the defender and an attacker is commonplace. The expectation is that the equilibrium of these games yields an optimal (mixed) strategy that guides the defender on how to move their dynamic cyber-system in the presence of a strategic and rational adversary. The notion of Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium predominantly underlies the definition of optimal strategies in these settings [ref]4  as the defender deploys a system first (acting as a leader) while the attacker, who seeks to attack the deployed system, assumes the role of the follower. In many real-world scenarios, single-stage normal-form games do not provide sufficient expressiveness to capture the switching costs of actions [ref]4  or reason about the adversary’s sequential behavior  . On the other hand, works that consider modeling the MTD as a multi-stage stochastic game  0 1 , do not model incomplete information about adversaries, a key aspect of the single-stage normal-form formalism (known as Bayesian Stackelberg Games (BSG) 2 ). To address these concerns about expressiveness, while remaining scalable for use in cyber-security settings, we propose the unifying framework of Bayesian Stackelberg Markov Games (BSMG).\nWe show that BSMGs can be used to model various Moving Target Defense scenarios, capturing the uncertainty over attacker types and sequential impacts of attacks and switching defenses. We characterize the notion of optimal strategy as the Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium of BSMGs and show that the robust (movement) strategy improves the state-of-the-art found by previous game-theoretic modeling. While multi-stage game models are ubiquitous in security settings, expecting experts to provide detailed models about rewards and system transitions is considered unrealistic. Thus, researchers have considered techniques in reinforcement learning to learn optimal movement policies over time 3 4 5 6. Unfortunately, these works ignore (1) the strategic nature and the rational behavior of an adversary and (2) the incomplete knowledge a defender may possess about their opponent. This, as we show in our experiments, results in a new attack surface where the defender’s movement policy can be exploited by an adversary. To mitigate this, we bridge the knowledge gap between existing work, and techniques in multi-agent reinforcement learning by proposing a Bayesian Strong Stackelberg Q-learning (BSS-Q) approach (graphically shown in Figure 1). First, we can show that BSS-Q converges to the Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium of BSMGs. Second, we design an Open-AI gym 7 style multi-agent environment for two Moving Target Defenses (one for web-application and the other for cloud-network security) and compare the effectiveness of policies learned by BSS-Q against existing state-of-the-art static policies and other reinforcement learning agents. In the next section, we motivate the need for a unifying framework and formally describe the proposed game-theoretic model of BSMGs. We briefly discuss how two Moving Target Defenses are modeled as BSGMs. We then introduce the Bayesian Strong Stackelberg Q-learning approach and show that it converges to the SSE of BSMGs, followed by a section showcasing experimental results. Finally, before concluding, we discuss related work.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: and attack.
