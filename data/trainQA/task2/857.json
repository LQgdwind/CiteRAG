The analysis of largely digital traces of social networks at scale expanded well-studied mathematical algorithms for reinforcement, information processing, social judgment, balance, and dissonance . Wasserman et al. introduced social network analysis as algebraic graph representations and proposed a series of statistical tests . The domain research has focused on predicting the existence and/or sentiments of edges in the graph, recommending content or a product, or identifying unusual trends. Baseline signed graph theory was used to explain the relative status that individuals hold within in a social network   and focused on socially-conscious science to help understand bias, controversy, conflict, and trust  . All mathematical models in network science that model intents and trends in online social networks have relied on aspects of well-established consensus-based models in signed graph theory    and balanced modeling  7    . A multitude of measures have been proposed to access the rich information coded in signed graphs. Mishra et al.  introduces trustworthiness and deserve as local vertex-based measures of bias to reflect the expected weights of out- and in-edges. Controversy was introduced by Garimella et al.  as the likelihood a random walk will return to the same side of the network. This method improved the examination of triangles in  by including pendant vertices and proposed to reduce controversy by bridging opposing viewpoints. Conflict is defined in Chen et al.  by examining the Laplacian matrix to produce a ‚ÄúConservation Law of Conflict‚Äù reminiscent of Kirchhoff‚Äôs laws ‚Äî we provide our own Conservation Law of Controversy in subsection 4.3. Kumar et al.  discuss group mobilization against other groups to describe conflict in intra-community interactions, and Guha et al.  examines trust through an iterative build of belief matrix. Yuan et al.  introduces a sign prediction model for sparse data edge prediction in which they convert the original graph into a edge-dual graph and apply machine learning to predict signs in sparse graphs. Established methods of network graph analysis focus on endorsement analysis through local topology analytics and strive for agreement by changing , adding  or removing  edges in the graph. We propose to analyze the signed graph in its entirety and characterize the vertices and edges through frustration cloud-based attributes. In cybernetics, a multi-agent network dynamic is often too complex for existing tools to analyze the entire network and collective dynamic reactions. It is known  that our methodology for balancing a signed graph works on any signed graph and certain classes of hypergraphs. Altafini   proposes controllability and consensus algorithms in networks by examining the effects of the bipartite consensus of Harary . Pan et al. 0 examine the bipartite structure of Laplaican dynamics and node decomposition. Hu et al. show that the ideal state of the multi-agent system can modeled as a balanced graph, and that the system converges to the optimal state through the bipartite consensus iterations , while uncontrollability and stabilizability is examined by Alemzadeh et al. in . Algorithms for the characterization of the status quo have been examined in 5 for transitive graphs. Jiang et al. propose a sign-driven consensus as a control protocol measured via Laplacian dynamics [ref]29. She et al. 9 examine consensus in terms of graphical characterizations of the controllability of signed networks and offers a heuristic algorithm for leader selection based on balance theory. This prior work focuses on producing a single balanced state. In this paper, we propose a discrete alternative to find all nearest balanced states of the network via frustration cloud graph analysis.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: for the characterization of the status quo have been examined in 5 for transitive graphs.
