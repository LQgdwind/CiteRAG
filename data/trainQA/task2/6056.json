      "content": "Paper Title: Controllable One-Shot Face Video Synthesis With Semantic Aware Prior\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe ability to animate static images has numerous important applications such as film production, digital advertisement, video dubbing and immersive communication  . In this paper, we revisit the problem of one-shot face video synthesis, where a portrait image is given, and animated by a driving video. The resulting video, therefore, preserves the face appearance from the portrait image, while pose and expression are inherited from the driving video. There are many existing attempts to tackle face video synthesis by using deep generative models, and they can be broadly summarized into two paradigms. The first line of works     relies solely on learning-based image reconstruction, which typically is subject-specific and requires hours of video footage of source subjects to fit the appearance and motion of a source, so that in the inference, the model can map the source directly to the target video in an image-to-image translation manner. Recently, various methods  [ref]38 [ref]7     [ref]35 have been proposed to build a generic model that is applicable to any source subject under one-shot setting, which is much more challenging given the minimal input. Thanks to the advanced power of GANs and the disentangled representation in appearance and motion, keypoints-based motion-warping methods have made notable progress in driving expression and pose in arbitrary view. Specifically, Monkey-Net  proposes a network that transfers the deformation from sparse to dense motion flow. FOMM  extends Monkey-Net via the first-order local transformations. Then, Face-vid2vid [ref]35 improves FOMM via a learned 3D unsupervised keypoints for free-view talking head generation. Besides achieving good photo-realism, their formulation remains lightweight, only involving a single source image and a sequence of compact self-learned keypoints, which essentially enables some novel applications like low bandwidth video conferencing. However, based on our studies, these end-to-end learned unsupervised keypoints have two major limitations as can be seen in Fig. 1. Firstly, unsatisfactory generation quality in the case of large head poses, and the existence of observable pose misalignment between the source and the first frame in driving videos. We conjecture the former is highly correlated with the missing of external supervision on the keypoints learning. While the latter hinders their usability, as such assumption is not always met therefore it’s not guaranteed that generated samples would follow the driver. Secondly, failing to capture fine yet critical facial motion details, e.g., in row 2, the driver frame has a smile-like expression, however, its magnitude can not meticulously be captured in the generated frame. We argue this is due to the lack of semantic understanding and appropriate face geometry regularization. We also visualized the learned unsupervised keypoints in Fig. 1, intuitively, limited keypoints are assigned to the important regions such as the eyes and mouth. Lastly, we observe that the two aforementioned issues can not be simply solved via scaling up the number of unsupervised keypoints. Adding more keypoints usually does not lead to a more accurate flow estimation, on the contrary, it may even deteriorate the performance. We propose to improve the motion-warping-based methods by leveraging a readily available prior knowledge of faces. As different from other objects, face, a regular object, has been well studied since the early graphics community, and 3D faces model provides a powerful prior for rendering and editing via the parameters modulation. Therefore, we simply grab an off-the-shelf face model: 3DMM , and plug it into our pipeline, but any other face model shall flexibly work. We focus on identifying the best generative strategy compatible with low bandwidth cost and real-time inference. Different from the previous methods  [ref]38 [ref]7 that rely on dense mesh, we demonstrate that by only resorting to a few sparse keypoints extracted from prior, our learned generator can achieve identity preservation, and better transfer the pose and expression even under the large head poses. Our contributions can be summarized in the followings: 1) We empirically verify the limitation of current unsupervised keypoint-based one-shot face video synthesis methods, and propose a novel framework equipped with a plug-and-play face prior, besides robustness, it enables several new functionalities: flexible expression editing and novel view synthesis. 2) We provide a comparative analysis of design choices to address the flaw that leads to inaccurate warping. Moreover, person-agnostic expression information is utilized to further enhance the model performance in faithfully retaining fine-grained expression. 3) We have done comprehensive experiments to investigate the trade-off between synthesis quality (geometric correspondences, expression preserving) and bandwidth, our strategy consistently outperforms the baseline model across different bandwidths.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: to fit the appearance and motion of a source, so that in the inference, the model can map the source directly to the target video in an image-to-image translation manner.
