      "content": "Paper Title: Time-Aware Neighbor Sampling for Temporal Graph Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we present the performance of TGN models implemented with our neighbor sampling methods.\nWe compare our proposed method against a variety of strong baselines (adapted for temporal settings when possible) on the task of edge prediction and node classification.\nOur experimental settings closely follow those of the previous work    to ensure a fair comparison.\nAs for the evaluation metrics, we follow   to use the average precision (AP) and accuracy in edge prediction and employ the area under the ROC accuracy curve (AUC) for node classification . We use three standard temporal graph datasets: MOOC, Reddit, and Wikipedia for evaluation.\nThe MOOC dataset consists of actions, e.g., viewing a video, submitting an answer, etc. done by students on a MOOC online course .\nThe Reddit dataset consists of one month of posts made by users on subreddits .\nThe user posts have textual features that are transformed into a 172-dimensional vector representing its linguistic inquiry and word count (LIWC) categories.\nThe Wikipedia dataset includes one month of edits on Wikipedia pages .\nThe statistics of these datasets are shown in Table 1.\nWe do the\nchronological train-validation-test split with a\nratio of 70%-15%-15% following  . For the hyper-parameters of baseline methods, e.g., the number of sampled neighbors, the number of hidden units, the optimizer, the number of modules, the number of sampled neighbors, and the learning rate, we set them as suggested by their authors.\nFor the hyper-parameters of our TNS method, we set the gradient factor of the expansion learning module as α=0.1𝛼0.1\\alpha=0.1, and the standard deviation σ=10−5𝜎superscript105\\sigma=10^{-5} for the initialization of the expansion learning module by default. \n\n\n\nDataset\n##\\#Nodes\n##\\#Edges\n##\\#Nodes in val./test.\n##\\#Edges in val./test.\n##\\#Nodes with dynamic labels\nNodes’ label type\n\n\n\nMOOC\n7,144\n411,749\n2,599/2,412\n61,762/61,763\n4,066\ncourse dropout\n\nReddit\n10,984\n672,447\n9,839/9,615\n100,867/100,867\n366\nposting ban\n\nWikipedia\n9,227\n157,474\n3,256/3,564\n23,621/23,621\n217\nediting ban\n\n \n\n\n\nMethod\nMOOC\nReddit\nWikipedia\n\nAccuracy\nAP\nAccuracy\nAP\nAccuracy\nAP\n\nCTDNE \n65.34 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.7\n74.29 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.6\n73.76 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.5\n91.41 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.3\n79.42 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.4\n92.17 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.5\n\nJODIE \n76.45 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.6\n83.87 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.4\n90.91 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.3\n97.11 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.3\n87.04 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.4\n94.62 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.5\n\nDyRep [ref]19\n73.36 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.4\n81.75 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.3\n92.11 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.2\n97.98 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.1\n87.77 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.2\n94.59 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.2\n\nTGAT \n75.20 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.5\n82.66 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.4\n92.92 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.3\n98.12 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.2\n88.14 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.2\n95.34 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.1\n\nTGN \n81.38 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.6\n89.79 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.5\n92.56 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.2\n98.70 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.1\n89.51 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.4\n98.46 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.1\n\nTGAT + TNS (Ours)\n80.76 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.5\n89.20 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.3\n93.95 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.3\n98.68 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.1\n89.59 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.2\n96.73 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.1\n\nTGN + TNS (Ours)\n84.42 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.3\n92.54 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.3\n94.04 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.2\n98.93 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.1\n91.61 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.2\n98.93 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.1\n\n \n\n\n\nMethod\nMOOC\nReddit\nWikipedia\n\nAccuracy\nAP\nAccuracy\nAP\nAccuracy\nAP\n\nJODIE \n75.79 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.5\n83.44 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.6\n88.34 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.9\n94.36 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 1.1\n84.32 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.4\n93.11 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.4\n\nDyRep [ref]19\n72.92 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.4\n80.36 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.4\n89.60 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.2\n95.68 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.2\n83.46 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.3\n92.05 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.3\n\nTGAT \n74.02 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.3\n80.84 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.5\n90.73 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.2\n96.62 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.3\n85.35 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.2\n93.99 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.3\n\nTGN \n80.73 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.2\n89.21 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.3\n91.62 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.1\n97.55 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.1\n88.60 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.2\n97.81 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.1\n\nTGAT + TNS (Ours)\n80.45 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.3\n87.82 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.4\n91.89 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.2\n97.09 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.2\n87.27 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.2\n95.84 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.3\n\nTGN + TNS (Ours)\n83.81 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.2\n91.36 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.3\n92.71 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.1\n98.02 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.1\n91.14 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.2\n98.42 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.1\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: 0.5\n\nJODIE \n76.45 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.6\n83.87 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.4\n90.91 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.3\n97.11 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.3\n87.04 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.4\n94.62 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.5\n\nDyRep [ref]19\n73.36 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.4\n81.75 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.3\n92.11 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.2\n97.98 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.1\n87.77 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.2\n94.59 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.2\n\nTGAT \n75.20\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
