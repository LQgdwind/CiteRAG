      "content": "Paper Title: Predictive Compliance Monitoring in Process-Aware Information Systems: State of the Art, Functionalities, Research Directions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHeterogeneous data from distributed processes and (contextual) data sources\nChallenge:\nFirst approaches start addressing data requirements in PPM and PCM. However, approaches for event and constraint data from distributed and heterogeneous sources and processes are missing. Moreover, the ongoing exploitation of contextual data is promising, but under-researched yet. \nResearch direction: Future research on heterogeneous data for PCM may have to borrow techniques from data integration research that deal with the problems of, for example, entity recognition, data fusion or schema alignment  before the line of research that tackles the problems of event extraction, event abstraction and handling event data that does not come with a single case identifier can be followed. In particular for event data that does not come with a single case identifier, a new field of research within process mining called object-centric process mining that conceptualizes such event data as object-centric event logs (OCEL)  is emerging. These problems are likely to occur, if relevant data on processes is distributed across multiple information systems either within a company or among partners. These problems are aggravated when compliance constraints are not stated in a machine-readable format carrying semantics of a logic such as LTL. Typically, constraints are stated in natural language and scattered across multiple regulatory documents (cf. Ex. 1). Then, the regulatory documents are further data sources that are challenging to include, as constraints have to be extracted in a way that we can match events/activities with them. Including context data potentially coming from other sources than the process data into PCM can significantly increase prediction capabilities and quality. In manufacturing processes, for example, several sensor data streams are measured continuously that report the environment state/context of the process, e.g., the temperature of a room/machine or the fluid level in the machine. Detecting deviations in the context data can increase prediction effectiveness, e.g., concept drifts might be predicted early . Additionally, data value prediction might not only refer to process data, but also to contextual data such as time series, for example, if decision rules are based on time series data such as temperature [ref]169. Here, the combination of PCM with time series prediction approaches constitutes a promising research direction . \nPrediction and compliance in process choreographies\nChallenge: This challenge is related to the previous challenge on data from multiple sources as the choreography of partner processes results in heterogeneous data sources, e.g., one data source per partner. Especially for choreographies, additional challenges arise from confidentiality requirements of the partners, i.e., aggravates the challenges for multiple, heterogeneous data sources by restricted visibility of the data. As a consequence, as there can exist constraints spanning multiple partners, predicting compliance in this distributed setting is a task that typically cannot be performed at one partnerâ€™s side. Hence, process choreographies pose new challenges for PCM such as how the prediction and checking of constraints is actually performed (in a distributed way?). If private processes of partners come into play, the prediction of and checking of constraints has to adhere to privacy and confidentiality requirements. \nResearch direction: Although first approaches enable to check compliance in process choreographies (e.g., [ref]143), the problem of predicting compliance in process choreographies has not been addressed so far. One challenge arises from the confidentiality requirements of the private partner processes: if they are affected by compliance predictions, it might become necessary to distribute the prediction among the partners. This endeavour may be realized by means of secure multi-party computation . \nData properties and quality\nChallenge: The exploitation of data properties and quality is promising. One drawback of existing PPM approaches with respect to the input data is the assumption of label equivalence, i.e., the prediction are based on labels of events. Label equivalence is not sufficient, particularly when merging event streams from heterogeneous input sources (variety). Another challenge is the size of the input data which can be too small or too big (volume). For distributed processes, event streams might contain information on message exchanges between partners â€“how can they be exploited for prediction or being predicted themselves?â€“ and might also contain hidden/invisible parts due to confidentiality requirements of the partners. Here, an initial hurdle is the lack of data sets. Another one is that event logs in practice are error-prone . When considering data quality, the data values of low quality may signify a compliance violation or be used as a feature for prediction. Determining whether the former is the case and the latter is beneficial, is yet another challenge. \nResearch direction: To tackle variety challenges, PPM and PCM can benefit from equivalence notions that aim at the functionality of activities, e.g., attribute equivalence . First approaches for dealing with volume challenges boost small data sets  [ref]173. Other approaches aiming at efficiency and performance of PPM and PCM with respect to both, volume and high velocity event streams are missing (note that for PCM also a large set of compliance constraints might exist). To deal with PCM in distributed settings, the collection, provision, and preparation of (real-world) data for different process scenarios containing multiple perspectives remains an ongoing direction of research. With respect to data quality and its exploitation in a PCM system, approaches are missing. Here, PCM can investigate based on work considering data quality as uncertain data values  .\n\nReference markers found: [169]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]169: data value prediction might not only refer to process data, but also to contextual data such as time series, for example, if decision rules are based on time series data such as temperature [ref]169.
