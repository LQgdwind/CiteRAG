      "content": "Paper Title: Expansion Laws for Forward-Reverse, Forward, and Reverse Bisimilarities via Proved Encodings\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper we have exhibited expansion laws for forward bisimilarity, which is interleaving, and reverse\nand forward-reverse bisimilarities, which are truly concurrent. To uniformly develop them, we have resorted\nto the proved trees approach of¬†, which has turned out to be effective also in our setting. With\nrespect to other truly concurrent semantics to which the approach was applied, such as causal and location\nbisimilarities, the operational semantics of our reversible calculus does not carry the additional\ndiscriminating information within transition labels. However, we have been able to derive it from those\nlabels and shown to consist of backward ready sets for both reverse and forward-reverse bisimilarities.\nAnother technical difficulty that we have faced is the encoding of concurrent processes in which both\nsubprocesses have executed non-synchronizing actions, because their expansions cannot contain executed\nactions on both sides of an alternative composition. For completeness we mention that in¬† proved\nsemantics has already been employed in a reversible setting, for a different purpose though. As for future work, an obvious direction is to exploit the same approach to find out expansion laws for the\nweak versions of forward, reverse, and forward-reverse bisimilarities, i.e., their versions capable of\nabstracting from œÑùúè\\tau-actions¬†[ref]9. A more interesting direction is to show that forward-reverse bisimilarity augmented with a clause for\nbackward ready multisets equality corresponds to hereditary history-preserving\nbisimilarity¬†, thus yielding for the latter an operational characterization, an axiomatization\nalternative to¬†, and logical characterizations alternative to¬† . These two\nbisimilarities were shown to coincide in¬†    in the absence of autoconcurrency. In\nfact, if a=bùëéùëèa=b in Figure¬†1, the two processes turn out to be forward-reverse\nbisimilar, with the backward ready sets of the three bottom states collapsing to {a}ùëé\\{a\\}, but not\nhereditary history-preserving bisimilar, because identifying executed actions is\nimportant¬† (as done also in CCSK via communication keys¬†6). However, if backward ready\nmultisets are used instead, then the bottom state on the left can be distinguished from the two bottom\nstates on the right. Thus, counting executed actions that label incoming transitions may be enough.
