It schedules a value βtsubscript𝛽𝑡\\beta_{t} as the noise level for each timestep t𝑡t . The noise ϵtsubscriptitalic-ϵ𝑡\\epsilon_{t} is scaled by the noise level and then is used to perturb x0subscript𝑥0x_{0} 8. A suitable schedule encourages a balance between exploration and exploitation. Exploration describes the ability of generalization on data not seen during training  while exploitation refers to the convergence situation where a model fits the training data well . According to the definition of the forward process in Eq. 2.1, the larger the amount of noise that is used, the faster the data structures are destroyed, and vice versa. On the one hand, a sufficient amount of noise is necessary to encourage exploration to generalize well on unseen data, while excessive noise may result in sub-optimal convergence or inconvergence of a model, which cannot adequately recover the details of data . On the other hand, too little noise boosts exploitation to fit distributions well but undermines generalization  [ref]55. Empirically, smaller noise levels are scheduled at early timesteps for exploitation, and higher levels are assigned at late timesteps for exploration for a better balance . Data are often considered when a noise schedule is designed. From the viewpoint of data representation, the number of data dimensions and the maximum Euclidean distance of training samples need to be considered to design the noise schedule . Furthermore, the noise schedule should align with the complexity and redundancy of the data [ref]46. For example, larger images may require more noise than smaller ones . In the context of data reconstruction, adding sufficient noise is beneficial for easy modeling of the distribution while adding little noise helps accurate reconstruction . The noise schedule can be learned by a network or empirically designed using mathematical formulations. To learn a noise schedule, existing methods recognize it as a parameter to be learned jointly with other parameters . These parameters are usually optimized by maximizing a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood . Since the noise schedule is learned by the network, it can be different for training and sampling to achieve optimal results [ref]55. In contrast, manually-designed noise schedules are formulated with a wide variety of mathematical heuristics. Some design the noise schedule to be affine 9 [ref]46, or to have an exponential relationship 8 with the timestep. Both are thought to perturb data quicker than necessary. Consequently, other functions, such as cosine , sigmoid , and mathematical integral , are used to achieve a more appropriate perturbation speed in the forward process. Table III shows several examples of designed noise schedules.\n\nReference markers found: [55]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]55: or inconvergence of a model, which cannot adequately recover the details of data .
