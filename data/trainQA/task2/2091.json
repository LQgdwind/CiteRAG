      "content": "Paper Title: Multiplierless MP-Kernel Machine For Energy-efficient Edge Devices\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEdge computing is transforming the way data is being handled, processed, and delivered in various applications. At the core of edge computing platforms are embedded machine learning (ML)\nalgorithms that make decisions in real-time, which endows these platforms with greater autonomy .\nCommon edge-ML architectures reported in the literature are based on a deep neural network  or support vector machines , and one of the active areas of research is to be able to improve the energy efficiency of these ML architectures, both for inference and learning . To achieve this, the hardware models are first trained offline, and the trained models are then optimized for\nenergy efficiency using pruning or sparsification techniques [ref]8 before being deployed on the edge platform. An example of such design-flows is the binary or the quaternary neural networks, which are compressed and energy-efficient variants of deep-neural network inference engines [ref]9 0. However, robust training of quantized deep learning architectures still requires full precision training 1. Also, deep neural networks require a large amount of training data  2 which is generally unavailable for many applications. On the other hand, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can provide good classification results with significantly less training data. The convex nature of SVM optimization makes its training more robust and more interpretable 3. SVMs have also been shown to outperform deep learning systems for detecting rare events45, which is generally the case for many IoT applications. One such IoT-based edge device architecture is depicted in Fig. 1. Data from video surveillance, auditory event, or motion sensor can be analyzed, and the system can be trained on the device to produce robust classification models. At a fundamental level, SVMs and other ML architectures extensively use Matrix-Vector-Multiplication (MVM) operations. One way to improve the overall system energy efficiency is to reduce the complexity or minimize MVM operations. In literature, many approximations and\nreduced precision MVM techniques have been proposed 6 and have produced improvements in energy efficiency without significantly\nsacrificing classification accuracy. Kernel machines have similar inference engine as SVMs, sharing the execution characteristics with SVM 7. This paper proposes a kernel machine architecture that eliminates the need for multipliers. Instead, it uses more fundamental but energy efficient and optimal computational primitives like addition/subtraction, shift, and overflow/underflow operations.\nFor example, in a 45 nm CMOS technology, it has been shown that an 8-bit multiplication operation consumes 0.2 pJ of energy, whereas an 8-bit addition/subtraction operation consumes only 0.03 pJ of energy8. Shift and comparison operations consume even less energy than additions and subtractions, and\nunderflow/overflow operations do not consume any additional energy at all.\nTo achieve this multiplierless mapping, the proposed architecture uses a margin propagation (MP) approximation technique originally proposed for analog computing 9. MP approximation has been optimized for a digital edge computing platform like field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) in this work. We show that for inference, the MP approximation is computed as a part of learning, and all\nthe computational steps can be pipelined and parallelized for other MP approximation operations. In addition to reporting an MP approximation-based inference engine, we also report an online training algorithm that uses a gradient-descent technique in conjunction with hyper-parameter annealing. We show that the same hardware can be reused for both training and inference for the proposed MP kernel machine. As a result, the MP approximation errors can be effectively reduced. Since kernel machine inference and SVM inference have similar equations, we compare our system with traditional SVMs. We show that MP-based kernel machines can achieve similar classification accuracy as floating-point SVMs without using multipliers or equivalently any MVMs. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: Design and optimization of MP-approximation using iterative binary addition, shift, comparison, and underflow/overflow operations. Implementation of energy-efficient MP-based inference on an FPGA-based edge platform with multiplierless architecture that eliminates the need for DSP units. Online training of MP-based kernel machine that reuses the inference hardware. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II briefly discusses related work, followed by section III, where we explain the concept of multiplierless inner product computation and the related MP-based approximation. Section IV presents the kernel machine formulation based on MP theory. Section V details the online training of the system. Section VI provides the FPGA implementation details and contrasts with other hardware implementations of MP-based kernel machine algorithm.\nSection VII discusses results obtained with few classification datasets and compares our multiplierless system with other SVM implementations, and Section VIII concludes this paper and discusses potential use cases.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: inference and learning .
