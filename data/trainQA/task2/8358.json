      "content": "Paper Title: CodeSAM: Source Code Representation Learning by Infusing Self-Attention with Multi-Code-View Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMachine learning for software engineering (ML4SE) is an active area of research that has demonstrated substantial improvements in many SE tasks such as source code completion [ref]51, automatic code summarization  and semantic code search 0. The success of these ML4SE pipelines largely depends on effectively learning source code representations. Hence, introducing novel ML techniques that incorporate information from source code is an active area of research . With the advent of language models, many works have explored methods to adapt natural language techniques to source code directly [ref]15  [ref]51. Although popular NLP techniques show impressive results when applied to source code [ref]15, various studies emphasize that source code is a richer construct and should not be treated simply as a collection of tokens or natural language text .\nAs a result, contemporary research in ML4SE deliberately avoids restricting itself to traditional NLP approaches alone. Instead, it strives to leverage program analysis techniques and code-views such as the AST, CFG, and DFG, and integrate them into language models to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of source code.\nThis can be seen from transformer-based  SLMs like GraphCodeBERT 0 and SemanticCodeBERT  that are performant in multiple downstream SE tasks. To accommodate graph-based code-views into a transformer model, works like GraphCodeBERT convert a code-view into a sequence and then append this sequence to the original code tokens. However, upon closer examination, we identify and elaborate on two major drawbacks of this approach - (1) the loss of structural information when flattening graphs and (2) the inability to scale this approach in a multi-code-view setting. Flattening Graphs: Since most code-views are predominantly graph structures, they cannot be directly used by models that consume sequential tokens (like transformers). As a result, most methods like GraphCodeBERT flatten the graph code-views by applying post-processing techniques like extracting all the graph’s nodes into a sequence. Flattening graphs into sequences erodes the structural information contained in the edges of the graph code-view. To compensate for this loss, GraphCodeBERT attempts to learn the graph topology using a pre-training task of edge-prediction between the graph nodes. However, we note that it is important to prioritize an approach that takes the complete graph topology as input rather than focusing on mitigating information loss from graph flattening.\n Ballooning Input Size: After the graph is flattened into a sequence, approaches like GraphCodeBERT proceed to append this sequence to the original code snippet tokens.\nAs most SLMs can typically handle sequence lengths of up to 102410241024 or 204820482048 tokens , the original code tokens are often truncated to accommodate the additional code-view sequence. This problem is further exaggerated when considering multiple code-views. Trying to accommodate the flattened sequences of two or more code-views would result in input overflow or extreme truncation of the original code tokens, resulting in the loss of crucial context. Hence, there is a need for a scalable method that incorporates code-views without increasing sequence lengths. Based on the above observations, we believe that existing methods fall short when it comes to effectively integrating multi-code-view representations into transformer models.\nTo solve the above drawbacks, we propose CodeSAM, a novel approach to infuse information from multi-code-views by modifying the self-attention mechanism for transformers without altering the input token sequence. Additionally, after generating this self-attention mask, we propose two masking strategies for transformer models, that help incorporate local and global context in the source code representations. We also design CodeSAM to be code-view agnostic and applicable to any single or multi-code-view graph representation. Hence, we believe that CodeSAM is the first work to showcase how to execute a practical and complete pipeline - beginning from the static analysis of non-compilable code snippets, abstracting this analysis into a language and code-view agnostic format and finally integrating this format into transformer models without impacting input sequence lengths. This is unlike other works that implement methodologies that are specific to one code-view or methods that incorporate multiple code-views by significantly increasing input sequence length like GraphCodeBERT and SemanticCodeBERT.\n\n\n\n\nOur core contribution is a novel, code-view agnostic, and flexible framework that infuses multi-code-view information via self-attention masking strategies into transformer-based models.\n\n\n Paper Organization: We elaborate on CodeSAM, our novel methodology used for source code representation learning in Section 2. In Section 3, we present a systematic analysis of the most relevant code-view generating tools often required for ML pipelines, and describe how we arrived at an appropriate tool to be plugged into our CodeSAM pipeline. Since there exist many static analysis tools that are language specific 8 , or code-view specific, without support for customizing or combining multiple code-views, we believe that this section will help future ML4SE researchers in selecting appropriate analysis tools. Section 4 deals with the evaluation of our methodology through experiments on code clone detection, semantic code search, and program classification. Section 5 contains the relevant related literature. Section 6 entails the Threats to Validity of this work and is followed by Conclusion and Future Work in Section 7.\n\nReference markers found: [51]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]51: Machine learning for software engineering (ML4SE) is an active area of research that has demonstrated substantial improvements in many SE tasks such as source code completion [ref]51, automatic code summarization  and semantic code search 0.
