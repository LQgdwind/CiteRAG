      "content": "Paper Title: Attention-based model for predicting question relatedness on Stack Overflow\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe continuous progress of the information industry has caused more and more people to engage in software development. Therefore, Programming Community-based Question Answering (PCQA) websites have attracted a large number of users. Stack Overflow is one of the most popular PCQA websites, where users can ask and answer questions related to program problems and gain knowledge . By October 2020, Stack Overflow had more than 20 million questions, and there could be semantic relatedness between them. For example, two or more questions may be duplicated, or information in one question may help solve other questions. Figure 1 presents an example of a duplicate question pair. The same solution can answer these two questions, so the recent question (’Q2’) was closed and marked as ’[duplicate]’ and linked to the ’Q1’. Duplicate questions are not conducive to the websites’ maintenance. Users who ask duplicate questions will wait a long time for the question to be answered while ready answers are already available [ref]2. Figure 2 shows two related questions, and the answer to the question above (’Q1’) can directly solve the question below (’Q2’). Therefore, providing questions related to the question raised or being inquired by users can effectively help them solve problems. However, semantic relatedness between questions often requires manual analysis by users, such as identifying and labeling duplicate questions by programmers with high reputation or indicating questions that help answer the current question in the way of URL sharing. Due to a large number of questions on the websites, and the same question can be expressed in a variety of ways, the artificial recognition method is inefficient and time-consuming, resulting in a large number of questions with semantic relatedness are not recognized. Thus, it is necessary to propose an automated approach that can help predict semantic relatedness between questions to solve this problem. Although Stack Overflow recommends related questions when users view a question, its recommendations are based on word overlap between questions that are not reliable due to the lexical gaps 0. Some previous methods [ref]2   can automatically calculate the semantic relatedness between questions, but they do not fully use the semantic information in questions . Moreover, as there are many different expressions for the same question, and there may be few words common between them, such methods’ performance is poor. In recent years, deep learning has been well applied in many software engineering domains, such as user intention classification , software defect prediction [ref]7, code summarization , and type inference . With the strong non-linear fitting ability, deep learning can also effectively extract semantic information in the question. Some previous works have adopted the deep learning technique to predict the linkable of questions 0 1 2 or detect duplicate questions  3 4 5 6 in the PCQA websites. Compared with traditional methods based on features and heuristics, their methods can achieve better results. However, most of them only adopt the sentence encoding model 7 to learn the vector representation of individual questions separately and only calculates the semantic relatedness between questions based on vector distance. Such methods can not sufficiently consider the interaction information between two questions, which is essential for semantic relatedness prediction. Recently, the attention mechanism has been widely applied in the NLP field. Using the attention mechanism to predict question relatedness, the model can extract the interaction information between questions more effectively and achieve better prediction performance through inter-sentence alignment. Therefore, in this paper, we adopt the deep learning technique to build a sentence pair interaction model based on the attention mechanism. The model aims to identify the semantic relatedness between questions on Stack Overflow. This paper conducts research based on the work of Shirani et al. 2. Their paper refers to a question and the entire set of its answers as a knowledge unit and constructs a dataset of 347,372 pairs of knowledge units (hereafter, Knowledge Unit dataset). In the Knowledge Unit dataset, the relationships between knowledge units are divided into four classes based on the degree of relatedness from high to low: duplicate, direct, indirect, and isolated. They also construct two models DOTBILSTM and SOFTSVM, based on deep learning and SVM classifier, respectively, among which the DOTBILSTM is the state-of-the-art model in this dataset. We regard the task as a multi-class classification task and proposes an Attention-based Sentence pair Interaction Model (ASIM) to solve this problem. Moreover, the most common pre-trained word embeddings are trained on a large amount of data unrelated to the software engineering domain, which may lead to ambiguous results 8. Therefore, we construct a corpus of software engineering based on stack Overflow data dump and pre-train the word embeddings of domain-specific based on this corpus. Our word embeddings are openly available, which may also help design models in other software engineering tasks. In general, we answer the following five research questions in this paper: How much improvement can ASIM achieve over the two baseline models SOFTSVM and DOTBILSTM, to predict question relatedness? Compared with the SOFTSVM and the DOTBILSTM, how effective is ASIM in predicting knowledge unit pairs of different relatedness classes? How much influence does the attention mechanism contribute to the improvement of ASIM? What is the impact of domain-specific word embeddings on the performance improvement of ASIM? How is the generalization ability of ASIM? The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the related work of our study. Section 3 details our approaches to predict question relatedness. Section 4 describes the experimental settings and presents the experiment results. We present a case study of the attention mechanism and discuss the threats to our study’s validity in Section 5, and Section 6 concludes the paper and discusses future work.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Duplicate questions are not conducive to the websites’ maintenance.
