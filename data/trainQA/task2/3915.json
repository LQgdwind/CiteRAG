      "content": "Paper Title: Incorporating Prior Knowledge into Neural Networks through an Implicit Composite Kernel\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe believe ICKy will be particularly useful for remote sensing applications. In this experiment, we evaluate ICKy on a remote sensing datasets where each data point ùíô={x,t}ùíôùë•ùë°\\boldsymbol{x}=\\{x,t\\} contains 2 sources of information: a three-band natural color (red-blue-green) satellite image xùë•x as the high-dimensional information and the corresponding timestamp as the low-dimensional information. Our goal is to forecast the ground-level PM2.5 concentration y^=f‚Äã(x,t)^ùë¶ùëìùë•ùë°\\hat{y}=f(x,t) using both sources of information. As PM2.5 varies with time on a yearly basis, we use an exponential-sine-squared kernel with a period of T=365ùëá365T=365 (days) to process the low-dimensional information tùë°t. The satellite images are processed with a CNN. The results of ICKy are then compared with 2 benchmarks as shown in Table 1: a Convolutional Neural Network-Random Forest (CNN-RF) joint model   (similar to the MLP-RF model in Section 5.1) and a carefully designed Seasonal CNN-RF model that maps tùë°t into two new features, sin‚Å°(2‚ÄãœÄ‚Äãt/365)2ùúãùë°365\\sin(2\\pi t/365) and cos‚Å°(2‚ÄãœÄ‚Äãt/365)2ùúãùë°365\\cos(2\\pi t/365), to explicitly model seasonality. We note that the inner product operation in ICK is similar in mathematical structure to attention-based mechanisms [ref]48, which are popular in many deep learning frameworks. Therefore, we introduce 2 variants of ICKy and compare them with another 4 benchmarks where the CNN is replaced by an attention-based mechanism based off of a Vision Transformer (ViT)  and DeepVit  architectures. These models include ViT-RF, Seasonal ViT-RF, Seasonal DeepViT-RF, and Seasonal MAE-ViT-RF, where ViT is pre-trained by a Masked Autoencoder . ‚ÄúSeasonal‚Äù here denotes that we use the transformed periodic representation defined previously. We note that we are unaware of Vision Transformers being used in this manner, and we want to evaluate whether it is the model structure or the prior information that is improving the results. Hence, these attention-based models, while not a primary contribution, are novel and represent a good-faith effort to define models with similar forms. As displayed in Table 1, both standard CNN-RF and ViT-RF models yields very large errors on predicting PM2.5 values. After including seasonality, CNN-RF performs significantly better and shares similar predictive performance with CNN-ICKy. After replacing CNN with ViT, we observe slight improvement in both RF-joint models (especially when pre-trained by MAE) and ICKy variants. Among the models we present here, ViT-ICKy and DeepViT-ICKy achieve the highest correlation and the smallest prediction error, respectively. To evaluate the uncertainty calibration capability of ICKy, we construct ICKy ensembles by following Algorithm 2 and compare them with ensemble formulations of RF-joint model benchmarks. We use a criterion called Mean Standardized Log Loss (MSLL) as defined in  to evaluate the uncertainty calibration.\nFrom Table 1, it can be observed that CNN-ICKy ensemble achieves the smallest MSLL. In addition, we realize ViT-based ICKy variants yield very large MSLL as they make predictions which are far from the true PM2.5 labels with high confidence (i.e. small variance). We provide details and possible explanations in Appendix K. To see if our ICKy framework generalizes to other domains, we acquired two additional regression datasets from the UCI machine learning repository, one for predicting worker productivity (with 1197 samples and 15 features) and the other for predicting power consumption (with 2075259 samples and 9 features). For the worker productivity dataset, we employ ICKy with an exponential-sine-squared kernel with different periods and compare them with benchmarks including MLPs  and Deep Kernel Learning (DKL)  as shown in Table 3. For the power consumption dataset, we use ICKy with both an exponential-sine-squared kernel and a Mat√©rn 3/2 kernel and compare them with scalable exact GP  and stochastic variational GP [ref]20 as shown in Table 3. From the results, we observe that ICKy outperforms all the benchmarks in both experiments (especially on the worker productivity data with a margin of almost one order of magnitude).\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: t/365) and cos‚Å°(2‚ÄãœÄ‚Äãt/365)2ùúãùë°365\\cos(2\\pi t/365), to explicitly model seasonality. We note that the inner product operation in ICK is similar in mathematical structure to attention-based mechanisms [ref]48, which are popular in many deep learning frameworks.
