      "content": "Paper Title: Enhanced Isotropy Maximization Loss: Seamless and High-Performance Out-of-Distribution Detection Simply Replacing the SoftMax Loss\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo allow standardized comparison, we used the datasets, training procedures, and metrics that were established in [ref]2 and used in many subsequent OOD detection papers [ref]4 [ref]5 . We trained many 100-layer DenseNetBCs with growth rate k=12ùëò12k\\!=\\!12 (i.e., 0.8M parameters) , 110-layer ResNets (correct size proper implementation) https://github.com/akamaster/pytorch_resnet_cifar10, and 34-layer ResNets (overparametrized commonly used implementation) https://github.com/pokaxpoka/deep_Mahalanobis_detector on CIFAR10 , CIFAR100 , SVHN , and TinyImageNet  datasets with SoftMax, IsoMax, and IsoMax+ losses using the same procedures (e.g., initial learning rate, learning rate schedule, weight decay). We used SGD with the Nesterov moment equal to 0.9 with a batch size of 64 and an initial learning rate of 0.1. The weight decay was 0.0001, and we did not use dropout. We trained during 300 epochs for CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN; and during 90 epochs for TinyImageNet. We used a learning rate decay rate equal to ten applied in epoch numbers 150, 200, and 250 for CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN; and 30 and 60 for TinyImageNet. The code to reproduce the results and replace the SoftMax loss by the IsoMax+ loss is available at https://github.com/dlmacedo/entropic-out-of-distribution-detection. We used resized images from the TinyImageNet , the Large-scale Scene UNderstanding dataset (LSUN) , CIFAR10, and SVHN  to create out-of-distribution samples. We added these out-of-distribution images to the validation sets of in-distribution data to form the test sets and evaluate the OOD detection performance. We evaluated the OOD detection performance using the true negative rate at 95% true positive rate (TNR@TPR95), the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the detection accuracy (DTACC), which corresponds to the maximum classification probability over all possible thresholds Œ¥ùõø\\delta: where o‚Äã(ùê±)ùëúùê±o(\\mathbf{x}) is the OOD detection score. It is assumed that both positive and negative samples have an equal probability of being in the test set, i.e., P‚Äã(ùê±‚Äã¬†is from¬†‚ÄãPin)=P‚Äã(ùê±‚Äã¬†is from¬†‚ÄãPout)ùëÉùê±¬†is from¬†subscriptùëÉinùëÉùê±¬†is from¬†subscriptùëÉoutP\\left(\\mathbf{x}\\text{ is from }P_{\\texttt{in}}\\right)=P\\left(\\mathbf{x}\\text{ is from }P_{\\texttt{out}}\\right). All metrics follow the calculation procedures specified in [ref]5. In this paper, we did not directly present a comparison with the approaches that produce classification accuracy drop (e.g.,  ) because this is a substantial limitation from a practical perspective . Regardless, it is easy to notice that IsoMax+ presents a similar OOD detection performance of Generalized ODIN (difference lower than the margin of error alternatively in favor of one or another) while simultaneously avoiding classification accuracy drop, hyperparameter tuning, and inefficient inferences. Moreover, IsoMax+ is also much easier to implement and to use. For example, on the one hand, when using Generalized ODIN, we need to exclude some components of the solution from receiving weight decay, which requires optimization procedure modifications. On the other hand, just a loss replacement is needed in our proposal. Additionally, Generalized ODIN has many flavors. Consequently, it is hard to know a prior which one will perform best for a given dataset and model without training all of them from scratch using the same data and model.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: To allow standardized comparison, we used the datasets, training procedures, and metrics that were established in [ref]2 and used in many subsequent OOD detection papers [ref]4 [ref]5 .
