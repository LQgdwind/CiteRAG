      "content": "Paper Title: LaDe: The First Comprehensive Last-mile Delivery Dataset from Industry\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDataset Perspective. To the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available last-mile dataset containing both package pick-up and delivery data. The most relative effort comes from Amazon  (named AmazonData in this paper). It is a courier-operated sequence dataset proposed for a last-mile routing research challenge hosted by Amazon. Specifically, this dataset contains 9,184 historical routes performed by Amazon couriers in 2018 in five metropolitan areas in the United States. Despite the contribution of AmazonData to the research field, it still has three limitations: 1) Without pick-up data, it only contains data generated in the package delivery process; 2) Small scale, in terms of spatio-temporal range and the number of trajectories; 3) Lack of courier-related and task-event-related information, which prevents it from benefiting a wider group of researchers with different interests. In light of the above issues, we introduce an industry-scale, comprehensive dataset (i.e., LaDe) for researchers to develop and evaluate new ideas on real-world instances in last-mile delivery. The scale of LaDe is 5 times of AamazonData in terms of package number and 50 times in terms of trajectory number. We provide a detailed comparison of AamazonData and LaDe in Table 1. Application Perspective. Overall, last-mile logistics is an emerging interdisciplinary research area connecting transportation and AI technology, in which deep learning methods have long been the most popular model . Broadly speaking, there are four branches in this field: 1) Emerging trends and technologies, which focus on technological solutions and innovations in last-mile logistics, such as courier’s route and arrival time prediction  , self-service technologies , drone-assisted delivery . 2) Last-mile-related data mining  [ref]25, which aims to excavate the underlying patterns of knowledge from data generated by real-world operations for better logistics management. 3) Operational optimization, which focuses on optimizing last-mile operations and making better operational decisions, such as vehicle routing problem  , delivery scheduling , and facility location selection  . 4) Supply chain structures, which focused on designing structures for last mile logistics, such as the network design .\nWe refer readers to the paper  for a more detailed, systematic classification of last-mile-related research. The proposed LaDe contains instances based on real operational data that researchers can use to advance the state-of-the-art in their fields and to expand its applications to industry settings.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: solutions and innovations in last-mile logistics, such as courier’s route and arrival time prediction  , self-service technologies , drone-assisted delivery . 2) Last-mile-related data mining  [ref]25, which aims to excavate the underlying patterns of knowledge from data generated by real-world operations for better logistics management. 3) Operational optimization, which focuses on\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
