Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

We incorporated the CSS into model LMH , which is dubbed as LMH-CSS, and compared it with the state-of-the-art models on both VQA-CP v2 and VQA v2. According to the backbone of these models, we group them into: 1) AReg 3, MuRel , GRL [ref]18, RUBi , SCR , LMH , HINT . These models utilize the UpDn [ref]4 as their backbone. 2) HAN , GVQA ,\nReGAT , NSM . These models utilize other different backbones, e.g., BLOCK , BAN  etc. Especially, the AReg, GRL, RUBi, LMH are ensemble-based models. Results. The results are reported in Table 3. When trained and tested on the VQA-CP v2 dataset (i.e., left side of Table 3), the LMH-CSS achieves a new state-of-the-art performance over all question categories. Particularly, CSS improves the performance of LMH with a 6.50% absolution performance gains (58.95% vs. 52.45%). When trained and tested on the VQA v2 dataset (i.e., middle side of Table 3), the CSS results in a minor drop in the performance by 1.74% for LMH. For completeness, we further compared the performance drop between the two benchmarks. Different from previous models that suffer severe performance drops (e.g., 23.74% in UpDn, and 9.19% in LMH), the LMH-CSS can significantly decrease the performance drop into 0.96%, which demonstrate that the effectiveness of CSS to further reduce the language biases in VQA.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: LMH , which is dubbed as LMH-CSS, and compared it with the state-of-the-art models on both VQA-CP v2 and VQA v2.
