      "content": "Paper Title: Training Meta-Surrogate Model for Transferable Adversarial Attack\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe developments of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) [ref]32  have greatly promoted the advancements in Computer Vision .\nHowever, previous works     have shown a critical robustness issue that CNN models are vulnerable to human-imperceptible perturbations of input images, also known as adversarial examples (AEs). The design of AEs is useful for revealing the security threats on machine learning systems  and for understanding the representations learned by CNN models . In this paper, we consider the problem of black-box attack, where the target victim model is entirely hidden from the attacker. In this setting, standard white-box attacks   or even query-based black-box attacks    cannot be used, and the prevailing way to attack the victim is through transfer attack  .\nIn transfer attack, the attackers commonly generate AEs by attacking one or an ensemble of surrogate models and hope the obtained AEs can also successfully fool the victim black-box model. Although great efforts have been made to improve the transferability of adversarial attacks 7 [ref]53 [ref]51,\nthe transfer attack-based methods still encounter poor success rates, especially when attacking adversarially trained target models.\nThis is caused by a fundamental limitation of current approaches—they all leverage the surrogate models trained by standard learning tasks (e.g., classification, object detection), while it is not guaranteed that attacks fooling such models can be easily transferred.\nWe thus pose the following important question on transfer attack that has not been studied in the literature: Instead of using the original surrogate models, can we obtain a Meta-Surrogate Model (MSM) such that attacks to this model can be easier transferred to other models? We answer this question in the affirmative by developing a novel black-box attack pipeline called Meta-Transfer Attack (MTA).\nAssume a set of source models (standard surrogate models) are given,\ninstead of directly attacking these source models, our algorithm aims to obtain a “meta-surrogate model (MSM)”, which is designed in the way that attacks to this model can be easier transferred to fool other models, and conduct attacks on the MSM to obtain transferable AEs.\nWe show that this goal can be mathematically formulated as a well-posed (bi-level-like) training objective by unrolling the attacks on the MSM and defining a loss to measure the transferability of the resulting AEs.\nTo avoid discrete operations in the white-box attack, we propose a Customized PGD attacker that enables back-propagation through the whole procedure.\nWith this bi-level-like optimization  1, the source models supervise the MSM to improve the transferability of the AEs created on it. Through extensive experiments on various models and datasets, we show that the proposed MTA method leads to significantly improved transfer attacks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the MSM. We summarize the main contributions of our work as follows.\n1) We propose a novel MTA framework to train an MSM to improve the transferability of AEs.\nTo the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to explore a better surrogate model for producing stronger transferable AEs.\n2) We compare MTA with state-of-the-art transfer attack methods (M-PGD , DI-PGD [ref]53, TI-PGD , SGM-PGD [ref]51, AEG , IR-PGD 9, SI-N-PGD , etc.) on Cifar-10 9 and Imagenet . The comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MTA—the AEs generated by attacking MSM significantly outperform previous methods, in attacking both naturally trained and adversarially trained black-box target models.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: The developments of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) [ref]32  have greatly promoted the advancements in Computer Vision .\nHowever, previous works     have shown a critical robustness issue that CNN models are vulnerable to human-imperceptible\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
