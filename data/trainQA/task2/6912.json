      "content": "Paper Title: EnsembleFollower: A Hybrid Car-Following Framework Based On Reinforcement Learning and Hierarchical Planning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRNNs have become a pivotal tool in the domain of deep learning, particularly for tasks that involve sequential data or where past information influences current decision-making. They possess the distinctive capability to maintain the memory of previous inputs, making them uniquely suited for modeling temporal dependencies [ref]31. In the realm of autonomous driving, RNNs have been employed for a multitude of tasks, ranging from  to fulfilling car-following tasks accurately . These networks can aptly capture the evolving dynamics of traffic, thus aiding in real-time decision-making. More recently, RL has emerged as a prominent paradigm for intelligent transportation studies, ranging from coordinating the charging recommendation for electric vehicles to learning decision-making policies for autonomous vehicles [ref]33  . RL focuses on how an agent can learn an optimal policy for decision-making through interactions with the environment, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards over time. In the context of autonomous driving, the agent is the vehicle’s control system, and the environment encompasses other vehicles, pedestrians, infrastructure, and various road conditions. Most RL-related problems are formulated as Markov Decision Process (MDP), which is, at each discrete time step t𝑡t, the agent perceives its current state stsubscript𝑠𝑡s_{t} and selects an appropriate action atsubscript𝑎𝑡a_{t} from the available action space A𝐴A, guided by a policy π​(at|st)𝜋conditionalsubscript𝑎𝑡subscript𝑠𝑡\\pi(a_{t}|s_{t}) that maps states to actions. Upon executing the selected action atsubscript𝑎𝑡a_{t}, the system transitions to a subsequent state st+1subscript𝑠𝑡1s_{t+1}, and the agent receives a reward signal rtsubscript𝑟𝑡r_{t}. This iterative process persists until a terminal state is encountered, at which point the agent’s episode is reset. The primary objective of the agent is to optimize its policy so as to maximize the accumulated reward Rt=∑k=0∞γk​rt+ksubscript𝑅𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑘0superscript𝛾𝑘subscript𝑟𝑡𝑘R_{t}=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\gamma^{k}r_{t+k} over time, which is discounted by a factor γ∈(0,1]𝛾01\\gamma\\in(0,1] to account for the relative importance of immediate versus future rewards in the decision-making process [ref]33. A prominent algorithm within the value-based RL paradigm is Q-learning [ref]36, which aims to estimate the optimal action-value function iteratively, Q​(s,a)𝑄𝑠𝑎Q(s,a), representing the expected return for taking action a𝑎a in state s𝑠s and following the optimal policy thereafter. The Q-values are updated according to the Bellman Equation (1), and the optimal policy selects the action with the largest Q​(s,a)𝑄𝑠𝑎Q(s,a) to achieve the maximum expected future rewards [ref]33. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has evolved into a powerful tool for solving complex planning and decision-making problems in various domains, including autonomous driving. DRL combines the generalization capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs) with the sequential decision-making framework of RL to efficiently learn optimal control policies [ref]33. Building on this foundation, techniques like the Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) have emerged. This method refines the original Deep Q-Network by incorporating the ‘double’ component, astutely addressing Q-learning’s overestimation bias and effectively ensuring more stable and performant learning . DDQN’s advancements notwithstanding, other methodologies like Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) have tailored solutions for specific challenges. Particularly suited for continuous action spaces, DDPG merges principles from Deep Q-Learning and policy gradients. Through its actor-critic framework, DDPG creates a synergy where the actor provides deterministic state-to-action mappings, while the critic offers a comprehensive action assessment, ensuring adept exploration of action domains . Amidst these developments, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) stands as a testament to the pursuit of stability in policy gradient. By emphasizing controlled policy updates, PPO averts potential pitfalls associated with drastic changes. This approach, which methodically constrains the policy update ratio, marries the ideals of exploration and exploitation, sans the complexities of higher-order optimization . These deep variants of RL have become indispensable tools for researchers and engineers in the quest to develop robust and efficient autonomous driving systems. Following Zhu et al.’s application of DDPG to human-like autonomous car-following , several studies have investigated applying DRL in car-following directly. Soft Actor-Critic algorithms were employed for speed control using naturalistic driving data 0, while RL-based longitudinal driver models were tested on a real car to verify efficacy 1. Additionally, Spatial-temporal Reinforcement Learning was designed to address ‘phantom’ traffic jams in single-lane traffic environments 2. Alongside human-like driving, alternative objectives for autonomous car-following were introduced via novel reward functions, such as safe, efficient, and comfortable driving 3 4. Therefore, RL is an appropriate candidate for high-level policy in autonomous driving, as it can learn from experience to identify the most suitable low-level model when receiving the environment state.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: past information influences current decision-making.
