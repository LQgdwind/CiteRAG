      "content": "Paper Title: Cross-Layer Encrypted Semantic Communication Framework for Panoramic Video Transmission\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the rapid development of information technology and mobile devices, global data traffic is experiencing unprecedented growth. It is projected that by 2027, data traffic on smart devices will reach 41 GB per month, nearly four times the level in 2021 . Against this backdrop, the upcoming 6G era must be prepared to support a wider and more diverse range of application scenarios to meet future challenges. For example, immersive traffic information scenarios require systems to provide real-time, panoramic traffic information to ensure that individuals and vehicles receive high-quality and responsive data. At the same time, ultra-large-scale connectivity scenarios anticipate that billions of devices will be connected and communicating simultaneously in future urban environments. This raises higher demands for data processing capabilities and intelligent network management , [ref]3, . To meet these increasingly severe demands, new communication technologies must be developed. Semantic communication, as one of the key technologies for 6G, has attracted widespread attention [ref]5, . It significantly reduces the need for data transmission by extracting and compressing information at the semantic level while ensuring the precision and relevance of the information conveyed. Compared to traditional bit-level error-free transmission, semantic communication aims to pursue higher “semantic fidelity” rather than error-free transmission of symbols, and effectively overcomes the “cliff effect” caused by declines in signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) . Therefore, as an emerging communication paradigm, semantic communication not only addresses the challenges of large-scale data transmission but also lays the foundation for an efficient and intelligent future communication network. Traditional mobile communication systems adopt a five-layer TCP/IP protocol architecture, including the physical layer, data link layer, network layer, transport layer, and application layer [ref]8. This structure ensures the reliability, efficiency, and standardization of communication services, enabling seamless connectivity with the Internet and other TCP/IP-based networks. However, the design of semantic communication frameworks currently focuses on different transmission information modalities (such as image, video, text, speech, etc.), with targeted designs for semantic extraction networks and deep joint source-channel coding (JSCC) , 0, 1, 2. The processing of semantic information is concentrated in the data link layer or physical layer without considering the impact on the transmission performance of other layers. To ensure compatibility with traditional mobile communication systems and coordination and information sharing between layers, as shown in Fig. 1, we present several compatible adaptation schemes: Scheme 1: Encryption and feature extraction processes are performed at the physical layer with Deep JSCC encoding, where encryption precedes feature extraction. However, this scheme disrupts source correlation and ineffective semantic information extraction. Scheme 2: Similar to Scheme 1, the encryption process is executed after semantic extraction. However, this scheme destroys the correlation of semantic information, reducing the efficiency of Deep JSCC encoding. Scheme 3: Feature extraction, Deep JSCC encoding, and encryption are performed at the physical layer. However, how other layers recognize the semantics of information remains an unresolved issue. In light of this, based on the priority of semantic information, our study proposes a cross-layer encrypted semantic communication (CLESC) framework, aiming to achieve efficient transmission while ensuring seamless compatibility with traditional mobile communication systems. Specifically, the physical and data link layers within our framework dynamically adjust resource allocation and error control strategies based on the importance of semantic information (hereinafter referred to as semantic importance). In addition, the application layer is restructured to better identify the importance and priority of information, integrating closely with the underlying transport characteristics. This ensures that important information is prioritized for transmission and processing, even under poor transmission conditions. These designs not only enhance the efficiency of communication but also improve the system’s adaptability and responsiveness in dynamic environments. Furthermore, we use panoramic video transmission as an example to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed cross-layer encrypted semantic communication framework. Panoramic video, as a crucial component of immersive communication within virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), poses significant demands on network performance due to its massive data volume 3, 4. This first necessitates ensuring the efficiency of end-to-end panoramic video semantic transmission. In this paper, to transmit the panoramic video, equirectangular projection (ERP) is first applied to project spherical video on a flat surface. However, due to the characteristics of the ERP 5, there would be a large information redundancy if panoramic videos are transmitted directly by current semantic video transmission networks 6, 0. At the same time, it will cause a decrease in the panoramic video evaluation metrics weighted-to-spherically-uniform peak signal-to-noise ratio (WS-PSNR) and weighted-to-spherically-uniform structural similarity (WS-SSIM) which mean the quality of immersive experience 7, 8. To enhance the transmission efficiency of panoramic video and provide a superior immersive experience quality, while also facilitating cross-layer transmission and adaptation of semantic features, a cross-layer transmission framework for panoramic video based on semantic communication needs to be designed. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:\n We propose the CLESC framework, a novel approach that integrates semantic communication with traditional communication systems. The CLESC framework integrates feature extraction, encoding, encryption, cyclic redundancy check (CRC), and retransmission strategies. By identifying the semantic importance, it enables underlying layers to adaptively adjust transmission strategies, ensuring the system’s transmission efficiency in environments with low SNRs and limited resources. To our knowledge, this is the first to achieve compatibility between semantic communication and traditional communication systems. We propose an adaptive cross-layer transmission mechanism that dynamically adjusts CRC, channel encoding, and retransmission schemes based on semantic importance, prioritizing the transmission of important information. This mechanism enhances the adaptive capacity and efficiency of cross-layer information transmission across diverse environments. We design a semantic transmitter and receiver for adaptive panoramic video semantic transmission (APVST) to verify the efficiency of the CLESC framework. Based on the Deep JSCC structure and attention mechanisms, APVST extracts semantic features from panoramic frames and implements variable-length encoding of information. Additionally, APVST utilizes an entropy model to mark the semantic importance level based on the entropy, ensuring priority transmission of crucial data. Furthermore, a weight attention (WA) module and a latitude adaptive module are introduced to enhance the quality and efficiency of panoramic video transmission. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CLESC achieves compatibility and adaptation between semantic communication and traditional communication systems, showing improvements in both transmission efficiency and noise resistance. Compared to traditional communication schemes, APVST reduces bandwidth consumption by 85% and exhibits significant advantages at low SNR in cross-layer transmission. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The related work is introduced in Section II. The system model and optimization goal are described in Section III. The proposed adaptive cross-layer transmission mechanism is described in Section IV. Section V introduces the enabled modules and internal structures of APVST. Experimental results are analyzed in Section VI. Conclusion is finally drawn in Section VII.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: billions of devices will be connected and communicating simultaneously in future urban environments.
