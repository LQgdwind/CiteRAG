      "content": "Paper Title: Foundations of Population-Based SHM, Part IV: The Geometry of Spaces of Structures and their Feature Spaces\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMachine learning is a means of constructing connections between quantities of interest, based on observations of those quantities. Most of the effort so far has been\nconcerned with learning input-output mappings for regression or classification problems, where the input and output quantities are vectors in multidimensional real\nvector spaces; many of the ‚Äòclassical‚Äô algorithms e.g.¬†Gaussian processes, neural networks (NN)  [ref]34, support vector machines (SVM) [ref]38, operate\nin precisely this manner. In more recent years, this viewpoint has been recognised as quite restrictive in a wide range of disciplines including: social networking\n[ref]39  , biology , chemistry , medicine , engineering  etc. The issue has been that interest has\nbeen focussed on relationships between objects which exist in more diverse structures than vector spaces. A fairly trivial problem presented in , illustrates where such algorithms can fail. The problem is to calculate the centre of mass of a planetary\nsystem. Assuming training data for a fixed number of planets and their resulting centroid, a ‚Äòtraditional‚Äô ML algorithm will probably be able to calculate the centroids\nfor solar systems in testing data sets constructed in the same manner. However, the algorithm would fail if one were to take as an input, a permutation of the input\nvector (with masses moved as the planet indices move); it will only work if the coordinates of the planets are given in a specific order and according to the\ndistribution of the training data. Furthermore, if the number of planets was not fixed, it would be impossible to get an estimate of their centre of mass using the\nspecific model; a new model would have to be trained with appropriate data. These are the same problems highlighted earlier in terms of learning on graphs: the graphs do\nnot have fixed ‚Äòdimension‚Äô and have a natural permutation invariance which is not respected by classical methods. In order to solve problems like the one described above, various types of graph networks (GNs) have been developed. A large class of GNs is encompassed by the approach\nintroduced in , so that model will form the basis of the discussion here. The algorithm uses graphs as both inputs and outputs. The graphs have attributes\nassigned to their nodes, their edges and also globally. With this representation of data, the algorithm becomes invariant to permutations on the inputs and also\nbecomes, via the proposed computational blocks, invariant to the size of the graph; i.e.¬†the same model may be applied to graphs of any size. Such an algorithm is\nwell-suited to perform inference amongst structures, since they may differ a lot in size, materials, functionality etc. Even the layout of substructures within the greater structure plays a crucial role in the behaviour of the system . The prior information provided by the user as an IE-model or AG of the\nstructure contains a great deal of guidance in terms of how variable and complex structures can be. The formulation is extremely versatile and existing neural network\nalgorithms may be considered as a subclass of the newly proposed algorithm . Furthermore, by using graphs as the objects of interest, the algorithm allows different inductive biases in the model to those encountered in classical\nmachine learning. An example of an inductive bias is the introduction of L2subscriptùêø2L_{2} regularisation for training of a neural network; this reflects a belief that smooth\nmappings should be favoured, and this can be imposed by favouring solutions with lower weight values on network connections. In classification or regression problems,\nthis inductive bias will select a more smooth decision boundary or approximating function from the neural network. Another widely-used inductive bias is applied in the\narchitecture of convolutional neural networks . By applying local convolution operators in the earlier layers, the algorithm looks for local patterns;\nobjects within an image for example. The intensity of each local object is extracted and used as a feature in a later fully-connected multilayer perceptron. In the case of graphs, inductive biases are inserted into the model via connections defined in the representation of data. Such biases are well known in the field of\nprobabilistic graphicals models (PGMs). A good example of this is the PGM for a Markov process, where the state node at time tùë°t is only connected to the state node at\ntime t‚àí1ùë°1t-1, because it is dependent on that state and no previous ones. Different types of connections may also be motivated by inductive biases, expanding the connectivity\nand functionality of the network. In the framework of PBSHM, the geometrical formulation discussed in the first part of the paper is anticipated to motivate new inductive\nbiases which will further empower algorithms. The rest of this paper will be taken up with demonstrating the potential power of graph networks in addressing geometrical problems in population-based SHM, of the sort\ndescribed in the first part of the paper. Because GNN methods have not previously been used in SHM, the basic terminology and the form of the algorithm will be discussed\nin some detail.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: classification problems, where the input and output quantities are vectors in multidimensional real\nvector spaces; many of the ‚Äòclassical‚Äô algorithms e.g.¬†Gaussian processes, neural networks (NN)  [ref]34, support vector machines (SVM) [ref]38, operate\nin precisely this manner.
