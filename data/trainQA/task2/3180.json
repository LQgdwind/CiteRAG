      "content": "Paper Title: Hyperdimensional Feature Fusion for Out-of-Distribution Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOut-of-distribution (OOD) detection has been addressed in the context of image classification   [ref]56  and semantic segmentation 7 [ref]8   with a diverse set of solutions to each of the problems. In this section, we highlight overarching concepts and most relevant contributions in three areas: i) Many approaches try to extrapolate the properties of the distribution of OOD data by utilising a small subset of the data to fine-tune on. ii) When this information is unavailable (OOD agnostic), distances or densities in the softmax probabilities and logit spaces are used. iii) Comparatively few bodies of work exist that use multiple feature maps for OOD detection. OOD Fine-tuning\nSome prior work  0    [ref]8  requires the availability of an OOD dataset to train or fine-tune the network or adjust the OOD detection process. However, such approaches are problematic. By definition, the OOD dataset has to always be incomplete: during deployment, samples that do not match the assumptions embedded in the OOD dataset can still be encountered, leaving such methods exposed to high OOD risk. In contrast, we do not require prior knowledge about the characteristics of OOD data, instead we directly model the in-distribution data and measure deviations from this set. OOD Agnostic Most approaches that do not rely on the availability of OOD data during training or validation analyse the model outputs to identify OOD data during deployment. Early work  showed the maximum of a model’s softmax output to be a good baseline. Expanding on this idea, 7 proposed using the maximum of the unnormalised output logits. Additional methods focus on extracting more information from the outputs  or learning calibrated confidence estimates  5. Model averaging techniques such as Deep Ensembles 4, Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout 0 7 and SWA-G  [ref]56 often improve the OOD detection performance. Training networks with specialised losses that impose a beneficial structure on the feature space has been growing in popularity  [ref]56 . E.g. the recent 1D Subspaces [ref]56 OOD estimator encourages the network to learn orthogonal features in the layer before the logits. The approaches discussed above attempt OOD detection based on only a single layer in the network. In contrast, we show that utilising multiple layers is beneficial for OOD detection. Multi-Feature OOD Detection Newer approaches incorporate and analyse multi-scale feature maps extracted from a DNN to detect OOD samples. The use of feature maps and additional information extracted from a network has been shown to set a new state-of-the-art in both OOD segmentation [ref]8  and classification  when used as input to an auxiliary OOD detection network. The requirement on an auxiliary network necessarily entails training on OOD, or proxy-OOD, data that is strongly representative of the OOD samples likely to be drawn from target distribution. Related work with auxiliary networks in online performance monitoring demonstrates that this class of networks can be robust to failures of the primary network without prior knowledge of the exact failures that are likely to be encountered  . Avoiding these problems altogether, recent works have tried to model in-distribution classes without an auxiliary network  6 . However, the curse of dimensionality requires these methods to rely on PCA reductions  6 or random projections , losing information from the feature maps. By contrast, we use techniques from Hyperdimensional Computing to model our in-distribution data without the need for an auxiliary network. We seek to build upon evidence in the literature   8  that multi-scale features benefit OOD detection performance.\n\nReference markers found: [56]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]56: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection has been addressed in the context of image classification   [ref]56  and semantic segmentation 7 [ref]8   with a diverse set of solutions to each of the problems.
