      "content": "Paper Title: Don’t Watch Me: A Spatio-Temporal Trojan Attack on Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Augment Autonomous Driving\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAn AD system is mainly composed of two parts: scene understanding and decision making & planning [ref]3. The former perceives physical driving dynamics by different sensors to provide sensor agnostic representations of the environment. The latter performs actions of steering, acceleration and braking according to routing and motion planning policies. Given the representations and routing planning, DRL is one of the most popular approaches to generate motion planning policies [ref]3 . It is important to design appropriate state and action spaces and rewards for DRL. While many existing methods directly use raw sensor data, (e.g., camera images, LiDAR, radar) which provides the benefit of finer contextual information, condensed abstracted data has been validated to reduce the complexity of the state space. Generally, the action space should be continuous for AD systems, including steering angle, throttle, and brake, which, however, is complex for DRL. Discretizing them uniformly by dividing the range of continuous actions into equalized bins is a feasible solution to simplify the action space [ref]3. Considering complex spatio-temporal correlations of urban traffic , researchers involve RNN and attention mechanisms to design DNN models to implement AD systems.\nMo et al. combined deep recurrent Q-learning (DRQN) [ref]16 and Monte Carlo tree search to implement a safe DRL for AD. For continuous controlling AV, Chen et al. introduced a spatial attention network to process features extracted by CNN and output to a LSTM layer, and add temporal attention over the output of the LSTM layer. Seong et al.[ref]21 also used a similar network architecture (spatial attention →→\\rightarrow LSTM →→\\rightarrow temporal attention), but its input is condensed abstracted data, rather than camera images. Since a general self-attention mechanisms cannot guarantee vehicle-to-vehicle attention, Leurent et al. proposed a multi-head social attention mechanism into deep Q-learning (DQN), which decomposes the state space into the individual state of each observable vehicle and sends a single query generated from the AV state to the attention network. This mechanism enables the DRL agent to capture more vehicle-to-ego dependencies. Ma et al. focused on the effect of surrounding drivers’ latent state and spatio-temporal relationships on the AD system. They provide a LSTM layer for each observable vehicle, embed these LSTM output by a graphsage convolution, and infer AV control and surrounding drivers’ latent states which are merged into the next MDP sate. In this paper, we also use social attention and RNN to design a DNN to capture spatio-temporal correlations for decision making in DRL. But different from existing works, we include state, last action, and reward as input to extract more hidden temporal features by a GRU layer and feed these temporal features into the attention network to capture spatio-temporal vehicle-to-ego dependencies.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: An AD system is mainly composed of two parts: scene understanding and decision making & planning [ref]3.
