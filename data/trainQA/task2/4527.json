      "content": "Paper Title: More Interpretable Graph Similarity Computation via Maximum Common Subgraph Inference\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph similarity measurement, which is to compute distance/similarity between two graphs, is a fundamental problem in graph-related tasks. It arises in a variety of real-world applications, such as graph search in graph-based database , malware detection , brain data analysis , etc. Graph Edit Distance (GED)  and Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS)  are two domain-agnostic graph similarity metrics, yet exact computation of both are known to be NP-hard . For instance, no algorithm can compute the exact GED between graphs of more than 16 nodes within a reasonable time so far . This problem has motivated interest in approximation algorithms, with a recent surge in graph similarity learning methods [ref]19 [ref]1  1    . Recent methods improve performance by capturing node-level or subgraph-level interactions. The initial way is to encode each graph as a graph-level fixed-length vector via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and then combine the two vectors of both input graphs to predict similarity. However, the actual difference between two graphs often arises from very small local substructures, resulting in the graph-level fixed-length vector being difficult to contain local information [ref]1. To alleviate this problem, GMN [ref]19, MGMN 1 and H2MN  derive node-level and graph-level embeddings containing interaction information of different scales through the cross-graph attention (propagation), and then convert these embeddings to one hidden vector (e.g. concatenation between two graph-level embeddings). SimGNN [ref]1 and GraphSim  derive the corresponding hidden vector by applying the convolution operation to the pairwise node similarity matrix or extracting its histogram features respectively. Ultimately, all models map the hidden vector to the ground-truth similarity. Previous methods lack interpretability despite the exploitation of interaction information. It is unclear what the final hidden vector represents and how to map it to ground truth. In natural language processing 5, it has been demonstrated that models with more interpretability tend to boost performance. Many tasks use attention, such as machine translation 3, language modelling 2, abstractive summarization 5. Attention not only provides interpretability  0 , but also benefits the performance of models . Without loss of generality, the graph similarity learning model with a more reasonable and interpretable paradigm can generally capture more critical information and filter out interference information, thus outperforming the less interpretable one. To cope with this limitation, this study proposes a more interpretable end-to-end paradigm for graph similarity learning, named Similarity Computation via Maximum Common Subgraph Inference (INFMCS). Commonly, the more significant proportion of MCS to the average size of graph pairs , i.e. normalized MCS size (nMCSnMCS\\mathrm{nMCS})111nMCS‚Äã(ùí¢1,ùí¢2)=|MCS‚Äã(ùí¢1,ùí¢2)|(|ùí¢1|+|ùí¢2|)/2nMCSsubscriptùí¢1subscriptùí¢2MCSsubscriptùí¢1subscriptùí¢2subscriptùí¢1subscriptùí¢22\\mathrm{nMCS}\\left(\\mathcal{G}_{1},\\mathcal{G}_{2}\\right)=\\frac{\\left|\\mathrm{MCS}\\left(\\mathcal{G}_{1},\\mathcal{G}_{2}\\right)\\right|}{\\left(\\left|\\mathcal{G}_{1}\\right|+\\left|\\mathcal{G}_{2}\\right|\\right)/2}. In this paper, we always view the graph with the smaller size as ùí¢1subscriptùí¢1\\mathcal{G}_{1}, because the MCS size between two graphs is less than or equal to the size of the smaller graph., the more similar the two graphs are. According to this fact, we infer Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS) implicitly and then obtain the normalized MCS size in an end-to-end fashion. First, we perform message passing from ùí¢2subscriptùí¢2\\mathcal{G}_{2} to ùí¢1subscriptùí¢1\\mathcal{G}_{1} by the modified cross-graph attention mechanism, thereby obtaining |ùí¢1|subscriptùí¢1|\\mathcal{G}_{1}| pairs of node-level embeddings. In each pair, one embedding represents one node in ùí¢1subscriptùí¢1\\mathcal{G}_{1} and the another embedding represents one node in ùí¢2subscriptùí¢2\\mathcal{G}_{2} most likely matching the former. After concatenating the two embeddings in the embedding pair, we use MLP to transform the concatenation to the matching score between zero and one, where one and zero represent that two nodes are matched and not matched respectively. Finally, we add up the |ùí¢1|subscriptùí¢1|\\mathcal{G}_{1}| matching scores as the predicted MCS size and then normalize it to derive the predicted similarity score. The entire process is optimized by either GED222nGED‚Äã(ùí¢1,ùí¢2)=exp‚Å°(‚àíGED‚Äã(ùí¢1,ùí¢2)(|ùí¢1|+|ùí¢2|)/2).nGEDsubscriptùí¢1subscriptùí¢2GEDsubscriptùí¢1subscriptùí¢2subscriptùí¢1subscriptùí¢22\\mathrm{nGED}\\left(\\mathcal{G}_{1},\\mathcal{G}_{2}\\right)=\\exp(\\frac{-\\mathrm{GED}\\left(\\mathcal{G}_{1},\\mathcal{G}_{2}\\right)}{\\left(\\left|\\mathcal{G}_{1}\\right|+\\left|\\mathcal{G}_{2}\\right|\\right)/2})./MCS normalized similarity or graph-graph classification label end-to-end.\nWe also stack a few vanilla transformer encoder layers 6 with graph convolution layers to capture more global information, called Graph Convolution with Transformer (GCwT). Unlike the inherent order of sentences in natural language 6, graphs are permutation-invariant, resulting in no order for nodes. Thus we propose a novel Positional Encoding based on permutation-invariant node ordering. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that INFMCS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for graph-graph classification and regression tasks. Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of individual components, including the proposed graph similarity learning paradigm and GCwT with novel Positional Encoding. In brief, we highlight our main contributions as follows: We propose a more interpretable end-to-end paradigm for graph similarity learning. The interpretability is derived from inferring MCS implicitly. To our best knowledge, the proposed Positional Encoding based on permutation-invariant node ordering is the first being proposed and used in the graph-transformer related model for graph similarity task. Like the order of tokens in sentences, permutation-invariant node ordering is also an essential graph feature. We perform comprehensive experiments on six graph-graph regression datasets and two graph-graph classification datasets to verify the effectiveness of the INFMCS. Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of individual components. Also, the case study and visualization demonstrate interpretability.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: GED between graphs of more than 16 nodes within a reasonable time so far .
