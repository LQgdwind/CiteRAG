      "content": "Paper Title: SynthVSR: Scaling Up Visual Speech Recognition With Synthetic Supervision\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisual speech recognition (VSR), also known as lip reading, is the task of recognizing speech content based on visual lip movements. VSR has a wide range of applications in real-world scenarios such as helping the hearing-impaired perceive human speech and improving automatic speech recognition (ASR) in noisy environments. VSR is a challenging task, as it requires capturing speech from high-dimensional spatio-temporal videos, while multiple words are visually ambiguous (e.g., “world” and “word”) in the visual streams.\nRecently, with the release of large-scale transcribed audio-visual datasets such as LRS2 [ref]1 and LRS3 [ref]2, deep neural networks have become the mainstream approach for VSR. However, even the largest public dataset for English VSR, LRS3, does not exceed 500 hours of transcribed video data. The lack of large-scale transcribed audio-visual datasets potentially results in VSR models which could only work in a laboratory environment i.e. limited word vocabulary and lip sources diversity . A common solution to this issue is to collect and annotate large-scale audio-visual datasets. For example,   collected 90,000 hours of YouTube videos with user-uploaded transcriptions to achieve state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. However, such a procedure is expensive and time-consuming, especially for most of the world’s 7,000 languages 3. If annotations are missing, the ASR can be used to generate the transcriptions automatically and this has been shown to be an effective approach to significantly improve VSR performance . The other promising direction is to learn audio-visual speech representations from large amounts of parallel unlabeled audio-visual data in a self-supervised approach, and then fine-tune them on the limited labeled video dataset 3. Nevertheless, publicly available video datasets are also limited and their usage may raise license-related111Such as LRW  and LRS2 [ref]1 datasets which are only permitted for the purpose of academic research. concerns, barring their use in commercial applications. Human perception of speech is inherently multimodal, involving both audition and vision 3. ASR, which is a complementary task to VSR, has achieved impressive performance in recent years, with tens of thousands of hours of annotated speech datasets    available for large-scale training. It is intuitive to ask: Can we improve VSR with large amounts of transcribed acoustic-only ASR training data? The key to this question is to take advantage of recent advances in speech-driven visual generative models 9 . By leveraging visual generative models, we can produce parallel synthetic videos for large-scale labeled audio datasets. Synthetic videos provide advantages such as having control over the target text and lip image as well as the duration of a generated utterance. To the best of our knowledge, the potential of leveraging synthetic visual data for improving VSR has never been studied in the literature. In this work, we present SynthVSR, a novel semi-supervised framework for VSR. In particular, we first propose a speech-driven lip animation model that can generate synthetic lip movements video conditioned on the speech content. Next, the proposed lip animation model is used to generate synthetic video clips from transcribed speech datasets (e.g., Librispeech ) and human face datasets (e.g., CelebA ). Then, the synthetic videos together with the corresponding transcriptions are used in combination with the real video-text pairs (e.g., LRS3 [ref]2) for large-scale semi-supervised VSR training. The pipeline of SynthVSR is illustrated in Fig. 1. Unlike existing studies in exploiting unlabeled video data for VSR using methods such as pseudo-labeling  and self-supervised learning 3, we use the unlabeled audio-visual data to train a cross-modal generative model in order to bridge ASR training data and VSR. Furthermore, we propose to optimize the lip animation model towards a pre-trained VSR model when labeled videos are available. We empirically demonstrate that the semantically high level, spatio-temporal supervision signal from the pre-trained VSR model offers the lip animation model more accurate lip movements. SynthVSR achieves remarkable performance gains with labeled video data of different scales. We evaluate the performance of SynthVSR on the largest public VSR benchmark LRS3 with a Conformer-Transformer encoder-decoder VSR model . In the low-resource setup using only 30 hours of labeled video data from LRS3 [ref]2, our approach achieves a VSR WER of 43.3%, substantially outperforming the former VSR methods using hundreds or thousands of hours of video data for supervised training  [ref]1  4  and self-supervised learning 3  . Notably, we demonstrate the first successful attempt that trains a VSR model with considerable WER performance using only 30 hours of real video data. Using the complete 438 hours from LRS3 further improves WER to 27.9% which is on par with the state-of-the-art self-supervised method AV-HuBERT-LARGE 3 that uses external 1,759 hours of unlabeled audio-visual data, but with fewer model parameters.\nFurthermore, following a recent high-resource setup  which uses additional 2,630 hours of ASR pseudo-labeled publicly available audio-visual data, our proposed method yields a new state-of-the-art VSR WER of 16.9%, surpassing the former state-of-the-art approaches   trained on 90,000 hours of non-public machine-transcribed data. Finally, we present extensive ablation studies to analyze where the improvement of SynthVSR comes from (e.g., the diversity of lip sources, the scale of ASR data). We also show considerable VSR improvement using synthetic video data derived from Text-To-Speech (TTS)-generated speech, indicating the great potential of our method for VSR.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: videos, while multiple words are visually ambiguous (e.g., “world” and “word”) in the visual streams.\nRecently, with the release of large-scale transcribed audio-visual datasets such as LRS2 [ref]1 and LRS3 [ref]2, deep neural networks have become the mainstream approach for VSR.
