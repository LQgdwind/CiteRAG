      "content": "Paper Title: Evaluating Large Language Models with Grid-Based Game Competitions: An Extensible LLM Benchmark and Leaderboard\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExisting benchmarks primarily focus on language understanding tasks such as sentiment analysis, question-answering, and comprehension. Although some tasks in BIG-bench involve game-like problem-solving skills, they do not assess LLMs’ performance in conventional games like chess or Go, which are valuable for evaluating strategic thinking and decision-making abilities. Using games as a benchmarking tool provides a unique perspective on LLM capabilities, highlighting their proficiency in understanding rules, formulating strategies, and making decisions. Strategic games like chess and Go emphasize predicting opponents’ moves, while games involving linguistic interaction test language mastery and contextual understanding. The dynamic nature of games allows researchers to observe LLMs’ adaptability and learning in real-time. Engaging in gameplay offers a standardized framework for comparing various LLMs’ performances under the same conditions, evaluating their strategic and creative problem-solving abilities, and capacity for innovative solutions. The controlled environment of games is instrumental for safely testing LLMs, allowing researchers to observe behaviors and mitigate potential risks or ethical concerns. Games involving human–AI interaction reveal how LLMs collaborate with or compete against humans, shedding light on human–AI relationship dynamics. Therefore, testing LLMs within the gaming domain extends beyond evaluating their ability to play games; it offers a comprehensive examination of strategic thinking, language processing, creativity, and adaptability, which is crucial for advancing AI research and ensuring the responsible development and deployment of these technologies. Text-based games present a distinctive and challenging domain for benchmarking LLMs. These interactive fiction games require models to understand natural language, interpret evolving game states, and generate appropriate commands within narrative-driven environments, demanding a profound grasp of language, context, and strategic application . Studies on models like FLAN-T5, Turing, and OPT in the text-based game \"Detective\" reveal that these LLMs fall short of state-of-the-art or human performance levels, facing challenges in adapting to game dynamics, learning from past interactions, and goal-oriented processing . The \"GameEval-Evaluating LLMs on Conversational Games\" paper introduces a framework for assessing LLMs through goal-driven conversational games, highlighting their abilities in complex discussions, decision-making, and problem-solving . The SmartPlay benchmark assesses LLMs across diverse games, emphasizing their evolution as intelligent agents [ref]32. The MindAgent infrastructure evaluates multi-agent collaboration, enhancing human–AI coordination [ref]33. Studies on LLM behavior in social interaction games like the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma and the Battle of the Sexes show challenges in adapting to strategies requiring mutual understanding and flexibility . Research by Lorè and Heydari on \"Strategic Behavior of Large Language Models\" underscores the role of context in strategic decision-making . Tsai et al. highlight limitations in LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4 in constructing world models and leveraging knowledge in text-based games, suggesting the potential for targeted benchmarks . The study \"Can Large Language Models Serve as Rational Players in Game Theory?\" evaluates LLMs’ potential in game theory, identifying gaps in mimicking human rationality . Another study explores models like Claude 2, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 in processing game strategy and spatial information through Tic-Tac-Toe, finding that prompt design significantly impacts performance . GTBENCH evaluates LLMs’ strategic reasoning in competitive game-theoretic tasks [ref]39. It features 10 tasks covering complete vs. incomplete information, dynamic vs. static, and probabilistic vs. deterministic scenarios. Results show LLMs struggle in complete, deterministic games but perform better in probabilistic ones. Commercial LLMs like GPT-4 outperform open-source models such as CodeLlama-34b-Instruct. Code-pretraining aids strategic reasoning, but advanced methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought do not consistently help. Detailed error profiles are provided to understand LLM behaviors [ref]39. GAMEBENCH evaluates strategic reasoning in LLMs across nine game environments, each highlighting key reasoning skills . Using GPT-3 and GPT-4, along with Chain-of-Thought prompting and Reasoning Via Planning (RAP), the study finds that while these frameworks improve performance, no model matches human capabilities, with GPT-4 sometimes performing worse than random actions. The games are selected to avoid overlap with the models’ pretraining corpuses. In a previous study, the authors evaluated the strategic thinking capabilities of various LLMs, including Claude 2.1, Gemini-Pro 1.0, GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, Llama2-70B, and Mistral Large, by having them play Tic-Tac-Toe through a mobile app . This study builds upon that research with additional games, more in-depth analysis, and a user-friendly web-based game simulation software to evaluate more recent LLMs. A recent survey paper explores the state of the art in applying LLMs to gaming, identifying the various roles LLMs can play within games. It highlights underexplored areas and promising directions for future research, reconciling the potential and limitations of LLMs in the gaming domain. This survey aims to serve as a foundation for future research and innovation in this emerging field . Another recent survey paper explores LLM-based game agents and their role in advancing toward AGI. It introduces the conceptual architecture centered on perception, memory, thinking, role-playing, action, and learning. The paper reviews methodologies and adaptation agility of existing LLM-based game agents across six game genres: adventure, communication, competition, cooperation, simulation, and crafting & exploration. It also provides future research directions in this field . These studies collectively deepen our understanding of LLMs’ strengths and weaknesses in gaming and interactive contexts, providing a foundation for future research to enhance their performance and cognitive skills. They highlight the value of using games as benchmarks to expose the capabilities and limitations of current AI systems, paving the way for developing advanced models with sophisticated reasoning and strategic thinking.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: their abilities in complex discussions, decision-making, and problem-solving .
