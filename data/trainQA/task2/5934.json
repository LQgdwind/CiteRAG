      "content": "Paper Title: Revisiting Test Time Adaptation under Online Evaluation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe follow prior art   [ref]8 and focus on the task of image classification.\nIn all our experiments, we assume that fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f_{\\theta} is a ResNet-50-BN333SAR demonstrated the superiority of using batch independent normalization layers under batch size of 1. We leave this ablation to the Appendix. [ref]12 trained on ImageNet  (pretrained weights obtained from torchvision).\nWe further assume that the stream 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} reveals batches of size 64444This batch size is recommended by most baselines  [ref]27, except for MEMO , which predicts on single images to incentivize prediction consistency over an input and its augmentations.\nRegarding datasets, we follow earlier works   [ref]27 [ref]8 , and thus evaluate on the ImageNet-C dataset  with a corruption level of 5 for all 15 corruptions.\nWe further extend our evaluation and consider both ImageNet-R , and the more recent ImageNet-3DCC , which leverages depth estimates to construct more spatially-consistent corruptions. Our experiments compare the performance of the baseline model fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f_{\\theta} (without test time adaptation) against 15 state-of-the-art TTA methods published in top-tier venues (e.g. CVPR, NeurIPS, and ICLR) between 2017 and 2023.\nIn particular, we consider: BN  and AdaBN , which adjust the statistics of the batch normalization layers; SHOT  and SHOT-IM , which finetune the feature extractor to maximize mutual information; entropy minimization approaches such as TENT , ETA [ref]27 (a more efficient version of TENT), and SAR , which trains the learnable parameters of the batch normalization layers; distillation approaches, such as CoTTA , Pseudo Labeling (PL) , and the very recent and efficient\nLAME ;\nEATA [ref]27 and TTAC 4 that assume access to the source training data;\ndata-dependent approaches such as MEMO  and the diffusion-based method DDA [ref]8.\nFor all methods, we use their official implementation with their recommended hyper-parameters.\nWe report our experimental results on a subset of 12 baselines, while leaving ETA, SHOT-IM, and PL, to the appendix due to space constraints and their similarity to SHOT and EATA. As mentioned in Section 3.2, our protocol performs an online computation of the relative adaptation speed of g𝑔g.\nIn particular, for each batch revealed by the stream, we compute 𝒞​(g​(x))𝒞𝑔𝑥\\mathcal{C}\\left(g(x)\\right). Then, if 𝒞​(g​(xi))=k𝒞𝑔subscript𝑥𝑖𝑘\\mathcal{C}(g(x_{i}))=k, all the samples {xi+1,xi+2,…,xi+k}subscript𝑥𝑖1subscript𝑥𝑖2…subscript𝑥𝑖𝑘\\{x_{i+1},x_{i+2},\\dots,x_{i+k}\\} are processed by fθisubscript𝑓subscript𝜃𝑖f_{\\theta_{i}} without adaptation.\nOtherwise, if 𝒞​(g​(xi))=1𝒞𝑔subscript𝑥𝑖1\\mathcal{C}(g(x_{i}))=1, then these samples are processed by g𝑔g.\nFor methods that accumulate parameter updates such as TENT , fθisubscript𝑓subscript𝜃𝑖f_{\\theta_{i}} is the most recent updated model g​(fθi−1)𝑔subscript𝑓subscript𝜃𝑖1g(f_{\\theta_{i-1}}).\nWe report all our main results as the average across three seeds, and leave the detailed analysis to the Appendix.\nThroughout the experiments, we refer to our Online evaluation protocol as “online”, and refer to the Offline protocol as “offline”.\nNext, we evaluate all methods on four different scenarios:\n(i) when domain shifts happen in an episodic manner (Section 4.2),\n(ii) when domain shifts happen continually, i.e. one after the other (Section 4.3),\n(iii) when the stream speed varies (Section 4.4), and\n(iv) when the baseline fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f_{\\theta} is unavailable for evaluating the samples skipped by the TTA method g𝑔g.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: We follow prior art   [ref]8 and focus on the task of image classification.\nIn all our experiments, we assume that fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f_{\\theta} is a ResNet-50-BN333SAR demonstrated the superiority of using batch independent\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
