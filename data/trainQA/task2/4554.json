      "content": "Paper Title: DisenHCN: Disentangled Hypergraph Convolutional Networks for Spatiotemporal Activity Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nDisenHCN model, we compare it with the following competitive methods, including tensor-based model, graph-based model and hypergraph-based model. The two compared tensor-based models are: SCP  is widely used in spatiotemporal activity prediction, which models user, location, time, and activity with a 4D tensor and conduct tensor decomposition to obtain latent features. MCTF  simultaneously factorizes coupled tensors and matrices shared common modes with the tensors, of which the matrices are constructed by reducing different dimensions (user, location, time, or activity). The four compared graph-based models are: CrossMap  is a state-of-the-art method for spatiotemporal activity prediction with cross-modal graph embeddings. SA-GCN  is a state-of-the-art method in App-usage activity prediction and adopts Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with meta path-based objective function to combine the structure of the graph and the attribute of units, including locations, time, and Apps. LightGCN  is a state-of-the-art method to learn node representations and capture user-item interaction in collaborative filtering. We adapt LightGCN to the same graph structure with SA-GCN as another competitive baseline. HAN  is a state-of-the-art method for heterogeneous graph learning. We adapt it to the graph in our task, with four types of nodes representing user, location, time, and activity and six types of edges representing co-occurrence relations, to solve our problem. The three compared hypergraph-based models are: DHCF  is a hypergraph-based collaborative filtering method for recommendation, which constructs two homogeneous hypergraphs for user and item respectively.\nSince it can only handle homogeneous graphs, to adapt it to our task, we construct four homogeneous hypergraphs for user, location, time and activity. MHCN  is another recently-proposed hypergraph learning model. It constructs a multi-channel hypergraph to capture the complex social relations among users for social recommendation. To adapt it to our problem, we construct three channels for location, time, and activity.\nFollowing the original paper, we also construct a user-location-time-activity interaction graph to capture the pair-wise interactions among user, location, time, and activity. HWNN  is a state-of-the-art heterogeneous hypergraph\nembedding method. We define six types meta relations, i.e. {UL, UT, UA, LT, LA, TA}, and with them we construct the heterogeneous hypergraph snapshots. It is worth mentioning that there exists some dynamic graph-based methods [ref]27 [ref]25  [ref]53 for spatiotemporal-aware problems, such as origin-destination flow  and stock movement forecasting [ref]53, which construct a spatial graph as a feature encoder for each time step and use RNN to fuse the features generated by spatial graphs. However, those dynamic graph-based methods can not be well applied to spatiotemporal activity prediction\nas these methods require constructing a spatial graph for each time step, consuming huge computation resources, which has been reported in  and . Thus, these works are always only evaluated on small-scale graph-structure data [ref]27 [ref]25  [ref]53.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: six types meta relations, i.e. {UL, UT, UA, LT, LA, TA}, and with them we construct the heterogeneous hypergraph snapshots.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
