      "content": "Paper Title: Explainable Link Prediction for Emerging Entities in Knowledge Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent years have seen a surge in the usage of large-scale cross-domain knowledge graphs \nfor various\ntasks, including factoid question answering, fact-based dialogue engines, and information retrieval . Knowledge graphs serve as a source of background factual knowledge for a wide range of applications [ref]6.\nFor example, Google‚Äôs knowledge graph is tightly integrated into its search engine, while Apple adopted Wikidata as a source of background knowledge for its virtual assistant Siri.\nMany such applications deal with\nqueries that can be transformed to a structured relational query of the form (es,rq,?)subscriptùëíssubscriptùëüq?(e_{\\mathrm{s}},r_{\\mathrm{q}},?), where essubscriptùëíse_{\\mathrm{s}} is the source entity and rqsubscriptùëüqr_{\\mathrm{q}} is the query relation.\nFor example, the query ‚ÄúWho is the director of World Health Organization?‚Äù can be mapped to the structured query (World Health Organization, director, ?) while executing it on a knowledge graph.\nUnfortunately, due to the inherent sparsity and incompleteness of knowledge graphs, answers to many such queries cannot be fetched directly from the existing data, but instead need to be inferred indirectly. Furthermore, with the ever-increasing volume of the knowledge graphs, the number of emerging entities also increases. Many of these emerging entities have a small number of known facts at the time they are integrated into the knowledge graphs. Therefore, their connectivity to pre-existing entities in the knowledge graph is often too sparse. In recent years, embedding-based models 8 have widely been adopted to infer missing relationships in a knowledge graph. In such embedding-based models, distributed vector representations of entities and relations in the knowledge graph are used to learn a scoring function f‚Äã(es,rq,eo)ùëìsubscriptùëíssubscriptùëüqsubscriptùëíof(e_{\\mathrm{s}},r_{\\mathrm{q}},e_{\\mathrm{o}}) in a latent embedding space to determine the plausibility of inferring a new fact.\nHowever, these models are lacking in terms of the interpretability and explainability of the decisions they make. One does not obtain any clear explanation of why a specific inference is warranted. For example, from the embeddings of facts (A, born_in, California) and (California located_in, US), the fact (A, born_in, US) could be deduced. But logical composition steps like this one are learned implicitly by knowledge graph embeddings. This means that this approach cannot offer such logical inference paths as support evidence for an answer. In contrast, path-based reasoning approaches operate in the symbolic space of entities and relations, leveraging the symbolic compositionality of the knowledge graph relations, thus making the inference process explainable. This means that the user can inspect the inference path, consisting of existing edges in the knowledge graph, as support evidence. To this end, purely symbolic and fast rule-mining systems, e.g., PRA 2, AMIE+ , and AnyBURL 5 may attain a level of performance that is comparable to embedding-based methods, but neglect many of the statistical signals exploited by the latter. To leverage the advantages of both path-based and embedding-based models, some neural-symbolic approaches   6 [ref]13  have as well been proposed.\nSome recent path-based reasoning approaches  3 formulate the path-finding problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), in which the model learns a policy to find an inference path from the source entity to the target entity using REINFORCE 1, a policy gradient based reinforcement learning algorithm. However, most of these approaches are studied with static snapshots of the knowledge graphs, thus severely restricting their applicability for a dynamically evolving knowledge graph with many emerging entities. Except for the purely symbolic rule-mining systems mentioned above, most existing approaches that depend on learning latent representations of entities require that all entities are present during training. Therefore, these models are incapable of learning representations of arbitrary newly emerging entities not seen during training. Some recent approaches such as HyTE  and DyRep  have considered dynamically evolving temporal knowledge graphs. However, similar to embedding-based models, these models are not explainable. To overcome this issue, we propose a joint framework for representation learning and reasoning in knowledge graphs that aims at achieving inductive node representation learning capabilities applicable to a dynamic knowledge graph with many emerging entities while preserving the unique advantage of the path-based approaches in terms of explainability. For inductive node representation learning, we propose a variant of Graph Transformer encoder 1 7 that aggregates neighborhood information based on its relevance to the query relation. Furthermore, we use policy gradient-based reinforcement learning (REINFORCE) to decode a reasoning path to the answer entity.\nWe hypothesize that the inductively learned embeddings provide prior semantic knowledge about the underlying knowledge environment to the reinforcement learning agent. We summarize the contributions of this paper as follows: (1) We introduce a joint framework for inductive representation learning and explainable reasoning that is capable of learning representations for unseen emerging entities during inference by leveraging only a small number of known connections to the other pre-existing entities in the knowledge graph. Our approach can not only infer new connections between an emerging entity and any other pre-existing entity in the knowledge graph, but also provides an explainable reasoning path as support evidence for the inference. (2) We introduce new train/development/test set splits of existing knowledge graph completion benchmark datasets that are appropriate for inductive representation learning and reasoning.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: including factoid question answering, fact-based dialogue engines, and information retrieval .
