      "content": "Paper Title: Geometry-Complete Diffusion for 3D Molecule Generation and Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe first dataset used in our experiments, the QM9 dataset (Ramakrishnan\net¬†al. ), contains molecular properties and 3D atom coordinates for 130k small molecules. Each molecule in QM9 can contain up to 29 atoms. For the task of 3D molecule generation, we train GCDM to unconditionally generate molecules by producing atom types (H, C, N, O, and F), integer atom charges, and 3D coordinates for each of the molecules‚Äô atoms. Following Anderson et¬†al. , we split QM9 into training, validation, and test partitions consisting of 100k, 18k, and 13k molecule examples, respectively. Metrics. We adopt the scoring conventions of Satorras et¬†al. [ref]17 by using the distance between atom pairs and their respective atom types to predict bond types (single, double, triple, or none) for all but one baseline method (i.e., E-NF). Subsequently, we measure the proportion of generated atoms that have the right valency (atom stability - AS) and the proportion of generated molecules for which all atoms are stable (molecule stability - MS). To offer additional insights into each method‚Äôs behavior for 3D molecule generation, we also report the validity (Val) of a generated molecule as determined by RDKit (Landrum et¬†al. ) and the uniqueness of the generated molecules overall (Uniq). Baselines. Besides including a reference point for molecule quality metrics using QM9 itself (i.e., Data), we compare GCDM (a geometry-complete DDPM - i.e., GC-DDPM) to 10 baseline models for 3D molecule generation using QM9: G-Schnet (Gebauer et¬†al. ); Equivariant Normalizing Flows (E-NF) (Satorras et¬†al. [ref]17); Graph Diffusion Models (GDM) (Hoogeboom\net¬†al. [ref]20) and their variations (i.e., GCM-aug); Equivariant Diffusion Models (EDM) (Hoogeboom\net¬†al. [ref]20); Bridge and Bridge + Force (Wu et¬†al. ); latent diffusion models (LDMs) such as GraphLDM and its variation GraphLDM-aug (Xu et¬†al. [ref]22); as well as the state-of-the-art GeoLDM method (Xu et¬†al. [ref]22). For each of these baseline methods, we report their results as curated by Wu et¬†al.  and Xu et¬†al. [ref]22. We further include two GCDM ablation models to more closely analyze the impact of certain key model components within GCDM. These two ablation models include GCDM without chiral and geometry-complete local frames ‚Ñ±i‚Äãjsubscript‚Ñ±ùëñùëó\\mathcal{F}_{ij} (i.e., GCDM w/o Frames) and GCDM without scalar message attention (SMA) applied to each edge message (i.e., GCDM w/o SMA). In Section 3 as well as Appendices A.1 and B of our supplementary materials, we further discuss GCDM‚Äôs design, hyperparameters, and optimization with these model configurations. Results. In Table 1, we see that GCDM matches or outperforms all previous methods for all metrics, with generated samples shown in Figure 2. In particular, GCDM generates the highest percentage of probable (NLL), valid, and unique molecules compared to all baseline methods, improving upon previous SOTA results in such measures by 54%, 1%, and 1%, respectively. Our ablation of SMA within GCDM demonstrates that, to generate stable 3D molecules, GCDM heavily relies on both being able to perform a lightweight version of fully-connected graph self-attention (Vaswani et¬†al. ), similar to previous methods (Hoogeboom\net¬†al. [ref]20), which suggests avenues of future research that will be required to scale up such generative models to large biomolecules such as proteins. Additionally, removing geometric local frame embeddings from GCDM reveals that the inductive biases of molecular chirality and geometry-completeness are important contributing factors in GCDM achieving these SOTA results.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: et¬†al. , we split QM9 into training, validation, and test partitions consisting of 100k, 18k, and 13k molecule examples, respectively.
