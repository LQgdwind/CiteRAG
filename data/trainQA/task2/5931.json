      "content": "Paper Title: EKILA: Synthetic Media Provenance and Attribution for Generative Art\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGenerative AI (GenAI) is transforming digital art, creating compelling synthetic images by sampling millions of diverse creative works  [ref]42 6. However, describing the provenance of synthetic assets – i.e. their generative models and the assets used to train them – is critical to the acceptance of GenAI. Much as the music industry matured from ad-hoc sampling in the eighties to a formal model for consent and paid reuse, the ability to commodify the image data sampled to train GenAI models may establish a new facet of our future creative economy. To this end, we propose EKILA111From eh⋅⋅\\cdotki⋅⋅\\cdotl: “complex rules that help people understand how to share in the right way.” o. Mbendjele, D.C. Congo.[ref]28; a decentralized framework for assigning usage rights to creative assets and compensating creators when those rights are exercised. We tie the latter to a novel attribution and apportionment method for establishing synthetic images' provenance (origins), providing a means for creatives to be recognized and rewarded for their contributions to GenAI. EKILA is decentralized in that it uses tokenized representations of creative assets (Non-fungible Tokens: `NFTs'). NFTs are immutable digital representations of creative works created (`minted') on the blockchain . One problem with NFTs in their current form is that purchasers are not conveyed any concrete `rights’ (e.g. to make derivative works via GenAI or otherwise) . This limits the scope for NFT use in creative works, leaving their primary use as a vehicle for financial speculation 1. Furthermore, ownership provenance and creation provenance are not coupled in NFTs, leaving assets open to unauthorized re-sale (`copy-minting' ). EKILA addresses these shortcomings by extending NFTs from the consideration solely of ownership provenance to the provenance of any usage right related to the NFT and links this to the creation provenance of the asset using an emerging open standard (the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity: `C2PA' ). As such, EKILA provides a means for describing the ownership, rights, and attribution of assets without recourse to a centralized registry, leveraging this in the context of GenAI to enable fair recognition and reward for creators. We make three technical contributions: 1. ORA Triangle. We extend NFTs to propose a model that jointly describes the (O)wnership, usage, (R)ights, and (A)ttribution of assets. ORA assets are `owned' by a smart contract operated by the creator rather than directly by an individual assignee, enabling tokenized rights to be assigned in a one-many relationship. Under ORA, NFT assets also bear attribution metadata (C2PA) describing their creation provenance. Rights tokens are tied to this C2PA metadata to prevent substitution of the asset. This three-way binding (the `ORA Triangle') addresses two major limitations of NFTs: dynamic assignment of image rights and protection against `copy-minting' . 2. Synthetic Media Attribution. We apply the C2PA provenance standard  to describe synthetic image provenance, namely the GenAI model that generated an image and the training data of that model. We propose a robust visual matching method to attribute synthetic images (or parts thereof) to a subset of that training data and to apportion credit to recognize the creative contribution of training data responsible for that image. We show this method to operate robustly over millions of images and image patches and, notably, to outperform CLIP 4 and common perceptual metrics (LPIPS , SIFID 9) at the attribution task. 3. Royalty mechanism. We combine both (1) and (2) to automatically compensate creators via crypto-currency payment for their contributions to synthetic art. The royalty mechanism enables creators to receive apportioned credit via crypto-currency payment when their training images are attributed to generated images.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: Generative AI (GenAI) is transforming digital art, creating compelling synthetic images by sampling millions of diverse creative works  [ref]42 6.
