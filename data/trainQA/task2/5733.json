      "content": "Paper Title: Exorcising “Wraith”: Protecting LiDAR-based Object Detector in Automated Driving System from Appearing Attacks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn automated driving systems (ADS), multiple deep neural networks (DNNs) are jointly deployed to provide key functionalities of localization, perception and planning, stimulating the recent development of automated transportation   . The robustness of each DNN module is of key importance to the security of the whole ADS. A typical example is the perception module, which relies on a vector of object detectors, based on multiple sources like cameras and LiDARs , to predict the categories and locations of the obstacles around the ADS  [ref]32.\nAs the LiDAR point clouds (PCs) contain richer location information than the images from cameras, most commercial ADS, including Google’s Waymo One   and Baidu’s Apollo  , set LiDARs as the main sensors and rely on the detection results of LiDAR-based object detectors for obstacle perception 7  [ref]37 [ref]32. Differently using PC as the model input, LiDAR-based object detectors still share the common vulnerability against adversarial examples   . In general, the attacker can spoof the LiDAR sensors with a limited number of perturbed/crafted points to mislead the detector’s prediction.\nAs a popular attack class, the appearing attack aims at forging non-existent cars in the detection results to cause traffic jams and emergency braking  1 (Fig.1).\nDespite the severity, existing defenses  5 4 either have strong prior assumptions on the undergoing attacks, or are biased by predefined heuristic rules, insufficient for handling complex driving scenarios (§3.3). Our Work. In this paper, we propose a novel plug-and-play defense for 3D object detectors, which, instead of constructing a more robust model,\nadopts a local objectness predictor (LOP) module to detect and eliminate forged obstacles from the original detection results.\nIn general, our LOP is designed as a point-wise PC classifier  9   which learns to predict each local part of a detected object with an objectness score, i.e., the confidence of whether the local part belongs to a real object.\nBy systematizing recent appearing attacks, we develop the following defensive insights: Recent appearing attacks focus on increasing the confidence score of a fake detection result without considering the local difference between a real and a forged obstacle. Although an increased confidence score enhances the possibility of a non-existent obstacle to be detected by a 3D object detector, most appearing attacks leave the fake and the real obstacles locally distinguishable when inspected at the granularity of pillars or voxels (§4.1) Constrained by the physical capability of attack apparatus, appearing attacks are usually unable to forge a fake obstacle without violating some physical laws,\nespecially the inimitable relation between the depth and the point density of real obstacles 4.\nTo pose real-world threats, the forged obstacles have to be close to the victim ADS, because otherwise they can be easily bypassed after the victim’s re-routing.\nYet, constrained by the attack apparatus (e.g., a laser transmitter ), the attacker can only forge a limited number of points near the victim during one scan of the LiDAR, which could hardly reach the normal point density of a real car at a close distance (§4.2). Concurrent to our defense, Hau et al. 4 also notices the importance of the physical law in detecting forged obstacles, and presents a set of hand-crafted rules to eliminate the anomaly. Our work steps further by showing stronger robustness can be achieved if we exploit learning-based techniques to model the complicated physical laws. In fact, modeling the relation between the depth and the point density is rather challenging with hand-crafted rules. For example, although most of the real cars with smaller depth tend to have larger point density, those real cars occluded by others may also have smaller depth and point density simultaneously (Fig.4).\nTo address this challenge, we implement the LOP as a DNN-based point-wise PC classification model and explicitly incorporate the depth information of each point into its feature vector.\nThis substantially improves the modeling capability compared with using the original input feature for statistical outlier detection. Moreover, another technical challenge is the lack of no explicit annotation available for supervising the training of LOP in standard 3D object detection datasets.\nInspired by a recent observation that a single part of the input already contains rich semantic information for a PC model to predict its related object’s category and location 5,\nwe construct a self-supervised learning task where the LOP learns to predict whether a pillar intersects with any bounding box of real objects based on the features of its inside points.\nDuring the detection, we first divide the input 3D space into equal-sized pillars, then the LOP predicts an objectness score for each pillar intersected with a predicted object’s bounding box. By majority voting on the local objectness predictions, our defense determines whether the object is real or fake (§4.3). Our Contributions. In summary, the key contributions of this work are as follows: • We systematize the limitations of\nrecent appearing attacks in violating the physical invariants and propose a learning-based defense to detect the forged obstacles with anomaly in the relation between the depth and the point density for the mainstream LiDAR-based object detectors. • We propose the design of our local objectness predictor (LOP) which learns to predict the confidence of whether a local object part belongs to a real object, and allows plug-and-play integration with different defense targets for enhancing robustness against popular appearing attacks. •  Extensive evaluation on mainstream 3D detectors (i.e., PointPillars 7, PointRCNN  and PV-RCNN [ref]37) on the KITTI dataset 9 and on real-world PC data we collect from a driving test of the D-KIT Advanced with Velodyne-128  validate the advantages of our proposed defense under three popular attacks. For example, with the same-level trade-off in model utility, our proposed defense eliminates at least 70%percent7070\\% cars forged by most appearing attacks, while the best baseline method only eliminates the forged ones less than 30%percent3030\\%. • Moreover, we empirically validate that the effectiveness of our proposed LOP is robust to the architecture design of the LOP, the type of the defense target (including fusion models) which further implies our defense is more general-purpose than existing defenses. Besides, we also provide a preliminary study on the robustness of LOP against adaptive attacks. • We further implement and evaluate the effectiveness of LOP in Apollo 6.0.0, an end-to-end open-source self-driving system, with closed-loop control in the LGSVL simulation tests, which validates the system-level usefulness of our proposed defense in both benign and adversarial scenarios.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: is the perception module, which relies on a vector of object detectors, based on multiple sources like cameras and LiDARs , to predict the categories and locations of the obstacles around the ADS  [ref]32.\nAs the LiDAR point clouds (PCs) contain richer location information than the images from cameras, most commercial ADS, including Google’s Waymo One   and Baidu’s Apollo  , set LiDARs as the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
