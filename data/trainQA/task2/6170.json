      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey of Safety and Trustworthiness of Large Language Models through the Lens of Verification and Validation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA Large Language Model (LLM) is a deep learning model equipped with a massive amount of learnable parameters (commonly reaching more than 10 billion).\nLLMs are attention-based sequential models based on the transformer architecture , which consistently demonstrated the ability to learn universal representations of language. The universal representations of language can then be used in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) task.\nThe recent scale-up of these models, in terms of both numbers of parameters and pre-trained corpora, has\nconfirmed the universality of transformers as mechanisms to encode language representations. At a specific scale, these models started to exhibit in-context learning  , and the properties of learning from few examples (zero/one/few-shot – without the need for fine-tuning) and from natural language prompts (complex instructions which describe the behavioural intent that the model needs to operate). Recent works on Reinforcement Learning via Human Feedback (RLHF)  have further developed the ability of these models to align and respond to increasingly complex prompts, leading to their popularisation in systems such as ChatGPT  and their use in a large spectrum of applications.\nThe ability of LLMs to deliver sophisticated linguistic and reasoning behaviour, has pushed their application beyond their intended operational envelope. While being consistently fluent, LLMs are prone to hallucinations , stating factually incorrect statements , lacking necessary mechanisms of safety, lacking transparency and control , among many others. Such vulnerabilities and limitations have already led to bad consequences such as suicide case , lawyer submitted fabricated cases as precedent to the court , leakage of private information , etc. Therefore, research is urgently needed to understand the potential vulnerabilities and how the LLM s’ behaviour can be assured to be safe and trustable.\nThe goal of this paper is to provide a review of known vulnerabilities and limitations of LLM s and, more importantly, to investigate how the V&V techniques can be adapted to improve the safety and trustworthiness of LLM s. While there are several surveys on LLM s [ref]370 [ref]365, as well as a categorical archive of ChatGPT failures , to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides a comprehensive discussion on the safety and trustworthiness issues, from the perspective of the V&V. With the rising of LLM s and its wide applications, the need to ensure their safety and trustworthiness become prominent.\nConsidering the broader subject of deep learning systems, to support their safety and trustworthiness, a diverse set of technical solutions have been developed by different research communities. For example, the machine learning community is focused on adversarial attacks  [ref]224  , outlier detectors 3, adversarial training  1 , and explainable AI    . The human-computer interaction community is focused on engaging the learning systems in the interactions with end users to improve the end users’ confidence . Formal methods community treats ML models as yet another symbolic system (evidenced by their consideration of neurons, layers, etc.) and adapts existing formal methods tools to work on the new systems . While research has been intense on these individual methods, a synergy among them has not been addressed. Without a synergy, it is hard, if not impossible, to rigorously understand the causality between methods and how they might collectively support the safe and trusted autonomous systems at runtime. This survey is rooted in the field of AI assurance, aiming to apply a collection of rigorous V&V methods throughout the lifecycle of ML models, to provide assurance on the safety and trustworthiness. An illustrative diagram is given in Figure 1 for general ML models. To begin with, data collection and synthesis is required to obtain as many as possible the training data, including the synthesis of high quality data through e.g., data argumentation or generative models.\nIn the training phase, other than the prediction accuracy, multiple activities are needed, including e.g., the analysis of the learned feature representations and the checking for unintended bias.\nAfter the training, we apply offline V&V methods to the ML model, including techniques to falsify, explain, and verify the ML models. During the deployment phase, we must analyse the impact and hazard of the potential application environment. The operational design domain and operational data will be recorded. A run-time monitor is associated to the ML model to detect outliers, distribution shifts, and failures in the application environment. We may further apply reliability assessment methods to evaluate the reliability of the ML model and identify failure scenarios. Based on the detection or assessment results, we can identify the gaps for improvement. Finally, we outline the factors that affect the performance of the ML model, and optimise the training algorithm to obtain an enhanced ML model. These V&V techniques have been successful in supporting the reliable and dependable development of software and hardware that are applied to safety-critical systems, and have been adapted to work with machine learning models, mainly focusing on the convolutional neural networks for image classification (see surveys such as   and textbooks such as ), but also extended to consider, for example, object detection, deep reinforcement learning, and recurrent neural networks. This paper discusses how to extend further the V&V techniques to deal with the safety and trustworthiness challenges of LLM s. V&V are independent procedures that are used together for checking that a system (or product, service) meets requirements and specifications and that it fulfills its intended purpose . Among them, verification techniques check the system against a set of design specifications, and validation techniques ensure that the system meets the user’s operational needs. From software, convolutional neural networks to LLM s, the scale of the systems grows significantly, which makes the usual V&V techniques less capable due to their computational scalability issues. White-box V&V techniques that take the learnable parameters as their algorithmic input will not work well in practice. Instead, the research should focus on black-box techniques, on which some research has started for convolutional neural networks. In addition, V&V techniques need to consider the non-deterministic nature of LLM s (i.e., different outputs for two tests with identical input), which is a noticeable difference with the usual neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks and object detectors, that currently most V&V techniques work on. Considering the fast development of LLMs, this survey does not intend to be complete (although it includes 370+ references), especially when it comes to the applications of LLMs in various domains, but rather a collection of organised literature reviews and discussions to support the\nunderstanding of the safety and trustworthiness issues from the perspective of V&V. Through the survey, we noticed that the current research are focused on identifying the vulnerabilities, with limited efforts on systematic approaches to evaluate and verify the safety and trustworthiness properties. The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we review the LLM s and its categories, its lifecycle, and several techniques introduced to improve safety and trustworthiness. Then, in Section 3, we present a review of existing vulnerabilities. This is followed by a general verification framework in Section 4. The framework includes V&V techniques such as falsification and evaluation (Section 5), verification (Section 6), runtime monitor (Section 7), and ethical use (Section 8). We conclude the paper in Section 10.\n\nReference markers found: [370]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]370: and limitations of LLM s and, more importantly, to investigate how the V&V techniques can be adapted to improve the safety and trustworthiness of LLM s.
