      "content": "Paper Title: iSAGE: An Incremental Version of SAGE for Online Explanation on Data Streams\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIf machine learning is used for high-stake decision-making, e.g., in healthcare  or energy consumption analysis , models learned on data should be transparent and explainable. However, as the best performing models are often opaque in nature, this is typically not the case. The field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) addresses this problem by developing methods to uncover the inner working of black box models and to make the input-output relationships represented by such models more understandable .\nNotably, this includes global feature importance (global FI) methods, which quantify the influence of individual input features on the model predictions, and seek to rank the features in terms of their importance. So far, XAI has mainly focused on static learning scenarios, where a single model is learned from data in a batch mode.\nHowever, in modern machine learning applications such as online credit risk scoring for financial services , intrusion detection in networks , or sensor network analysis  , data is not static but coming in the form of a continuously evolving stream of data.\nIn applications of that kind, online algorithms are needed for learning in an incremental mode, processing data in a sequential manner one by one. Incremental learning should not only be time- and memory-efficient, but must also account for possible changes in the underlying data distribution, which is referred to as concept drift. Such drift may occur in different forms and for different reasons, e.g., as a change of energy consumption patterns or hospital admission criteria due to pandemic-induced lockdowns . In dynamic scenarios, where models are constantly evolving and reacting to their changing environment, static explanations do no longer suffice.\nInstead, explanations for monitoring dynamic models should be updated in a continuous manner, similar to the models themselves.\nIn this work, we compute global FI in an incremental manner, thereby also addressing the challenge of drifting data distributions, where batch methods are likely to yield wrong explanations (cf. Fig. 7 in Appendix 0.C).\nProviding an incremental global FI method comes with various challenges, not only conceptually and algorithmically, but also computationally, especially because the computation of many FI measures is already prohibitive in the batch setting.\n We take a first step towards efficient explanations for changing models on data streams and contribute: iSAGE; a model-agnostic global FI algorithm that provides time- and memory-efficient incremental estimates of SAGE values and is able to react to changes in the model and concept drift. interventional and observational iSAGE; two conceptual approaches to define SAGE values that extend on the existing discussion of appropriate feature removal techniques with an efficient incremental algorithm.\n open source implementation; a well-tested and general implementation\nof our algorithms and experiments that integrates into the well-known River 1 Python framework.111iSAGE is implemented in iXAI at https://github.com/mmschlk/iXAI. Global FI is an active part of XAI research, and various methods have been proposed .\nModel-specific methods were developed based on the magnitude of weights for linear models and neural networks 5 , as well as split heuristics for tree-based models 7.\nAnother common approach to global FI is to aggregate local explanations, such as model-agnostic LIME 7 and SHAP [ref]39 or neural network specific methods 2 7 0 1 .\nPermutation Feature Importance (PFI) [ref]8 is a well-established model-agnostic, global FI method with various extensions 0  .\nSAGE is based on the Shapley value 9, similar to SHAP [ref]39 and LossSHAP  and overcomes computational limitations of aggregating local SHAP explanations.\nRetricting a model to compute FI is done either by retaining (observational) or breaking (interventional) feature dependencies, where it was shown that both methods generate different explanations and the choice should depend on the application 1  2. Traditionally, XAI focuses on the batch learning scenario.\nHowever, recently more methods that natively support incremental, dynamic learning environments are proposed.\nFor instance, online feature selection methods compute FI periodically  6.\nHaug et al. 8 propose a concept drift detection algorithm based on clusterings and changes in SHAP’s base value.\nA model-specific approach for tree-based models is measuring the mean decrease in impurity (MDI) 0 4.\nIn the notion of explaining change 3, iPFI 2 is a related model-agnostic approach that computes the traditional PFI [ref]8 in an incremental manner.\nTo efficiently restrict the model 5, we rely on geometric sampling 2 (interventional) and a combination of the conditional subgroup approach 0 and the TreeSHAP methodology  (observational). Existing online FI methods are either model-specific or interpretation of the resulting feature importance scores is unintuitive, emphasizing the need for incremental variants of Shapley-based explanations, such as SAGE.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: models and neural networks 5 , as well as split heuristics for tree-based models 7.\nAnother common approach to global FI is to aggregate local explanations, such as model-agnostic LIME 7 and SHAP [ref]39 or neural network specific methods 2 7 0 1 .\nPermutation Feature Importance (PFI) [ref]8 is a well-established model-agnostic, global FI method with various extensions 0  .\nSAGE is based on\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
