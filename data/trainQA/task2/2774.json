      "content": "Paper Title: From SLAM to Situational Awareness: Challenges and Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis section covers the recent works which focus only on the complex high-level representations of the environment.\nMost of these methods assume the SLAM problem to be solved and focus only on the scene representation.\nAn ideal environmental representation must be efficient concerning the required resources, capable of reasonably estimating regions not directly observed, and flexible enough to perform reasonably well in new environments without any significant adaptations. Occupancy mapping is a method for constructing an environment map in robotics.\nIt involves dividing the environment into a grid of cells, each representing a small portion of the environment.\nThe occupancy of a cell represents the likelihood of that cell being occupied by an obstacle or not.\nInitially, all cells in the map can be considered unknown or unoccupied.\nAs the robot moves and senses the environment, the occupancy of cells is updated based on sensor data.\nOne of the most popular approaches in this category is Octomap .\nThey represent the grid of cells through a hierarchical structure that allows a more efficient query of the occupancy probability in a certain space. The adoption of  Signed Distance Field (SDF)-based in robotics is well established to represent the robot’s surroundings [ref]222 to enable planning a trajectory towards the mission goal safely [ref]223. In general, SDF is a three-dimensional function that maps points of a metric space to the distance to the nearest surface. SDF can represent distances in any number of dimensions, including two-dimensional and higher-dimensional spaces, and can represent complex geometries and shapes with an arbitrary curvature and are therefore widely used in computer graphics. However, a severe limitation of SDF is that they can only represent watertight surfaces, i.e., surfaces that divide the space into inside and outside . SDF has two main variations,  Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) and  Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF), which usually apply to a discretized space made of voxels.\nOn the one hand, ESDF gives the distance to the closest obstacle for free voxels and the contrary for occupied ones.\nThey have been used for mapping in FIESTA , where the authors exploit the property of direct modeling free space for collision checking and the gradient information for planning  while dramatically improving their efficiency.\nOn the other hand, TSDF relies on projective distance, which is the distance measured along the sensor ray from the camera to the observed surface.\nThe distances are calculated only within a specific radius around the surface boundary, known as the truncation radius .\nThis helps improve computational efficiency and reduce storage requirements while accurately reconstructing the observed scene.\nTSDF has been demonstrated in multiple works such as Voxgraph , Freetures , Voxblox++ , or the more recent Voxblox-Field .\nThey can create and maintain globally consistent volumetric maps that are lightweight enough to run on computationally constrained platforms and demonstrate that the resulting representation can navigate unknown environments.\nPanoptic segmentation has been integrated with TSDF by  for labeling each voxel semantically while differentiating between stuff, e.g., the background wall and floor, from things, e.g., movable objects. Furthermore,  leverage pixel-wise semantics to maintain temporal consistency and detect changes in the map caused by movable objects, hence surpassing the limitations of a static environment assumption. Implicit Neural Representations (INR) (sometimes also referred to as coordinate-based representations) are a novel way to parameterize signals of all kinds, even environments parameterized as 3D points clouds, voxels, or meshes.\nWith this in mind, Scene Representation Networks (SRNs)  are proposed as a continuous scene representation that encodes both geometry and appearance and can be trained without any 3D supervision.\nIt is shown that SRNs generalize well across scenes, can learn geometry and appearance priors, and are helpful for novel view synthesis, few-shot reconstruction, joint shape, and appearance interpolation unsupervised discovery of non-rigid models.\nIn , a new approach is presented, capable of modeling signals with fine details and accurately capturing their spatial and temporal derivatives.\nBased on periodic activation functions, this approach demonstrates that the resulting neural networks referred to as Sinusoidal Representation Networks (SIRENs) are well suited for representing complex signals, including 3D scenes. Neural Radiance Fields (NERF)  exploits the framework of INRs to render realistic 3d scenes by a differential process that takes as input a ray direction and predicts the color and density of the scene along that ray.\n pioneered the first application of NERF to SLAM for representing the knowledge of the 3D structure inside the weights of a deep NN. For their promising results, this research prospect attracted numerous following works that continuously improve the fidelity of the reconstructions and the possibility of updating the knowledge of the scene while maintaining previously-stored information   . Differently from the previous dense environment representation methods, which are helpful for autonomous navigation, sparser scene representation also exists, such as point clouds and surfel maps, which are more commonly used for more straightforward tasks such as localization. Remarkably, a surfel, i.e., a surface element, is defined by its position in 3D space, the surface normal, and other attributes such as color and texture. Their use has been extensively explored in recent LIDAR-based SLAM to efficiently represent a 3D map that can be performed as a consequence of optimization following revisited places, i.e., loop closure  . 3D scene graphs have also been researched to represent a scene, such as   , which build a model of the environment, including not only metric and semantic information but also essential topological relationships between the objects of the environment.\nThey can construct an environmental graph spanning an entire building, including the semantics of objects (class, material, and shape), rooms, and the topological relationships between these entities.\nHowever, these methods are executed offline and require an available 3D mesh of the building with the registered RGB images to generate the 3D scene graphs.\nConsequently, they can only work in static environments. Dynamic Scene Graphs (see Fig. 7) are an extension of the aforementioned scene graphs to include dynamic elements (e.g., humans) of the environment in an actionable representation of the scene that captures geometry and semantics [ref]240.\n present the first method to build a DSG automatically using the input of a VIO . Furthermore, it allows tracking of the pose of humans and optimizes the mesh based on the deformation of the space induced by detected loop closures.\nAlthough these results are promising, their main drawback is that the DSG is built offline, and the VIO first creates a 3D mesh-based semantic map fed to the dynamic scene generator.\nConsequently, the SLAM does not use these topological relationships to improve the accuracy of the spatial reconstruction of the robot trajectory. Besides, except for the humans, the rest of the topological relationships are considered purely static, e.g., chairs or other furniture are fixed to the first detection location. More recently, Hydra  implements the scene graph construction into a real-time capable system relying on a highly parallelized architecture.\nMoreover, they can optimize an embedded deformation graph online, consequently to a loop closure detection.\nRemarkably, the information in the graph allows the creation of descriptors based on objects and visited places histograms that can be matched robustly with previously seen locations.\nTherefore, DSGs, even if in their infancy stage, are shown to be a practical decision-making tool that enables robots to perform autonomous tasks.\nFor example,  demonstrate how they can be used for learning a trajectory policy by turning a DSG into a graph observation that serves as input to a  Graph Neural Network (GNN).\nOr DSG may be used for planning challenging robotic tasks as proposed in the Taskography benchmark . Lastly, one of the main features of a DSG is the possibility to perform queries and predictions of the future evolution of the scene based on dynamic models linked with the agents or physical elements [ref]240. And an even more intriguing property is their application to scene change detection or long-term the newly formalized semantic scene variability estimation task, which sets as a goal the prediction of long-term variation in location, semantic attributes, and topology of the scene objects .\nThis property has only been explored by scratching the surface of its potential application.\nStill, it already grasps our vision of a comprehension layer that produces the knowledge required by the projection and prediction of future states.\nTable. V summarizes the main mapping methods described above with their generated map types and limitations.\n\nReference markers found: [222]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]222: a more efficient query of the occupancy probability in a certain space.
