      "content": "Paper Title: Anti-Factor Is FPT Parameterized by Treewidth and List Size (But Counting Is Hard)\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe show the hardness of #X𝑋{X}-AntiFactorR,\ni.e., Lemma 7.1,\nby a reduction from #B𝐵B-Factor.\nRecall, for the decision and optimization version\nwe added some gadgets between the (simple) vertices and their neighbors.\nFor the counting version we use a different approach\nwhich only attaches gadgets to the (simple) vertices\nwithout altering the remaining graph structure.\nAs this modification is not directly possible,\nthe reduction splits into multiple steps.\nSee Figure 2 for an illustration of these steps. The first step makes the transition from a finite set of allowed degrees\n(i.e., the #B𝐵B-Factor problem)\nto a simple cofinite set of allowed degrees\n(i.e., #[0,x]0𝑥[0,{x}]-AntiFactor for some x≥0𝑥0{x}\\geq 0).\nFormally, we show in Lemma 7.9 a lower bound for\n#Min-X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor with X=[0,x]𝑋0𝑥{X}=[0,{x}] and x≥0𝑥0{x}\\geq 0. The #Min-X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor problem is the variant of #X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor\nwhere we only count solutions of minimum size. In the second step we remove the requirement of counting only minimum solutions.\nIn Lemma 7.11\nwe use interpolation techniques to reduce from #Min-X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor\nto the edge-weighted\n#X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor problem where X=[0,x]𝑋0𝑥{X}=[0,{x}] with x≥0𝑥0{x}\\geq 0. For the edge-weighted version of the problem\nthe edges are assigned weights by which they contribute to the solution\nif they are selected.\nThe weight of a solution is the product\nof the weights of the selected edges.\nThe output of the problem is the sum of all weighted solutions.\nThe unweighted problem can be seen as assigning weight 1 to all edges. As a third step we transition from simple cofinite sets of allowed degrees\nto arbitrary cofinite sets of allowed degrees.\nThis step introduces relations,\na technique we have already seen in earlier problems.\nFormally, Lemma 7.13\nshows a reduction from the problem of the previous step\nto the edge- and relation-weighted #X𝑋{X}-AntiFactorR problem. In this problem each accepted input of a relation is assigned a (rational) weight.\nThen, an accepted input contributes by this weight to the solution.\nThe weight of the solution is the product of the weights of the relations\nmultiplied by the weights of the selected edges.\nThe problem without relation-weights can be obtained\nby assigning weight 1 to all accepted inputs\nand weight 0 to all rejected inputs. The last two steps are dedicated to removing the weights\nfrom the relations and from the edges.\nWe remove the relation-weights\nin Lemma 7.15\nby using additional edge-weights. The last step in Lemma 7.17\nremoves these edge-weights by an appropriate Turing-reduction\ncombined with known techniques for the interpolation\nof multivariate polynomials. We use the Holant framework (cf.    [ref]25  )\nto contextualize several versions of #AntiFactor.\nThe framework was already extensively used in proving the #SETH lower bounds\nfor Counting Perfect Matchings \nand Counting General Factors [ref]33. In the Holant framework, we are given a signature graph\nΩ=(V,E)Ω𝑉𝐸\\Omega=(V,E), where every edge e∈E𝑒𝐸e\\in E has a weight wesubscript𝑤𝑒w_{e}.\nEvery vertex v∈V𝑣𝑉v\\in V is labeled with a\nsignature fv:{0,1}I​(v)→ℚ:subscript𝑓𝑣→superscript01𝐼𝑣ℚf_{v}\\colon\\{0,1\\}^{I(v)}\\to\\mathbb{Q}, where I​(v)𝐼𝑣I(v) is the incidence\nvector of edges incident to v𝑣v.\nA solution is a subset of edges such that the\nsignature for each vertex is non-zero.\nThe weight of a solution is the product of the weights of all edges\nin the solution multiplied by the product of the signatures of all the vertices.\nThen, the Holant of ΩΩ\\Omega is defined as the sum\nof the weights of all solutions. The Holant problem is easily seen to be a weighted generalization of\nthe counting versions of GenFac and AntiFactor.\nFor example,\nthe problem #X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor is a Holant problem\non unweighted graphs where every vertex has the following symmetric relation. where hw⁡(⋅)hw⋅\\operatorname{hw}(\\cdot) is the Hamming weight operator. We call\nvertices with such functions to be 𝙷𝚆∈X¯subscript𝙷𝚆absent¯𝑋\\mathtt{HW}_{\\in{\\overline{{X}}}} nodes. For relations R1,…,Rksubscript𝑅1…subscript𝑅𝑘R_{1},\\ldots,R_{k},\nwe define Holant⁡(R1,…,Rk)Holantsubscript𝑅1…subscript𝑅𝑘\\operatorname{Holant}(R_{1},\\ldots,R_{k}) to be the set of Holant problems\nwhere every edge is unweighted\nand every vertex has signature Rjsubscript𝑅𝑗R_{j}, for some j∈[k]𝑗delimited-[]𝑘j\\in[k].\nBy an abuse of notation also let Rjsubscript𝑅𝑗R_{j} be a family of\nrelations. For example, we may use Holant⁡(𝙷𝚆=1)Holantsubscript𝙷𝚆absent1\\operatorname{Holant}(\\mathtt{HW}_{=1}) when\nevery vertex has relation 𝙷𝚆=1(k)superscriptsubscript𝙷𝚆absent1𝑘\\mathtt{HW}_{=1}^{(k)}, for some k𝑘k. The edge- and relation-weighted version of #X𝑋{X}-AntiFactorR\ncorresponds to a variant of the Holant problem\nwhere we have the signature 𝙷𝚆∈X¯subscript𝙷𝚆absent¯𝑋\\mathtt{HW}_{\\in{\\overline{{X}}}} for all simple vertices\nnot having a specified signature. The edge-weighted version of #X𝑋{X}-AntiFactorR\ncorresponds to a variant of the Holant problem\nwhere we additionally require that the value of the signatures is either 0 or 1,\ni.e., they only accept or reject. We prove the lower bound in Lemma 7.9\nby a reduction from #B𝐵B-FactorR where B={max⁡X+1}𝐵𝑋1B=\\{\\max{X}+1\\}.\nObserve that a direct reduction to #X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor is non-trivial\nalthough B⊆X¯𝐵¯𝑋B\\subseteq{\\overline{{X}}}:\nLet H𝐻H be a given #B𝐵B-FactorR instance.\nWhen treating H𝐻H as a #X𝑋{X}-AntiFactorR instance G𝐺G,\neach solution of H𝐻H\nis also a solution for G𝐺G\nbecause of our choice of B𝐵B.\nHowever, the converse is not true.\nIndeed, as X𝑋{X} is finite (and thus the set of allowed degree is cofinite),\nthe degree of the solutions for G𝐺G\ncan be larger than max⁡X+1𝑋1\\max{X}+1.\nWe avoid this issue by only counting solutions which have minimum size.\nThen, no vertex can have degree larger than max⁡X+1𝑋1\\max{X}+1 in the solution. Let X=[0,x−1]𝑋0𝑥1{X}=[0,{x}-1] be a fixed set for some x≥1𝑥1{x}\\geq 1.\nFor every constant ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0,\nthere is no algorithm that can,\neven if we are given a path decomposition of width pwpw{\\operatorname{pw}},\nsolve #Min-X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor\nin time (x+1−ϵ)pw​n𝒪​(1)superscript𝑥1italic-ϵpwsuperscript𝑛𝒪1({x}+1-\\epsilon)^{{\\operatorname{pw}}}n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)},\nunless #SETH fails. Assume the claimed algorithm for #Min-X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor exists.\nWe use this algorithm to give a faster algorithm for #B𝐵B-Factor where B≔{max⁡X+1}={x}≔𝐵𝑋1𝑥B\\coloneqq\\{\\max{X}+1\\}=\\{{x}\\}\nto contradict #SETH by Theorem 1.1. Let H𝐻H be an instance of #B𝐵B-Factor.\nUse Theorem 1.1 to check if H𝐻H has a solution,\ni.e., an x𝑥{x}-factor.\nIf H𝐻H has no such solution, then return 00 as solution.\nOtherwise,\nwe replace all vertices in H𝐻H with set B𝐵B (of allowed degrees)\nby vertices with the set X𝑋{X} (of forbidden degrees)\nto obtain an instance G𝐺G of #Min-X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor.\nThen, we apply the algorithm for #Min-X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor\nand return the number of solutions. We first analyze the runtime of the algorithm for #B𝐵B-Factor.\nBy Theorem 1.1,\nit can be checked in time\n(max⁡B+1)pw​n𝒪​(1)=(x+1)pw​n𝒪​(1)superscript𝐵1pwsuperscript𝑛𝒪1superscript𝑥1pwsuperscript𝑛𝒪1(\\max B+1)^{{\\operatorname{pw}}}n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}=({x}+1)^{\\operatorname{pw}}n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}\nif H𝐻H has a solution.\nGiven H𝐻H, the construction of instance G𝐺G\ntakes time polynomially in the size of H𝐻H.\nHence, the claimed algorithm for #Min-X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor\ndirectly contradicts Theorem 1.1\nassuming the above algorithm is correct. It remains to argue that the above procedure correctly solves #B𝐵B-Factor.\nBy definition, we have B⊆ℕ∖X𝐵ℕ𝑋B\\subseteq{\\mathbb{N}}\\setminus{X}\nand thus, every solution for H𝐻H is also a solution for G𝐺G.\nHence, we get To show the converse of this inequality,\nwe can assume that H𝐻H has a solution S0subscript𝑆0S_{0}\n(the algorithm checked this initially).\nConsider a minimum solution S𝑆S of G𝐺G\nthat is not an x𝑥{x}-factor (the other case is trivial).\nSince X=[0,x−1]𝑋0𝑥1{X}=[0,{x}-1],\nthere must be some vertex v∈V​(G)𝑣𝑉𝐺v\\in V(G)\nsuch that degS⁡(v)>xsubscriptdegree𝑆𝑣𝑥\\deg_{S}(v)>{x}.\nWe get\n Recall, we assumed that H𝐻H has a solution S0subscript𝑆0S_{0}\nand moreover, S0subscript𝑆0S_{0} is an x𝑥{x}-factor.\nUsing that all vertices are incident to exactly x𝑥{x} selected edges in S0subscript𝑆0S_{0},\nwe have\n Hence, S𝑆S is of larger size than S0subscript𝑆0S_{0}\nwhich contradicts the assumption that S𝑆S is a minimum solution for G𝐺G. Therefore, there is no vertex v𝑣v in S𝑆S with degS⁡(v)>xsubscriptdegree𝑆𝑣𝑥\\deg_{S}(v)>{x}\nwhich proves that S𝑆S is a solution for H𝐻H\nand we get which concludes the proof. As a next step we remove the restriction of counting only minimum solutions.\nFor this we introduce edge-weights\nand compute the (weighted) number of solutions.\nThen, we recover the number of solutions for the original instance\nby polynomial interpolation techniques. Let X=[0,x−1]⊆ℕ𝑋0𝑥1ℕ{X}=[0,{x}-1]\\subseteq{\\mathbb{N}} be a finite and non-empty set\nfor some x≥1𝑥1{x}\\geq 1.\nThere is a Turing-reduction from #Min-X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor\nto edge-weighted #X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor\nwith a single edge-weight\nrunning in time n𝒪​(1)superscript𝑛𝒪1n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}\nwithout changing the pathwidth of the graph. Let G𝐺G be an instance of #Min-X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor.\nFor a positive integer w𝑤w,\nwe define the instance Gwsubscript𝐺𝑤G_{w} of edge-weighted #X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor\nas the modification of G𝐺G, where we put weight w𝑤w\non every edge of G𝐺G. For all i∈[0,m]𝑖0𝑚i\\in[0,m], where m𝑚m denotes the number of edges of G𝐺G,\nwe denote by aisubscript𝑎𝑖a_{i} the number of solutions of G𝐺G\nwith respect to #X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor\nthat have size exactly i𝑖i.\nNote, aisubscript𝑎𝑖a_{i} includes solutions that do not have minimum size. With this notation, we can rewrite the number of solutions of Gwsubscript𝐺𝑤G_{w} as If we treat w𝑤w as a variable,\n#​Sol⁡(Gw)#Solsubscript𝐺𝑤\\operatorname{\\#Sol}(G_{w}) can be seen as a polynomial in w𝑤w\nof degree at most m𝑚m. We use the oracle-access to #X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor\nto compute #​Sol⁡(Gw)#Solsubscript𝐺𝑤\\operatorname{\\#Sol}(G_{w}) for m+1𝑚1m+1 different values of w𝑤w.\nThen we can easily, i.e., in time polynomially in m𝑚m,\nrecover the coefficients of #​Sol⁡(Gw)#Solsubscript𝐺𝑤\\operatorname{\\#Sol}(G_{w}).\nWith i∗=min⁡{i∈[0,m]∣ai≠0}superscript𝑖𝑖conditional0𝑚subscript𝑎𝑖0i^{*}=\\min\\{i\\in[0,m]\\mid a_{i}\\neq 0\\}\nwe get that G𝐺G has ai∗subscript𝑎superscript𝑖a_{i^{*}} solutions\nwith respect to #Min-X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor. Since the construction of Gwsubscript𝐺𝑤G_{w} can be done in polynomial time\nand recovering the aisubscript𝑎𝑖a_{i}s also takes polynomial time,\nthis finishes the proof. The next step now drops the requirement on X𝑋{X} to be a contiguous interval.\nInstead arbitrary finite sets are allowed,\nwhich results in arbitrary cofinite sets of allowed degrees.\nHowever, to remove this constraint we have to make use of (weighted) relations. Let X⊆ℕ𝑋ℕ{X}\\subseteq{\\mathbb{N}} be a fixed, non-empty and finite set.\nThere is a many-one reduction from\nedge-weighted #[0,max⁡X]0𝑋[0,\\max{X}]-AntiFactor with r𝑟r weights\nto edge- and relation-weighted #X𝑋{X}-AntiFactorR\nwith at most r+max⁡X+2𝑟𝑋2r+\\max{X}+2 weights\nsuch that\nthe size increases by a constant factor,\nΔ∗superscriptΔ\\Delta^{\\!*} of the resulting instances is max⁡X+1𝑋1\\max{X}+1\nand pathwidth increases only by 1. For the reduction we construct a gadget\nand attach to each (simple) vertex a copy of this gadget.\nThe gadget is such that each vertex\nis incident to at least max⁡X+1𝑋1\\max{X}+1 selected edges from the original graph.\nWe define the relation-weights such that all other solutions cancel out\nand hence, all solutions are also valid for #[0,max⁡X]0𝑋[0,\\max{X}]-AntiFactor.\nWe exploit the fact that the set X𝑋{X}\ndoes not allow certain combinations of selected incident edges\nbut once a vertex is incident to at least max⁡X+1𝑋1\\max{X}+1 selected edges,\nall states are essentially equivalent (with respect to X𝑋{X}). We start with an edge-weighted #[0,max⁡X]0𝑋[0,\\max{X}]-AntiFactor instance H𝐻H\nand apply the following transformation, illustrated in\nFigures 3(a) and 3(b),\nfor each simple vertex v^^𝑣\\widehat{v}\nto obtain an instance G𝐺G of #X𝑋{X}-AntiFactorR. *Transformation.\nWe remove v^^𝑣\\widehat{v} (with set B𝐵B)\nand create a simple vertex v𝑣v (with set X𝑋{X}) and a complex vertex uvsubscript𝑢𝑣u_{v}.\nWe connect v𝑣v to all neighbors of v^^𝑣\\widehat{v} in H𝐻H\nand call these edges outer edges.\nWe connect v𝑣v and uvsubscript𝑢𝑣u_{v} by max⁡X+1𝑋1\\max{X}+1 parallel edges\nwhich we call inner edges.999Though these parallel edges disappear later,\none could place 𝙴𝚀2subscript𝙴𝚀2\\mathtt{EQ}_{2} nodes on them to obtain a simple graph.\nWe assign the set X𝑋{X} to v𝑣v\nand the relation R𝑅R to uvsubscript𝑢𝑣u_{v}.\n(The relation R𝑅R is actually the same for all simple vertices.)\nFor all β∈[0,max⁡X+1]𝛽0𝑋1\\beta\\in[0,\\max{X}+1],\nrelation R𝑅R accepts exactly one (arbitrary) set\nof exactly β𝛽\\beta selected inner edges with weight wβsubscript𝑤𝛽w_{\\beta}.\nAll other sets of selected edges are accepted with weight 0,\ni.e., rejected.\nBefore we define the weights, we provide some intuition. The weights for relation R𝑅R are chosen such that\nv𝑣v is always incident to k𝑘k selected outer edges,\nfor some k≥max⁡X+1𝑘𝑋1k\\geq\\max{X}+1.\nFor this we exploit that the weights wβsubscript𝑤𝛽w_{\\beta} might also be negative.\nThen, the “bad” solutions cancel out\nand only the “good” solutions contribute to the total number of solutions. If we denote by α𝛼\\alpha the number of selected outer edges\nand by β𝛽\\beta the number of selected inner edges,\nthen the weights must satisfy If we consider each wβsubscript𝑤𝛽w_{\\beta} as a variable,\nthen the constraints from Equation 3\nform a system of linear equations with max⁡X+2𝑋2\\max{X}+2 variables.\nObserve further that all constraints with α≥max⁡X+1𝛼𝑋1\\alpha\\geq\\max{X}+1 are identical.\nHence, there are max⁡X+2𝑋2\\max{X}+2 constraints.\nNow consider the matrix M𝑀M formed by the coefficients\nof Equation 3.\nObserve that the anti-diagonal of M𝑀M and all entries below are ones\nas max⁡X+1,max⁡X+2,⋯∉X𝑋1𝑋2⋯𝑋\\max{X}+1,\\max{X}+2,\\dots\\notin{X}.\nMoreover, every entry one row above the anti-diagonal in M𝑀M is zero\nby the fact that max⁡X∈X𝑋𝑋\\max{X}\\in{X}.\nThis observation directly implies that the sums for α+1𝛼1\\alpha+1 and α𝛼\\alpha\ndiffer by (at least) one summand,\ni.e., by wmax⁡X−αsubscript𝑤𝑋𝛼w_{\\max{X}-\\alpha}.\nHence, the matrix M𝑀M is invertible and there is a solution\nto Equation 3.\nMoreover,\nwhen starting with the sums for max⁡X+1𝑋1\\max{X}+1 and max⁡X𝑋\\max{X},\nwe can find the value for w0subscript𝑤0w_{0}\nand eliminate it from the system of linear equations.\nThen, we repeat this process\nto iteratively eliminate w1subscript𝑤1w_{1} up to wmax⁡X+1subscript𝑤𝑋1w_{\\max{X}+1}. We conclude that there are values for each wβsubscript𝑤𝛽w_{\\beta}\nsuch that Equation 3 hold.\nMoreover, the above procedure already finds these values\nin time polynomially in the number of variables, which is max⁡X+2𝑋2\\max{X}+2. *Finalizing the Reduction.\nSince the weights for the gadget are chosen such that\nthe remaining graph does not see a difference\nbetween the vertex v^^𝑣\\widehat{v} and this new gadget,\nwe can replace all simple vertices by this procedure\nto get an edge- and relation-weighted #X𝑋{X}-AntiFactorR instance\nwhich we denote by G𝐺G. Recall that H𝐻H is the initial edge-weighted #X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor instance.\nWe have nG≤2​nHsubscript𝑛𝐺2subscript𝑛𝐻n_{G}\\leq 2n_{H},\nΔG∗=max⁡X+1subscriptsuperscriptΔ𝐺𝑋1\\Delta^{\\!*}_{G}=\\max{X}+1,\nand pwG≤pwH+1subscriptpw𝐺subscriptpw𝐻1{\\operatorname{pw}}_{G}\\leq{\\operatorname{pw}}_{H}+1.\nThis finishes the proof. The next step of our reduction removes the weights from the relations\nby using additional weighted edges. Let X⊆ℕ𝑋ℕ{X}\\subseteq{\\mathbb{N}} be an arbitrary set\n(possibly given as input). We can many-one reduce edge- and relation-weighted #X𝑋{X}-AntiFactorR\nwith r𝑟r different weights\nto edge-weighted #X𝑋{X}-AntiFactorR\nwith at most r𝑟r weights\nsuch that the size increases by a multiplicative factor of 𝒪​(r)𝒪𝑟\\mathcal{O}(r), Δ∗superscriptΔ\\Delta^{\\!*} increases to Δ∗+r+1superscriptΔ𝑟1\\Delta^{\\!*}+r+1, and pwpw{\\operatorname{pw}} increases to pw+1pw1{\\operatorname{pw}}+1. We apply the following procedure to each complex vertex u𝑢u\n(that uses weights).\nSee Figure 3(c)\nfor an illustration of the modification.\nLet R𝑅R be the relation of u𝑢u.\nLet w1,…,wr′subscript𝑤1…subscript𝑤superscript𝑟′w_{1},\\dots,w_{r^{\\prime}} be the r′<rsuperscript𝑟′𝑟r^{\\prime}<r different weights used by R𝑅R.\nAssume without loss of generality that r′=rsuperscript𝑟′𝑟r^{\\prime}=r. For all i∈[r]𝑖delimited-[]𝑟i\\in[r],\nwe add a vertex uisubscript𝑢𝑖u_{i} with relation 𝙷𝚆∈{0,1}(1)superscriptsubscript𝙷𝚆absent011\\mathtt{HW}_{\\in\\{0,1\\}}^{(1)}\nand make it adjacent to u𝑢u by an edge of weight wisubscript𝑤𝑖w_{i}. Based on R𝑅R, we design a new relation R′superscript𝑅′R^{\\prime} as follows:\nWhenever R𝑅R accepts the input x𝑥x with weight wisubscript𝑤𝑖w_{i}, for some i∈[r]𝑖delimited-[]𝑟i\\in[r],\nthen R′superscript𝑅′R^{\\prime} accepts x𝑥x\nbut additionally requires that the edge to uisubscript𝑢𝑖u_{i} is selected\nwhile the edges to the other ui′subscript𝑢superscript𝑖′u_{i^{\\prime}} remain unselected. One can easily check that this modification does not change the solution.\nMoreover, the pathwidth increases by at most 1\nand the degree of the complex vertices by at most r𝑟r. In the next step of our reduction, we remove the edge weights from the graph.\nFirst observe that we do not have to change edges of weight 1.\nFurthermore, we can simply remove all edges with weight 0. Let X⊆ℕ𝑋ℕ{X}\\subseteq{\\mathbb{N}} be a finite and non-empty set\n(possibly given as input).\nThere is a Turing-reduction from edge-weighted #X𝑋{X}-AntiFactorR\nwith r𝑟r different weights\nto unweighted #X𝑋{X}-AntiFactorR\nrunning in time n𝒪​(r)superscript𝑛𝒪𝑟n^{\\mathcal{O}(r)}.\nThe reduction\nis\nsuch that the size increases by a multiplicative factor of 𝒪​(log2⁡(n))𝒪superscript2𝑛\\mathcal{O}(\\log^{2}(n)), the degree of the simple vertices stays the same, Δ∗superscriptΔ\\Delta^{\\!*} increases to Δ∗+𝒪​(1)superscriptΔ𝒪1\\Delta^{\\!*}+\\mathcal{O}(1), and pwpw{\\operatorname{pw}} increases to pw+𝒪​(1)pw𝒪1{\\operatorname{pw}}+\\mathcal{O}(1). We use the same interpolation technique\nalready used in \nand later in [ref]33 to remove the edge weights. We replace the edge weights w1,…,wrsubscript𝑤1…subscript𝑤𝑟w_{1},\\dots,w_{r}\nby variables x1,…,xrsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑟x_{1},\\dots,x_{r}\nand treat the value of the solution as an r𝑟r-variate polynomial P𝑃P. Observe that, for each i∈[r]𝑖delimited-[]𝑟i\\in[r],\nP𝑃P has degree at most m<n2𝑚superscript𝑛2m<n^{2} in xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i}.\nAssume we can choose n2superscript𝑛2n^{2} values for each xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} independently.\nIf we can evaluate P𝑃P on all (n2)rsuperscriptsuperscript𝑛2𝑟(n^{2})^{r} combinations of values,\nthen,\nby Lemma 1 in ,\nwe can recover the coefficients of P𝑃P in n𝒪​(r)superscript𝑛𝒪𝑟n^{\\mathcal{O}(r)} time.\nFinally, we output P​(w1,…,wr)𝑃subscript𝑤1…subscript𝑤𝑟P(w_{1},\\dots,w_{r}). It remains to show that we can achieve n2superscript𝑛2n^{2} different values for each xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i}.\nWe first show how to realize edge weights of the form 2isuperscript2𝑖2^{i}.\nWe replace the edge of weight 2isuperscript2𝑖2^{i} by a chain of 2​i+32𝑖32i+3 edges\nwhere, for all j∈[i]𝑗delimited-[]𝑖j\\in[i], the 2​j+12𝑗12j+1th edge is a parallel edge.101010\nTo avoid parallel edges,\none can place one 𝙴𝚀2subscript𝙴𝚀2\\mathtt{EQ}_{2} node on each parallel edge.\n\nWe assign the relation 𝙷𝚆=1subscript𝙷𝚆absent1\\mathtt{HW}_{=1} to all vertices\nthat are introduced by this gadget.\nWhen the original edge was selected,\nwe have, for each j∈[i]𝑗delimited-[]𝑖j\\in[i], two choices\nfor selecting one of the 2​i+12𝑖12i+1th parallel edges.\nMoreover, these choices are independent from each other.\nThis contributes a weight of 2isuperscript2𝑖2^{i} to the solution.\nIf the original edge was not selected,\nthen we only have a unique solution;\nwe select the edges that are not parallel edges,\ni.e., the 2nd, 4th, …, edge. We use this as building block to realize arbitrary positive weights W𝑊W.\nFrom the binary representation of W𝑊W we get a set S={s1,…,sℓ}⊆ℕ𝑆subscript𝑠1…subscript𝑠ℓℕS=\\{s_{1},\\dots,s_{\\ell}\\}\\subseteq{\\mathbb{N}}\nsuch that W=∑i=1ℓ2si𝑊superscriptsubscript𝑖1ℓsuperscript2subscript𝑠𝑖W=\\sum_{i=1}^{\\ell}2^{s_{i}}.\nLet the edge of weight W𝑊W be between the vertices v𝑣v and u𝑢u.\nWe create new vertices v1,v1′,…,vℓ,vℓ′subscript𝑣1superscriptsubscript𝑣1′…subscript𝑣ℓsuperscriptsubscript𝑣ℓ′v_{1},v_{1}^{\\prime},\\dots,v_{\\ell},v_{\\ell}^{\\prime}\nand u1,u1′,…,uℓ,uℓ′subscript𝑢1superscriptsubscript𝑢1′…subscript𝑢ℓsuperscriptsubscript𝑢ℓ′u_{1},u_{1}^{\\prime},\\dots,u_{\\ell},u_{\\ell}^{\\prime}\nall with relation 𝙷𝚆=1subscript𝙷𝚆absent1\\mathtt{HW}_{=1}.\nSet vℓ+1=vsubscript𝑣ℓ1𝑣v_{\\ell+1}=v and uℓ+1=usubscript𝑢ℓ1𝑢u_{\\ell+1}=u.\nFor all i∈[ℓ]𝑖delimited-[]ℓi\\in[\\ell],\nwe connect visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} to vi′superscriptsubscript𝑣𝑖′v_{i}^{\\prime} and connect vi′superscriptsubscript𝑣𝑖′v_{i}^{\\prime} to vi+1subscript𝑣𝑖1v_{i+1}\nand similarly for ui,ui′,ui+1subscript𝑢𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑢𝑖′subscript𝑢𝑖1u_{i},u_{i}^{\\prime},u_{i+1}.\nFor all i∈[ℓ]𝑖delimited-[]ℓi\\in[\\ell],\nwe add an edge of weight 2sisuperscript2subscript𝑠𝑖2^{s_{i}} between visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} and uisubscript𝑢𝑖u_{i}.\nWe use the previous method to realize the weight of these edge.\nThe total weight sums up to W𝑊W\nif exactly one weighted edge can be selected at a time.\nNow assume the edge from visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} to uisubscript𝑢𝑖u_{i} is selected.\nThen, the edges from uisubscript𝑢𝑖u_{i} to ui′superscriptsubscript𝑢𝑖′u_{i}^{\\prime} is not selected.\nBy the relation of ui′superscriptsubscript𝑢𝑖′u_{i}^{\\prime},\nthe edge from ui′superscriptsubscript𝑢𝑖′u_{i}^{\\prime} to ui+1subscript𝑢𝑖1u_{i+1} must be selected.\nTherefore, the weighted edge from ui+1subscript𝑢𝑖1u_{i+1} to vi+1subscript𝑣𝑖1v_{i+1} cannot be selected.\nAs the edge ui+1subscript𝑢𝑖1u_{i+1} to ui+1′superscriptsubscript𝑢𝑖1′u_{i+1}^{\\prime} also cannot be selected\nand the argument applies recursively to the vertices ui′subscript𝑢superscript𝑖′u_{i^{\\prime}} and ui′′superscriptsubscript𝑢superscript𝑖′′u_{i^{\\prime}}^{\\prime} with i′<isuperscript𝑖′𝑖i^{\\prime}<i,\nno other weighted edge can be selected. Thus, it suffices to consider the weights from 111 to n2superscript𝑛2n^{2}.\nAdding the parallel edges and the paths\nincreases pathwidth only by a constant.\nThe same holds for Δ∗superscriptΔ\\Delta^{\\!*}\nas the degree of each vertex is at most three.\nThe size increases by a factor of 𝒪​(log2⁡(n))𝒪superscript2𝑛\\mathcal{O}(\\log^{2}(n))\nas we introduce 𝒪​(log⁡(n))𝒪𝑛\\mathcal{O}(\\log(n)) many new vertices\nand the gadget for weight 2isuperscript2𝑖2^{i} is of size 𝒪​(i)𝒪𝑖\\mathcal{O}(i). The previous construction uses weights between 111 and n2superscript𝑛2n^{2}.\nBy this choice the size increases by a logarithmic factor (in n𝑛n) only.\nNow assume that the construction would use weights from 21superscript212^{1} to 2n2superscript2superscript𝑛22^{n^{2}}.\nThis choice could lead to a polynomial blow-up of the size of the graph.\nWhile this is not an issue for the lower bound for #X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor,\nthis lemma could not be applied for the proof of the #W[ref]1delimited-[]1[ref]1-hardness\nwhich we give later.\n\nNow, we can combine the previous steps\nand prove the lower bound for #X𝑋{X}-AntiFactorR. Let H𝐻H be an edge-weighted #Min-X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor instance\nwith 𝒪​(1)𝒪1\\mathcal{O}(1) different edge-weights.\nWe apply Lemmas 7.11, 7.13, 7.15 and 7.17\nto obtain nH𝒪​(max⁡X)superscriptsubscript𝑛𝐻𝒪𝑋n_{H}^{\\mathcal{O}(\\max{X})} instances Gisubscript𝐺𝑖G_{i} of #X𝑋{X}-AntiFactorR.\nAs X𝑋{X} is fixed, there are nH𝒪​(1)superscriptsubscript𝑛𝐻𝒪1n_{H}^{\\mathcal{O}(1)} such instances. For each such instance Gisubscript𝐺𝑖G_{i},\nwe get nGi≤𝒪​(nH​log2⁡(nH))subscript𝑛subscript𝐺𝑖𝒪subscript𝑛𝐻superscript2subscript𝑛𝐻n_{G_{i}}\\leq\\mathcal{O}(n_{H}\\log^{2}(n_{H})),\nΔGi∗∈𝒪​(max⁡X)subscriptsuperscriptΔsubscript𝐺𝑖𝒪𝑋\\Delta^{\\!*}_{G_{i}}\\in\\mathcal{O}(\\max{X}),\nand pwGi≤pwH+𝒪​(1)subscriptpwsubscript𝐺𝑖subscriptpw𝐻𝒪1{\\operatorname{pw}}_{G_{i}}\\leq{\\operatorname{pw}}_{H}+\\mathcal{O}(1).\nAssume a fast algorithm for #X𝑋{X}-AntiFactorR exists\nfor some ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0.\nThen, since ΔGi∗∈𝒪​(1)subscriptsuperscriptΔsubscript𝐺𝑖𝒪1\\Delta^{\\!*}_{G_{i}}\\in\\mathcal{O}(1),\nwe can run this algorithm on all these instances Gisubscript𝐺𝑖G_{i}\nand recover the solution for H𝐻H.\nThe total running time of this process is Thus, the running time directly contradicts #SETH\nby Lemma 7.9.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: step in Lemma 7.17\nremoves these edge-weights by an appropriate Turing-reduction\ncombined with known techniques for the interpolation\nof multivariate polynomials. We use the Holant framework (cf.    [ref]25  )\nto contextualize several versions of #AntiFactor.\nThe framework was already extensively used in proving the #SETH lower bounds\nfor Counting Perfect Matchings \nand Counting General Factors\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
