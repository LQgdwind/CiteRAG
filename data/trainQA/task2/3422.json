      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Learning on 3D Point Clouds by Clustering and Contrasting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent years have witnessed significant progress in feature learning for 3D shapes due to the ability of deep learning techniques to consume 3D point clouds directly. PointNet [ref]8, and DeepSets [ref]28 are the pioneering architectures that can handle unordered and unstructured 3D points by independently learning each point of the point cloud and fusing point features with invariant permutation operations. Though efficient, PointNet and DeepSets ignore the local structures that are indispensable to describe the 3D shape. PointNet++ [ref]9 was then proposed to mitigate this issue by developing sampling and grouping operations to extract features from point clusters hierarchically. Similarly, various recent studies such as PointCNN , PointConv  DGCNN  and Relation-Shape CNN  also focus on extracting more semantic features from the local region by separating points into scales or bins, and then, aggregating these features by concatenation  or with an RNN. PAConv  uses a plug-and-play convolutional operation for deep representation learning on 3D point clouds. AdaptConv  proposed to adaptively establish the relationship between a pair of points according to their learned features, effectively and precisely capturing the diverse relations between points from different semantic parts. Sun et al.  proposed a point-to-surface representation for 3D point cloud learning considering both the point and the geometric surface simultaneously.  developed a perturbation learning-based point cloud upsampling method to generate uniform, clean, and dense point clouds. LGA  presented a layer-wise geometry aggregation framework for lossless LiDAR point cloud geometry compression. Transformer3D-Det  proposed to solve the 3D object detection task by using the attention mechanism to model the relationship from neighboring clusters to produce more accurate voting centers. Although these methods achieve remarkable success, they require supervised information during the feature learning process. The dependence on annotation impedes the deployment of point cloud models into new real-world settings where labeled data is scarce. Therefore, it is important to develop methods to reduce the number of annotated samples that are required to achieve the required performance of deep learning-based point cloud understanding tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Recent years have witnessed significant progress in feature learning for 3D shapes due to the ability of deep learning techniques to consume 3D point clouds directly.
