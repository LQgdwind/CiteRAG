Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Audio-Visual Event Localization via Recursive Fusion by Joint Co-Attention\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAudio-Visual Event Dataset. The Audio-Visual Event (AVE) dataset by [ref]36 is a subset of AudioSet . It consists of 4,14341434,143 video clips that involve 282828 event categories. We adopt the split technology of [ref]36 where train/validation/test sets are 3,309/402/40233094024023,309/402/402 video clips, respectively.\nWhile training, the model has no access to the test portion to better evaluate the model’s generalization ability.\nFor the AVE dataset, it contains comprehensive audio-visual event types, in general, instrument performances, human daily activities, vehicle activities, and animal actions. To be more specific, for more detailed event categories, take instrument performances as an example, AVE dataset contains accordion playing, guitar playing, and ukulele playing, etc. A typical video clip is 10 seconds long and is labeled with the start point and endpoint at the segment level to clarify whether the segment is an audio-visual event. Sample images and their attended images are shown in Fig. 3. Evaluation Metrics.\nWe follow [ref]19 [ref]36  and adopt the global classification accuracy obtained from the last prediction layer as the evaluation metric.\nFor an input video sequence, our goal is to predict the category label for each segment. It is worth noting that the background category contains 28 backgrounds since each event category can have its own background so that it is hard to predict. Experimental Details. Following [ref]36 , we adopt pre-trained CNN models to extract features for each audio and visual segment. Specifically, we exploit the VGG19  network pre-trained on ImageNet  as the backbone to extract segment-level visual features. Meanwhile, for the audio segment, we extract the segment feature using a Vggish network  which is pre-trained on AudioSet . For a fair comparison, we use the same extracted features (i.e, audio and visual features) as used in [ref]36 . In the training stage, the only supervision we exploit is the annotation labels for the temporal segments.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: Audio-Visual Event Dataset.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
