      "content": "Paper Title: Inductive Logical Query Answering in Knowledge Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraditionally, querying knowledge graphs (KGs) is performed via databases using structured query languages like SPARQL.\nDatabases can answer complex queries relatively fast under the assumption of completeness, i.e., there is no missing information in the graph.\nIn practice, however, KGs are notoriously incomplete¬†.\nEmbedding-based methods that learn vector representations of entities and relations are known to be effective in simple link prediction predicting heads or tails of query patterns (head, relation, ?), e.g., (Einstein, graduate, ?), as common in\nKG completion¬† 7. Complex queries are graph patterns expressed in a subset of first-order logic (FOL) with operators such as intersection (‚àß\\land), union (‚à®\\lor), negation (¬¨\\lnot) and existentially quantified (‚àÉ\\exists) variables111The universal quantifier (‚àÄfor-all\\forall) is often discarded as in real-world KGs there is no node connected to all others., e.g., ?U.‚àÉV:Win(NobelPrize,V)‚àßCitizen(USA,V)‚àßGraduate(V,U)?U.\\exists V:\\texttt{Win}(\\texttt{NobelPrize},V)\\land\\texttt{Citizen}(\\texttt{USA},V)\\land\\texttt{Graduate}(V,U) (Fig.¬†1).\nComplex queries define a superset of KG completion. The conventional KG completion (link prediction) task can be viewed as a complex query with a single triplet pattern without logical operators, e.g., Citizen‚Äã(USA,V)CitizenUSAùëâ\\texttt{Citizen}(\\texttt{USA},V), which we also denote as a projection query. To tackle complex queries on incomplete knowledge graphs, query embedding methods are proposed to execute logic operations in the latent space, including variants\nthat employ geometric¬†5 [ref]23 , probabilistic¬† , neural-symbolic¬†  , neural¬† , and GNN¬†1  approaches for learning entity, relation, and query representations. However, this very fact of learning a separate embedding for each entity makes those methods inherently transductive\ni.e., they are bound to the space of learned entities and cannot generalize to unseen entities without retraining the whole embedding matrix which can be prohibitively expensive in large graphs. The problem is illustrated in Fig.¬†1: given a graph about Einstein and a logical query Where did US citizens with Nobel Prize graduate?, transductive QE methods learn to execute logical operators and return the answer set {University of Zurich, ETH Zurich}University of Zurich, ETH Zurich\\{\\texttt{University of Zurich, ETH Zurich}\\}.\nThen, the graph is updated with new nodes and edges about Feynman and Princeton, and the same query now has more correct answers {University of Zurich, ETH Zurich, Princeton}University of Zurich, ETH Zurich, Princeton\\{\\texttt{University of Zurich, ETH Zurich, Princeton}\\} as new unseen entities satisfy the query as well. Such inductive inference is not possible for transductive models as they do not have representations for new Feynman and Princeton nodes. In the extreme case, inference graphs might be disconnected from the training one and only share the set of relations.\nTherefore, inductive capabilities are a key factor to transferring trained query answering models onto updated or entirely new KGs. In this work, we study answering complex queries in the inductive setting, where the model has to deal with unseen entities at inference time.\nInspired by recent advancement in inductive Kg completion¬†2 3, we devise two solutions for learning inductive representations for complex query: 1) The first solution, NodePiece-QE, extends the inductive node representation model NodePiece¬†3 to complex query answering. NodePiece-QE learns inductive representations of each entity as a function of tokens from a fixed-size vocabulary, and answers complex query with a non-parametric logical query executor¬†. The advantages of NodePiece-QE are that it only needs to be trained on simple link prediction data, answers complex queries in the inference-only mode, and can scale to large KGs. 2) The second solution, GNN-QE¬†0, extends the inductive KG completion model NBFNet¬†2 for complex query answering. Originally, GNN-QE was studied only in the transductive setting. Here, we analyze its inductive capabilities. GNN-QE learns inductive representations of the relational structure without entity embeddings, and uses the relational structure between the query constants and the answers to make the prediction. GNN-QE can be trained end-to-end on complex queries, achieves much better performance than NodePiece-QE, but struggles to scale to large KGs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study complex logical query answering in the inductive setting without any additional features like entity types or textual descriptions.\nConducting experiments on a novel benchmarking suite of 10 datasets, we find that 1) both inductive solutions exhibit non-trivial performance answering logical queries over unseen entities and query patterns; 2) inductive models demonstrate out-of-distribution generalization capabilities to graphs up to 500% larger than training ones; 3) akin to updatable databases, inductive methods can successfully find new correct answers to known training queries after adding new nodes and edges; 4) the inductive node representation method scales to answering logical queries over a graph of 2M nodes with 500k new unseen nodes; 5) GNN-based models still exhibit some difficulties¬† 5 generalizing to graphs larger than those they were originally trained on.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: query.
