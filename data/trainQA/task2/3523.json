      "content": "Paper Title: Parameterised Partially-Predrawn Crossing Number\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDetermining the crossing number, i.e. the smallest possible number of pairwise transverse intersections\n(called crossings) of edges in any drawing, of a graph is among the most important problems in discrete computational geometry.\nAs such its general computational complexity is well-researched:\nProbably most famously, it is known that graphs with crossing number 00, i.e. planar graphs, can be recognised in polynomial time   .\nGenerally, computing the crossing number of a graph is \\NP-hard, even in very restricted settings    [ref]4, and also \\APX-hard .\nHowever there is a fixed-parameter algorithm for the problem, and even one that can compute a drawing of a graph with at most k𝑘k crossings in time in 𝒪​(f​(k)​n)𝒪𝑓𝑘𝑛\\mathcal{O}(f(k)n) or decide that its crossing number is larger than k𝑘k  . More recently, so called graph drawing extension problems have received increased attention.\nInstead of being given an entirely abstract graph as an input, here the input is a partially drawn graph 𝒫=(G,ℋ)𝒫𝐺ℋ\\mathcal{P}=(G,\\mathcal{H}), meaning that a subgraph H𝐻H of the input graph G𝐺G is given with a fixed drawing ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} which must not be changed in the solution.\nThis is motivated by immediate applications in network visualisation , as well as a more general line of research in which important computational problems are extended to the setting in which parts of the solution are prescribed which can lead to useful insights for dynamic or divide-and-conquer type algorithms and heuristics  3.\nIn this context it is natural to define the partially predrawn crossing number as the smallest number of pairwise crossings of edges in any drawing which coincides with (i.e., extends) the given fixed drawing of the predrawn skeleton, minus the number of ‘unavoidable’ crossings already contained in the fixed drawing of the skeleton.\nWe name this problem Partially Predrawn Crossing Number. Of course, the problem of computing the partially predrawn crossing number is more general than the one of computing the classical crossing number (which is captured by the former by simply letting the predrawn skeleton be empty), and thus the known hardness results for computing the classical crossing number carry over.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the partially predrawn crossing number problem has so far not been explicitly studied in literature, although, there are papers which study partially embedded planarity, i.e. the property of having partially predrawn crossing number 00, and variants thereof.\nIn particular, similarly to ordinary planarity, partially drawn graphs extendable to planar drawings can be recognised in polynomial time ,\nand in analogy to the Kuratowski theorem, there is also a neat list of forbidden “partially drawn minors” (Figure 3) which characterise partially drawn graphs extendable to planar drawings . If one allows a non-zero number of crossings, the only algorithmic results on extending partially drawn graphs with constrained crossings\nwe are aware of are those for scenarios with a few edges or vertices outside of the predrawn skeleton or/and with a small number of crossings for each edge.\nWe give a brief list of these algorithmic results: An algorithm to determine the exact partially predrawn crossing number of a partially drawn graph in \\FPT time parameterised by the number of edges which are not fixed by the predrawn skeleton  (the “rigid” case in the paper). An algorithm to determine whether there is a 111-planar drawing (or more generally a drawing in which each edge outside of the predrawn skeleton has at most c𝑐c crossings) which coincides with the given partial drawing in \\FPT time parameterised by (c𝑐c and) the number of edges which are not fixed by the predrawn skeleton 5 7. An algorithm to determine whether there is a 111-planar drawing which coincides with the given partial drawing in \\XP time parameterised by the vertex cover size of the edges which are not fixed by the predrawn skeleton 4. An algorithm to determine whether there is a simple drawing in which each edge outside of the predrawn skeleton has at most c𝑐c crossings which coincides with the given partial drawing in \\FPT time parameterised by c𝑐c and the number the edges which are not fixed by the predrawn skeleton 7. We remark that all these parameterised algorithms require the given predrawn skeleton to be connected, and the last three algorithms are easily adapted to output drawings minimising the number of crossings under the requirement of the respective properties.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: that graphs with crossing number 00, i.e. planar graphs, can be recognised in polynomial time   .\nGenerally, computing the crossing number of a graph is \\NP-hard, even in very restricted settings    [ref]4, and also \\APX-hard .\nHowever there is a fixed-parameter algorithm for the problem, and even one that can compute a drawing of a graph with at most k𝑘k crossings in time in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
