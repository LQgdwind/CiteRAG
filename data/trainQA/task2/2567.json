      "content": "Paper Title: Temporal Kernel Consistency for Blind Video Super-Resolution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSingle-Image Blind Super-Resolution. \nPrevious deep learning-based image-based SR approaches [ref]6  1    1 assumed a fixed and ideal downsampling degradation process, often bicubic interpolation, leading to poor performance when applied to real-world images.\nAs a result, most blind SR approaches focused on estimating the downsampling kernel and/or utilizing it for upsampling.\nEfrat et al.  first highlighted the kernel mismatch problem: using the incorrect kernel during restoration had a significant impact on the performance regardless of the choice of image prior.\nTowards accurate downsampling kernel estimation, Michaeli et al.  exploited the inherent recurrence property of image patches and proposed an iterative algorithm to derive the kernel that maximizes the similarity of recurring patches across scales of the LR image.\nBell-Kligler et al.  adopted a GAN approach 0, in which the generator learnt an estimated kernel to downscale the input image with and the discriminator learnt to differentiate between the patch distribution of the input image and its downscaled variant.\nThe downsampling kernel can also be learned using CNNs by enforcing that the super-resolved image maps back to the LR image 3 or using a paired of real-world image dataset .\nExploiting the kernel mismatch phenomenon, Gu et al. 2 and Luo et al.  alternatively estimated the kernel from the approximated super-resolved image and restored the image by using the estimated kernel, reaching the current state-of-the-art. Multi-Frame Super-Resolution.\nMFSR approaches focus on utilizing temporal information from the LR frames by aligning and fusing them in order to further boost restoration performance through CNNs or RNNs.\nEarlier works  7 performed motion compensation by estimating optical flow using traditional off-the-shelf motion estimation algorithms .\nAs the accuracy of motion estimation directly affects the reconstruction quality of the super-resolved images, these traditional motion estimation works are superseded by more accurate CNN-based networks such as spatial transformer networks 5 or task-specific motion estimation networks 4 8 4, leading to approaches 2 5 5 0 9 that focused on integrating motion estimation and SR networks for end-to-end learning.\nRecent works 6 6 7 9 decoupled this dependency on motion estimation networks and performed motion compensation by adaptively aligning the reference and supporting frames through dynamically-generated filters or deformable convolutions  5.\nAlthough majority of these works helped to elucidate the relationship between motion estimation and video restoration, they neglected the degradation process by assuming a fixed known kernel.\nTherefore, unlike previous MFSR works that focused on incorporating temporal information in the frames, we also utilized the temporal information in the downscaling degradation operation in order to further boost restoration performance. Towards blind MFSR, Pan et al. 0 used a kernel estimation network, consisting of two fully-connected layers, to learn a fixed blur kernel for inference.\nHowever, they, similar to Liu et al. 1, assumed that the kernel is fixed at every timestamp, resulting in poor SR performance as shown in Sec. 5.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: Single-Image Blind Super-Resolution. \nPrevious deep learning-based image-based SR approaches [ref]6  1    1 assumed a fixed and ideal downsampling degradation process, often bicubic interpolation, leading to poor performance when applied to real-world images.\nAs a result, most blind SR\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
