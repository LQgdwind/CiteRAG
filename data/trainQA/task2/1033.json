      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Schroeppel and Shamir’s Algorithm for Subset Sum via Orthogonal Vectors\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur main result is a positive answer to the 40-year old open Question 1: Every instance of Subset Sum can be solved in 𝒪⋆​(2n/2)superscript𝒪⋆superscript2𝑛2\\mathcal{O}^{\\star}(2^{n/2}) time and\n𝒪⋆​(20.249999​n)superscript𝒪⋆superscript20.249999𝑛\\mathcal{O}^{\\star}(2^{0.249999n}) space by a randomized Monte Carlo\nalgorithm with constant success probability. The result implies an analogous\nspace improvement for Knapsack and Binary Integer Programming (see\nCorollary 1.4).333See Appendix C for definitions of all problems considered in this paper.\nTo explain our key ideas and their combination with existing methods, the following problem is instrumental: \n\nWeighted Orthogonal Vectors (shorthand notation: WOV​(N,d,h)WOV𝑁𝑑ℎ\\textnormal{WOV}(N,d,h))\nInput: Families of N𝑁N weighted sets 𝒜,ℬ⊆([d]h)×ℕ𝒜ℬbinomialdelimited-[]𝑑ℎℕ\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{B}\\subseteq\\binom{[d]}{h}\\times\\mathbb{N} of Hamming weight hℎh, target integer t𝑡t\nTask: Detect (A,wA)∈𝒜𝐴subscript𝑤𝐴𝒜(A,w_{A})\\in\\mathcal{A} and (B,wB)∈ℬ𝐵subscript𝑤𝐵ℬ(B,w_{B})\\in\\mathcal{B} such that A𝐴A and B𝐵B are disjoint and wA+wB=tsubscript𝑤𝐴subscript𝑤𝐵𝑡w_{A}+w_{B}=t\n\n The starting point is the 𝒪⋆​(2n/2)superscript𝒪⋆superscript2𝑛2\\mathcal{O}^{\\star}(2^{n/2}) time and space algorithm by [ref]24.\nTheir algorithm can be seen as a reduction to an instance of WOV​(2n/2,0,0)WOVsuperscript2𝑛200\\textnormal{WOV}(2^{n/2},0,0). Since d=0𝑑0d=0, this is an instance of 2-SUM,3 and the runtime follows by a linear time algorithm for 2-SUM. In contrast, the representation technique by  can also\nbe thought of as a reduction from instances of Subset Sum to WOV, but with the\nassumption that the Subset Sum instance does not have additive structure.444Specifically, this means that |w​(2[n])|≥2(1−ε)​n𝑤superscript2delimited-[]𝑛superscript21𝜀𝑛|w(2^{[n]})|\\geq 2^{(1-\\varepsilon)n} for some small ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, where w​(2[n])𝑤superscript2delimited-[]𝑛w(2^{[n]}) denotes {w​(X):X⊆[n]}conditional-set𝑤𝑋𝑋delimited-[]𝑛\\{w(X):X\\subseteq[n]\\}. \nIn a follow-up work,  loosen the assumption of\n and show that their reduction applies whenever there is a small subset of d𝑑d weights without additive structure. Their work implies a reduction from every555Actually not every instance, but instances where the reduction fails can be solved quickly by other means. instance of Subset Sum to WOV​(N,d,d/4)WOV𝑁𝑑𝑑4\\textnormal{WOV}(N,d,d/4), where N=2n/2​(dd/4)/2d𝑁superscript2𝑛2binomial𝑑𝑑4superscript2𝑑N=2^{n/2}\\binom{d}{d/4}/2^{d} and d/n>0𝑑𝑛0d/n>0 is a small (but fixed) positive constant. Note that the two above reductions feature an intriguing trade-off between the size N𝑁N and the dimension d𝑑d of the produced instance, and the natural question is how the worst-case complexities of solving these instances as quick as possible compare.\nOur first step towards proving Theorem 1.1 is to show that this trade-off is tight, unless Question 1 is answered positively:\n\n\n\nKey Insight: There is an algorithm for WOV whose run time dependency in d𝑑d matches the instance decrease in d𝑑d in the reduction from .\nIn particular, WOV​(N,d,d/4)WOV𝑁𝑑𝑑4\\textnormal{WOV}(N,d,d/4) can be solved in 𝒪~​(N⋅2d/(dd/4))~𝒪⋅𝑁superscript2𝑑binomial𝑑𝑑4\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(N\\cdot 2^{d}/\\binom{d}{d/4}) time and 𝒪~​(N+2d)~𝒪𝑁superscript2𝑑\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(N+2^{d}) space (see\nTheorem 6.1).\n This insight has two interesting immediate consequences. First, it provides an\navenue towards resolving Question 1, because a positive answer to\nthis question is implied by an improvement of our algorithm even for the unweighted version of WOV​(N,d,d/4)WOV𝑁𝑑𝑑4\\textnormal{WOV}(N,d,d/4). To the best of our knowledge, such an improvement is entirely consistent with all the known hypotheses on (low/moderate/sparse) versions of the Orthogonal Vectors problem  . In fact, to answer Question 1 affirmatively we only need an improvement for the regime 2d/(dd/4)≤N≤2dsuperscript2𝑑binomial𝑑𝑑4𝑁superscript2𝑑2^{d}/\\binom{d}{d/4}\\leq N\\leq 2^{d}, while previous hypotheses address the regime where d/log⁡N𝑑𝑁d/\\log N tends to infinity. Second, a combination of the reduction from  and our\nalgorithm for WOV​(N,d,d/4)WOV𝑁𝑑𝑑4\\textnormal{WOV}(N,d,d/4) would give an algorithm for Subset Sum that runs\nin 𝒪⋆​(2n/2)superscript𝒪⋆superscript2𝑛2\\mathcal{O}^{\\star}(2^{n/2}) time and 𝒪⋆​(2(1/2−δ)​n)superscript𝒪⋆superscript212𝛿𝑛\\mathcal{O}^{\\star}(2^{(1/2-\\delta)n}) space, for some small\nδ>0𝛿0\\delta>0. While this is not even close to the memory improvement of , one may hope that by adding the ideas  on top of this approach results in a\nbetter memory usage. Notwithstanding the significant hurdles that need to be overcome to make these two methods combine, this is exactly how we get the improvement in Theorem 1.1.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: that A𝐴A and B𝐵B are disjoint and wA+wB=tsubscript𝑤𝐴subscript𝑤𝐵𝑡w_{A}+w_{B}=t\n\n The starting point is the 𝒪⋆​(2n/2)superscript𝒪⋆superscript2𝑛2\\mathcal{O}^{\\star}(2^{n/2}) time and space algorithm by [ref]24.\nTheir algorithm can be seen as a reduction to an instance of WOV​(2n/2,0,0)WOVsuperscript2𝑛200\\textnormal{WOV}(2^{n/2},0,0).
