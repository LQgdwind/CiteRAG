      "content": "Paper Title: Dense Siamese Network for Dense Unsupervised Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets.\nFor unsupervised pre-training,\nwe compare with other methods on ImageNet-1k¬† (IN1k) dataset and conduct ablation studies on COCO¬†[ref]31 dataset as it is smaller.\nCOCO and IN1k are two large-scale datasets that contain ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim118K and ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim1.28 million images, respectively.\nThough having more images, IN1k is highly curated and it mainly consists of object-centric images. Thus, the data is usually used for image classification.\nIn contrast, COCO contains more diverse scenes in the real world and it has more objects (‚àºsimilar-to\\sim7 objects vs. ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim1 in IN1k) in one image. Hence, it is mainly used for dense prediction tasks like object detection, semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation. For unsupervised semantic segmentation,\nthe model is trained and evaluated on curated subsets¬†[ref]28 [ref]11 of COCO train2017 split and val2017 split, respectively.\nThe training and validation set contain 49,629 images and 2,175 images, respectively.\nThe semantic segmentation annotations include 80 thing categories and 91 stuff categories¬†.\nWe follow previous methods¬†[ref]11 [ref]28 to merge these categories to form 27 (15 ‚Äòstuff‚Äô and 12 ‚Äòthings‚Äô) categories. Training Setup.\nWe closely follow the pre-training settings of SimSiam¬† when conducting unsupervised pre-training experiments of DenseSiam.\nSpecifically, we use a learning rate of lr√ólr{\\times}BatchSize/256absent256{/}256 following the linear scaling strategy¬†, with a base l‚Äãr=0.05ùëôùëü0.05lr\\!=\\!0.05.\nThe batch size is 512 by default.\nWe use the cosine decay learning rate schedule¬† and SGD optimizer, where the weight decay is 0.00010.00010.0001 and the SGD momentum is 0.90.90.9.\nWe pre-train DenseSiam for 800 epochs on COCO and for 200 epochs on IN1k.\nResNet-50¬† is used as default. For unsupervised semantic segmentation, for a fair comparison, we follow PiCIE¬†[ref]11 to adopt the backbone pre-trained on IN1k in a supervised manner.\nThe backbone is then fine-tuned with DenseSiam for unsupervised semantic segmentation using the same base learning rate, weight decay, and SGD momentum\nas those used in unsupervised representation learning. The batch size is 256 by default.\nWe empirically find the constant learning schedule works better during training. The model is trained for 10 epochs.\nResNet-18¬† is used as default for a fair comparison with previous methods¬†[ref]11. Evaluation Protocol of Transfer Learning.\nFor unsupervised pre-training, we evaluate the transfer learning performance of the pre-trained representations following Wang¬†et al¬†8.\nWe select different dense prediction tasks to comprehensively evaluate the transferability of the dense representation, including semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation.\nChallenging and popular dataset with representative algorithms in each task is selected. When evaluating on semantic segmentation, we fine-tune a FCN¬† model and evaluate it with the Cityscapes dataset¬†.\nThe model is trained on the train_fine set (2975 images) for 40k iterations and is tested on the val set.\nStrictly following the settings in MMSegmentation¬†, we use FCN-D8 with a crop size of 769, a batch size of 16, and synchronized batch normalization.\nResults are averaged over five trials. When evaluating on object detection, we fine-tune a Faster R-CNN¬† with C4-backbone by 24k iterations on VOC 2007 trainval + 2012 train set and is tested in VOC 2007 test set.\nResults are reported as an average over five trials. We also evaluate the representation on object detection and instance segmentation on COCO dataset¬†[ref]31.\nWe fine-tune a Mask R-CNN with FPN¬† with standard multi-scale 1x schedule¬†  on COCO train2017 split\nand evaluate it on COCO val2017 split.\nWe apply synchronized batch normalization in backbone, neck, and RoI heads during training¬† 8. Evaluation of Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation.\nSince the model is trained without labels, a mapping between the model‚Äôs label space and the ground truth categories needs be established.\nTherefore, we first let the model predicts on each image on the validation set, then we calculate the confusion matrix between the predicted labels and the ground truth classes.\nWe use linear assignment to build a one-to-one mapping between the predicted labels and ground truth classes by taking the confusion matrix as the assignment cost.\nThen we calculate mean IoU over all classes based on the obtained mapping¬†[ref]11 [ref]28.\nTo more comprehensively understand the model‚Äôs behavior, we also report mean IoU of stuff and things classes, noted as mIoUSt and mIoUTh, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: Datasets.\nFor unsupervised pre-training,\nwe compare with other methods on ImageNet-1k¬† (IN1k) dataset and conduct ablation studies on COCO¬†[ref]31 dataset as it is smaller.\nCOCO and IN1k are two large-scale datasets that contain ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim118K and ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim1.28 million images, respectively.\nThough having more images, IN1k is\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
