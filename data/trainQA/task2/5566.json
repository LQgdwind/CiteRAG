      "content": "Paper Title: Generalization Analysis for Contrastive Representation Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe performance of machine learning (ML) models often depends largely on the representation of data, which motivates a resurgence of contrastive representation learning (CRL) to learn a representation function f:𝒳↦ℝd:𝑓maps-to𝒳superscriptℝ𝑑f:\\mathcal{X}\\mapsto\\mathbb{R}^{d} from unsupervised data [ref]11 [ref]23 [ref]20.\nThe basic idea is to pull together similar pairs (𝐱,𝐱+)𝐱superscript𝐱(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}^{+}) and push apart disimilar pairs (𝐱,𝐱−)𝐱superscript𝐱(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}^{-}) in an embedding space, which can be formulated as minimizing the following objective [ref]11  where k𝑘k is the number of negative examples.\nThe hope is that the learned representation f​(𝐱)𝑓𝐱f(\\mathbf{x}) would capture the latent structure and be beneficial to other downstream learning tasks  . CRL has achieved impressive empirical performance in advancing the state-of-the-art performance in various domains such as computer vision [ref]20  [ref]11  and natural language processing   3. The empirical success of CRL motivates a natural question on theoretically understanding how the learned representation adapts to the downstream tasks, i.e., How would the generalization behavior of downstream ML models benefit from the representation function built from positive and negative pairs? Especially, how would the number of negative examples affect the learning performance? Arora et al.  provided an attempt to answer the above questions by developing a theoretical framework to study CRL. They first gave generalization bounds for a learned representation function in terms of Rademacher complexities. Then, they showed that this generalization behavior measured by an unsupervised loss guarantees the generalization behavior of a linear classifier in the downstream classification task. However, the generalization bounds there enjoy a linear dependency on k𝑘k, which would not be effective if k𝑘k is large. Moreover, this is not consistent with many studies which show a large number of negative examples [ref]11 8  [ref]23 is necessary for good generalization performance. For example, the work [ref]20 used 655366553665536 negative examples in unsupervised visual representation learning, for which the existing analysis requires n≥(65536)2​d𝑛superscript655362𝑑n\\geq(65536)^{2}d training examples to get non-vacuous bounds . Therefore, the existing analysis does not fully answer the question on the super performance of CRL to downstream tasks as already shown in many applications. Yuan et al.  has demonstrated the benefits using all negative data for each anchor data for CRL and proposed an efficient algorithms for optimizing global contrastive loss. Therefore, the existing analysis does not fully answer the question on the super performance of CRL to downstream tasks as already shown in many applications. In this paper, we aim to further deepen our understanding of CRL by fully exploiting the Lipschitz continuity of loss functions. Our contributions are listed as follows. 1. We develop generalization error bounds for CRL. We consider three types of loss functions: ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-Lipschitz loss, ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty}-Lipschitz loss and self-bounding Lipschitz loss. For ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-Lipschitz loss, we develop a generalization bound with a square-root dependency on k𝑘k by two applications of vector-contraction lemmas on Rademacher complexities, which improves the existing bound by a factor of k𝑘\\sqrt{k} . For ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty}-Lipschitz loss, we develop generalization bounds which does not depend on k𝑘k, up to some logarithmic terms, by approximating the arguments of loss functions via expanding the original dataset by a factor of k𝑘k to fully exploit the Lipschitz continuity. For self-bounding Lipschitz loss, we develop optimistic bounds involving the training errors, which can imply fast rates under a low noise setting. All of our generalization bounds involve Rademacher complexities of feature classes, which preserve the coupling among different features. 2. We then apply our general result to two unsupervised representation learning problems: learning with linear features and learning with nonlinear features via deep neural networks (DNNs). For learning with linear features, we consider two regularization schemes, i.e., p𝑝p-norm regularizer and Schatten-norm regularizer. For learning with nonlinear features, we develop Rademacher complexity and generalization bounds with a square-root dependency on the depth of DNNs. To this aim, we adapt the technique in Golowich et al.  by using a different moment generalization function to capture the coupling among different features. 3. Finally, we apply our results on representation learning to the generalization analysis of downstream classification problems, which outperforms the existing results by a factor of k𝑘k (ignoring a log factor). The remaining parts of the paper are organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related work, and Section 3 provides the problem formulation. We give generalization bounds for CRL in Section 4 for three types of loss functions, which are then applied to learning with both linear and nonlinear features in Section 5. Conclusions are given in Section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: which motivates a resurgence of contrastive representation learning (CRL) to learn a representation function f:𝒳↦ℝd:𝑓maps-to𝒳superscriptℝ𝑑f:\\mathcal{X}\\mapsto\\mathbb{R}^{d} from unsupervised data [ref]11 [ref]23 [ref]20.\nThe basic idea is to pull together similar pairs (𝐱,𝐱+)𝐱superscript𝐱(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}^{+}) and push apart disimilar pairs (𝐱,𝐱−)𝐱superscript𝐱(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}^{-})\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
