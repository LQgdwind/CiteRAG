      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Scalable Multi-Agent Coordination by Spatial Differentiation for Traffic Signal Control\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe existing traffic signal control (TSC) methods can be divided into two categories: rule-based methods and learning-based methods. The former transforms the problem into a rule-based optimization problem; the later one seeks control strategy from the traffic flow data. For the rule-based methods, such as Webster, GreenWave and Max-pressure, a traffic signal optimization problem is usually solved under some assumptions like a preset period or fixed cycle-based phase sequence. Webster is used for an isolated intersection and is a widely-used method in TSC. It assumes that the traffic flow is uniform during a certain period and constructs a closed-form equation to generate the optimal cycle length and phase split for a single intersection that minimizes the travel time of all vehicles passing the intersection.\nGreenWave is a classical method in the transportation field to implement coordination,\nwhich aims to optimize the offsets to reduce the number of stops for vehicles travelling along one specific direction.\nMax-pressure aims to reduce the risk of over-saturation by balancing queue length between adjacent intersections and minimizing the “pressure” of the phases for an intersection. However, the unpractical assumptions in these methods might not lead to excellent performance. Recently, the DRL technique, as a popular learning-based method, has been proposed to control traffic signals due to its capability of online optimization without prior knowledge about the given environment. At present, DRL has been successfully applied to the single-intersection regulation of traffic signal [ref]3 by regarding the intersection as an agent. The results of various state-of-the-art DRL algorithms are compared in , showing that Deep Q-Networks algorithm is more suitable for the solution of TSC tasks. However, the problem with multiple intersections is still a frontier. Existing MARL algorithms focus on collaboration among agents and can be divided into centralized and decentralized setting according to various information structures[ref]7.\nIndependent reinforcement learning (IRL), as a fully decentralized setting, directly perform a DRL algorithm for each agent with neither explicit nor implicit information exchange with each other. This method has been applied in multi-intersection TSC problem. However, the environment is shared in MARL, and it changes with the policy and state of each agent. For one of the agents, the environment is dynamic and non-stationary, leads to convergence problems.\nTan et.al.[ref]15 compares IRL with Value Decomposition Networks (VDN) and illustrates the disadvantages of IRL.\nAs a centralized method, there exists a central controller in VDN which integrates the value function of each agent to obtain a joint action-value function. The integration strategy is to add them directly. Moreover, QMIX, as a extend of VDN, uses state information and integrates them in a nonlinear way and gets a stronger approximation ability than VDN. Both QMIX and VDN are typical centralized MARL algorithms with communication, and this joint-action idea has been already used in TSC. Based on these centralized methods, recent TSC studies condense the global scope into a smaller neighborhood and use graph convolution network (GCN) to achieve coordination. Colight introduces the concept of attention mechanism and realized cooperation by integrating observations in a neighborhood implicitly into a hidden state. However, as mentioned in Colight, the neighborhood scope is a constant, so the traffic information among intersections cannot be utilized to determine the range of the neighborhood. Due to the usage of GCN and Multi-head Attention techniques, these methods still need to gather information for centralized computing and betray the intention of distribution. In fact, such a central controller does not exist in many applications, apart from those that can easily have a global perspective, like video games[ref]7. Considering the demand for the scalability in TSC, setting a central controller is impractical. Therefore, we need to seek a compromise solution which is both convergent and scalable. This setting is referred to as a decentralized one with networked agents[ref]7.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: to its capability of online optimization without prior knowledge about the given environment.
