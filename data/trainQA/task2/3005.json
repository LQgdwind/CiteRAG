      "content": "Paper Title: Time Discretization-Invariant Safe Action Repetition for Policy Gradient Methods\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated phenomenal achievements in a wide array of tasks, including superhuman game-playing  7 and controlling complex robots [ref]8 .\nMost RL algorithms are based on an Markov Decision Process (MDP), which is a discrete-time control process for the iteration of observing a state and performing an action.\nHowever, numerous real-world problems such as robotic manipulation and autonomous driving are defined in continuous time, which does not directly fit the MDP setting.\nTo fill this gap, continuous time is often discretized by a discretization time scale Œ¥ùõø\\delta, where the RL agent makes a decision at every Œ¥ùõø\\delta.\nIt has been shown that RL algorithms are greatly sensitive to this hyperparameter  .\nFor instance, altering Œ¥ùõø\\delta via frame skipping leads to drastic performance differences  .\nIndeed, an excessively high Œ¥ùõø\\delta precludes the agent from making fine-grained decisions, which is likely to cause performance degradation. On average, the agent could perform equally well or better with a lower Œ¥ùõø\\delta than with a higher Œ¥ùõø\\delta, since the agent can make decisions more frequently.\nHowever, Baird  and Tallec et¬†al.  theoretically proved that the standard Q-learning fails when Œ¥‚Üí0‚Üíùõø0\\delta\\to 0 as the action-value (Q) function collapses to the state-value (V) function, eliminating preferences between actions.\nAs will be shown in Section¬†4.1, policy gradient (PG) methods fail as well with an infinitesimal Œ¥ùõø\\delta for the following three reasons:\n(1) The variance of the gradient estimator explodes. (2) Exploration ranges may become highly limited.\n(3) Infinitely many decision steps are required.\nThe latter two also apply to Q-learning methods. Therefore,\nit is generally required to differently set an appropriate Œ¥ùõø\\delta for each continuous environment.\nIndeed, continuous control environments in MuJoCo  have different discretization time scales from one another, ranging from 0.008s (Hopper) to 0.05s (InvertedDoublePendulum).\nHowever, such tuning of Œ¥ùõø\\delta could be burdensome when applying RL algorithms to new environments,\nconsidering its significant influence on performance  .\nFurthermore, even if the optimal Œ¥ùõø\\delta is found in simulation, trained policies may not be transferable to real-world settings, since physical sensors often have their unique sampling frequencies. There have been proposed some methods for robustness to discretization of time scales.\nŒ¥ùõø\\delta-invariant methods could bring several advantages:\n(1) It obviates the need for tuning Œ¥ùõø\\delta on each continuous control environment.\n(2) They can achieve better performance\nby utilizing more fine-grained control with a low Œ¥ùõø\\delta.\n(3) Using a policy with adaptive decision frequencies (as a variant of Œ¥ùõø\\delta-invariant policies),\nthe agent can efficiently take actions only when necessary, which could expedite training without losing agility.\nTallec et¬†al.  introduced an algorithm based on Advantage Updating ,\nwhich can make existing Q-learning methods (e.g., DQN 8 and DDPG 6)\ninvariant to Œ¥ùõø\\delta by preventing them from Q-function collapse.\nFor PG methods, Munos 1 and Wawrzynski  proposed methods that can cope with fine time discretization.\nHowever, these methods either assume access to the gradient of the reward function or require an infinite number of decision steps (or training steps) when Œ¥‚Üí0‚Üíùõø0\\delta\\to 0, both of which could hinder its application to real-world environments. We aim at proposing an efficient Œ¥ùõø\\delta-invariant approach applicable to existing PG methods such as PPO , TRPO 8 and A2C 0.\nOne straightforward approach may be to take durative actions by making policies produce both actions and their durations.\nSuch an approach is practically equivalent to prior work on action repetition whose policies output both actions and the number of action repetitions 5 [ref]31,\nsince continuous control environments such as MuJoCo often already provide discretized time scales.\nHowever, prior approaches to action repetition possess some limitations.\nFor example, there is no way to stop repeating a chosen action during a repetition period,\nwhich means that they are not capable of immediately handling unexpected events in stochastic environments.\nThis could lead to catastrophic failure in some real-world settings such as autonomous driving. We thus propose an alternative approach named Safe Action Repetition (SAR) with the key idea of repeating an action until the agent exits its safe region.\nOur policy produces both an action and a safe region in the state space, only within which the chosen action is repeated.\nSAR enables any PG algorithm to not only be Œ¥ùõø\\delta-invariant but also be robust to stochasticity such as unexpected events in the environment,\nbecause such situations lead the agent‚Äôs state to be outside of the safe region, immediately causing the cease of the current action.\nWe apply the proposed method to several PG algorithms and empirically show that SAR indeed exhibits Œ¥ùõø\\delta-invariance on various MuJoCo environments and outperforms baselines on both deterministic and stochastic settings. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We first provide a more general proof on the variance explosion of the PG estimator, which is the main reason why PG methods fail as Œ¥‚Üí0‚Üíùõø0\\delta\\to 0.\nWe then show that temporally extended actions can resolve the failure mode of PG algorithms with a low Œ¥ùõø\\delta. We introduce a novel Œ¥ùõø\\delta-invariant method named SAR applicable to any PG method on continuous control domains.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first action repetition (or durative action) method that repeats an action based on the agent‚Äôs state, rather than a precomputed action duration.\nAs a result, SAR can cope with unexpected situations in stochastic environments, which existing action repetition methods cannot handle. We apply SAR to three PG methods, PPO, TRPO and A2C, and empirically demonstrate that our SAR method is mostly invariant to Œ¥ùõø\\delta on eight MuJoCo environments.\nWe also verify its robustness to stochasticity via three different stochastic settings on each MuJoCo environment.\nOur method also outperforms previous Œ¥ùõø\\delta-invariant approaches such as FiGAR-C [ref]31 and DAU  on those settings.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated phenomenal achievements in a wide array of tasks, including superhuman game-playing  7 and controlling complex robots [ref]8 .\nMost RL algorithms are based on an Markov Decision Process (MDP), which is a discrete-time control process for the iteration of observing a state and performing an action.\nHowever, numerous\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
