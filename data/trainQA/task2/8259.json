      "content": "Paper Title: The Communication Complexity of Approximating Matrix Rank\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe exact and approximate computation of matrix rank is a fundamental\nproblem in theoretical computer science, studied for its intrinsic\nimportance as well as its connections to other algorithmic and complexity-theoretic\nquestions. In particular, a large body of research has focused on\nthe communication complexity of the matrix rank problem in Yao’s two-party\nmodel  , with both classical and quantum\ncommunication. In this problem, the two parties Alice and Bob receive\nmatrices A,B∈𝔽n×n𝐴𝐵superscript𝔽𝑛𝑛A,B\\in\\mathbb{F}^{n\\times n}, respectively, over a finite\nfield 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} and are tasked with determining the rank of A+B𝐴𝐵A+B\nusing minimal communication. The first result in this line of research\nwas obtained three decades ago by Chu and Schnitger ,\nwho proved a lower bound of Ω​(k​n2)Ω𝑘superscript𝑛2\\Omega(kn^{2}) for the deterministic\ncommunication complexity of computing the rank of A+B𝐴𝐵A+B when the\nmatrix entries are k𝑘k-bit integers. Several years later, Chu and\nSchnitger [ref]7 further showed that\nthis communication problem has deterministic complexity Ω​(n2​log⁡p)Ωsuperscript𝑛2𝑝\\Omega(n^{2}\\log p)\nwhen the matrix entries are in 𝔽psubscript𝔽𝑝\\mathbb{F}_{p}, the finite field\nwith p𝑝p elements. The first result on the randomized communication\ncomplexity of the matrix rank problem was obtained by Sun and Wang ,\nwho proved that determining whether A+B𝐴𝐵A+B is singular requires Ω​(n2​log⁡p)Ωsuperscript𝑛2𝑝\\Omega(n^{2}\\log p)\nbits of communication for matrices A,B𝐴𝐵A,B over the finite field 𝔽psubscript𝔽𝑝\\mathbb{F}_{p}\nfor prime p𝑝p. In a follow-up paper, Li, Sun, Wang, and Woodruff \nshowed that this Ω​(n2​log⁡p)Ωsuperscript𝑛2𝑝\\Omega(n^{2}\\log p) lower bound holds even for\na promise version of the matrix rank problem, where the matrix A+B𝐴𝐵A+B\nis guaranteed to have rank either n−1𝑛1n-1 or n𝑛n. The lower bounds\nof  \nfurther apply to quantum communication. Despite these exciting developments, no progress has been made on\nlower bounds for approximating matrix rank. Our main contribution\nis the complete resolution of the approximate matrix rank problem.\nIn what follows, we state our results for matrix rank and several\nother approximation problems, and present applications of our work\nto streaming complexity.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: for the deterministic\ncommunication complexity of computing the rank of A+B𝐴𝐵A+B when the\nmatrix entries are k𝑘k-bit integers.
