      "content": "Paper Title: VeriDIP: Verifying Ownership of Deep Neural Networks through Privacy Leakage Fingerprints\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo begin with, we briefly show the details of datasets and the configurations of machine learning models used in the experiments. Datasets. We use four famous datasets in our experimental evaluation, CIFAR-10¬†111https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html, FMNIST¬†222https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist, Adult¬†333https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult, and Health¬†444https://www.dshs.texas.gov/THCIC/Hospitals/Download.shtm. Specifically, CIFAR-10 and FMNIST are two image datasets used by recent studies in evaluating WE and OT approaches¬† [ref]10  ; Adult and Health are two tabular datasets, by which we could train (almost) perfect MI attacks-resilient model as (almost) the worst-case scenario for VeriDIP (Algorithm¬†1). CIFAR-10: CIFAR-10 consists of 32√ó32323232\\times 32 color images of 101010 real world objects, with 5,00050005,000 instances of each object class. FMNIST: Fashion MNIST consists of 28√ó28282828\\times 28 grayscale images, associated a label from 101010 classes, with 7,00070007,000 instances of each object class. Adult: The US Adult Census dataset comprises 48,8424884248,842 entries, with each entry containing 131313 features. These features are utilized to infer whether an individual‚Äôs income exceeds 50K/year or not. Health: The Heritage Health dataset consists of 139,785139785139,785 physician records and insurance claims, with each record containing 250250250 features. The objective is to predict ten-year mortality by binarizing the Charlson Index, using the median value as a cutoff. Neural networks. Following existing works¬† [ref]10, we train CIFAR-10 using ResNet-18 architecture and the SGD optimizer with a stepped learning rate. The initial learning rate is set to 0.010.010.01 and is divided by ten every 20 epochs. For the FMNIST dataset, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) using the Adam optimizer. As for the Adult and Health datasets, which are tabular datasets, we utilize a 4-layer perceptron with the Adam optimizer. The learning rate for all Adam optimizers is set to 10‚àí4superscript10410^{-4}. The batch size is set to 505050 for CIFAR-10 and FMNIST, and it is set to 500500500 for Adult and Health. Model stealing attacks. We have discussed attackers in OT experiments in Section¬†3.3. In this section, we consider three types of model stealing attacks that are commonly used for evaluating the effectiveness of copyright protection approaches. Note that fine-prune attack  presented in Figure¬†1 is not specifically targeted at model copyright protection but rather falls under a category of defenses against model backdoor attacks. Therefore, to ensure fairness in the experiments, we did not include it in our evaluation. Model extraction (ME) attack¬† [ref]33. The ME attack retrains a model from scratch by minimizing the loss between the predictions of stolen copies and its teacher predictions. Knowledge distillation (KD)¬†[ref]9. The KD attack retrains a model from scratch by minimizing the distance between the teacher‚Äôs and student‚Äôs soft predictions plus the cross-entropy loss between the student‚Äôs prediction and ground-truth label yùë¶y. The student model is the stolen copy. Fine-tuning (FT)¬†[ref]10. The FT attack keeps training the victim model for a while to modify the original decision boundary. It first uses a large learning rate to erase the original decision boundary, then gradually reduces the learning rate to restore the prediction accuracy of the model. According to their result, it is effective for removing all watermarks. The ME and the KD are black-box attacks, while FT is a white-box attack. We use the open-source code and the same hyperparameters as the existing works of ME¬†[ref]33, KD¬†[ref]9 and FT¬†[ref]10. We list their loss functions and hyper-parameters in Table¬†III.\nAccording to [ref]10, carefully tuning the learning rate can remove all model watermarks. Our aim is to determine the effectiveness of these attacks in disturbing model fingerprints. MI attack algorithm. The implementation of the global threshold MI attack follows the methods proposed by Yeom et al.¬†. As for the per-sample threshold MI attacks, there are two implementations: online and offline. We use the open-source code of the online implementation¬† since it demonstrates better attack performance. Reproduction of Dataset Inference (DI)¬†. DI proposed to use ‚Äúprediction margins‚Äù as fingerprints to verify model ownership. The prediction margins are obtained by performing adversarial attacks on the suspect models. We use their black-box implementation (Blind Walk) since it is more consistent with our attacker‚Äôs capability assumptions. Plus, the Blind Walk has better verification performance and lower computational costs than their white-box implementation (MinGD)¬†.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: and Health¬†444https://www.dshs.texas.gov/THCIC/Hospitals/Download.shtm. Specifically, CIFAR-10 and FMNIST are two image datasets used by recent studies in evaluating WE and OT approaches¬† [ref]10  ; Adult and Health are two tabular datasets, by which we could train (almost) perfect MI attacks-resilient model as (almost) the worst-case scenario for VeriDIP (Algorithm¬†1).
