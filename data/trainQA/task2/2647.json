      "content": "Paper Title: Graph Attention Layer Evolves Semantic Segmentation for Road Pothole Detection: A Benchmark and Algorithms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe existing road pothole detection methods can be categorized into two groups: explicit programming-based [ref]3 and machine learning-based . Explicit programming-based methods detect potholes via either two-dimensional (2-D) image analysis/understanding or three-dimensional (3-D) road point cloud modeling and segmentation [ref]3. As an example, a Microsoft Kinect sensor is used to capture road depth images , which are then segmented using image thresholding method for road pothole detection. In order to ensure the applicability of image thresholding method, the Microsoft Kinect sensor has to be mounted as perpendicularly as possible to the road surface as it requires uniformly distributed background (undamaged road areas) depth values . The 3-D road point cloud modeling and segmentation approaches [ref]12 typically interpolate a road surface point cloud into an explicit mathematical model, e.g., a quadratic surface. The road potholes can then be effectively detected by comparing the difference between and actual and the interpolated 3-D road surfaces. Recently, [ref]3 introduced a hybrid road pothole detection system developed based on disparity transformation and modeling. The disparity transformation algorithm can not only estimate the stereo camera’s roll and pitch angles but also transform the disparity image into a quasi-inverse perspective view, where the background disparity values become very similar [ref]13. This algorithm does not require the depth sensor’s optical axis to be perpendicular to the road surface, greatly enhancing the robustness and adaptability of depth/disparity image segmentation algorithms. Subsequently, a quadratic surface is fitted to the disparities in the undamaged road regions for accurate road pothole detection. Machine learning-based methods generally train CNNs on well-annotated vision data for end-to-end road pothole detection . Any general-purpose semantic/instance segmentation CNN can be easily applied to detect road potholes from RGB or disparity/depth images. For example, mask region-based CNN (R-CNN) is employed in  to detect road potholes from RGB images. In , DeepLabv3+ is utilized to segment RGB images for road pothole detection. In , five single-modal and three data-fusion CNNs are compared in terms of detecting road potholes from RGB and/or transformed disparity images, where an attention aggregation framework and an adversarial domain adaptation technique are used to boost the CNN performance.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: The existing road pothole detection methods can be categorized into two groups: explicit programming-based [ref]3 and machine learning-based .
