      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to schedule job-shop problems: Representation and policy learning using graph neural network and reinforcement learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we analyze the performances of the GNN scheduler, trained using the training set described in the previous section, on the following benchmark job shop problems: ORB 01-10 , SWV 01-20 , FT 06/10/20 , LA 01-40 2, ABZ5-9 , YN 1-4 [ref]54, and TA 01-80 . The numbers of machines and jobs of a JSSP instance in the benchmark sets range from 5 to 20 and 6 to 100, respectively. Each set of benchmark instances follows a different distribution for generating JSSP instances. Refer appendix¬†A to find detail description about the generating distribution of benchmarks. Using the benchmark instances, we investigated how well the trained GNN scheduler solved completely new JSSP instances whose sizes and other characteristics were completely different to those of the training JSSP instances. For some large-size JSSP benchmarks, there are no exact solutions found in the literature . Instead, the lower bound and upper bound of the makespan are only known. For such cases, we consider the mean value of the lower bound and upper bound of the JSSP instance as Cm‚Äãa‚Äãx‚àósubscriptsuperscriptùê∂ùëöùëéùë•C^{*}_{max}. Figure¬†6 [Left] shows the average relative error of the GNN scheduler on each benchmark set compared to the PDRs. The GNN scheduler yielded quality solutions whose average relative errors ranged from 12.6% to 20.9%. Except the ABZ and TA benchmark JSSPs, the relative errors of the trained GNN scheduler were the lowest. In the cases of ABZ and TA, the difference in relative error between our scheduling policy and the best PDR was within 0.1%. The results of the trained GNN scheduler with respect to the size of JSSP are presented in Figure¬†6 [Right]. We excluded the 6√ó\\times6 (6 machines and 6 jobs) instances from the performance evaluation because the benchmark JSSP with that size is only FT06. Figure¬†6 [Right] shows that the proposed GNN scheduler also obtained strong performances over all JSSPs across all sizes compared to the PDRs. Our scheduler ranked best in all but two size of instances, where it ranked second for the cases of 20√ó\\times30 and 20√ó\\times50, with 4.4% and 2.7% gaps in relative error from the best PDR, respectively. From the experiment on the benchmark instances, we can confirm that the proposed GNN scheduler is relatively robust to variations of problem distribution and size compared to PDRs. PDRs schedule operations according to a pre-determined rule without considering the JSSP structure. Therefore, the quality of scheduling solutions from PDRs may fluctuate depending on the properties of the particular JSSP. For example, the MOR and FIFO rules generally performed well, but their scheduling performances deteriorated significantly on the SVW benchmark problems. In contrast, our GNN scheduler reliably generated the high-quality scheduling solutions for various types of JSSPs. This result implies that the proposed graph embedding algorithm enables the scheduling algorithm to (1) extract effective features representing the current state of JSSP regardless of its size and processing time and (2) derive a better scheduling action. Also note that, as shown in Figure 6, the error score of the proposed method varies significantly depending on the benchmark instances. The large fluctuation of the error score is possibly caused by (1) the characteristic of a JSSP problem and (2) the large variability in the difficulty level of the benchmark instances. Because the optimum solution of a JSSP is represented as a unique sequence of assignments, even a single change in the order of assignments can induce a considerable performance degradation, which is a typical property of a function defined over high-dimensional combinatorial action space. Furthermore, this performance degradation strongly depends on the structure of a JSSP (i.e., the distribution of numbers for jobs and machines, and the distribution of task completion time). This argument can be supported by the fact that the error function patterns over the benchmark instances are similar for all the algorithms, including the proposed one. For instance, the scheduling algorithms generally have a low level of an error on LA instances, while the scheduling algorithms have a high level of an error on SVW and FT instances.\n\nReference markers found: [54]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]54: the GNN scheduler, trained using the training set described in the previous section, on the following benchmark job shop problems: ORB 01-10 , SWV 01-20 , FT 06/10/20 , LA 01-40 2, ABZ5-9 , YN 1-4 [ref]54, and TA 01-80 .
