      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Video Prediction from a Single Frame by Estimating 3D Dynamic Scene Structure\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEarly works on video prediction did not account for the fact the the future is uncertain   , hence tended to produce blurry or averaged predictions on real-world data [ref]2 .\nRecently there has been increasing work on stochastic prediction methods, which do account for this uncertainty, usually with variational inference .\nThese methods typically have one latent embedding variable per frame, with frames also conditioned on prior frames in an autoregressive fashion.\n[ref]8 and  use ConvLSTMs for the decoder and encoder, with the prior distribution on the latents also dependent on preceding frames.  present an extension using deeper networks to achieve improved visual fidelity.  extend this further, with an ODE-inspired residual architecture to improve the dynamics model.\n[ref]2 again use a variational approach, but with a more sophisticated generative process that composes output frames from transformed regions of the input frames.\n augment the usual variational reconstruction loss with an adversarial term, to produce sharper results. Instead of variational training,  propose an approach based on normalizing flows ; this allows maximizing the exact likelihood, at the expense of an extremely computationally-heavy model.\nMost of these methods are evaluated exclusively on datasets with a static camera [ref]2  [ref]8; moreover, the majority focus on multi-frame inputs—a considerably easier setting as object velocities can be observed. A separate line of work aims to decompose videos into a set of objects, model their dynamics, and hence predict future frames. These are broadly similar in spirit to our model, but all consider objects as 2D entities rather than 3D, which limits their applicability to real-world datasets.\n predicts videos from a single frame, in terms of a set of moving objects defined by bounding-boxes; however they assume access to ground-truth boxes (or a pretrained detector) during both training and testing.\n learns to auto-encode videos through a latent space that explicitly represents the locations of a set of keypoints, while also learning a dynamics model on that space.\n construct a latent representation similar to early work on object-centric image generation , but with a more-sophisticated dynamics model and the ability to generate conditioned on input frames.\n learn a 2D sprite-based representation jointly with a dynamics model over those sprites; this allows video extrapolation on simple datasets that can be adequately modelled by 2D sprites.\nLastly, [ref]47  both predict frames by reasoning over optical flow (in 2D and 3D respectively), but assume access to additional information—depth images for , and segmentation masks for [ref]47. Several recent methods build unconditional generative models of video, by modelling the video in terms of a set of objects.\n   model objects as 2D sprites, and focus on evaluating tracking and segmentation rather than generation.\n focuses on generation, treating objects as 3D, but only considering short, synthetic videos.\nThese methods can sample videos a priori, but are unable to condition on provided frames. Our method uses a novel extension of NeRF  to represent 4D scenes.\n present an alternative approach to this; however, they focus on the single-scene setting, i.e. training one model to represent a single scene given multiple views—in contrast to our setting of inferring the representation from a single image.\nIn contrast,  consider predicting a NeRF from one or few images, but only to represent a static scene.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Early works on video prediction did not account for the fact the the future is uncertain   , hence tended to produce blurry or averaged predictions on real-world data [ref]2 .\nRecently there has been increasing work on stochastic prediction methods, which do account for this uncertainty, usually with variational inference .\nThese methods typically have one latent\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
