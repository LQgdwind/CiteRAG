      "content": "Paper Title: Robust Reinforcement Learning in Continuous Control Tasks with Uncertainty Set Regularization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRobust Reinforcement Learning (Robust RL) has recently become a popular topic    [ref]40, due to its effectiveness in tackling perturbations. Besides the transition perturbation in this paper, there are other branches relating to action, state and reward.\nWe will briefly discuss them in the following paragraphs. Additionally, we will discuss the relation of Robust RL, sim-to-real, Bayesian RL and Adaptive RL approaches, which are also important topics in robot learning\n Action Perturbation.\nEarly works in Robust RL concentrated on action space perturbations. Pinto et al. [ref]41 first proposed an adversarial agent perturbing the action of the principle agent, training both alternately in a mini-max style. Tessler et al.  later performed action perturbations with probability α𝛼\\alpha to simulate abrupt interruptions in the real world. Afterwards, Kamalaruban et al.  analyzed this mini-max problem from a game-theoretic perspective and claimed that an adversary with mixed strategy converges to a mixed Nash Equilibrium. Similarly, Vinitsky et al.  involved multiple adversarial agents to augment the robustness, which can also be explained in the view of a mixed strategy. State Perturbation.\nState perturbation can lead to the change of state from s𝑠s to spsubscript𝑠𝑝s_{p}, and thus might worsen an agent’s policy π​(a|s)𝜋conditional𝑎𝑠\\pi(a|s) . Zhang et al. , Oikarinen et al.  both assume an Lpsubscript𝐿𝑝L_{p}-norm uncertainty set on the state space (inspired by the idea of adversarial attacks widely used in computer vision ) and propose an auxiliary loss to encourage learning to resist such attacks. It is worth noting that state perturbation is a special case of transition perturbation, which can be covered by the framework proposed in this paper, as further explained in Appendix F. Reward Perturbation.\nThe robustness-regularization duality has been widely studied, especially when considering reward perturbations  [ref]20 . One reason is that the policy regularizer is closely related to a perturbation on the reward function without the need for a rectangular uncertainty assumption. However, it restricts the scope of these works as reward perturbation, since it can be shown to be a particular case of transition perturbation by augmenting the reward value in the state [ref]20. Besides, the majority of works focus on the analysis of regularization to robustness, which can only analyze the effect of existing regularizers instead of deriving novel regularizers for robustness as in the work we present here. Sim-to-real.\nSim-to-real is a key research topic in robot learning. Compared to the Robust RL problem, it aims to learn a robust policy from simulations for generalization in real-world environments. Domain randomization is a common approach to ease this mismatch in sim-to-real problems  . However, Mankowitz et al.  has demonstrated that it actually optimizes the average case of the environment rather than the worst-case scenario (as seen in our research), which fails to perform robustly during testing. More recent active domain randomization methods  resolve this flaw by automatically selecting difficult environments during the training process. The idea of learning an adversarial uncertainty set considered in this paper can be seen as a strategy to actively search for more valuable environments for training. Bayesian RL.\nOne commonality between Bayesian RL and Robust RL is that they both store uncertainties over the environmental parameter (posterior distribution q​(w)𝑞𝑤q(w) in Bayesian RL and uncertainty set ΩwsubscriptΩ𝑤\\Omega_{w} in Robust RL). Uncertainties learned in Bayesian RL can benefit Robust RL in two ways: (1) Robust RL can define an uncertainty set Ωw={w:q​(w)>α}subscriptΩ𝑤conditional-set𝑤𝑞𝑤𝛼\\Omega_{w}=\\{w:q(w)>\\alpha\\} to learn a robust policy that can tolerate model errors, which is attractive for offline RL and model-based RL; (2) A soft robust objective with respect to the distribution q​(w)𝑞𝑤q(w) can ease the conservative behaviours caused by the worst-case scenario . Adaptive RL.\nAdaptive RL (often referred as Meta RL ) is another popular technique to deal with the perturbations in environments parallel to Robust RL introduced in this paper. The main difference between Robust RL and Adaptive RL is whether policy parameters are allowed to change when environmental parameters vary. Robust RL is a zero-shot learning technique aiming to learn one single robust policy that can be applied to various perturbed environments. Adaptive RL is a few-shot learning technique aiming to quickly change policy to adapt to the changing environments. These two techniques can be combined to increase the robustness in real-world robots. One can first use Robust RL to learn a base policy as the warm start and fine-tune the policy on certain perturbed environments with Adaptive RL.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: Robust Reinforcement Learning (Robust RL) has recently become a popular topic    [ref]40, due to its effectiveness in tackling perturbations.
