Unsupervised-shapelets are discovered without label information,\nand thus shapelets can been used for not only time series classification but also time series clustering.\nLi et al.  proposed the ShapeNet framework\nto discover shapelets for multivariate time series classification.\nIn comparison, this paper is the first work to investigate how to discover shapelets\nto do the clustering on both univariate and multivariate time series.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: method (a.k.a u-shapelet) was proposed for time series clustering in .\nScalable u-shapelet method, a hash-based algorithm to discover u-shapelets efficiently, was introduced by Ulanova et al. [ref]39.\nThe optimized techniques of SAX  have been exploited in scalable u-shapelet.\nk-Shape  relies on a scalable iterative refinement procedure to generate homogeneous and well-separated\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
