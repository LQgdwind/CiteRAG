Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: The Right Tool for the Job: Open-Source Auditing Tools in Machine Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAt the 2021 Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) conference, the organizing committee instituted an Ethics Review process for papers submitted to the conference.\nAccording to the conference Retrospective publication, 9122 total papers were submitted and reviewed and 265 were flagged for additional ethics review in one or more areas of concern. Areas of concern included: Discrimination/Bias/Fairness Concerns, Inadequate Data and Algorithm Evaluation, Inappropriate Potential Applications and Impact (e.g. human rights concerns), Legal Compliance (e.g. GDPR, copyright, terms of use), Privacy and Security (e.g. consent), Responsible Research Practice (e.g. IRB, documentation, research ethics), and research integrity issues (e.g. plagiarism) [ref]7. The ACL, CVPR, ICLR, and EMNLP conferences have also taken steps to establish ethical expectations for the research community including introducing ethics review processes [ref]7. Including fairness and ethics assessments in the underlying work and research methodologies and reporting the same in the papers, reviews, and conference presentations will boost confidence from industry, academia, government, business, the public, and end-users who have concerns about AI and machine learning fairness and safety. In January 2022, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced that it would soon require facial recognition technology in order to access its systems [ref]8 and [ref]9. The IRS contracted with a third-party company, ID.me, to provide the service. The company also provides services to the US Department of Veterans Affairs and the US Social Security Administration. However, the agency reversed its decision after large public outcries over the practice . Even more chilling data privacy concerns were uncovered following the public outcry that showed the IRS had consented to allowing ID.me to “disclose or share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Third-Party Service Providers and Affiliates” . This implies that the company was or intended to be a data broker and many data privacy advocates have become rightly concerned. Initially, ID.me initially stated that it was only going to be using 1:1 facial recognition, but later clarified that the company also uses 1:N (1:many) technology, prompting privacy advocates to raise public concerns.  The CEO founder of ID.me stated that the 1:many is only used during initial enrollment and that afterwards, 1:1 is used . However, a New Jersey man was indicted by the US Department of Justice in January 2022 for deliberately circumventing the security measures of ID.me in order to further a scheme to defraud the California Employment Development Department (EDD), filing at least 78 fraudulent unemployment insurance claims with EED seeking Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and other benefits under the federal CARES Act. EDD has partnered with ID.me since at least October 2021 . How much better off would ID.me be if they could show that they or a neutral third-party entity has conducted an algorithm audit of their systems and processes and be able to provide proof of the same?\nIn situations where the algorithmic model and data are proprietary, the use of something like zero-knowledge proofs may be a way to affirmatively show the results of an algorithmic and data audit without actually opening the proprietary system for analysis to the public or in a public forum. As issues of fairness in machine learning and AI ethics continue to expand, it becomes imperative for the community to be aware of the potential risk and legal implication and the need to be familiar with open-source and free auditing tools that can be used to insure integrity of data and algorithms used.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: (e.g. GDPR, copyright, terms of use), Privacy and Security (e.g. consent), Responsible Research Practice (e.g. IRB, documentation, research ethics), and research integrity issues (e.g. plagiarism) [ref]7.

Including\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
