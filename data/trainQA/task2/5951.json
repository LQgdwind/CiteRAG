      "content": "Paper Title: AutoShot: A Short Video Dataset and State-of-the-Art Shot Boundary Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExtensive efforts have been made to collect video shot boundary detection datasets 2    6 7, which have significantly accelerated the development of advanced shot boundary detection methods. A specific type of video boundary detection attempts to parse the video into pieces of human actions, where instructional videos with human performing diverse actions are commonly used 8  . Another widely studied type of video boundary detection is scene boundary detection, where videos are split into several semantically independent clips. Movies and TV episodes are commonly used for scene boundary detection, and MovieScenes 6 and AdCuepoints [ref]6 are two large-scale movie datasets for scene boundary detection. Furthermore, Shou et al. 9 collect a new benchmark, Kinectics-GEBD, for generic event boundary detection. For video ads scene boundary detection, Wang et al.  recently collect a multi-modal video ads understanding dataset, which involves scene boundary detection and multi-modal scene classification. However, scene boundary detection is typically based on the pre-extracted shots and the evaluation of scene segmentation is shot-level instead of frame-level. The TV series and talk shows have also been used for shot boundary detection, where BBC Planet Earth Documentary series  and RAI  are two commonly used datasets consists of tens of videos having length from half an hour to one hour. ClipShots 2 enhances the conventional shot boundary detection datasets by collecting diverse videos from various media platforms, e.g., YouTube and Weibo, and it is one of the most challenging large-scale shot boundary detection datasets. The shot transitions in short videos, are quite different from that of movies as shown in Fig. 1 Right and Table 1, and it is extremely necessary that a short video dataset is collected to advance the development of short video shot boundary detection. The only short video dataset publicly available so far, to our best knowledge, is the SVD dataset 5; yet that is developed for a completely different task for near-duplicate video retrieval. The accuracy of shot boundary detection has been improved, leveraging the aforementioned high quality datasets and deep learning. Before the deep learning era, PySceneDetect  is a popular shot boundary detection library, which relies on conventional features, e.g., changes between frames in the HSV color space. Recent progresses on video boundary detection can be divided into two categories, scene boundary detection and shot boundary detection. Rao et al. 6 propose a local-to-global scene segmentation framework integrating multi-modal information across clip, segment, and movie. Chen et al. [ref]6 further propose a shot contrastive self-supervised learning 4 to learn a shot representation that maximizes the similarity between nearby shots compared to randomly selected shots, then apply the learned shot representation for scene boundary detection. The scene boundary detection highly depends on the accurate shot boundary detection. DeepSBD 1 predicts a likelihood of transitions in a clip of 16 frames by the C3D network 4. DSM 2 utilizes a cascade framework to accelerate the speed of shot boundary detection. Gygli 0 constructs a fast shot boundary detection without any post-processing. TransNet 1 uses dilated convolution blocks 8 and achieves comparable accuracy as DeepSBD without post-processing. TransNetV2 0 surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches with advanced components, e.g., skip connection 2, batch normalization 4, kernel factorization 7, frame similarities as features and multiple classification heads. Leveraging the progress of 3D ConvNets 5, Transformers 5 and neural architecture search , AutoShot automatically identifies the optimal shot boundary detection architecture from the designed search space, which achieves better accuracy than previous methods on the collected SHOT, ClipShots, BBC and RAI datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: scene boundary detection, where videos are split into several semantically independent clips.
