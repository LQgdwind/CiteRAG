      "content": "Paper Title: Schema-learning and rebinding as mechanisms of in-context learning and emergence\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDataset:\nThe GINC dataset, introduced in  to study ICL, is generated from a uniform mixture of five factorial HMMs . Each factorial HMM is referred to as a “concept”. A document is created by concatenating independent sentence samples from a concept.\nThe in-context test prompts have a number of examples varying from n=0𝑛0n=0 to n=64𝑛64n=64: each example can be of lengths k∈{3,5,8,10}𝑘35810k\\in\\{3,5,8,10\\}, with 250025002500 prompts for each setting (k,n)𝑘𝑛(k,n).\nEach prompt uniformly selects a concept, samples n−1𝑛1n-1 examples x:k(1),…,x:k(n−1)subscriptsuperscript𝑥1:absent𝑘…subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑛1:absent𝑘x^{(1)}_{:k},\\ldots,x^{(n-1)}_{:k} of length k𝑘k, and one example x:k−1(n)subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑛:absent𝑘1x^{(n)}_{:k-1} of length k−1𝑘1k-1. The in-context task is to infer the most likely last token of the last example, i.e., argmaxxk−1(n)p​(xk−1(n)|x:k(1),…,x:k(n−1),x:k−1(n))subscriptargmaxsuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑘1𝑛𝑝conditionalsuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑘1𝑛subscriptsuperscript𝑥1:absent𝑘…subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑛1:absent𝑘subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑛:absent𝑘1\\operatorname*{argmax}_{x_{k-1}^{(n)}}p\\left(x_{k-1}^{(n)}|x^{(1)}_{:k},\\ldots,x^{(n-1)}_{:k},x^{(n)}_{:k-1}\\right).\nSince the vocabulary is shared among different latent concepts, observations in GINC are aliased like in natural language, and solving the task requires the model to disambiguate the aliased observations to correctly infer the latent concepts. Training:\nWe train a single CSCG with 505050 clones on the GINC dataset for 100100100 full-batch EM iterations using a pseudocount [ref]6 of ϵ=10−2italic-ϵsuperscript102\\epsilon={10}^{-2}. Given a test prompt, CSCG infers the most likely hidden sequence for that prompt, then predicts the next most likely observation. Results: CSCG learns different latent sub-networks corresponding to the five latent concepts in the GINC dataset ( Fig. 3A), and inference on a supplied prompt retrieves the correct latent sub-network (Fig. 3C). Increasing the prompt length improves the localization of the sub-network and the particular states within the sub-network. Figure  3C visualizes the decoded latent state distribution for an example prompt in the zero-shot setting (n=0𝑛0n=0). The decoding starts out uncertain, and improves as the prompt gets longer. This localization (on the graph) results in effective schema retrieval, and hence accurate prompt completion.\nFigure  3B[left] reports the in-context accuracy—defined as the average ratio of correct predictions—for each (k,n)𝑘𝑛(k,n) pair of the GINC test set.\nCSCG in-context accuracy matches the patterns exhibited by LSTMs and transformers in , while slightly improving their performance.\nFig. 3B also shows that a CSCG with larger capacity, i.e. with 505050 clones per token, better separates the latent concepts and significantly outperforms a CSCG with only 101010 clones per token. Fig. 9[left] in Appendix C displays the CSCG in-context confidence: for larger contexts, CSCG is better at disambiguating aliasing and the averaged predictions probabilities are higher. Finally, Fig. 9[right] shows that similarly to the transformer and LSTM in , CSCG fails at ICL when test prompts are sampled from concepts unseen during training. The GINC results match the context-based retrieval argument in Section 3.1: ICL in this setting is the retrieval of a shared latent concept between the prompt and the model. By using the long-range coherence of concepts in the training documents, the model learns to separate concepts into different latent representations. Despite the train and prompt distribution mismatch , CSCG succeeds at prompt completion because the representation allows transitive mixing.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: the aliased observations to correctly infer the latent concepts.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
