      "content": "Paper Title: Proof-of-Learning is Currently More Broken Than You Think\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecall that in Section 4.1, we analyzed one of the fundamental assumptions for the PoL protocol: reproducibility of gradient updates. We proved the existence of optimal per-step verification thresholds, but due to the noise encountered while performing the computations, it remains an open problem as to how to construct the optimal verification strategy. Prior work by Zhang et al. , discussed in Section 2.2, has implicitly exploited the vulnerability of static thresholds in verification to create spoofs (i.e., they did not point out this vulnerability). However, their attack is computationally costly, requiring at least (43⋅niter+1)⋅k⋅⋅43subscript𝑛iter1𝑘(43\\cdot n_{\\text{iter}}+1)\\cdot k forward passes (FPs) for every update in the proof, where nitersubscript𝑛itern_{\\text{iter}} is the number of iterations for optimizing the adversarial example (more details are in Appendix B). Furthermore, it is not guaranteed to converge, so Zhang et al.  had to assume that the adversary is able to manipulate PoL hyperparameters such as the checkpointing interval (see Section 2.3).333We reproduced their results and found it does not work\nwhen the checkpointing interval (k𝑘k) differs from the ones picked in  (e.g., k=10𝑘10k=10 for CIFAR-100). In this subsection, we will introduce a new attack that targets the same vulnerability: the infinitesimal update attack. Our new attack is more efficient and is guaranteed to succeed without assuming control of the PoL hyperparameters. Infinitesimal update attack. Let us re-establishour notation. Let gt=Wt+k−Wtsubscript𝑔𝑡subscript𝑊𝑡𝑘subscript𝑊𝑡g_{t}=W_{t+k}-W_{t} be the update in the honest proof, and g^t=W^t+k−W^tsubscript^𝑔𝑡subscript^𝑊𝑡𝑘subscript^𝑊𝑡\\hat{g}_{t}=\\hat{W}_{t+k}-\\hat{W}_{t} the update in the adversary’s spoof. Let gt′=Wt+k′−Wtsubscriptsuperscript𝑔′𝑡subscriptsuperscript𝑊′𝑡𝑘subscript𝑊𝑡g^{\\prime}_{t}=W^{\\prime}_{t+k}-W_{t} and g^t′=W^t+k′−W^tsubscriptsuperscript^𝑔′𝑡subscriptsuperscript^𝑊′𝑡𝑘subscript^𝑊𝑡\\hat{g}^{\\prime}_{t}=\\hat{W}^{\\prime}_{t+k}-\\hat{W}_{t} denote the corresponding reproduced updates by the verifier. At a high level, the static threshold vulnerability can be exploited by small-magnitude update, as shown in Figure 3. To demonstrate this, we propose a strategy that (a) requires near-zero computational cost; (b) is guaranteed to yield updates of near-zero magnitude; and (c) is hard for the verifier to detect. The idea is simple: to obtain an update of near-zero magnitude, one can either generate a near-zero gradient, or one can use an infinitesimal learning rate. Formally, the strategy is as follows: Generate model weights W^ksubscript^𝑊𝑘\\hat{W}_{k}, W^2​ksubscript^𝑊2𝑘\\hat{W}_{2k} between W^0subscript^𝑊0\\hat{W}_{0} and the victim model WTsubscript𝑊𝑇W_{T} such that, d​(W^i⋅k,W^(i+1)⋅k)≪δmuch-less-than𝑑subscript^𝑊⋅𝑖𝑘subscript^𝑊⋅𝑖1𝑘𝛿d(\\hat{W}_{i\\cdot k},\\hat{W}_{(i+1)\\cdot k})\\ll\\delta. As an exemplar approach, we utilize linear interpolation to achieve this. The learning rate η𝜂\\eta is set to a small value (i.e., η→0→𝜂0\\eta\\rightarrow 0) such that the update is always smaller than δk𝛿𝑘\\frac{\\delta}{k} irrespective of the gradient value. All other information logged, including the data, can be random values. It is clear that the cost of infinitesimal update attack is low since no training is required. The only cost comes from linear interpolation in step 1, which requires one floating point operation for every model parameter per model update. This amount is upper-bounded by the computation needed for 1 FP, and is much less than the aforementioned cost of Attack 2 by Zhang et al. . Moreover, this attack is hard for the verifier (with the static threshold) to detect as it is always possible to create a much smaller update compared to δ𝛿\\delta. If the verifier decreases δ𝛿\\delta to detect such updates, valid updates may also be discarded, resulting in a high false negative rate. Note that detecting linear interpolation is not sufficient either because it is not the only way to generate models: any strategy such that d​(W^i⋅k,W^(i+1)⋅k)≪δmuch-less-than𝑑subscript^𝑊⋅𝑖𝑘subscript^𝑊⋅𝑖1𝑘𝛿d(\\hat{W}_{i\\cdot k},\\hat{W}_{(i+1)\\cdot k})\\ll\\delta ∀ifor-all𝑖\\forall i will be similarly effective. Evaluation & Results: We evaluated our infinitesimal updates strategy against the original PoL framework with the same experimental setup (described at the beginning of this section) and the same parameters as Jia et al. [ref]2. We assume the most powerful verifier: verifying all updates. It can be seen in Figure LABEL:subfig:infinitesimal and LABEL:subfig:infinitesimal_cifar100 that our proposed strategy is able to achieve a normalized reproduction error ‖εrepr‖normsubscript𝜀repr||\\varepsilon_{\\text{repr}}|| significantly smaller than δ𝛿\\delta, and can thus pass verification. We re-implement and reproduce Attack 2 by Zhang et al.  (refer to Figure LABEL:subfig:zhang and LABEL:subfig:zhang_cifar100) as a baseline to understand the effectiveness of our approach. It is observed that our attack always outperforms that of Zhang et al. . This observation is true even when we later utilized code from the repository of Zhang et al. .\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: We evaluated our infinitesimal updates strategy against the original PoL framework with the same experimental setup (described at the beginning of this section) and the same parameters as Jia et al. [ref]2.
