      "content": "Paper Title: HYGENE: A Diffusion-based Hypergraph Generation Method\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHypergraphs are higher-order extensions of graphs.\nThey comprise a set of nodes, also called vertices, and a set of hyperedges.\nUnlike regular graphs, where edges connect only two nodes, hyperedges can connect any number of nodes.\nThese structures have demonstrated their ability to capture more complex relationships than graphs and have been applied in various domains  [ref]2.\nFor instance, hypergraphs have been applied in drug discovery [ref]3, modeling contagion spread , and electronics   .\nBesides, they have also proven useful in recommender systems , molecular biology  0, and urban planning 1.\nThe versatility of hypergraphs in representing multi-way relationships makes them a powerful tool across these diverse fields; consequently, hypergraph generation (the ability to sample from specific hypergraph distributions) holds significant promise. Despite its wide applicability, research in hypergraph generation has primarily focused on algorithmic approaches, aiming to develop methodologies that produce hypergraphs with specific, predefined structural properties 2 3.\nIn contrast, the exploration of hypergraph generation using deep learning models remains largely understudied.\nThis gap represents a significant opportunity to advance this field since deep learning approaches may capture complex patterns and generate more realistic and diverse hypergraphs.\nSuch methods could enhance the modeling of intricate relationships beyond the scope of traditional graph structures. In contrast to hypergraph generation, deep learning-based graph generation has been extensively studied 4.\nLearning-based graph generation can be broadly categorized into two approaches: one-shot approaches that generate the entire graph simultaneously 5 6, and iterative models that generate the graphs incrementally, predicting edges for each new node 7 8.\nWhile graph generation techniques have shown promise, their adaptation to hypergraphs remains challenging.\nThe variable size of hyperedges and their higher-order relationships increase the difficulty of the task, making direct application of graph methods non-trivial.\nFigure 1 shows that naïvely generating the incidence matrix using classical image generation architectures is not sufficient either, as it lacks the correct understanding of the underlying data structure. By leveraging the spectral equivalence between a hypergraph and two carefully chosen representations (the clique and star expansions), we generalize the work by 9 for hypergraph generation.\nTheir method is based on an iterative local expansion scheme, where graph generation is performed hierarchically, first building the global structure before refining the details.\nThis process is seen as the inverse of a coarsening operation, which involves the reduction of a graph while preserving its relevant properties.\nFor hypergraphs, the variable size of hyperedges increases the complexity of the problem, as they are exponentially more numerous than classical edges because every non-empty set of nodes is a possible hyperedge.\nIn order to mitigate this, we introduce an iterative expansion and refinement process for Hyperedge Generation (HYGENE), rather than predicting all possible hyperedges at once.\nWe train a denoising diffusion model  using this framework, and validate our method on four synthetic and three real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in replicating important structural properties.\nAt a glance, our main contributions are the following: To the best of our knowledge, we introduce the first deep learning-based method for generating hypergraphs sampled from specific distributions (Sec. 3.2). We generalize important concepts in the graph domain to hypergraph generation, like hypergraph coarsening and diffusion (Sec. 3.3, Sec. 3.4, Sec. 3.5). We provide rigorous theoretical justifications for our technical choices. We validate HYGENE on four synthetic and three real-world datasets, showcasing its ability to capture and reproduce subtle structural properties of hypergraphs (Sec. 4).\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: two nodes, hyperedges can connect any number of nodes.\nThese structures have demonstrated their ability to capture more complex relationships than graphs and have been applied in various domains  [ref]2.\nFor instance, hypergraphs have been applied in drug discovery [ref]3, modeling contagion spread , and electronics   .\nBesides, they have also proven useful in recommender systems , molecular\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
