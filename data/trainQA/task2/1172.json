      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient falsification approach for autonomous vehicle validation using a parameter optimisation technique based on Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA guarantee of safety is essential for the acceptance of autonomous vehicles, and society is unlikely to tolerate fatalities caused by failures of an intelligent system. The validation of Highly Automated Vehicles (HAV) is an essential step before deploying them on public roads. Traditionally, the test matrix approach is considered to be one of the primary validation methods to evaluate the system. It uses test scenarios extracted from a crash database [ref]4. A typical example based on this approach is the Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) test protocol developed as part of the Euro New Car Assessment Program (Euro-NCAP). Even though this approach is repeatable and reliable, these scenarios are fixed and predefined[ref]4. As a result, the system is likely to perform well in these tests, but this is not a true test of real-world performance as the real-world is non-deterministic and challenging[ref]4. One possible method to evaluate the system is to use a Naturalistic Field Operation Test (N-FOT) that involves driving on public roads to validate the system statistically. The motivation of this distance-based validation is to uncover rare events that are not captured during the validation process. Such occurrences are by definition rare events and are not uniformly distributed, meaning that the AV will need to drive a large number of miles[ref]7. In addition to that, the collected evidence will be undermined with every software change [ref]7.\nThus, this approach is considered to be time-consuming and expensive. Recently, the research community and automotive industry have broadly started to support scenario-based testing as an alternative strategy [ref]4012. This has been considered as a feasible solution to realising HAVs on public roads. Most of the driving data collected in N-FOT is considered non-critical, thus not meaningful for validation purposes. The scenario-based approach for validating HAVs is promising as it focuses on critical scenarios without the need of driving millions of kilometres . Scenario-based testing has been implemented in real-world and simulated settings. The detailed definition of the scenario and different classifications are explained in the methodology section.\nThe aim of this paper is to find critical, concrete scenarios as defined by this classification. We use the term ‘scenario’ to refer to a concrete scenario, and the terms ‘test case’, ‘challenging scenario‘, ‘challenging case‘,‘critical scenario’ and ‘edge cases’ are all used interchangeably. From previous works [ref]401 in the area of scenario-based testing, the frequency distributions of parameters that are considered influential are extracted from N-FOT. From these, concrete scenarios are generated based on observation drawn from the distribution. The system gets evaluated by running a Monte-Carlo simulation using generated test cases and importance sampling using the test cases that were identified as critical in the Monte-Carlo run. In our work, we considered that scenarios are constructed using different parameters [ref]40 and that critical scenarios are considered as a combination of parameter values found to maximise the safety risks. The parameter optimisation technique is defined as the approach to find the the combination of parameter values that create challenging cases using an optimisation engine. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a innovative falsification method by considering the generation of challenging scenarios as a parameter optimisation problem. The falsification approach focuses on finding challenging cases in order to evaluate the System Under Test(SUT)3. The whole approach is considered as an optimisation guided falsification method, and the optimisation process looks to find the critical scenario that has the maximum return. The proposed method is based on Neural Architecture Search(NAS)4, which is the search for the best neural network architecture for a specific task. The NAS architecture is based on a policy gradient reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. We have designed a reward function for the RL process in such a way that a positive reward for the combination of considered parameter values that can create challenging scenarios. In this experiment, we use the well established Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) metric5, the euclidean distance of pedestrian w.r.t ego-vehicle, and whether there was a collision as the metrics. The pedestrian crossing illustrated in figure 1 is used as the experimental context in the simulator to test our method. We can summarise the contribution of this papers as follows: We propose an innovative falsification method to search for critical scenarios using a parameter optimisation technique based on NAS as the optimisation engine. The learning of the optimisation engine searches for critical scenarios that has maximize the measure of safety risk. Due to the RL strategy, the proposed method has better performance in searching for challenging scenarios compared to random search as used in many recent scenarios-based testing approaches[ref]4016, or brute-force search. We demonstrate that the proposed approach is scalable as it can handle high-dimension problems compared to our previous work7. Also, it can incorporate more parameters in a computationally efficient manner as opposed to the prior work. The proposed method can create more realistic scenarios compared to similar work in this area78.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: them on public roads.
