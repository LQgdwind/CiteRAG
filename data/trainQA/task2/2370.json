      "content": "Paper Title: Hierarchical Neural Dynamic Policies\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nArchitectures: In the imitation learning case, we use the same image and network sizes as Levine et¬†al. , everything up to the NDP layer, which is from Bahl et¬†al. . Our global policies have 3 convolutional layers, of kernel sizes 7, 5 and 5, have 64, 32 and 32 output channels. After the convolutional layers, just like Levine et¬†al. , we employ a spacial softmax, where we take the expected features in the x and y axis and concatenate them. We then get a flattened vector of size 64. Similarly to Levine et¬†al.  we concatenate the robot joint positions and 3D end-effector pose into these features. We then have 2 fully connected layers of hidden size 40. We use ReLU non-linearities. For the rest of the network, we use the exact architecture from Bahl et¬†al. . Our local NDPs are similar to those provided by Bahl et¬†al. , but use a smaller hidden layer size (40 instead of 100). All images are 224 x 224, except for the ones used in the writing which are 100 x 100. Pretraining: For the scooping and pouring tasks, we collect data from about 150-200 goal locations. We move the object to these 250 locations, and then randomly sample 5 actions for the robot take. We use all the layers of the global policy described above, save for the last layer, which we replace with a layer of output 3. We train the network to output the pose of the object. This is a similar pre-training procedure as Levine et¬†al. . Training: In our imitation learning experiments, we use the parameter Œ±ùõº\\alpha to weigh the contributions of the original demonstrations to the IL loss function, in the outer loop. For writing we use Œ±=1ùõº1\\alpha=1, for pour and scooping we use Œ±=0.5ùõº0.5\\alpha=0.5. In the inner loop, we use Œ≤=0.1ùõΩ0.1\\beta=0.1 to weigh the contributions of the outputs of the global policy. Training such networks takes about 2 hours. RL: For the RL experiments, we use the same exact architectures and hyperparameters for every method as Bahl et¬†al. , which is built on the PPO¬† implementation from Kostrikov . All networks use hidden layer sizes   with tanh non linearities. We use the code from Zhu et¬†al.  for VICES 2 and from Whitney et¬†al. [ref]43 for DYN-E. We present the hyperparameters we used for the RL experiments in Table¬†II.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: , which is built on the PPO¬† implementation from Kostrikov .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
