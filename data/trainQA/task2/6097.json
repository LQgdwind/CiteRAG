      "content": "Paper Title: Smaller3d: Smaller Models for 3D Semantic Segmentation Using Minkowski Engine and Knowledge Distillation Methods\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKnowledge Distillation in 3D is not developed as a holistic approach, as there are different evaluation benchmarks, such as Scannet V2 (Dai, A., Chang, A. X., Savva, M., Halber, M., Funkhouser, T., & Nießner, M. (2017)), S3DIS(Armeni, I., Sener, O., Zamir, A. R., Jiang, H., Brilakis, I., Fischer, M., & Savarese, S. (2016))3, SemanticKITTI(Behley, J., Garbade, M., Milioto, A., Quenzel, J., Behnke, S., Stachniss, C., & Gall, J. (2019)), nuScenes(Caesar, H., Bankiti, V., Lang, A. H., Vora, S., Liong, V. E., Xu, Q., … & Beijbom, O. (2020)). One of the main features of current Knowledge Distillation methods in 3D is that they focus mainly on either object detection or lidar Semantic Segmentation. Those methods mainly focus on outside datasets for self-driving applications. On the other hand, the Scannet V2 dataset focuses on indoor scans. Those differences are crucial, as they make a difference when using some specific methods (e.g. Augmentation techniques like Mix3D[ref]4). Lidar Semantic Segmentation is an area that has seen significant advancement in 3D knowledge distillation. One of the examples is Liu, Y., Chen, K., Liu, C., Qin, Z., Luo, Z., & Wang, J. (2019), that suggest simultaneously distilling knowledge at three different levels: pairwise similarity, pixel-level, and holistic. Moreover, it is well introduced in the \"Point-to-voxel knowledge distillation for lidar semantic segmentation\" paper by\nHou, Y., Zhu, X., Ma, Y., Loy, C. C., & Li, Y. (2022) , which suggests using point-to-voxel knowledge distillation approach for lidar Semantic Segmentation. Also, there is an approach which is targeting object detection tasks in 3D but is also able to transfer its knowledge to 3D Semantic Segmentation. This is a paper suggested by Yang, J., Shi, S., Ding, R., Wang, Z., & Qi, X. (2022), which suggests its 3D KD pipeline, but their suggested pipeline performance is not good on the Semantic Segmentation tasks. There is a wide range of Attention-based Knowledge Distillation algorithms, that are working on Semantic Segmentation tasks too. However, those architectural solutions are not relevant to sparse matrixes. Such examples of methods are (Jiang, F., Gao, H., Qiu, S., Zhang, H., Wan, R., & Pu, J. (2023)),(ao, Y., Zhang, Y., Yin, Z., Luo, J., Ouyang, W., & Huang, X. (2022))[ref]30. Their evaluation tasks are done mainly by comparing with their relative Transformers or very earlier methods. Thus, those methods are irrelevant to Convolutional networks and are not promising in this case. One of the recent studies was 3D Point Cloud Pre-training with Knowledge Distillation from 2D Images done by ao, Y., Zhang, Y., Yin, Z., Luo, J., Ouyang, W., & Huang, X. (2022)[ref]30. They try to use 2D image knowledge and distill information to the student model, which has a different architecture and is designed for 3D Point cloud reconstruction. They evaluate the performance of the model with mainly object detection on Scannet V2 and also Semantic Segmentation in 3D as well. They compare their results with similar task models, and their results are around  46% mIoU which is 20% off from Mix3D[ref]4 or Minkowski engine methods.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: On the other hand, the Scannet V2 dataset focuses on indoor scans.
