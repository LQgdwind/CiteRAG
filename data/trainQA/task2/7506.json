The question is whether there is a solution to ℐℐ\\mathcal{I}, i.e., an assignment of elements from A𝐴A to the variables such that for all\nℂℂ\\mathbbm{C} we have f​((x1,…,xk))∈R𝑓subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑘𝑅f((x_{1},\\ldots,x_{k}))\\in R. The formalism CSP​(𝔹)CSP𝔹\\textrm{CSP}(\\mathbb{B}) for a finite 𝔹𝔹\\mathbb{B} captures a number of natural problems. Indeed, if 𝔹𝔹\\mathbb{B} is a graph ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}, then we cope with an ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}-coloring problem , in particular with a k𝑘k-colouring problem. If the domain of 𝔹𝔹\\mathbb{B}\nhas only two elements, then CSP​(𝔹)CSP𝔹\\textrm{CSP}(\\mathbb{B}) is a Boolean satisfiability problem such as k𝑘k-SAT or NAE-SAT . There are also structures 𝔹𝔹\\mathbb{B} whose CSP​(𝔹)CSP𝔹\\textrm{CSP}(\\mathbb{B}) comes down to solving a system of equations over a finite field .\nThe variety of natural NP-complete and polynomially solvable problems\nwithin this formalism raises a number of natural questions including: Is there a single simple technique of showing NP-completness for CSP​(𝔹)CSP𝔹\\textrm{CSP}(\\mathbb{B})? Is there a single algorithm that solves all polynomially tractable CSP​(𝔹)CSP𝔹\\textrm{CSP}(\\mathbb{B})? Are all CSP​(𝔹)CSP𝔹\\textrm{CSP}(\\mathbb{B}) either NP-complete or polynomially tractable? The conjecture that the answer to the last question is affirmative was known as the Feder-Vardi Conjecture . However, there was no reasonable progress until the questions were reformulated in the language of universal algebra . The immediate consequence of that step was the conditional answer to the first question and a clear algebraic conjecture concerning the second question known as the algebraic tractability conjecture saying that a CSP​(𝔹)CSP𝔹\\textrm{CSP}(\\mathbb{B}) is in PTIME if and only if the algebra corresponding to 𝔹𝔹\\mathbb{B} lies in a Taylor variety. Actually, this conjecture has a number of equivalent formulations and the one of which we care the most in this paper says that CSP​(𝔹)CSP𝔹\\textrm{CSP}(\\mathbb{B}) is in PTIME iff 𝔹𝔹\\mathbb{B} is preserved by a Siggers operation .\nThe algebraic tractability conjecture has been confirmed independently by\nBulatov  and Zhuk , and hence all the three questions for finite structures 𝔹𝔹\\mathbb{B}\nhave been answered. Although the Bulatov-Zhuk theorem is a great achievement,\nthere are still some natural computational problems that can be expressed as CSP​(𝔹)CSP𝔹\\textrm{CSP}(\\mathbb{B}) but only when 𝔹𝔹\\mathbb{B} is infinite. A perfect example is DIGRAPH-ACYCLICITY equivalent to CSP​(ℚ;<)CSPℚ\\textrm{CSP}(\\mathbb{Q};<) where (ℚ;<)ℚ(\\mathbb{Q};<)\nis the natural linear order over the rational numbers. That structure as well as all\nstructures with a first-order definition in (first-order reducts of) (ℚ;<)ℚ(\\mathbb{Q};<) a.k.a. temporal languages give rise to constraint satisfaction problems of interest in a field of artificial intelligence known as spatial and temporal reasoning, see  for more examples of natural computational problems expressible as infinite-domain CSPs. Furthermore, the structure (ℚ;<)ℚ(\\mathbb{Q};<) is a natural representative of a class of (countably infinite) finitely bounded homogeneous structures. A τ𝜏\\tau-structure 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} is homogeneous if every local isomorphism between finite substructures of 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} may be extended to an automorphism of 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A}. It is finitely bounded if there exists a finite set of finite τ𝜏\\tau-structures\nℱ𝔸subscriptℱ𝔸\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathbb{A}} such that a finite structure 𝔻𝔻\\mathbb{D} embeds into 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} if and only if there is no ℂ∈ℱ𝔸ℂsubscriptℱ𝔸\\mathbb{C}\\in\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathbb{A}}\nthat embeds into 𝔻𝔻\\mathbb{D}.\nThe following conjecture resembling the finite algebraic tractability conjecture has been formulated for cores of finite-signature first-order reducts of finitely-bounded homogeneous structures .\n(All definitions that are omitted in the introductionn are provided carefully in preliminaries.) (Infinite-domain Algebraic Tractability Conjecture)\n\nLet 𝔹𝔹\\mathbb{B} be the core of a finite-signature first-order reduct of a finitely bounded homogeneous structure.\nIf 𝔹𝔹\\mathbb{B} is preserved by a pseudo-Siggers operation, i.e., a 6-ary operation s𝑠s and some unary operations α,β𝛼𝛽\\alpha,\\beta\nsuch that for all x,y,z𝑥𝑦𝑧x,y,z in domain, then CSP​(𝔸)CSP𝔸\\textrm{CSP}(\\mathbb{A}) is solvable in polynomial time. The above conjecture has been confirmed in a number of special cases, in particular for temporal languages  or\nfirst-order reducts of homogeneous graphs  .\nIt is also known that if there is no pseudo-Siggers operation preserving 𝔹𝔹\\mathbb{B}, then CSP​(𝔹)CSP𝔹\\textrm{CSP}(\\mathbb{B}) is NP-complete [bodirsky_pinsker_pongrácz_2021].\nA simple strategy to attack the above conjecture in full generality would be to provide a polynomial-time algorithm for an infinite-domain CSP​(𝔹)CSP𝔹\\textrm{CSP}(\\mathbb{B})\nwhich works only under the assumption that 𝔹𝔹\\mathbb{B} is preserved by a pseudo-Siggers operation.\nThe reality is, however, that we do not have such algorithms even for operations satisfying much stronger algebraic conditions of that type, called pseudo minor conditions or quasi minor conditions. The situation is very different for finite-domain\nCSPs where a number of algebraic conditions implying tractability has been identified prior to the dichotomy proofs, see  and [ref]4 for the two most important results of this kind.\nThe notable exception in an infinite-domain CSP regime is a quasi near-unanimity operation f𝑓f satisfying: for all x,y𝑥𝑦x,y in domain, but even in this case the proof \nis a straightforward adaptation of the one for finite structures . The next natural algebraic condition to consider for infinite structures are chains of quasi directed Jónsson\noperations. A sequence (D1,…,Dn)subscript𝐷1…subscript𝐷𝑛(D_{1},\\ldots,D_{n}) of ternary operations on a set A𝐴A is\ncalled a chain of quasi directed Jónsson operations if for all x,y,z∈A𝑥𝑦𝑧𝐴x,y,z\\in A all of the following hold: Every relational structure preserved by a quasi near-unanimity operation is also preserved by a chain of quasi directed Jónsson operations, see  for a simple proof.\nAnother, even weaker system of operations worth considering is a chain of quasi Jónsson operations. A finite-signature finite structure is preserved by a near-unanimity operation iff by a chain of directed Jónsson operations  iff by a chain of Jónsson operations. One should however keep in mind that a direct proof of tractability for Jónsson operations  came prior to the equivalence of the three-conditions. The main result of this paper, explained in details in the following subsection, states that every first-order expansion 𝔹𝔹\\mathbb{B} of a finitely-bounded homogeneous symmetric binary core (all relations are binary and symmetric)\nwhose age has free amalgamation and which is preserved by a chain of directed quasi Jónsson operations has bounded width, and in consequence CSP​(𝔹)CSP𝔹\\textrm{CSP}(\\mathbb{B}) may be solved in polynomial time by establishing local consistency. Examples of symmetric binary structures are the countably infinite homogeneous universal graph\na.k.a. the random graph 𝔾𝔾\\mathbb{G} or the countably infinite\nhomogeneous universal graph omitting cliques of size k𝑘k, for any k≥3𝑘3k\\geq 3, known as the k𝑘k-th Henson graph ℍksubscriptℍ𝑘\\mathbb{H}_{k}. The complexity classifications of CSPs for first-order reducts of these structures have been obtained in  and respectively in .\nThe authors of the latter paper actually suggest that a reasonable intermediate step towards confirming Conjecture 1 might be to prove it for first-order reducts of structures whose age has free amalgamation. Here we make a major step towards completing that goal, which is much more challenging, even for symmetric binary cores, than the classification for homogeneous graphs presented in that paper. Homogeneous graphs have been classified in  — there are only few types of these. There are no such results for symmetric binary cores whose age has free amalgamation except for some partial results over multi-graphs with three kinds of edges 6.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: minor conditions.
