      "content": "Paper Title: Geometric Graph Representation with Learnable Graph Structure and Adaptive AU Constraint for Micro-Expression Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe experiments are carried out on SAMM  and CASME II  datasets. In CASME II, all participants are from one ethnicity, and it contains 255 video samples from 26 subjects with seven ME categories based on self-report.\nIn SAMM, participants are from 13 ethnicities, and it includes 159 samples from 32 subjects with eight ME categories based on self-report.\nThe video samples in both datasets are collected by the high-speed cameras at 200 fps. Both datasets contain AU annotations that can form seven ME categories based on AU annotations;\n In this work, the ME categories based on AU annotations are adopted to evaluate the proposed method. Like in previous MER tasks¬† , due to the long-tail distribution of the samples, we deleted the categories with less than ten samples. As a result, six and four ME categories based on AU annotations (Type ‚ë† in Table Ib) are selected from CASME II and SAMM, respectively. Furthermore, the existing methods used not only AU annotations, but also self-reported annotations. Thus, for a more comprehensive and fair comparison with SOTA methods, we report the results of the proposed method on other two types of category setting: under five ME categories based on AU annotations (Type ‚ë° in Table Ib) following  and under five ME categories based on self-report (Type ‚ë¢ in Table Ib) following [ref]7. As in the existing works, e.g. [ref]42 , the onset, apex and offset frames can be found based on labels on databases, and their detection belongs to another task    in ME analysis.\nFurthermore, the facial muscle movements are magnified by a learning-based motion magnification method¬†, such that the movements of landmarks are more obvious. The amplification factor is set to three following the setup in . In addition, the Dlib [ref]46 package is employed to detect facial landmarks.\nTo study the effectiveness of landmarks, the basic graph-based models with landmark are compared to the basic CNN model with image: ResNet18. All graph-based models used in our experiment have four layers, and the feature dimensions in different layers are shown in Table II. Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta is set to [0.1,1] with interval 0.1 in parameter evaluation and is fixed to 1 in the ablation study. To explore a better way to fuse the features from the two-stream inputs, GTS-GN is implemented in four types according to in which layer the two streams are merged, namely GTS-GN (layer nùëõn), n=1,2,3,4ùëõ1234n=1,2,3,4. The filter size of TCN is three to cover the node features in three frames. Two evaluation matrices under leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) strategy are adopted to evaluate different methods, including accuracy(ACC) and F1-score. Data augmentation is important for the training of the deep models.\nIn our experiments, ResNet18 take the magnified apex frame or three key frames as inputs. For ResNet-based models, data augment is performed by rotation, adding noise, cropping randomly, horizontal flip and color jitter.\nAlso, the detected landmarks for the face regions with different sizes have a small difference. Thus, we regard this difference as noise to augment data. The aligned frames are cropped to get the frames of different sizes. Then, we detect the landmarks of these frames with different sizes to obtain more data. All models are trained on a single GTX 1050 GPU with Pytorch  deep learning framework.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: other two types of category setting: under five ME categories based on AU annotations (Type ‚ë° in Table Ib) following  and under five ME categories based on self-report (Type ‚ë¢ in Table Ib) following [ref]7. As in the existing works, e.g. [ref]42 , the onset, apex and offset frames can be found based on labels on databases, and their detection belongs to another task    in ME\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
