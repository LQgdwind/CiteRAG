      "content": "Paper Title: Estimating the persistent homology of ℝ^𝑛-valued functions using function-geometric multifiltrations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe module H∗​(ℛδ→2​δ​(ℱ|P))subscript𝐻superscriptℛ→𝛿2𝛿evaluated-atℱ𝑃H_{*}(\\mathcal{R}^{\\delta\\to 2\\delta}(\\mathcal{F}|_{P})) has a single parameter 𝒙∈ℝ𝒙ℝ\\bm{x}\\in\\mathbb{R} when n=1𝑛1n=1, so, as in , we can use the variant of the standard persistence algorithm proposed in  for images, kernels or cokernels, to compute its barcode. This barcode coincides with the minimal rank decomposition of H∗​(ℛδ→2​δ​(ℱ|P))subscript𝐻superscriptℛ→𝛿2𝛿evaluated-atℱ𝑃H_{*}(\\mathcal{R}^{\\delta\\to 2\\delta}(\\mathcal{F}|_{P})), and the graded Betti numbers of H∗​(ℛδ→2​δ​(ℱ|P))subscript𝐻superscriptℛ→𝛿2𝛿evaluated-atℱ𝑃H_{*}(\\mathcal{R}^{\\delta\\to 2\\delta}(\\mathcal{F}|_{P})) can easily be derived from it. The algorithm of  for images has the same worst-case time complexity as the standard persistence algorithm, that is: O​(N3)𝑂superscript𝑁3O(N^{3}) where N𝑁N is the number of simplices in the larger filtration ℛ2​δ​(ℱ|P)superscriptℛ2𝛿evaluated-atℱ𝑃\\mathcal{R}^{2\\delta}(\\mathcal{F}|_{P}). It was recently optimized so as to be competitive with the best implementations of 111-parameter persistence for single filtrations on practical inputs [ref]6. This means that one can expect observed running times in O​(N)𝑂𝑁O(N) on reasonable input data. The module H∗​(ℛ∙⁣→2⁣∙​(ℱ|P))subscript𝐻superscriptℛ∙→absent2∙evaluated-atℱ𝑃H_{*}(\\mathcal{R}^{\\bullet\\to 2\\bullet}(\\mathcal{F}|_{P})) has two parameters (δ,𝒙)∈ℝ≥0×ℝ𝛿𝒙subscriptℝabsent0ℝ(\\delta,\\bm{x})\\in\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}\\times\\mathbb{R} when n=1𝑛1n=1. Its rank invariant can be computed using a straightforward adaptation of the approach222More precisely, the simplified approach using standard persistence and not zigzag persistence. of [ref]9, which computes 1-dimensional barcodes along monotonic paths with at most 222 turning points using the standard persistence algorithm. The adaptation consists merely in replacing the calls to the standard persistence algorithm with calls to its variant for images . The minimal rank decomposition is then computed via the Möbius inversion formula for the rank invariant [ref]9 . The total worst-case time complexity is in O​(N5)𝑂superscript𝑁5O(N^{5}) where N𝑁N is the number of simplices in the larger filtration ℛ2⁣∙​(ℱ|P)superscriptℛ2∙evaluated-atℱ𝑃\\mathcal{R}^{2\\bullet}(\\mathcal{F}|_{P}). As already mentioned, the observed practical running time is expected to be rather in O​(N3)𝑂superscript𝑁3O(N^{3}). The bigraded Betti numbers of H∗​(ℛ∙⁣→2⁣∙​(ℱ|P))subscript𝐻superscriptℛ∙→absent2∙evaluated-atℱ𝑃H_{*}(\\mathcal{R}^{\\bullet\\to 2\\bullet}(\\mathcal{F}|_{P})) can be obtained from the module’s minimal projective resolution. The latter can be computed using general computer algebra systems like GAP , however this kind of software generally does not scale up well with the size of the filtrations. Efficient specialized algorithms exist for computing minimal projective presentations of persistence modules that are induced in homology from simplicial bifiltrations [ref]34 : from these presentations and their kernels one obtains the minimal projective resolutions, however only for single bifiltrations. To our knowledge, there currently is no variant of these methods for nested pairs of bifiltrations, so computing the bigraded Betti numbers of H∗​(ℛ∙⁣→2⁣∙​(ℱ|P))subscript𝐻superscriptℛ∙→absent2∙evaluated-atℱ𝑃H_{*}(\\mathcal{R}^{\\bullet\\to 2\\bullet}(\\mathcal{F}|_{P})) in a scalable manner in this setting is still open.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: It was recently optimized so as to be competitive with the best implementations of 111-parameter persistence for single filtrations on practical inputs [ref]6.
