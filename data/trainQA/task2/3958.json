      "content": "Paper Title: Hyperspectral Image Classification With Contrastive Graph Convolutional Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nContrastive learning is one of self-supervised representation learning methods, which aims to obtain discriminative feature representation by leveraging the similarities and dissimilarities between examples [ref]26. It has gained increasing attention due to the promising results in various fields such as computer vision [ref]7  and natural language processing [ref]27. SimCLR [ref]7 is a well-known contrastive learning method and is anchored on a Siamese network that learns latent representations via maximizing agreement between differently augmented views of the same example. Similar to SimCLR, MoCo  utilized InfoNCE loss  and stored negative examples by using a memory bank rather than a large mini-batch size. The marriage of contrastive learning and GCN has also been observed in recent years. For example, Petar et al.  proposed to learn graph representations in an unsupervised manner via classifying local-global pairs and negative-sampled counterparts. Besides, to address the challenge of data heterogeneity in graphs, You et al.  developed graph contrastive learning with four types of graph data augmentations, each of which imposed certain prior on graph data and encoded the extent and pattern. Apart from this work, Peng et al.  introduced a novel concept of graphical mutual information for graph representation learning, which generalized the idea of conventional mutual information computations from vector space to the graph domain. Nevertheless, these methods are not applicable to HSI classification studied in this paper, as they fail to consider the spatial and spectral cues which are naturally and uniquely inherited by HSIs. Besides, they also ignore the class information carried by a handful of labeled data for HSI classification. Consequently, in this paper, we devise a new contrastive GCN which is able to acquire discriminative representations for accurate HSI classification.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: learning is one of self-supervised representation learning methods, which aims to obtain discriminative feature representation by leveraging the similarities and dissimilarities between examples [ref]26.
