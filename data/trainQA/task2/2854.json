      "content": "Paper Title: Ego4D: Around the World in 3,000 Hours of Egocentric Video\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis section details the Hands and Objects benchmark including definitions, annotations, baseline models and results. In a video of a human operating and manipulating an object with their hands, there may exist an object state change, i.e., the point where the state of the objects being operated changes, either temporarily or permanently in a way that cannot be easily reversed.\nExamples of temporary state change include turning on a machine, while examples of permanent state changes include physical changes such as chopping a tomato into pieces and chemical changes such as mixing water and cement powder together to create a new composition of cement.\nSome examples are illustrated in Figure 37. The concept of an object state change has been explored only in a limited manner in the video literature [ref]69   and the characterization of state changes has depended on many brittle vision-based component technologies, making it difficult to analyze state changes at scale. Fortunately, in the last decade we have seen tremendous advances in computer vision algorithms for understanding both objects and hands. As a result, we believe that now it is time to investigate the idea of characterizing state changes at scale and in depth. Why is recognizing the impact of agents on objects and environments so critical?\nWe believe that understanding, recognizing, and replicating object state changes are an essential aspect of creating artificial intelligence (AI) systems.\nWhile current AI systems have the ability to replicate certain types of human actions such as assembling furniture  or cutting tomatoes , most systems do not possess a general understanding of how the environment and the objects can be transformed as a result of interaction. Understanding the impact of interactions on objects and the environment is an important aspect of reasoning and can help AI systems perform more advanced tasks. For example, understanding the impact of interactions on the environment can help AI systems relate multiple ways to achieve the same change, discover efficient methods for achieving goal states, recognize the completion/incompletion of goals  , recover from failure, and learn from mistakes. In egocentric videos specifically, the object state changes offer rich and important information that are related to many other problems. For example, the object undergoing state change in an egocentric video can imply human-centric information such as human activity and intention. Moreover, the state change of an object shown provides cues about human-specific affordance and actionable information of an object or tool, which cannot be easily inferred from static images. Additionally, a joint understanding of human hands and the objects undergoing state change can benefit applications that require rich human demonstrations, such as robotic manipulation. Defining Object State Changes: This benchmark focuses on identifying and localizing the state change of an object in an egocentric video. Specifically, a object state change can be represented by the three aspects in the video: temporal, spatial, and semantic. An object state change can be represented by three distinct temporal points in the video.\n(1) Point-of-no-return: The point-of-no-return (PNR) is the frame IpnrsubscriptùêºpnrI_{\\text{pnr}} in a video that identifies the beginning of an object state change that cannot be easily reversed.\n(2) Pre-condition: The pre-condition is defined as some frame IpresubscriptùêºpreI_{\\text{pre}} that marks a moment prior to the state-change in which the related objects were visible within the field of view of the camera.\n(3) Post-condition: The post-condition is some frame IpostsubscriptùêºpostI_{\\text{post}} at which the completion of the state change is visible after the point-of-no-return.\nThese three frames mark the distinct temporal stages of the object state change: before and after the change, respectively. This proposal matches the Rubicon Boundaries proposed in¬†[ref]160. An object state change can be represented by the bounding box of the object at the PNR, pre-condition and post-condition, along with any tools involved in performing the state change. Tools offer extended capabilities of the actor‚Äôs hand, such as using an electric saw to cut a piece of wood in half. These bounding boxes represent the spatial dimensions of hands, tools and the objects undergoing the state change. We represent an object state change through the human action (verb), the object identity (noun) and the type of state change applied. The same state change can be performed on different objects using different tools. For example, cutting a piece of wood with electric saw and cutting a piece of paper with scissors are different interactions with different objects and different tools but they both result in the same object state change of being cut. Existing approaches for modeling object states and/or their changes can be categorized into two research lines. The first deals with collections of images.\nA representative dataset for this purpose is the MIT States dataset . By considering object states as object attributes (e.g. burnt, sliced), this line of work studies attribute-object composition, e.g. composition with context¬†, modeling attributes as operators¬†, and an architecture for compositional reasoning¬†. The second research line deals with video and views an action as a state transformation over time.\nOne direction is the discovery of object states and/or manipulating actions, e.g. in egocentric¬†[ref]69  and instructional videos¬†. Fathi et al. [ref]69 explore object state detection in video using a weakly supervised approach.\nAnother direction is the modeling of state transitions.\nZhou et al.¬† study temporal transformations of a single object state in time-lapse videos.\nWang et al.¬† propose to model state transformations in a high-level feature space with Siamese networks.\nDoughty et al.¬† leverage natural language and treat adverbs as modifiers for state transformations.\nIn terms of applications, Chang et al.¬† show state transformations can be utilized for procedure planning. Several video datasets have been proposed for human hand action recognition. The Yale human grasping dataset¬† focuses on human grasping behavior and consists of 27.7 hours of annotated videos. The Something-Something dataset  consists of 220,847 short videos annotated with 174 categories of general hand-object interactions.\nThe Jester dataset  provides 148,092 short videos in 27 hand gesture types.\nWang et al.  construct a synthetic video dataset of human-object interaction through rendering hand and object CAD models. The recent Human Hands dataset¬† annotates 100K single frames from web-based videos, focusing on hand interactions and the offset between the hand and the interacting object during interaction. Several egocentric video datasets capture daily living activities by people¬†     .\nIn the Activities of Daily Living Dataset (ADL), subjects wear chest-mounted cameras and perform unscripted activities at home, with a total of 10 hours of video from 20 participants; the target task is activity recognition¬†. In the UT-Egocentric dataset (UT-Ego), subjects wear a head-mounted camera and perform long unscripted activities inside and outside of the home, with a total of 17 hours from 4 subjects (4-5 hours of continuous capture for each person); the target task is video summarization¬†. The UT Egocentric Engagement (UT EE) dataset consists of 14 hours of head-mounted camera video captured in public spaces like museums, malls, and grocery stores, and is annotated for moments of engagement by the camera wearer with the environment. In the EGTEA+ dataset, 32 subjects wearing head-mounted cameras in a single kitchen environment capture 28 hours of video; the task is to recognize 44 meal preparation activities¬†.\nThe EPIC-KITCHENS dataset consists of 100 hours of kitchen activities recorded in 45 unique environments, with a total of 89,977 different object interactions across 97 verb and 330 noun classes; the task is to recognize objects and activities and anticipate interactions in the next moment of video¬†. The Charades-Ego dataset consists of 34 hours of video from 71 participants, with both first- and third-person paired instances labeled for 156 actions¬†. We now define the three tasks that comprise the Hands and Objects benchmark. The three tasks correspond to the three aspects of object state changes described above, namely, the temporal, spatial and semantic aspects of a state change. The goal of Point-of-no-return (PNR) Temporal Localization is to predict IpnrsubscriptùêºpnrI_{\\text{pnr}}. One possible formulation is to view this problem as a per-frame classification problem, predicting the Point-of-no-return frame within a short video clip. The performance is evaluated only on the videos that contain object state change, and is measured by the absolute temporal error of IpnrsubscriptùêºpnrI_{\\text{pnr}} prediction in seconds. The PNR was first discussed by P.¬†Gollwitzer in his well-cited handbook of behavior¬†9. Specifically, the book proposes the Rubicon Model of Action Phases, focusing on hand-object interaction. Action phases are delimited by three transition points: initiation of prior motion, PNR, and goal achievement. This was later experimentally assessed by our previous work¬†[ref]160, where PNR annotations\nwere acquired for three egocentric datasets, demonstrating\nincreased accuracy of annotations (see Fig.¬†10 in¬†[ref]160) and improved robustness in training models (see Sec.¬†5 in¬†[ref]160). Below, we find PNR closely aligns with the narration timestamps that we independently collected, suggesting PNR is a natural time point for human understanding (and thus narration) of the interaction. We define a State Change Object as the object that is manipulated by a person and undergoes a change in its state. The goal of this task is to predict the 2D bounding boxes of the State Change Object in Point-of-no-return frame IpnrsubscriptùêºpnrI_{\\text{pnr}} given three frames: Pre-condition IpresubscriptùêºpreI_{\\text{pre}}, Point-of-no-return IpnrsubscriptùêºpnrI_{\\text{pnr}}, and Post-condition IpostsubscriptùêºpostI_{\\text{post}}.\nWe expect that a good solution to this task would incorporate the visual information before and after state change to detect the State Change Object.\nThe detection performance is evaluated on the bounding boxes estimated in the Point-of-no-return frame IpnrsubscriptùêºpnrI_{\\text{pnr}} and measured by Average Precision (AP). The task of Object State Change Classification classifies a short video clip to a state change type. With NùëÅN object state change types defined, object state change classification is essentially an (N+1)ùëÅ1(N+1)-way classification problem, where the one additional category is ‚Äúwithout state change.‚Äù Object State Change Classification is evaluated by classification accuracy. Next we describe our data selection procedure and annotation pipeline, and we present the analysis of the data for the object state change benchmark. We begin by describing our procedure for selecting the subset of data to annotate for this benchmark. We start with a large pool of videos annotated with high-level scenario labels (e.g., gardening, cooking, landscaping, etc.) and narrations. We assess each scenario on the scale of 0 to 3 based on how likely it is to contain hand-object interactions (e.g., 0 for ‚Äúwatching tv‚Äù, 3 for ‚Äúcarpentery‚Äù, etc.). We then sample data to annotate following the resulting scenario distribution. Given a scenario and a target number of hours, we sample clips randomly in a hierarchical fashion: we first sample a participant, then a video, and finally a 5 minute clip from the video. If the video is shorter than 5 min we take the whole video. For each scenario, we balance the data across universities to maximize geographic diversity.\nThe resulting scenario and university distributions are shown in Figure¬†38. In total, our dataset has 120 hours representing 53 scenarios, 7 universities, and 406 participants. We annotate hand-object interactions corresponding to each narration within the selected 5 minute clips. We use the taxonomy from Section¬†D.3 for semantic verb and noun labeling. The annotation pipeline consists of three sequential stages: critical frame labeling, pre-period labeling, and post-period labeling. Critical frames. Given a narration, we create an 8 second video snippet centered at the narration time point and present it to the annotators. We ask the annotators to first read the narration and select a corresponding verb from the taxonomy. The annotators can then play the video back and forth to select three critical frames in time: PNR, PRE, and POST. We ask the annotators to start with the PNR frame that identifies the beginning of the state change. This frame is less ambiguous and helps provide the context for the interaction. We then ask the annotators to label a frame prior to the state change (PRE) and a frame after the completion of the state change (POST). Note that the PRE and POST frames are not uniquely defined. We let the annotators pick any, as long as the relevant objects are fully visible within the field of view of the camera. Pre period. Next, we label bounding boxes for the hands, tools, and objects, as well as the category names for the tools and objects. We do this in two steps. First we label the frames in the pre period, starting at PNR and going backward to the pre frame. The video frames are reversed and the annotators can play the video. We find that it is easier to start from the PNR frame since the hands and objects are clearly visible. To speed up hand box labeling, we initialize the hand boxes with a pre-trained object detector¬† and ask the annotators to correct these. Post period. Finally, we ask the annotators to label spatial annotations and categories for the post frame. As before, we first present the annotators with the PNR frame. Note that in this case the PNR frame is already labeled which helps identify the hands and objects to label in the post frame. Finally, we present the analysis of our annotations. Critical frames. In Figure¬†40 we show the temporal distribution of critical frames within the 8 second hand-object interaction snippets. First, we observe that the PNR frame distribution is centered around the middle of the 8 second snippet. Interestingly, this closely aligns with the narration point (4s mark). Next, we see that most of the pre and post frames come shortly before and after the PNR frame, respectively, highlighting the quick nature of these state changes, and thus the challenge in this benchmark. We also notice two additional modes for pre and post frames that come at the start and the end of the 8s interval, respectively. These correspond to long repetitive actions that start before or continue past the video snippet (e.g., knitting). Hands and objects. Our benchmark contains a large number of hands and objects annotated with bounding boxes. In total, we have ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim825K bounding boxes, including ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim245K for left hand, ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim260K for right hand, ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim280K for objects, and ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim40K for tools. In Figure¬†41 and Figure¬†42, we show the distributions of box sizes and locations, respectively. We observe that our data contains hands and objects at a variety of sizes and locations. Actions. One of the features of our benchmark is the diversity of interactions. We focus on low-level atomic actions rather than high-level actions. We show the distribution of verbs (Figure¬†39, left) and nouns (Figure¬†39, right). We see that we have a large number of verbs corresponding to common manipulation actions (e.g., put, take) and a natural long tail. The object distribution follows the same general trend. We note that our objects are common daily objects that are not typically present in object detection datasets (e.g., 442 out of our 478 object categories cover categories beyond the 80 COCO¬† categories). We present the implementation of several baseline methods for the Object State Change Classification and PNR Temporal Localization tasks.\nAmong the implemented baseline models, in general there are one or two types of output network heads: a classification head for the video clip used for state change classification, and/or a per-frame classification head for temporal localization.\nOne can choose to train two models separately, or use the same backbone model but two network output heads and train the joint model with a multi-task loss function.\nThe following baseline methods includes both types of model designs: I3D ResNet-50. \nWe use I3D  with ResNet-50  as backbone architecture of the model for both the Object State Change Classification and the PNR Temporal Localization tasks.\nThe ResNet backbone is followed by two network output heads: a state change classification head and a PNR temporal localization head.\nThe state change classification head is produced by global average pooling on the entire spatiotemporal feature tensor followed by a classification layer.\nThe PNR temporal localization head is produced by per-frame average pooling followed by a classification layer.\nThe overall training loss of the model is the combination of the loss of two heads which are both cross-entropy loss for classification. Boundary Matching Network (BMN). \nWe use BMN  as a baseline for the PNR Temporal Localization task.\nBMN is a temporal segment detection method based on confidence prediction of dense temporal segment proposals.\nWe view the start of the video as the start of the temporal segment and Point-of-no-return IpnrsubscriptùêºpnrI_{\\textrm{pnr}} as the end of the temporal segment, so we can convert the problem of localizing Point-of-no-return IpnrsubscriptùêºpnrI_{\\textrm{pnr}} to the problem of detecting the temporal segment.\nIn our implementation, BMN uses ResNet as the backbone model. Furthermore, BMN is only used for the PNR temporal localization task. SlowFast + Perceiver. \nWe implement a baseline model whose architecture consists of SlowFast  and Perceiver  for both object state change classification and PNR temporal localization.\nSlowFast acts as the video deep feature extractor.\nThe features are then passed to a Perceiver model.\nSimilar to the previous BMN model, the SlowFast + Perciever model is only trained for temporal localization task.\nThe training loss of the model is the cross-entropy loss for per-frame classification. Bi-directional LSTM. \nWe implement a Bi-directional LSTM model  for both the object state change classification and PNR temporal localization. We first pass individual frames to a ResNet model  to extract deep features. The sequence of per-frame features is then passed to the Bi-directional LSTM as input, with the output sent to both the per-frame classification head and the whole-sequence classification head. The overall training loss of the model is the combination of the loss of two heads which are both cross-entropy loss for classification. For the object state change classification tasks, in the current version we focus on the two-way classification problem of whether there is a object state change in the egocentric video.\nIn Table 14, we illustrate the number of positive video clips that contains an object state change and the number of negative video clips that do not contain object state change in the train/val/test splits. In all three splits, the positive and negative clips are balanced in number. Besides the above learnable baselines, for object state change classification, we also present the result of the naive baseline of always predicting the positive category as the prediction.\nFor the PNR temporal localization task, we additionally present the result of the naive baseline of always selecting the center frame of the trimmed video as the PNR frame, given the possible centre bias of the data. The results for object state change classification task are illustrated in Table 15.\nThe naive baseline of always positive prediction yields state change classification accuracy of close to 50%.\nAll the learnable baselines outperform the naive baseline and achieve accuracy of more than 60% while Bi-directional LSTM baseline achieves the best performance. This shows that the learnable baselines can learn meaningful information about object state change, though there is clearly still space for improvement.\nOne challenge in this task is that there is very large variance in term of the types of object state changes and objects contained in the videos. The results for the PNR temporal localization task are illustrated in Table 16.\nThe naive baseline of always predicting the center frame yields a temporal localization error of around 1.1 seconds.\nOther learnable baselines can achieve better temporal localization error of around 0.85 seconds or less which shows the baseline models can learn meaningful information for temporal localization of object state change. Note that the SlowFast + Perceiver model achieves the best temporal localization performance of 0.425 seconds on validation set and 0.489 seconds on test set, which highlights the necessity of using attention-based mechanism to model the change of object state. One challenge for this task is that in some actions, e.g., cutting a piece of paper with scissors, the state change of an object does not necessarily cause significant change of visual appearance and therefore it is difficult to localize the PNR. While we expect that new methods developed for the tasks of state change object detection will utilize all three input frames (pre, PNR, post), in this initial stage of the benchmark, we only evaluate single-frame detection baselines, where only the PNR frame IpnrsubscriptùêºpnrI_{\\text{pnr}} is used as input. We limited our input as many methods for object detection are primarily designed to work with a single image. We present the implementation of several baseline methods for the state change object detection task. In general, the baseline models for the task can be categorized into two types: (1) directly detecting the bounding box of the state change object including Faster-RCNN , CenterNet , and DETR , and (2) detecting hand bounding boxes first then predict state change object bounding boxes given the hands such as the 100DOH model [ref]199. Specifically, the baseline methods are the following: Faster-RCNN   is a two-stage anchor-based 2D object detector on a single RGB image. In its classification head, the state change object is the only positive category. We train Faster-RCNN on our benchmark and use it to directly detect the bounding boxes of state change objects in PNR frames. CenterNet   is another object detection method on a single RGB image. It estimates object keypoints to find object center points and regresses all other object properties, such as size, 3D location, and orientation.\nWe train CenterNet to directly detect the bounding boxes of state change objects. DETR  is an object detection model on a single RGB image based on Transformer . It views object detection as a direct set prediction problem and uses a transformer encoder-decoder architecture to produce a set of object predictions including bounding box information as well as other information such as category. We train DETR to directly detect the bounding boxes of state change objects. 100DOH Model [ref]199  first detects the bounding boxes of the human hand and objects as well as the relational vectors that links from each hand bounding box center to an object bounding box center. The final prediction of the objects are decided as the object predictions that satisfies the both the predictions of hand and relational vectors.\nWe used the 100DOH model pre-trained on 100DOH dataset [ref]199 to first detect hand bounding boxes and then predict state change object bounding boxes given the hands. We show the number of state change objects and hand bounding boxes contained in our dataset in Table 17.\nThe results of single-frame State Change Object Detection are illustrated in Table 18. All baselines struggle in detecting the State Change Objects with only one frame as input as an AP of 8-14%. There are several challenges in this task. First, the bounding box sizes of state change objects have large variance. For example, the size of state change objects can be as large as half of image in the action of ‚Äúpainting the wall‚Äù and as small as a few pixels in the action of ‚Äúigniting the match.‚Äù Second, when only using one frame as input, the detection models did not consider the change of object appearance across different frames. As future work, we hope the researchers will investigate using models that take multiple frames as input and perhaps develop frameworks that incorporate tracking or association. This novel benchmark explores three aspects of objects undergoing state changes as a result of hand manipulation: the when (i.e. temporal localization of state change), where¬†(i.e., spatial localization of objects that undergo change) and what¬†(i.e., semantic notion of action and object transformation). As a first step, we have explored these independently using readily available localization and classification methods. However, approaches that aim to tackle this challenge should focus on jointly understanding the manipulation with its spatio-temporal impact on objects as these are transformed. For example, knowing an object is being split should offer a strong prior to the PNR localisation and detect two or more bounding boxes after the point-of-no-return. Such methods that tackle the dependencies between the tasks are yet to be developed. We hope this benchmark will spur innovative approaches that bridge the gap between action perception and the impact of actions on objects and environments.
