      "content": "Paper Title: G-CoS: GNN-Accelerator Co-Search Towards Both Better Accuracy and Efficiency\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph neural networks (GNNs) [ref]1 have gained an increased popularity recently as they demonstrated the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in various graph-based learning tasks, including node classification [ref]1,\ngraph classification [ref]2, and recommendation systems . However, GNNs often suffer from prohibitive inference cost, limiting their potential to handle large-scale real-world graph applications.\nFor example, a 2-layer GNN model requires 19G FLOPs (FLOPs: floating point operations) to inference the Reddit graph [ref]4, which requires a latency of 2.942.942.94E+555 milliseconds when being executed on an Intel Xeon E5-2680 CPU platform , i.e., its required FLOPs and latency are 2×\\times and 5000×\\times of a 50-layer convolutional neural network (CNN), ResNet-50 . The giant computational cost of GNN inference results from three aspects.\nFirst, graphs are often very large as exacerbated by their intertwined complex neighbor connections, e.g., a total of 232,965 nodes in the Reddit graph with each node having about 50 neighbors .\nSecond, real-world graphs tend to follow the power-law distribution and therefore have highly irregular adjacent matrices, resulting in prohibitive inefficiencies in both data processing and movements.\nThird, the dimension of GNNs’ node feature vectors can be very high, e.g., each node in the CiteSeer graph has 3703 features. To tackle GNNs’ prohibitive inference cost, various efficient GNN inference techniques have been developed. On the algorithm level, several pioneering GNN compression techniques have been developed. For instance, two concurrent GNN pruning works   aim to sparsify the connections in GNNs’ graph adjacent matrices; and [ref]4 for the first time shows the feasibility of adopting 8-bit integer arithmetic for GNN inference without sacrificing the accuracy. Another paralleled trend is to search for efficient GNN architectures  . On the hardware level, various GNN accelerators have been proposed. For example, HyGCN  proposes hybrid execution patterns of GNNs for leveraging their intra-vertex and inter-vertex parallelisms to handle the irregularity in the aggregation phase and reusability in the combination phase, respectively;\nLater, AWB-GCN  identifies the workload imbalance problem in the aggregation phase, and proposes auto-tuning workload balancing techniques, achieving an average speedup of 7.4×\\times over HyGCN. On the development tool level, pioneering works have attempted to characterize the design space of dataflows and micro-architectures for GNN accelerators , and develop an automated framework to generate GNN accelerators . Despite the promising performance of existing efficient GNN inference solutions, their achievable efficiency is still not sufficient for enabling extensive GNN inference applications due to GNNs’ extremely dynamic and irregular data accesses and thus excessive acceleration cost. Motivated by the great success of algorithm-accelerator co-exploration works for CNN accelerations       , this work targets to co-optimize both the GNN structures and their accelerators with boosted development speed, and makes the following contributions: We propose G-CoS, a GNN and accelerator co-search framework that can automatically search for the matched GNN structures and accelerators to maximize both task accuracy and acceleration efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, G-CoS is the first co-search framework for GNNs and their accelerators. G-CoS integrates two enabling components: (1) a generic GNN accelerator search space which is applicable to various GNN structures and (2) a one-shot GNN and accelerator co-search algorithm that enables simultaneous and efficient search for optimal GNN structures and their matched accelerators, both of which can facilitate the algorithmic exploration of efficient GNN solutions. Extensive hardware/algorithm experiments and ablation studies validate G-CoS’s effectiveness and advantage: G-CoS generated networks/accelerators consistently outperform SOTA GNNs/accelerators, while requiring only a few hours for the end-to-end search, (e.g., 4 GPU hours for the Cora dataset).\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Graph neural networks (GNNs) [ref]1 have gained an increased popularity recently as they demonstrated the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in various graph-based learning tasks, including node classification [ref]1,\ngraph\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
