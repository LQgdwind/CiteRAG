      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Depth Completion with Calibrated Backprojection Layers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare our method against recent unsupervised depth completion methods on the KITTI test set in Table¬†2 (results taken from online leaderboard). Compared to the baseline , we improve by an average of 13.7% across metrics and by as much as 17.1% in iRMSE while reducing model size by 29%. Overall, we beat the best performing method [ref]45 by an average of 8.8% and up to 10.6% on the iMAE metric with a 11.5% reduction in model size. We note that top methods  [ref]45 use additional synthetic data for training; whereas, we do not. Also, for inference, our method takes 16ms per image (62 FPS), which is 2.75√ó2.75\\times faster than 333The reported run time of  on the KITTI leaderboard did not include their scaffolding step; whereas, the number in Table¬†2 accounts for it. and 2√ó2\\times faster than the state of the art [ref]45. We note that our method significantly improves the iMAE and iRMSE metrics, to the point where we are comparable to some of the supervised methods for close range performance. For example, our iMAE score is ranked 5th across all methods (see Table¬†9, 10 in Supp. Mat.). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first work in unsupervised depth completion to demonstrate comparable performance to supervised methods. To show the improvements from our contributions, we show head-to-head qualitative comparisons against the baseline  in Fig.¬†4. Our method performs better in regions where depth discontinuities occur in image topology i.e. street sign and wall (left panel, highlighted in green) and far regions of the road (right panel, in orange). This is in part thanks to our calibrated backprojection (KB) layer which goes counter to the current trend of learning everything with generic architectures, including what we already know about basic Euclidean geometry. Our KB layers imposes strong inductive bias by incorporating the camera intrinsic calibration matrix to yield 3D positional encoding that lifts the image representation into scene topology ‚Äì this delineates points where in 2D image topology are ‚Äúclose‚Äù, but can be far in 3D scene topology. Table¬†3 shows an ablation study on the KITTI validation set. As mentioned in Sec.¬†2.2, our sparse-to-dense module (S2D) provides dense depth representation which in turn enables dense 3D topology in our calibrated backprojection (KB) layers. Hence, removing it (‚Äúw/o S2D) will hurt performance because it results in a sparse 3D positional encoding. Nonetheless, sparse geometry is still helpful as we outperform  in rows 1, 2. Similarly, replacing our KB (‚Äúw/o KB layers‚Äù) with VGG blocks used by  also hurts performance as the model now lacks 3D spatial position. We show in rows 5 and 6 that one cannot simply substitute S2D with scaffolding  or SPP [ref]18 [ref]45. In Fig.¬†9, we perform a sensitivity study of our model to calibration on the KITTI validation set. To this end, we altered the calibration by increasing or decreasing focal length (fùëìf) and/or principal point (cx,cysubscriptùëêùë•subscriptùëêùë¶c_{x},c_{y}) and feed it as input. Our model is robust to changes up to ‚âà10%absentpercent10\\approx 10\\%; after which, performance degrades. While changes in cx,cysubscriptùëêùë•subscriptùëêùë¶c_{x},c_{y} have minor effects (which is scene-dependent), we observe a sharp decrease in performance when we decrease fùëìf by 20 to 25%. This is because, geometrically, decreasing fùëìf backprojects points to a larger field of view, distorting surfaces and sending points of the same surface far from each other. Increasing fùëìf conversely ‚Äúpacks‚Äù them tighter; this is okay for small increases, but for larger values, points will get ‚Äúsquashed together‚Äù ‚Äì thus hurting performance. Also, to quantify the effect of sparsity, we provide a sensitivity study on various density levels in Supp. Mat.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: Compared to the baseline , we improve by an average of 13.7% across metrics and by as much as 17.1% in iRMSE while reducing model size by 29%.
