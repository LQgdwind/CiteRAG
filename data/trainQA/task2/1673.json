      "content": "Paper Title: SUM: A Benchmark Dataset of Semantic Urban Meshes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnderstanding the urban environment from 3D data (e.g.¬†point clouds and 3D meshes) is a long-standing goal in photogrammetry and computer vision¬†[ref]1 .\nThe fast recent developments in data acquisition technologies and processing pipelines have allowed us to collect a great number of datasets on our 3D urban environments.\nProminent examples are Google Earth¬†, texture meshes covering entire cities (e.g.¬†Helsinki¬†), or point clouds covering entire countries (e.g., the Netherlands AHN¬†).\nThese datasets have attracted interest because of their potential in several applications, for instance, urban planning¬† , positioning and navigation¬†  , spatial analysis¬†, environmental analysis¬†, and urban fluid simulation¬†[ref]13. To effectively understand the urban phenomena behind the data, a large amount of ground truth is typically required, especially when applying supervised learning-based techniques, such as a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).\nThe recent development of machine learning (especially deep learning) techniques has demonstrated promising performance in semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds¬†[ref]14  .\nCompared to point clouds, a surface representation (in the form of a 3D mesh, often with textures, see Figure¬†1 and 2 for an example) of the urban scene has multiple advantages: easy to acquire, compact storage, accurate, and with well-defined topological structures. This means that 3D meshes have the potential to serve as input for scene understanding.\nAs a consequence, there is an urgent demand for large-scale urban mesh datasets that can be used as ground truth for both training and evaluating the 3D semantic segmentation workflows. In this paper, we aim to establish a benchmark dataset of large-scale urban meshes reconstructed from aerial oblique images.\nTo achieve this goal, we propose a semi-automatic mesh annotation framework that includes two components: (1) an automatic process to generate intermediate labels from the raw 3D mesh; (2) manual semantic refinement of those labels.\nFor the intermediate label generation step, we have developed a semantic mesh segmentation method that classifies each triangle into a pre-defined object class.\nThis semantic initialization allows us to achieve an overall accuracy of 93.0% in the classification of the triangle faces in our dataset, saving significant efforts for manually labelling.\nThen, in the semantic refinement step, a mesh annotation tool (which we have developed) is used to refine the semantic labels of the pre-labelled data (at the triangle and segment levels). We have used our proposed framework to generate a semantic-rich urban mesh dataset consisting of 19 million triangles and covering about 4 k‚Äãm2ùëòsuperscriptùëö2km^{2} with six object classes commonly found in an urban environment: terrain, high-vegetation, building, water, vehicle, and boat (Figure¬†2 shows an example from our dataset).\nWith our semi-automatic annotation framework, generating the ground truth took only about 400 hours; we estimate that manually labelling the triangles would have taken more than 1000 hours.\nThe contributions of our work are: a semantic-rich urban mesh dataset of six classes of common urban objects with texture information; a semi-automatic mesh annotation framework consisting of two parts: a pipeline for semantic mesh segmentation and\nan annotation tool for semantic refinement; a comprehensive evaluation and comparison of the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods on the new dataset. The benchmark dataset is freely available, and the semantic mesh segmentation methods and the annotation software for 3D meshes are released as open-source111https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/meshannotation/.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Understanding the urban environment from 3D data (e.g.¬†point clouds and 3D meshes) is a long-standing goal in photogrammetry and computer vision¬†[ref]1 .\nThe fast recent developments in data acquisition technologies and processing pipelines have allowed us to collect a great number of datasets on our 3D urban environments.\nProminent examples\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
