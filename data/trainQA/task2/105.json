      "content": "Paper Title: A Large-Scale Evaluation of Shape-Aware Neighborhood Weights and Neighborhood Sizes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile the approaches presented above are based on heuristics, some works try to deduce an optimal k𝑘k for the k𝑘k nearest neighborhoods based on error functions.\nFor instance, the authors of  work in the context of the Moving Least Squares (MLS) framework (see  6 7 ) for function approximation.\nThe authors perform an extensive error analysis to quantify the approximation error both independent and depending on the given data.\nFinally, they obtain an error functional.\nThis is then evaluated for different neighborhood sizes k𝑘k.\nThe neighborhood 𝒩ksubscript𝒩𝑘\\mathcal{N}_{k} yielding the smallest error is finally chosen to be used in the actual MLS approximation. In contrast, the authors of  deduce an error bound on the normal estimation obtained from different neighborhood sizes.\nUtilizing this error functional, they obtain the best suited neighborhood size for normal computation.\nThe work of  heavily depends on the MLS framework in which the error analysis is deduced, while the work of  depends on the framework of normal computation. The authors of  take a more general approach in the context of segmentation of 3D point sets. They also use the concept of combinatorial neighborhoods, going back to results of  0.\nIn order to choose an optimal value for k𝑘k, the authors turn to the covariance matrix, which is symmetric and positive-semi-definite.\nThus, the matrix has three non-negative eigenvalues.\nFollowing an idea of 2, in the work of [ref]26, the authors grow a neighborhood and consider a surface variation as a measure to grow a neighborhood around each point pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i}.\nThe same quantity is used by .\nHowever, the authors of [ref]26 do not grow a neighborhood, but choose a size k𝑘k for it according to a consistent curvature level.\nThe authors of  do not stop at these information, but proceed to consider three more quantities derived from the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix reflecting point set features, see 0 .\nAfterwards, following the concept of entropy by Shannon , they evaluate combinatorial and geometric neighborhood sizes via two error measures (see Section 4 for a detailed discussion).\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: value for k𝑘k, the authors turn to the covariance matrix, which is symmetric and positive-semi-definite.\nThus, the matrix has three non-negative eigenvalues.\nFollowing an idea of 2, in the work of [ref]26, the authors grow a neighborhood and consider a surface variation as a measure to grow a neighborhood around each point pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i}.\nThe same quantity is used by .\nHowever, the authors\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
