      "content": "Paper Title: Many-to-One Knowledge Distillation of Real-Time Epileptic Seizure Detection for Low-Power Wearable Internet of Things Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEpilepsy is amongst the five most common chronic diseases and, according to WHO, it is the most common chronic brain disease affecting more than 50 million people of all ages . Besides suffering an associated stigma and discrimination, epilepsy represents the second neurological cause of years of potential life loss. The most life-threatening effect of seizure attacks is sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) . To reduce the aforementioned effects of such attacks, we need to continuously monitor these patients for life-long periods. With the widespread adoption of Internet of Things (IoT)  in electronic medical care, low-power and easy-to-use IoT devices are growing in popularity. Thus, we can perform long-term everyday patient monitoring  to inform their family members or caregivers in case of emergency situations. The current trend in pathology detection systems are based on deep neural networks (DNNs) , which are capable of classifying large volumes of biomedical data. The ability of these networks to extract high-level and complex patterns from biomedical signals makes them an attractive tool for epilepsy monitoring . The IoT devices typically own limited resources and cannot satisfy the computing requirement of complex DNNs. By addressing the challenges regarding the comfortability, complexity and energy consumption, these systems can perfectly fit the requirements of epileptic seizure detection systems . This can be translated in using simpler and lighter networks, preferably with a smaller number of acquired biosignals, to make them more comfortable and improve their energy efficiency regarding data acquisition and processing. According to literature, monitoring the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal of the patients provides the standard detection accuracy in case of epileptic seizures . However, by simultaneous monitoring other bio-signals, the decision can become more accurate and robust, as each signal can reflect different effects of the seizures [ref]9. In this paper, we first introduce our multi-modal detection IoT system, which uses separate residual neural networks 0 for different biosignals, namely, EEG and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The overhead that comes with this multi-modal bio-signal monitoring is an increase in size of the detection system, as we should use a separate network for each signal. This bigger size results in higher energy consumption 1, which is problematic for IoT wearable systems and for long-term monitoring purposes. Besides, the synchronisation of signals from multiple devices is challenging in real IoT deployments, thus working with one signal has less risks of incorrect annotation. Finally, connecting several wearable devices to the patient increases the stigma especially in the case of EEG, where devices are usually bulky and draw a lot of attention 2. To reduce the abovementioned overheads caused by multi-modal monitoring, we propose to exploit the concept of knowledge distillation 3 in IoT systems. This also helps to leverage the information of both biosignals to keep a satisfying detection quality. Knowledge distillation is a procedure for model compression, in which a small (student) model is trained to match a large pre-trained (teacher) model. In the simplest form of distillation, knowledge is transferred to the distilled model by training it on a transfer set, trying to maximize the cross entropy of the two models. At the same time, the system attempts to maximize the generation of correct labels for the transfer set in the student model 4. Following this concept, as shown in Fig. 1, in this work, we propose a new approach based on knowledge distillation to design high-precision and low-power wearable systems for epileptic seizure detection. Thus, we develop and use a pre-trained multi-model DNN using synchronized EEG and ECG as the teacher and train a single input network using the ECG exclusively as biosignal detection input, while achieving a comparable performance and targeting low-power embedded devices. In the teacher model, which is a complex model with high energy consumption, the patient uses multiple IoT sensors, which are not comfortable and cause stigma. Conversely, the student model contains a much simpler model resulting in less energy consumption and enables more prolonged monitoring with IoT devices, as it requires only the ECG signal. This signal can be acquired using a chest strap, which is comfortable to use and fully removes the social stigma. At the same time, the student model achieves the detection accuracy of the more complex teacher model. To the best of our knowledge, this work is different from the usual knowledge distillation frameworks that have been proposed in the IoT systems context in the sense that other works propose to change the system structure, but the inputs are the same. On the contrary, we are completely omitting the EEG in the student model and only require ECG inputs in our final IoT system design. Thus, the main contributions of our work are as follows: We develop a knowledge distillation-based approach to develop high-precision low-power wearable IoT systems for epileptic seizure detection in real-time using only a single biosignal input. We show a way to create a neural network trained from the knowledge of a multi-modal DNN system relying on both EEG and ECG signals; but only using the ECG signal as input in the detection phase during the use of the IoT system to detect epileptic seizures. As a result, the synchronized EEG signal is only used in the initial (off-line) training phase. This approach results in removing the complexity and power requirements of EEG acquisition to better fit the design constraints of low-power IoT wearable devices. Moreover, we reduce the stigma and inconvenience of synchronising multiple biosignals in real-life IoT system deployments. As initial teacher network for our approach, we design a new multi-modal and multi-channel seizure detection DNN that increases the quality of seizure detection by acquiring information from both EEG and ECG. In this first step, to limit the design complexity and highlight how to target different biosignal inputs, we conceive independent 1-dimensional DNNs for each signal. Then, we use a weighted combination of the results to reach a final decision. Compared with a network using exclusively the ECG signal for training, we show that the proposed multi-modal method increases the sensitivity by 6.12% and specificity by 16.07% when applied to the EPILEPSIAE dataset 5. Our approach increases seizure detection accuracy and reduces false alarms at the same time, in comparison with using only the ECG signal. By using knowledge distillation, we reduce the complexity of the initial teacher DNN system to result in an implementable network for a much lower power IoT wearable device. Our results show the distilled model can be implemented on current IoT wearable platforms. Using an edge AI platform, we show that the required energy capacity is reduced by 37.65%. This energy reduction is obtained while sensitivity and specificity are only reduced by 1.5% and 1.3% in comparison with the initial (and very uncomfortable for the user) multi-modal DNN teacher IoT system. The rest of this article is organized as follows. In Section II, we review previous works on low-power embedded wearable platforms, multi-modal seizure detection and knowledge distillation. In Section III, we present a general overview of our seizure detection systems and the different parts: preprocessing, initial multi-modal network architecture and our knowledge distillation approach targeting low-power IoT wearable systems. Then, Section IV presents our experimental setup and, in Section V, we analyze the computational and energy consumption characteristics of the proposed distilled implementation, and compare it with other similar IoT wearable architectures. Finally, in Section VI, we summarize the main conclusions of this work.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: in case of epileptic seizures .
