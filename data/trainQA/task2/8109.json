      "content": "Paper Title: Detecting Spatial Dependence in Transcriptomics Data using Vectorised Persistence Diagrams\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe use three real transcriptomics datasets for our investigation. First, we analyse spatial data of a mouse olfactory bulb (referred to as MOB, replicate 1) and a breast cancer tumour sample (breast, replicate 1) from St√•hl et¬†al. , standard datasets commonly used to test spatial variability detection methods. Both have been sequenced using 1k spatial transcriptomics arrays, which measure spots on rectangular grids. Each spot has a diameter of 100‚ÄãŒº‚Äãm100ùúáùëö100\\mu m and encompasses 10-100 cells.\nFurther, we study one sample from Kuppe et¬†al.  (sample IZP10), which consists of spatial measurements of spots on a hexagonal grid. This sample has been taken from the heart of a patient that suffered from a heart attack from tissues with necrotic areas. Prior to analysis, peprocessing and quality control of omics data are crucial stpdf for accounting for technical errors as well as filtering out noise. Indeed, normalisation is a key step in spatial omics data analysis as many downstream tasks, including the detection of spatially variable features, rely on adequate preprocessing choices to account for technical effects .\nFollowing best practices  and alternative spatial variability studies [ref]16, we decide on the following pre-processing strategy and\nselect all genes that\nhave a minimum total expression count of 101010, and\nare present in at least 1% of locations.\nFurther, we remove all cells with fewer than 101010 counts. These stpdf are done to avoid analysing cells or gene for which hardly any biological signals have been detected. Finally,\nwe exclude all ribosomal and mitochondrial genes from analysis as these indicate technical artifacts and are not related to the mRNA, i.e.¬†protein-coding genes that are the focus of transcriptomics data analysis .\nFor each real dataset, we then identify the 500500500 most variable genes using seuratv3subscriptseuratv3\\texttt{seurat}_{\\texttt{v3}}\nfor further analysis. That is, we select a set of genes that vary most notably across cells. Our goal will then be to detect whether these genes that differ noticeably between dislocated cells also show distinct spatial patterns. Note that for the simulated data we skip these quality control stpdf as we want to compare all SVG detection methods across all simulated features. Further, as conventionally done in spatial omics data analysis, we decide to pre-process the expression values i.e. count data in the manner best fitting the SVG detection method  . For SpatialDE we apply the normalisation strategy preferred for this method as detailed in Section¬†4.3 .\nFor sepal, we apply the recommended shifted logarithm normalisation by applying the transformation log‚Å°(f+2)ùëì2\\log(f+2) to each feature fùëìf. This transformation is applied to\nstabilize the variance across the dataset to counteract variable sampling effects such as overdispersion and reduce the skewedness of the feature‚Äôs distribution. The pseudo-count of 222 is added to enable the log-transformation also for zero-values counts. To ensure comparability across spatial variability tests, we similarly choose to compute our persistence-based test as well as Moran‚Äôs I from the same log‚Å°(f+2)ùëì2\\log(f+2)-transformed features.\nNote however, that this pre-processing strategy is not the only viable choice and our method can be flexibly applied across varying pre-processing choices [ref]2.\nIn general, given that our persistence-based methods directly scales through each gene‚Äôs expression values, we highly recommend to apply our framework to transformed and normalised features, but we leave the choice of the best data-dependent transformation to further investigation [ref]2.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: the detection of spatially variable features, rely on adequate preprocessing choices to account for technical effects .\nFollowing best practices  and alternative spatial variability studies [ref]16, we decide on the following pre-processing strategy and\nselect all genes that\nhave a minimum total expression count of 101010, and\nare present in at least 1% of locations.\nFurther, we remove\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
