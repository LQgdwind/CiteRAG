      "content": "Paper Title: Class-Level Confidence Based 3D Semi-Supervised Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSemi-Supervised Learning: Semi-supervised learning methods have made a significant progress in recently years     [ref]12  8  8. Many existing SSL methods utilize pseudo-labeling [ref]12 to minimizes the entropy of the predictions on unlabeled data. The performance of pseudo labeling heavily relies on the quality of pseudo-labels. To improve the quality of pseudo-labels, state-of-the-art SSL method FixMatch 5 and many FixMatch-liked methods usually set a fixed high confidence threshold to filter out low-confidence predictions from the strong augmented data. The high-value threshold can improve the quality of pseudo labels but ignores the learning status of each class, which not only engenders the bias toward high learning status classes but leaves a large number of unlabeled data unused. To address this issue, Dash 8 uses cross entropy loss to obtain dynamic threshold for all classes. FlexMatch   substitutes the pre-defined threshold with flexible thresholds based on curriculum learning to consider each class learning status. However, our experiments demonstrate that the FlexMatch does not generalize well in 3D dataset. This is because it is designed for class-balanced datasets, but the 3D dataset is inherently imbalanced. Furthermore, in 3D networks, the prediction confidence of some classes cannot achieve the pre-defined high threshold and make those classes thresholds extremely small. Therefore, the learning status estimation strategy in FlexMatch is not suitable to be applied in 3D SSL tasks. More comparison with FlexMatch can be found in supplemental materials. Class-Imbalanced Semi-Supervised Learning:\nRecently, class imbalanced semi-supervised learning has attracted increasing attention as it more accurately describes the real-world data distribution   . Wei et al  3 found that the raw SSL methods usually have high recall and low precision for head classes and proposed CReST to re-sampling unlabeled data based on the labeled data numbers. Recent state-of-the-art method BiS   deployed two different re-sampling strategies at the same time to decoupled train the model. All of those class-imbalanced SSL methods resample based on data numbers. However, we find that some minority classes may have better performance than majority classes due to their low learning difficulty. Sampling based on data numbers makes the model biased toward those low learning difficulty classes. Due to the page limitation, we add the comparison with state-of-the-art imbalanced SSL methods in supplemental materials. 3D Semi-Supervised Object Classification: Currently, many 3D object classification method have been proposed for 3D understanding 0 1 9 4 7   6 6. Unlike 2D features, a 3D model is complex by nature and thus hard to extract. To better extract 3D features, many works  0 1 2 have been proposed to extract features from 3D point clouds for the 3D classification tasks. However, 3D SSL classification is underexploited. Chen et al.  finds that directly implementing 2D SSL methods like FixMatch 5, S4L 2, and Pseudo label [ref]12 cannot achieve comparable results in 2D and propose to utilize multi-modality information in 3D SSL classification. However, what downgrades those 2D SSL methods’ performance in 3D is left to explore. 3D Semi-Supervised Object Detection: According to the input data formats, current methods for 3D object detection task can be summarized into three different types: 2D projection   4 9, voxel grid  2 7, and point cloud   3 . Although those methods have achieved impressive results, the high-quality 3D ground truths are expensive and time-consuming to collect. Due to the capacity of alleviating the dependency on labeled data, semi-supervised 3D object detection has drawn wide attention from researchers 6 1. However, current 3D SSL detection works are all FixMatch-like and utilize a fixed threshold to select pseudo labels. None of them takes into account the variance of learning difficulty and class-imbalance situation, which leads to the sub-optimal results. In this work, a general class-level confidence based 3D SSL method is proposed to dynamically set the thresholds and re-sample the data according to the learning status.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Semi-Supervised Learning: Semi-supervised learning methods have made a significant progress in recently years     [ref]12  8  8.
