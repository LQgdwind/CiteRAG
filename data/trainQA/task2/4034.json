      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Scheduling of Data Augmentation for Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep reinforcement learning (RL) aims at finding\na neural network to represent policy or value functions\ntaking raw observation as input, of which the most common form in practice is visual data or images of high-dimensionality, e.g., video games ,\nboard games  , and robot controls  .\nRL handling high-dimensional input often suffers from\npoor sample efficiency and generalization capability,\nmainly due to the curse of dimensionality  .\nTo overcome these issues,\nit has been widely considered to augment data\nbased on prior knowledge that a set of transformations preserve\nthe meaning or context of input observations, e.g.,\ncropping out unimportant parts of images, and changing colors\n[ref]21   5.\nOn one hand,\nRL agent can be directly fed with the original and augmented data\nso that it implicitly learns a representation with the prior\nand improves the sample efficiency and generalization [ref]21.\nOn the other hand,\nthe prior knowledge in data augmentation\ncan be explicitly distilled via a self-supervised learning,\nwhich introduces additional regularization\nto ensure consistency between responses to original and augmented inputs  5. However,\ndata augmentation shows highly task-dependent effect in RL,\nand it is prone to generate severe interference with the training\neven when it truly conveys a useful prior to train and test environments\n[ref]21  5.\nWe address the problem of alleviating the interference between data augmentation and RL training to improve sample efficiency for acquainting train tasks, and generalization capability for unseen test environments.\nThis problem in (online) RL is more critical and challenging than\nthat in supervised learning (SL)\nsince the objective function and\ndata distribution are time-varying in RL,\nwhile they are not in SL.\nIndeed, according to\n 1,\nit is sufficient to partly apply data augmentation\njust for a short period of SL at any time.\nMeanwhile, we empirically observe that the prior from data augmentation\ncan be easily forgotten in RL of the non-stationary nature\n(see Section 5.3), i.e.,\nthe effect of augmentation is time-sensitive. Based on our observation about the interference and the time-sensitivity,\nwe propose two simple yet effective methods according to timings of data augmentation :\nIntra Distillation with Augmented observations (InDA)\nand Extra Distillation with Augmented observations (ExDA).\nData augmentation beneficial for the sample efficiency\nneeds to be applied over the entire RL training, i.e., InDA.\nConversely, data augmentation useful only for the generalization\nshould be postponed to the end of RL training, i.e., ExDA,\nso that we can minimize the interference in the training,\nwhile enjoying the benefit in the testing.\nInDA and ExDA are equipped with\nDistillation with Augmented observation (DA).\nDA is a stand-alone self-supervised learning\nwhich enables us to induce the prior after RL training,\nand shows a relatively small interference with RL training\nby explicitly preserving the response of RL agent to the original input. The best timing (InDA or ExDA) depends on traits of train task and augmentation.\nWe hence suggest a framework of adaptive scheduling, named UCB-ExDA,\nthat (i) first aims at\nmaximizing the sample efficiency by adaptively\nselecting which or no augmentation to be used during RL training;\nand then, (ii)\ndistill the priors from all the augmentations after RL training.\nSpecifically,\ninspired by ,\nwe devise UCB-InDA\nfor the adaptive selection in the first part by modifying the upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm  for multi-armed bandit,\nwhere differently from ,\nthe set of arms includes all the augmentations and the option to not augment.\nIn summary, UCB-ExDA is nothing but executing UCB-InDA followed by ExDA.\nOur experiment demonstrates the utility of the proposed framework.\n Our contributions are summarized as follows: We devise DA (Section 4.1) which explicitly preserves the knowledge of RL agent\nso that enables distilling the consistency prior of augmentation into RL agent not only during but also after RL training,\nwhile other methods\n[ref]21  5\nneed to be applied concurrently with RL training\nand thus show relatively strong interference in our experiments (Section 5.2). We identify the simple yet effective timings of data augmentation: either InDA or ExDA (Section 4.2, Section 4.3), based upon\nthe discovery of the time-sensitivity (Section 5.3)\nthat has not been observed in SL 1, i.e., the proposed timings are effective particularly for RL. We finally establish UCB-ExDA which automatically decides the best timing of augmentation, and demonstrate its superiority compared to others (Section 5.4).\nThe advantage of UCB-ExDA is particularly substantial when the best strategy is ExDA postponing augmentation to the end of RL training.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: to augment data\nbased on prior knowledge that a set of transformations preserve\nthe meaning or context of input observations, e.g.,\ncropping out unimportant parts of images, and changing colors\n[ref]21   5.\nOn one hand,\nRL agent can be directly fed with the original and augmented data\nso that it implicitly learns a representation with the prior\nand improves the sample efficiency and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
