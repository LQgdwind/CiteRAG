      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Resolving the Challenge of Long-tail Distribution in UAV Images for Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the advance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), collecting high-quality images from the air has become convenient. Object detection plays a crucial role in many UAV applications, being a theme common to security and surveillance, infrastructure inspection and emergency response, among others.\nAlthough state-of-the-art deep learning-based object detectors (e.g., Faster R-CNN [ref]27, Cascade R-CNN  and RetinaNet ) can be directly applied to UAV datasets (e.g., VisDrone 5 and UAVDT ), previous studies [ref]17 1  reveal that these detectors do not perform well on drone-captured scenes due to two main challenges: (1) targets appear very small in high-resolution UAV images; (2) targets have a nonuniform spatial distribution in images.\nTo address these challenges, a great amount of effort has been witnessed on augmenting the input images, such as developing effective image cropping strategies [ref]17 1  .\nFor example, DMNet [ref]17 generates a density map for each image and utilizes it to crop the original image to patches based on the object density.\nThe goal is to make objects evenly distributed in each cropped patch. The detection results are fused from the global image and cropped patches in the test phase. Although cropping methods alleviate the issue caused by uneven spatial distribution of the targets, they overlook another critical problem of UAV images: object sample imbalance among categories. As shown in Table 1, a few classes in VisDrone 5 such as c​a​r𝑐𝑎𝑟car, p​e​d.𝑝𝑒𝑑ped. and p​e​r​s​o​n𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑜𝑛person account for more than 70% of all the targets (these classes are known as head classes), while other classes such as t​r​i​c​y​c​l​e𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑦𝑐𝑙𝑒tricycle and a​w​n.𝑎𝑤𝑛awn. have only a small number of samples (i.e., tail classes). This is referred to as the long-tail distribution. Based on the detection results of Faster R-CNN [ref]27 in Table 1, we can easily notice the performance gap between head classes and tail classes (e.g., car vs. awn. == 51.7 vs. 7.7 in terms of average precision). Fig. 1 presents a few concrete examples to reveal the imbalanced class distribution in UAV images. The head-class objects (denoted by green boxes) dominate the scene. Even with the state-of-the-art cropping approach (DMNet [ref]17), the resulting patches still exhibit imbalanced class distribution.  Tackling the long-tail distribution problem is important and has been a hot research topic in general object detection.\nOne common approach is to repeatedly sample targets of tail classes  or discard some targets of head classes on purpose . However, these straightforward methods suffer distortion of the original distribution which impairs the representation learning 4 2. Therefore another line of research 4 2 aims to balance the class distribution by using different input distributions for training representation and classifier respectively in two phases (in the context of object detection, representation refers to feature extraction network and classifier refers to box head). These methods effectively reduce the performance drop caused by long-tail distribution on natural scene datasets (e.g., LVIS ). However, there are unique challenges that make the long-tail problem more difficult on UAV datasets than on general object detection datasets. Several state-of-the-art methods for long-tail visual recognition   2 sample a balanced set of targets in a batch based on the assumption that they can use a relatively large batch-size. However, this assumption may not be warranted on UAV datasets because the images are high-resolution (e.g., VisDrone dataset has many images over the size of 2000×\\times1500). Due to the memory constraint, the typical batch-size is set to 1 or 2 for model training on these UAV datasets. Moreover, there are often hundreds of targets from head classes in one image (see\nthe UAV images in Fig. 1). As a result, image-level repeat sampling  is not an effective solution on UAV datasets. In light of these challenges, we propose a novel Dual Sampler and Head Network (DSHNet) to address long-tail distribution in UAV datasets for object detection. DSHNet consists of two key components including Class-Biased Samplers (CBS) and Bilateral Box Heads (BBH). Different from image-level re-sampling, CBS use the biased-sampling strategy to sample tail-class and head-class proposals separately with two samplers instead of a (default) single sampler in existing object detectors. BBH then separate the sampled tail-class and head-class proposals and process them with two box heads in the training phase to compute their losses respectively. In the test phase, each head of BBH only predicts results of the corresponding (tail or head) classes. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows: We unveil the long-tail distribution problem in UAV images, which greatly hinders the performance of object detection. Previous works 1 [ref]17 3 mainly focus on resolving the nonuniform spatial distribution by cropping the original images into small patches. However, the cropped images still exhibit long-tail distribution. We analyze the unique challenges of object detection in UAV images and uncover that the solutions to long-tail distribution in natural images are not trivially applicable to UAV images. In light of this, we propose a novel Dual Sampler and Head Network (DSHNet) to handle head classes and tail classes separately. DSHNet substantially outperforms the baseline models and generic long-tail solutions on various object detectors and network backbones. When coupled with image cropping methods (e.g., DMNet [ref]17), DSHNet further improves the detection performance, resulting in new state-of-the-art results on VisDrone and UAVDT benchmarks.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: being a theme common to security and surveillance, infrastructure inspection and emergency response, among others.\nAlthough state-of-the-art deep learning-based object detectors (e.g., Faster R-CNN [ref]27, Cascade R-CNN  and RetinaNet ) can be directly applied to UAV datasets (e.g., VisDrone 5 and UAVDT ), previous studies [ref]17 1  reveal that these detectors do not perform well on\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
