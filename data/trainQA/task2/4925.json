      "content": "Paper Title: Single Image Super-Resolution via a Dual Interactive Implicit Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImplicit neural representations are an elegant way to parameterize signals\ncontinuously in comparison to conventional representations, which are usually\ndiscrete. Chen et al. , Mescheder et al. , and Park et al.  are among\nthe first to show that implicit neural representations outperform 3D\nrepresentations (e.g., meshes, voxels, and point clouds) in 3D modeling. Many\nworks that achieve state-of-the-art results in 3D computer vision have followed.\nFor example, Chabra et al. [ref]5 learned local shape priors for\nthe reconstruction of 3D surfaces coupled with a deep signed distance function.\nA new implicit representation for 3D shape learning called a neural\ndistance field was proposed by Chibane et al. . Jiang et al. [ref]18 leveraged voxel representations to enable implicit\nfunctions to fit large 3D scenes, and Peng et al. [ref]30\nincreased the expressiveness of 3D scenes with various convolutional models. It\nalso is possible to condition the implicit neural representations on the input\nsignals [ref]5  [ref]18 [ref]30, which can be considered as a hybrid implicit/explicit\nmodel.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: 3D\nrepresentations (e.g., meshes, voxels, and point clouds) in 3D modeling.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
