      "content": "Paper Title: Amodal Panoptic Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPanoptic segmentation approaches can be categorized into proposal-free and proposal-based methods. Proposal-free methods  [ref]4  first perform semantic segmentation, followed by applying various techniques to group thing pixels such as instance center regression , Hough-voting [ref]16, or pixel affinity  to obtain instance segmentation. On the other hand, in proposal-based methods   , typically a network head generates the object bounding boxes along with their masks and a parallel head yields the semantic segmentation output. In this work, we propose a top-down amodal panoptic segmentation architecture. We choose the top-down over the bottom-up approach due to its ability to handle large-scale variation in instances which plays a vital role in segmenting thing class objects. Li et al.  introduce the amodal instance segmentation task for which their approach relies on the directions of high heatmap values computed for each object to iteratively enlarge the corresponding object modal bounding box. Follmann et. al  propose a class-specific amodal instance segmentation approach called ORCNN which replaces the single instance mask head of Mask R-CNN  with amodal and inmodal instance mask heads. Further, they employ an occlusion mask prediction head on top of the modal-specific heads. Subsequently, Qi et al.  introduce the multi-level coding module to explicitly impart global information for better segmentation of the occluded area. VQ-VAE [ref]12 replaces the fully convolutional instance mask heads with variational autoencoders. Their method first classifies the input features into intermediate shape codes and then recovers complete object shapes from the intermediate shape codes. To learn the aforementioned discrete shape codes, they pretrain a vector quantized variational autoencoder model on the amodal groundtruth masks. Xiao et al.  use a shape-prior memory codebook with an autoencoder to refine the initial amodal mask prediction from Mask R-CNN. Similar to [ref]12, they pretrain the autoencoder on amodal groundtruth masks. More recently, BCNet  employs two overlapping GCN layers that detect the occluding objects and partially occluded object instances to decouple the boundaries of both the occluding and occluded object instances. Lastly, Zhu et al.  propose amodal semantic segmentation with the COCO amodal dataset. Their task requires the prediction of visible and invisible regions of thing classes in a class-agnostic manner while allowing multiple detections of the same objects. The COCO amodal dataset does not provide any labels for amorphous regions (wall, floor, etc.). In contrast, we introduce two benchmark datasets that treat all prominent amorphous regions (road, sidewalk, etc.) and non-traffic participants (pole, fence, etc.) in an urban scene as stuff, similar to the standard convention followed in panoptic segmentation . Consequently, our datasets consider all the traffic participants (cars, pedestrians, etc.) as part of thing classes. Furthermore, our amodal panoptic segmentation task allows at most one semantic label and instance-ID assignment to the pixel of visible regions. This discourages overlaps and requires predictions to be class-specific.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Panoptic segmentation approaches can be categorized into proposal-free and proposal-based methods.
