      "content": "Paper Title: A deep learning guided memetic framework for graph coloring problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis section shows a comparative analysis on the pxx, rxx, DIMACS/COLOR small, and DIMACS/COLOR large instances with respect to the state-of-the-art methods   [ref]47. The reference methods include the three best recent heuristics: AFISA , RedLS [ref]47 and ILS-TS . When they are available, we also include the optimal scores obtained with the exact algorithm MWSS [ref]6 and extracted from . Given the stochastic nature of the DLMCOL algorithm, each instance was independently solved 10 times. For small instances presented in Tables 3‚Äì4, a time limit of 1 hour was used. However for medium and large instance in Tables 5 and 6, as training the neural network and performing all the tabu searches with the large population is time consuming, a cutoff limit of 48 hours was retained. For a fair comparison, we also launched the reference methods RedLS [ref]47 and ILS-TS  during 48 hours on a computer with an Intel Xeon E5-2670 processor (2.5 GHz and 2 GB RAM), until no improvement was observed. As the available AFISA binary code does not allow setting a cutoff time, we only report its results mentioned in the original article . However, we acknowledge that the comparison remains difficult in terms of computational time between DLMCOL and the competitors, as DLMCOL was run on GPUs while the other algorithms, AFISA, RedLS and ILS-TS used CPUs. Therefore the timing information is provided for indicative purposes only. Columns 1, 2, and 3 of Tables 3‚Äì6 show the characteristics of each instance (i.e., name of the instance, number of vertices |V|ùëâ|V|, and optimal score reported in the literature if available). Columns 4-9 present the best and average scores obtained by the reference algorithms, as well as the average time in second required to obtain their best results. The results of the proposed DLMCOL algorithm are reported in columns 10 and 11. Boldfaced numbers show the dominating values while a star indicates a new upper bound444The certificates of the new best solutions from DLMCOL for the WVCP are available at https://github.com/GoudetOlivier/DLMCOL_WVCP.. The optima for the instances of Tables 3-5 are known except for four instances DSJC125 and two instances R100. As the result, no algorithm can further improve these bounds. For these graphs, the proposed algorithm and the latest ILS-TS algorithm report the same results and both algorithms perform better than AFISA and RedLS. However, the computation time required by DLMCOL to achieve its results is in general higher that the reference algorithms in particular when compared with ILT-TS. This is not really surprising given that the neural network training requires additional computation time in addition of the time needed by the optimization components. For the larger instances reported in Table 6, DLMCOL obtains excellent results by reaching the best-known score for 31 over 49 instances. For 11 of them, DLMCOL even finds new upper bounds that were never been reported before. In particular, improvements are quite important for 3 instances with a high reduction of the best-known scores: DSJC500.5 from 707 to 685, flat1000_50_0 from 1184 to 924 and latin_square_10 from 1542 to 1480. However, DLMCOL does not work well for large sparse graphs with low edge density such as DSJC1000.1, inithhx.i.2, inithhx.i.3 and wapXXa. For these graphs, it seems that it is very hard for the neural network to learn a common backbone of good solutions. An analysis of these negative results is proposed in Section 4.2. For the largest graphs, we notice that the DLMCOL algorithm converges slowly, but continually. Even after 48 hours, DLMCOL still improves its solutions. This indicates that the algorithm is not trapped in local optima, which is a common problem for most existing WVCP algorithms. For the graphs DJSC1000.5, flat1000_60_0 and flat1000_76_0, DLMCOL was able to obtain still better new upper bounds of 1185, 1162, 1165, after 138, 98 and 95 hours, respectively, raising the total number of improved upper bounds to 14 for the WVCP. For the large instances in Table 6, DLMCOL and the best competitors RedLS and ILS-TS have their own advantage respectively, while the proposed algorithm has the best overall success rate of 63% against AFISA (10%), RedLS (53%) and ILS-TS (49%).\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: This section shows a comparative analysis on the pxx, rxx, DIMACS/COLOR small, and DIMACS/COLOR large instances with respect to the state-of-the-art methods   [ref]47.
