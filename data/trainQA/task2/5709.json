      "content": "Paper Title: AdPE: Adversarial Positional Embeddings for Pretraining Vision Transformers via MAE+\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPretraining vision transformers [ref]1 effectively has received many attentions due to the potential of unifying transformer architectures across modalities. Among them is the Masked Image Modeling (MIM) [ref]3 that inherits the same idea in Bert pretraining of language transformers . These MIM approaches seek to predict the masked patches as a pretext task to pretrain vision transformers. A critical principle in unsupervised pretraining of deep networks is the pretext task ought to be sufficiently hard to avoid trivial solutions only focusing on low-level features to bypass the task . For this purpose, adversarial pretraining of the CNNs has demonstrated tremendous successes in the context of contrastive learning [ref]6   . For example, [ref]6 learn to generate hard negatives, forcing the network encoder to learn more discriminative features to distinguish hard negatives from their positive counterparts. By adopting harder pretext tasks , the results showcase the adversarial pretraining is able to prevent the deep network from learning trivial low-level features with poor generalizability to downstream tasks. Along this line of research, we aspire to develop an adversarial approach to effectively pretrain transformers in a MIM manner. While the adversarial contrastive learning seeks to learn hard negatives [ref]6  , no such adversaries exist in the MIM-based pretraining. Thus, we first need to answer the question of what to choose as the adversary in the MIM-pretrained transformer. In this paper, we propose that perturbing the positional encodings is a natural choice to adversarially pretrain the vision transformer. It spatially distorts the local visual structures through perturbed positional encodings, and thus prevents the transformer from learning trivial features by exploiting the strong correlations between masked patches and their local unmasked peers. In this way, we hypothesize the transformer is adversarially pretrained to focus on global contexts that are more useful for the downstream tasks to predict masked patches. We will consider adversarial perturbations applied in the positional embedding space additively, or on the image coordinates through a differentiable positional embedding/indexing function. Both absolute  and relative positional embeddings  will be considered for adversarial pretraining of transformers. In addition, we will present a new MAE+ baseline by seamlessly fitting multi-crop tokenization to MAE [ref]3. While multi-crop augmentation has been successfully applied in the contrastive pretraining of both CNNs  and transformers , we will demonstrate how this simple mechanism can be delicately designed with a lighter-weighted decoder having fewer input tokens than the existing MIM baseline [ref]3. It allows to strike a better trade-off between the lighter decoder and more crops of tokenization to improve the MIM-pretraining.\nWe will demonstrate this results in a more efficient MAE+ baseline reaching superior performances alongside the proposed Adversarial Positional Embeddings (AdPE). The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We will review the related works in Section 2. Then we will revisit the key idea behind the MIM and present a new MAE+ baseline in Section 3. We will elaborate on the proposed Adversarial Positional Embeddings (AdPE) in Section 4. Experiment results will be reported in Section 5, and we will conclude the paper in Section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Pretraining vision transformers [ref]1 effectively has received many attentions due to the potential of unifying transformer architectures across modalities.
