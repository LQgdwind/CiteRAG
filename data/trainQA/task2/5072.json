      "content": "Paper Title: Fast Graph Generation via Spectral Diffusion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBesides generic graph generation, our model can also generate organic molecules through our proposed reverse diffusion process. We test our model with two well-known molecule datasets: QM9  and ZINC250K . Following previous works [ref]10 [ref]20, the molecules are kekulized by the RDKit library  with hydrogen atoms removed. We evaluate the quality of 10,000 generated molecules with Frechet ChemNet Distance (FCD) [ref]26, Neighborhood subgraph pairwise distance kernel (NSPDK) MMD , validity w/o correction, and the generation time. FCD computes the distance between the testing and the generated molecules using the activations of the\npenultimate layer of the ChemNet. (NSPDK) MMD computes the MMD between the generated and the testing set which takes into account both\nthe node and edge features for evaluation. Generally speaking, FCD measures the generation quality in the view of molecules in the chemical space, while NSPDK MMD evaluates the generation quality from the graph structure perspective. Besides, following [ref]10, we also include the validity w/o correction as another metric to explicitly evaluate the quality of molecule generation prior to the correction procedure. It computes the fraction of the number of valid molecules without valency correction or edge resampling over the total number of generated molecules. In contrast, validity measures the fraction of the valid molecules after the correction phase. Generation time measures the time for generating 10,000 molecules in the form of RDKit. It is a salient measure of the practicability of molecule generation, especially for macromolecule generation. Baselines We compare our model with the state-of-the-art molecule generation models. The baselines include SOTA auto-regressive models: GraphAF  is a flow-based model, and GraphDF [ref]20 is a flow-based model using discrete latent variables. Following GDSS [ref]10, we modify the architecture of GraphAF and GraphDF to consider formal charges in the molecule generation, denoted as GraphAF+FC and GraphDF+FC, for fair comparisons. For the one-shot model, we include MoFlow , which is a flow-based model; EDP-GNN  and GDSS  which are both diffusion models. Results We show the results in Table II. Evidentally, GSDM achieves the highest performance under most of the metrics. The highest scores in NSPDK and FCD show that GSDM is able to generate molecules that have close data distributions to the real molecules in both the chemical space and graph space. Especially, our model outperforms GDSS, in most of the metrics, verifying that our proposed spectral diffusion is not only suitable for generic graph generation but also advisable for molecule designs. Apart from the visualization of generated graphs in Figure 2, visualizations of generated molecules are included in Appendix¬†B.3, showing that the proposed GSDM is capable of generating generic graphs as well as molecules of high quality. Time Complexity One of the main advantages of our GSDM compared to other diffusion models (e.g. EDP-GNN and GDSS) is the efficiency in generating molecules. We show the time spent (in seconds) for generating 10,000 molecules in Table II, demonstrating that our GSDM takes a significantly lower time in the inference process compared to EDP-GNN and GDSS. Especially, compared to GDSS which requires 1.06‚Äãe31.06superscriptùëí31.06e^{3} and 2.11‚Äãe32.11superscriptùëí32.11e^{3} seconds to generate 10,000 molecule graphs according to QM9 and Zinc250k, our model only takes 18.02 and 45.91 seconds, which are 58√ó\\textbf{58}\\times and 46√ó\\textbf{46}\\times faster respectively. This phenomenon verifies our methodology in designing the spectral diffusion that not only the spectral diffusion is more effective than the whole space diffusion, but also more efficient. Such an improvement is crucial for numerous applications such as drug design and material analysis.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: our model can also generate organic molecules through our proposed reverse diffusion process.
