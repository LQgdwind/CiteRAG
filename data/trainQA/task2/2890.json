Assume n𝑛n satisfies Let m∈ℕ𝑚ℕm\\in\\mathbb{N} and assume m𝑚m satisfies Eq. 76 and let X~m∈ℝm×dsubscript~𝑋𝑚superscriptℝ𝑚𝑑\\widetilde{X}_{m}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times d} be a data matrix corresponding to vectors x~1,…,x~msubscript~𝑥1…subscript~𝑥𝑚\\tilde{x}_{1},...,\\tilde{x}_{m} which are sampled independently and uniformly from 𝒳𝒳{\\cal X}. Let λ=ε2​(β+d)/β𝜆superscript𝜀2𝛽𝑑𝛽\\lambda=\\varepsilon^{2(\\beta+d)/\\beta}, τ=ε−2/β𝜏superscript𝜀2𝛽\\tau=\\varepsilon^{-2/\\beta} and f^τ,m,λsubscript^𝑓𝜏𝑚𝜆\\widehat{f}_{\\tau,m,\\lambda} be the Gaussian PSD model associated to the solution A^τ,m,λsubscript^𝐴𝜏𝑚𝜆\\widehat{A}_{\\tau,m,\\lambda} of Sec. 4.1 with X~m,λ,τsubscript~𝑋𝑚𝜆𝜏\\widetilde{X}_{m},\\lambda,\\tau.

We start by applying the same reasoning as in the proof of Theorem 7 by Rudi and Ciliberto, [ref]16. Note that since τ=ε−2/β𝜏superscript𝜀2𝛽\\tau=\\varepsilon^{-2/\\beta} and Eq. 76 is satisfied, with probability at least 1−δ1𝛿1-\\delta, it holds ‖f~τ,m,ϵ−f^τ,m,λ‖L2​(𝒳)⩽2​C1​‖fp‖sos,ℝd,β​εsubscriptnormsubscript~𝑓𝜏𝑚italic-ϵsubscript^𝑓𝜏𝑚𝜆superscript𝐿2𝒳2subscript𝐶1subscriptnormsubscript𝑓𝑝sossuperscriptℝ𝑑𝛽𝜀\\|\\widetilde{f}_{\\tau,m,\\epsilon}-\\widehat{f}_{\\tau,m,\\lambda}\\|_{L^{2}({\\cal X})}\\leqslant 2C_{1}\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ \\left\\|f_{p}\\right\\|_{\\texttt{sos},\\mathbb{R}^{d},\\beta}\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ \\varepsilon (where C1←C←subscript𝐶1𝐶C_{1}\\leftarrow C from Eq. 77) and hence ‖fp−f^τ,m,λ‖L2​(𝒳)⩽(C0+2​C1)​‖fp‖sos,ℝd,β​εsubscriptnormsubscript𝑓𝑝subscript^𝑓𝜏𝑚𝜆superscript𝐿2𝒳subscript𝐶02subscript𝐶1subscriptnormsubscript𝑓𝑝sossuperscriptℝ𝑑𝛽𝜀\\|f_{p}-\\widehat{f}_{\\tau,m,\\lambda}\\|_{L^{2}({\\cal X})}\\leqslant(C_{0}+2C_{1})\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ \\left\\|f_{p}\\right\\|_{\\texttt{sos},\\mathbb{R}^{d},\\beta}\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ \\varepsilon, (where C0←C1←subscript𝐶0subscript𝐶1C_{0}\\leftarrow C_{1} from Theorem 6). C0,C1subscript𝐶0subscript𝐶1C_{0},C_{1} are both constants depending only on d,β𝑑𝛽d,\\beta. Moreover, since the Frobenius norm is bounded by the trace norm, by definition of τ𝜏\\tau, we also have ‖M^τ,m,λ‖F⩽Tr⁡(M^τ,m,λ)⩽C1​‖fp‖sos,ℝd,β​τd/2⩽C1​‖fp‖sos,ℝd,β​ε−d/βsubscriptnormsubscript^𝑀𝜏𝑚𝜆𝐹Trsubscript^𝑀𝜏𝑚𝜆subscript𝐶1subscriptnormsubscript𝑓𝑝sossuperscriptℝ𝑑𝛽superscript𝜏𝑑2subscript𝐶1subscriptnormsubscript𝑓𝑝sossuperscriptℝ𝑑𝛽superscript𝜀𝑑𝛽\\|\\widehat{M}_{\\tau,m,\\lambda}\\|_{F}\\leqslant\\operatorname{Tr}{(\\widehat{M}_{\\tau,m,\\lambda})}\\leqslant C_{1}\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ \\left\\|f_{p}\\right\\|_{\\texttt{sos},\\mathbb{R}^{d},\\beta}\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ \\tau^{d/2}\\leqslant C_{1}\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ \\left\\|f_{p}\\right\\|_{\\texttt{sos},\\mathbb{R}^{d},\\beta}\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ \\varepsilon^{-d/\\beta}. We can modify Theorem E.2 from Rudi and Ciliberto, [ref]16 by taking v^=1n​∑i=1nfp​(xi)​ψη​(xi)^𝑣1𝑛superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛subscript𝑓𝑝subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝜓𝜂subscript𝑥𝑖\\widehat{v}=\\tfrac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{f_{p}(x_{i})\\psi_{\\eta}(x_{i})} and v=∫𝒳fp​(x)​ψη​(x)​𝑑x𝑣subscript𝒳subscript𝑓𝑝𝑥subscript𝜓𝜂𝑥differential-d𝑥v=\\int_{{\\cal X}}{f_{p}(x)\\psi_{\\eta}(x)\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ dx}; all the formulas then remain true and adapt to our problem Sec. 4.1. Applying Theorem E.2 from Rudi and Ciliberto, [ref]16 to A~τ,m,ϵsubscript~𝐴𝜏𝑚italic-ϵ\\widetilde{A}_{\\tau,m,\\epsilon} and using Lemma E.3 of Rudi and Ciliberto, [ref]16 to simplify notation, as well as the bound on the term ‖Qλ−1/2​(v^−v)‖normsuperscriptsubscript𝑄𝜆12^𝑣𝑣\\|Q_{\\lambda}^{-1/2}(\\widehat{v}-v)\\| combining Lemma E.4 (with ζ=Qλ−1/2​fp​(x)​ψη​(x)𝜁superscriptsubscript𝑄𝜆12subscript𝑓𝑝𝑥subscript𝜓𝜂𝑥\\zeta=Q_{\\lambda}^{-1/2}f_{p}(x)\\psi_{\\eta}(x)) using s=d𝑠𝑑s=d and Lemma E.5 (again, for more details, see part 2 of the proof of Theorem 7 by Rudi and Ciliberto, [ref]16) and using the fact that a+b⩽a+b,a,b⩾0formulae-sequence𝑎𝑏𝑎𝑏𝑎𝑏0\\sqrt{a+b}\\leqslant\\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{b},\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ a,b\\geqslant 0,\nwith probability at least 1−δ1𝛿1-\\delta, it holds : where C2subscript𝐶2C_{2} and C3subscript𝐶3C_{3} are constants which depend only on d𝑑d. Note that in the proof of Lemma E.4 of Rudi and Ciliberto, [ref]16, ‖ζ‖norm𝜁\\|\\zeta\\| is bounded in essential supremum and standard deviation by ∥fp∥L∞​(𝒳)×\\|f_{p}\\|_{L^{\\infty}({\\cal X})}\\times a quantity independent of fpsubscript𝑓𝑝f_{p} which is then bounded, hence the previous concentration bound since ‖fp‖L∞​(𝒳)⩽‖fp‖sos,ℝd,βsubscriptnormsubscript𝑓𝑝superscript𝐿𝒳subscriptnormsubscript𝑓𝑝sossuperscriptℝ𝑑𝛽\\|f_{p}\\|_{L^{\\infty}({\\cal X})}\\leqslant\\left\\|f_{p}\\right\\|_{\\texttt{sos},\\mathbb{R}^{d},\\beta}. Now combining both events in a union bound, and plugging in the fact that λ=ε2​β+2​dβ𝜆superscript𝜀2𝛽2𝑑𝛽\\lambda=\\varepsilon^{\\tfrac{2\\beta+2d}{\\beta}} and τ=ε−2/β𝜏superscript𝜀2𝛽\\tau=\\varepsilon^{-2/\\beta}, we see that with probability at least 1−2​δ12𝛿1-2\\delta, the left hand term is bounded by the following quantity: Now the goal is to bound the term T𝑇T. Note that as soon as ε⩽e−1𝜀superscript𝑒1\\varepsilon\\leqslant e^{-1} and δ⩽2𝛿2\\delta\\leqslant 2, if Y=ε−(d+2​β)/β​logd⁡(1ε)​log⁡(2δ)n𝑌superscript𝜀𝑑2𝛽𝛽superscript𝑑1𝜀2𝛿𝑛Y=\\frac{\\varepsilon^{-(d+2\\beta)/\\beta}\\log^{d}\\left(\\tfrac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\log\\left(\\tfrac{2}{\\delta}\\right)}{n}, then it holds T⩽C2log2⁡2​Y+C3​Y𝑇subscript𝐶2superscript22𝑌subscript𝐶3𝑌T\\leqslant\\tfrac{C_{2}}{\\log^{2}2}Y+C_{3}\\sqrt{Y}.

The theorem therefore holds with C←1+3​C1+C2/log2⁡2+C3←𝐶13subscript𝐶1subscript𝐶2superscript22subscript𝐶3C\\leftarrow 1+3C_{1}+C_{2}/\\log^{2}2+C_{3}. Finally, the fact that all bounds involving ‖fp‖sos,ℝd,βsubscriptnormsubscript𝑓𝑝sossuperscriptℝ𝑑𝛽\\left\\|f_{p}\\right\\|_{\\texttt{sos},\\mathbb{R}^{d},\\beta} can be replaced, up to constants depending only on β,d𝛽𝑑\\beta,d, by the norm ‖fp‖sos,𝒳,βsubscriptnormsubscript𝑓𝑝sos𝒳𝛽\\left\\|f_{p}\\right\\|_{\\texttt{sos},{\\cal X},\\beta}, is simply a consequence of proposition 4.\n∎ We now come to the final part of our section detailing the proof of propositions 10 and 8, which consists in approximately sampling from the learnt model f^τ,m,λsubscript^𝑓𝜏𝑚𝜆\\widehat{f}_{\\tau,m,\\lambda} using algorithm 1 with well chosen parameters.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: This theorem is a rewriting of Theorem 7 of Rudi and Ciliberto, [ref]16, but with the point of view of ε𝜀\\varepsilon instead of n𝑛n.
