      "content": "Paper Title: Joint Resource Management for MC-NOMA: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOwing to enhanced multi-user diversity and high flexibility in resource allocation, multi-carrier (MC) multi-access techniques have been widely applied in wireless systems. Recently, non-orthogonal multi-access (NOMA) has attracted significant attention. It can improve spectral efficiency, by adopting superposition coding at the transmitter and successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receiver. Combining MC and NOMA techniques, MC-NOMA extends the technical legacy of orthogonal frequency-division multi-access . The design and deployment of resource management play a crucial role in power-domain MC-NOMA (or “MC-NOMA” for short) systems . The resource management involves user grouping, subcarrier scheduling, and power allocation. Generally, the optimal joint resource management (JRM) algorithms require solving mixed integer nonlinear programming problems. Because MC-NOMA systems involve a much larger number of discrete and/or continuous optimization variables, most existing solvers become computationally prohibitive. For MC-NOMA with perfect SIC, a variety of optimal and suboptimal JRM algorithms have been proposed, typically using optimization theory. Lei et al.  employed Lagrangian duality and dynamic programming to obtain suboptimal solutions for power and channel allocation in a downlink (DL) MC-NOMA system. For spectrum and energy efficient resource allocation, Song et al.  formulated a multi-objective optimization problem solved by convex programming. Fu et al. [ref]6 also utilized convex programming and heuristic greedy algorithms to solve the subcarrier and power allocation problem, and designed a three-step resource allocation framework. Di et al.  investigated the power allocation and user scheduling to maximize the weighted-sum rate by designing a matching game. Zheng et al.  considered an uplink (UL) MC-NOMA system, and designed a Nash bargaining game for power allocation and user clustering. For the simpler UL power allocation problem, Fang et al. [ref]9 used Lagrangian dual decomposition and Dinkelbach algorithm to derive closed-form expressions for the optimal power allocation. Moreover, Sun et al. 0 studied the joint power and subcarrier allocation in a full-duplex MC-NOMA system, and a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based suboptimal iterative scheme was presented. All the above studies assumed perfect SIC. In practice, MC-NOMA is susceptible to imperfect SIC and subsequent error propagation. It is of significance to study the JRM of MC-NOMA systems in the presence of imperfect SIC (also known as imperfect NOMA). Wei et al. 1 considered an MC-NOMA system under imperfect channel state information CSI, and employed the branch-and-bound (B&B) and difference of convex (DC) programming to maximize the power efficiency of the system. Cheng et al. 2 modeled the channel estimation error as a complex Gaussian random variable and proposed a low-complexity user scheduling and power allocation algorithm in a DL MC-NOMA system. The results of 1 and 2 are only applicable in the case with at most two users multiplexed per subcarrier. To reduce the power consumption of a delay-sensitive UL transmission, Xu et al. 3 presented an approximate algorithm to minimize the transmit power of imperfect NOMA. Zamani et al. 4 formulated the power allocation into a fractional programming problem, and obtained the optimal solution by using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions and DC programming. While power allocation has been studied in 3 and 4, user grouping and subcarrier scheduling have not been well investigated. Adopting heuristics user scheduling, the authors of 5 focused on the power allocation under imperfect SIC with no consideration of the quality of service (QoS). Cellik et al. 6 considered the power disparity and sensitivity of the SIC receiver, and formulated a joint cluster formation and resource allocation problem. The subproblem of cluster formation was solved by the blossom algorithm. The subproblem of resource allocation was solved by geometric programming. The focus of 6 was on the UL, which however is distinctively different from the DL NOMA systems considered in this paper. The above existing works typically have the following two limitations: 1) deriving optimal JRM schemes is intractable for MC-NOMA under imperfect SIC, and 2) assuming that the same number of users are multiplexed on each subcarrier. In addition, the operation of an SIC receiver requires that the power difference between the signal and noise to exceed a threshold (referred to as “hardware sensitivity requirement”, which has been overlooked in the existing literature). Reinforcement learning (RL) allows an agent to maximize a long-term discount reward and derive a solution on its own 7. Yang et al. 8 utilized Q-learning to design a NOMA-based mobile edge computing framework. By integrating deep learning into RL, deep RL (DRL) addresses the challenges of Q-learning in the storage and look-up of the Q table. Yang et al. 9 employed a deep Q-network (DQN) to model the offloading problem for multi-user NOMA. Doan et al. 0 applied DRL to implement the power allocation in cache-aided NOMA systems. By employing the actor-critic RL, Zhang et al. 1 proposed a dynamic power allocation scheme. Zhang et al. 2 and Giang et al. 3 used DRL to obtain suboptimal solutions to the power allocation of UL MC-NOMA systems. He et al. 4 used a DRL framework solve to the joint power allocation and channel assignment problem in a perfect two-user NOMA system. An attention-based neural network was applied to capture the sequential relations between the input and output of channel assignment problem. In our recent works, we studied multi-channel access in fast-changing channels 5, joint virtual network function placement-and-routing 6, and user grouping of NOMA systems 7, by utilizing a new policy gradient-based DRL technique. In this paper, we are interested in a different problem of joint subcarrier assignment and power allocation in an MC-NOMA system with imperfect SIC. Although the above existing studies have revealed the potential of RL/DRL in the resource management, there is still paucity of research for applying DRL to the JRM of MC-NOMA, especially in the presence of hardware sensitivity requirements and imperfect SIC. This paper optimizes the subcarrier assignment and power allocation of a DL MC-NOMA system, under imperfect channel station information (CSI), non-negligible SIC errors, and given hardware sensitivity. These practical factors have yet to be considered in the literature. We propose a novel DRL-based JRM (DRL-JRM) framework with the following contributions: A practical DL MC-NOMA system is studied, where: 1) the number of users multiplexed on different subcarriers can differ; 2) the hardware sensitivity and imperfect SIC cannot be overlooked; and 3) subcarrier assignment (including user grouping) and power allocation are jointly optimized. We maximize the weighted-sum throughput of the DL MC-NOMA system, by decoupling the JRM of the system into two RL subtasks. A novel DRL-RM framework is designed for the two RL subtasks, where there are two modules: an SA module responsible for subcarrier assignment and a PA module responsible for power allocation. Both the SA and PA modules are implemented with a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. The optimization objective and constraints of the two subtasks are constructed as a new joint reward and internal reward mechanism. A novel centralized action-value function is designed to measure the reward in the PA module. In the centralized action-value function, we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to guarantee that an agent can effectively utilize its own information by condensing the information of other agents into lower dimensions. Several new designs on the neural network are also proposed. Extensive experiments verify that the proposed DRL-JRM scheme provides close-to-optimal results in the case of small-scale problems. In the case of large-scale problems, DRL-JRM is superior to existing benchmarks in terms of weighted-sum system throughput and resistance to interference. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we present the system model and formulate the JRM problem. The problem is transformed into an RL task in Section III. In Section IV, the new DRL-JRM framework is developed. Experiments are shown in Section V, followed by conclusions in Section VI.
