      "content": "Paper Title: P-time Algorithms for Typical #EO Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere is a growing interest among researchers in the field of mathematics in the area of counting problems. In fields such as statistical physics, economics, machine learning and combinatorics, the role of counting problems is becoming increasingly significant. Three well-founded frameworks have been put forth for the study of the complexity of counting problems, which are #GH, #​CSP#CSP\\#\\textsf{CSP} and Holant. Their definitions are as follows, basically refer to [9, section 1.2] and [15, section 2.1]. A counting weighted graph homomorphisms problem #​GH​(ℱ)#GHℱ\\#\\textsf{GH}(\\mathcal{F}) parameterized by a binary signature f𝑓f is as the following: The input is a directed graph222In this article, graphs refer to multigraphs. It is always permissible for self-loops and parallel edges to be present. G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E). The output is A counting constraint satisfaction problem #​CSP​(ℱ)#CSPℱ\\#\\textsf{CSP}(\\mathcal{F}) parameterized by a set ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} is as the following: The input is an instance of #​CSP​(ℱ)#CSPℱ\\#\\textsf{CSP}(\\mathcal{F}), which consists of a finite set of variables {x1,x2,⋯,xn}subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2⋯subscript𝑥𝑛\\{x_{1},x_{2},\\cdots,x_{n}\\} and a finite set C𝐶C of clauses. Each clause in C𝐶C contains a signature f∈ℱ𝑓ℱf\\in\\mathcal{F} of arity k𝑘k and a sequence of variables of length k𝑘k (xi1,xi2,⋯,xik)subscript𝑥subscript𝑖1subscript𝑥subscript𝑖2⋯subscript𝑥subscript𝑖𝑘(x_{i_{1}},x_{i_{2}},\\cdots,x_{i_{k}}) from {x1,x2,⋯,xn}subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2⋯subscript𝑥𝑛\\{x_{1},x_{2},\\cdots,x_{n}\\} 333A variable can appear in the sequence more than one time.. The output is A Holant problem Holant​(ℱ)Holantℱ\\textsf{Holant}(\\mathcal{F}) parameterized by a set ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} is as the following: The input is an signature grid Ω​(G,π)Ω𝐺𝜋\\Omega(G,\\pi) over ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}. Here, G𝐺G is a graph and π:V→ℱ×S​(E​(v)):𝜋→𝑉ℱ𝑆𝐸𝑣\\pi:V\\to\\mathcal{F}\\times S(E(v)) assigns a signature fv∈ℱsubscript𝑓𝑣ℱf_{v}\\in\\mathcal{F} of arity |E​(v)|𝐸𝑣|E(v)| to v𝑣v and a linear order to E​(v)𝐸𝑣E(v) for each v∈V​(G)𝑣𝑉𝐺v\\in V(G), where E​(v)𝐸𝑣E(v) are the edges adjacent to v𝑣v. The output is the partition function of ΩΩ\\Omega, The bipartite Holant problem Holant​(ℱ∣𝒢)Holantconditionalℱ𝒢\\textsf{Holant}(\\mathcal{F}\\mid\\mathcal{G}) is a Holant problem over the signature grid (G,π)𝐺𝜋(G,\\pi), where G=(U,V,E)𝐺𝑈𝑉𝐸G=(U,V,E) is a bipartite graph, and π𝜋\\pi assigns signatures from ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} to vertices in U𝑈U and signatures from 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} to vertices in V𝑉V. These frameworks are capable of expressing a wide range of natural counting problems and of great significance in counting complexity. For example, counting the number of vertex covers in a graph can be expressed in the framework of #GH, while counting the number of perfect matchings can be seen as a Holant problem. Recently, counting weighted Eulerian orientation problems (#​EO#EO\\#\\textsf{EO}) also draw our attention. We use HW<superscriptHW\\text{HW}^{<} to denote the strings that contain less 1’s than 0’s, and define HW=superscriptHW\\text{HW}^{=}, HW≤superscriptHW\\text{HW}^{\\leq}, HW>superscriptHW\\text{HW}^{>}, HW≥superscriptHW\\text{HW}^{\\geq} similarly. We denote the support of a signature f𝑓f by supp​(f)supp𝑓\\text{supp}(f), which contains all input strings that give non-zero evaluations. In this paper, we also denote a string α∈supp​(f)𝛼supp𝑓\\alpha\\in\\text{supp}(f) as a support of f𝑓f for convenience, without causing ambiguity. If supp​(f)⊆HW=supp𝑓superscriptHW\\text{supp}(f)\\subseteq\\text{HW}^{=}, we call it an EO signature. For any Eulerian graph G𝐺G, let EO​(G)EO𝐺\\textsf{EO}(G) be all possible Eulerian orientations of G𝐺G. Under a certain orientation in EO​(G)EO𝐺\\textsf{EO}(G), we assign 00 to the head and 111 to the tail of each edge. Therefore, an Eulerian orientation corresponds to an assignment to the ends of each edge, and for each vertex the number of ends adjacent to it and assigned 00 is equal to the number of those assigned 111 . [ref]15\nA #​EO#EO\\#\\textsf{EO} problem #​EO​(ℱ)#EOℱ\\#\\textsf{EO}(\\mathcal{F}) parameterized by a signature set ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} of EO signatures is as the following: The input is an EO-signature grid Ω​(G,π)Ω𝐺𝜋\\Omega(G,\\pi) over ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}. Here, G𝐺G is a Eulerian graph and π:V→ℱ×S​(E​(v)):𝜋→𝑉ℱ𝑆𝐸𝑣\\pi:V\\to\\mathcal{F}\\times S(E(v)) assigns a signature fv∈ℱsubscript𝑓𝑣ℱf_{v}\\in\\mathcal{F} of arity |E​(v)|𝐸𝑣|E(v)| to v𝑣v and a linear order to E​(v)𝐸𝑣E(v) for each v∈V​(G)𝑣𝑉𝐺v\\in V(G), where E​(v)𝐸𝑣E(v) are the edges adjacent to v𝑣v. The output is the partition function of ΩΩ\\Omega, We say a framework A𝐴A is more general than B𝐵B, denoted as B⪯Aprecedes-or-equals𝐵𝐴B\\preceq A if each problem in B𝐵B can be transformed into a problem in A𝐴A in polynomial time. The relationship between these definitions are concluded in the following lemma and Figure 1. We delay the proof of Lemma 1.5 to Section 2.2. Besides, Holant is a strictly more general class than #​GH#GH\\#\\textsf{GH}, given the fact that counting perfect matchings cannot be represented by a #​GH#GH\\#\\textsf{GH} problem  while can be expressed as a Holant problem. However, the dichotomy for complex weighted Holant problems remains unsettled. There are several constructive attempts on this problem over Boolean domain. A complete dichotomy is established when all signatures are symmetric , where a signature is called symmetric when all of its values on the inputs with the same number of 1’s are the same. When signatures aren’t all symmetric, complete dichotomies have been proven for nonnegative signatures  and real signatures . Also there are dichotomies for several special forms of Holant problems such as Holant∗superscriptHolant\\textsf{Holant}^{*} , Holant+superscriptHolant\\textsf{Holant}^{+}  and HolantcsuperscriptHolant𝑐\\textsf{Holant}^{c} [ref]1 with some given auxiliary signatures, even complex weighted.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: an Eulerian orientation corresponds to an assignment to the ends of each edge, and for each vertex the number of ends adjacent to it and assigned 00 is equal to the number of those assigned 111 .
