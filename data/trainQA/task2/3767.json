Corollary 27. Our hardness results are based on the algebraic theory of\nminions [ref]5, briefly introduced in Section 4.

This is the full version of an ICALP 2022 paper , which showed weaker\ntractability and intractability results.\nFirstly, in  \\NP-hardness of only PCSP⁡(𝐋𝐎kr,𝐋𝐎k+1r)PCSPsuperscriptsubscript𝐋𝐎𝑘𝑟superscriptsubscript𝐋𝐎𝑘1𝑟\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\mathbf{LO}_{k}^{r},\\mathbf{LO}_{k+1}^{r}) was shown for\nk≥2𝑘2k\\geq 2 and r≥5𝑟5r\\geq 5.\nSecondly, in  we designed an algorithm that, for a given 333-uniform hypergraph that admits an LO 222-colouring, finds an LO k𝑘k-colouring with k=O​(n​log⁡log⁡n/log⁡n)𝑘𝑂𝑛𝑛𝑛k=O(\\sqrt{n\\log\\log n}/\\log n).111The previous version of this paper  also contains a weaker result for 444-uniform hypergraphs.\nSome of the techniques used to establish the tractability result in the current paper are different in character to those used for approximate graph colouring, which was the main technique used in the tractability result in .\nIn particular, the techniques in  (see also the full version ) built on  . We note that we do not know how to apply the SDP-based methods from  directly as they seem specific to approximate graph colouring and less suited for LO colourings.222Interestingly, the approximability result for the independent set problem from , which we will use as a black-box in Section 3, does build on .\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: As in\nExample 1, this is obviously possible for k​(n)=n𝑘𝑛𝑛k(n)=n.
