      "content": "Paper Title: AR-TTA: A Simple Method for Real-World Continual Test-Time Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTest-time adaptation (TTA).\nDomain adaptation methods can be split into different categories based on what information is assumed to be available during adaptation . While in some scenarios, access to some labels in target distribution is available, the most common is unsupervised domain adaptation, which assumes that the model has access to labeled source data and unlabeled target data at adaptation time. Popular approaches are based on either minimizing the discrepancy between the source and target feature\ndistributions [ref]12 [ref]17. Alternative approaches are based on self-training, which uses the model’s predictions on the target domain as\npseudo-labels to guide the model adaptation  . Additionally, in test-time adaptation the model needs to adapt to the test-time distribution on the fly, in an online fashion. In the test-time training (TTT) method  the model solves self-supervised tasks on the incoming batches of data to update its parameters.\nTENT  updates only batch-norm statistics to minimize predictions entropy. This assumes that updating only batch norm statistics is sufficient to solve the problem, which might not be the case for real-world scenarios.\nEATA  further improves the efficiency of test-time adaptation methods, by using only diverse and reliable samples (with low prediction entropy). Additionally, it uses EWC  regularization to prevent drastic changes in parameters important for the source domain. Contrary to the TENT and EATA approaches, CoTTA [ref]39 updates the whole model. To prevent performance degradation it uses exponential weight averaging as well as stochastic model restoration, where randomly selected weights are reset to the source model.\nSAR  further improves by removing noisy\ntest samples with large gradients and adding loss components that encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum. Nevertheless, they also use model reset, to prevent forgetting. TTA benchmarks.\nThe most popular setting for test-time adaptation includes using different classes of synthetic corruptions proposed in , which are then utilized for test-time adaptation, one at a time (so allowing model reset between different domains).\nHowever, in practical applications, the target distribution can easily change perpetually over time,\ne.g., due to changing weather and lightness conditions, or due to sensor corruptions,\nhence the setting of continual test-time adaptation was recently introduced [ref]39.\nThe authors proposed to use a continual version of the corrupted benchmark (that is without model reset at domain boundaries). Another popular dataset for continual test-time adaptation is DomainNet  which consists of images in different domains (e.g., sketches, infographics). Yet, the distribution shifts arising in the real world may be very different from the synthetic ones. Hence, recently a CLAD, autonomous driving benchmark  was introduced. It consists of naturally occurring distribution shifts like changes in weather and lighting conditions, traffic intensity, etc. It was developed for the supervised Continual Learning scenario. In this work, we use it for test-time adaptation, that is without using any label information.\nIn our work, we also use SHIFT benchmark , a synthetically generated dataset for autonomous driving with realistic discrete and continuous shifts.\nSimilarly to use, CoTTA [ref]39 includes realistic domain shifts but their test is very small (1600 images).\nTo sum up, we extend over previous TTA work by focusing on realistic continual domain shifts over very long sequences. Continual Learning.\nOur work is also inspired by continual learning where the learner is presented with data from different tasks in a sequential fashion. Without access to the previous data from previous tasks, the model is prone to catastrophic forgetting . Popular approaches use knowledge distillation to regularize changes in outputs of the model (compared to the model train on source task)  or regularize changes in model parameters . On the other hand, exemplar-based approaches assume some limited access to the source data, which greatly helps to reduce the forgetting . Further, some continual learning approaches focus on online setting, where each data point can be visited only once and small batch sizes are assumed .\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: has access to labeled source data and unlabeled target data at adaptation time.
