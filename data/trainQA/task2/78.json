(9)] which corresponds to\nproblem (2)\nwith RW​(𝐖)=0subscript𝑅𝑊𝐖0R_{W}({\\bf W})=0, where\nW¯¯𝑊\\overline{W} (resp. W¯¯𝑊\\underline{W}) is set to the maximum (resp. minimum) value of 𝐗𝐗{\\bf X}, and ρ,ν>0𝜌𝜈0\\rho,\\nu>0 are two penalty parameters.\nIf not mentioned specifically, we set ρ=10−8×‖𝐗‖F2N𝜌superscript108superscriptsubscriptnorm𝐗𝐹2𝑁\\rho=10^{-8}\\times\\frac{\\|{\\bf X}\\|_{F}^{2}}{N} and ν=10−10×‖𝐗‖F2N𝜈superscript1010superscriptsubscriptnorm𝐗𝐹2𝑁\\nu=10^{-10}\\times\\frac{\\|{\\bf X}\\|_{F}^{2}}{N}. Detailed explanation of RH​(𝐇p)subscript𝑅𝐻subscript𝐇𝑝R_{H}({\\bf H}_{p}) and choice of parameters can be found in [ref]44. State-of-the-art distributed clustering methods will also be considered as benchmarks. Datasets: Four kinds of datasets are considered for evaluation, including synthetic data, the TDT2 data , the TCGA data , and the MNIST data .\nSpecifically, we follow the Gaussian linear model 𝐗=𝐖𝐇+𝐄𝐗𝐖𝐇𝐄{\\bf X}={\\bf W}{\\bf H}+{\\bf E} in  to generate a synthetic dataset with M=2000,N=10000formulae-sequence𝑀2000𝑁10000M=2000,N=10000 and K=20𝐾20K=20, where 𝐄∈ℝM×N𝐄superscriptℝ𝑀𝑁{\\bf E}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{M\\times N} denotes the Gaussian noise and the signal to noise ratio (SNR) =10​log10⁡(‖𝐖𝐇‖F2/‖𝐄‖F2)absent10subscript10superscriptsubscriptnorm𝐖𝐇𝐹2superscriptsubscriptnorm𝐄𝐹2=10\\log_{10}(\\|{\\bf W}{\\bf H}\\|_{F}^{2}/\\|{\\bf E}\\|_{F}^{2}) dB is set to −33-3 dB. The TDT2 dataset is extracted from the TDT2 corpus which contains 9394 documents in the largest 30 categories, i.e. K=30,N=9394,M=5000formulae-sequence𝐾30formulae-sequence𝑁9394𝑀5000K=30,N=9394,M=5000. The TCGA dataset is obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database which contains the gene expression data of 5314 cancer samples belonging to 20 cancer types, i.e. K=20,N=5314,M=5000formulae-sequence𝐾20formulae-sequence𝑁5314𝑀5000K=20,N=5314,M=5000. Note that the features of the TCGA and TDT2 datasets are chosen as top-ranked ones by the Pearson’s Chi-Squared Test. Lastly, following , we generate a MNIST dataset with K=10,N=10000,M=784formulae-sequence𝐾10formulae-sequence𝑁10000𝑀784K=10,N=10000,M=784. We distribute the samples of each dataset to P=100𝑃100P=100 clients in two ways: Case 1: we follow [ref]37 to obtain balanced and i.i.d. distributed data for the four datasets, respectively.\nCase 2: For the synthetic, TDT2 and TCGA datasets, we follow the similarity-based partition [ref]37 where the K-means algorithm is applied to the dataset to cluster it into 100100100 clusters, and each of the cluster is assigned to one client. This leads to a highly unbalanced and non-i.i.d. dataset. For the MNIST dataset, we follow  to obtain a distributed data where each of the client\ncontains images of two digits only and the numbers of samples among clients are highly unbalanced.

Communication cost:\nOnly the uplink communication cost is considered since it is the primary bottleneck when P𝑃P is large.\nWe define the communication cost as the accumulated number of real values sent to the server. For the s𝑠sth round, the accumulated communication cost of FedMAvg is s​(m​M​K)𝑠𝑚𝑀𝐾s(mMK) while that of FedMGS is s​(m​M​K+m​K2)𝑠𝑚𝑀𝐾𝑚superscript𝐾2s(mMK+mK^{2}).
