      "content": "Paper Title: Unlocking the Emotional World of Visual Media:An Overview of the Science, Research, and Impact of Understanding Emotion Drawing insights from psychology, engineering, and the arts, this article provides a comprehensive overview of the field of emotion analysis in visual media, and discusses the latest research, systems, challenges, ethical implications, and potential impact of artificial emotional intelligence on society.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPrior to the emergence of deep learning, visual emotion features were primarily developed manually, drawing inspiration from various interrelated disciplines including computer vision, art theory, psychology, and aesthetics. One straightforward approach employs existing low-level vision features as representations of emotion. Yanulevskaya et al.  extracted holistic Wiccest and Gabor features. Other researchers have employed scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), self-similarities, GIST, and local binary patterns (LBP) to extract low-level vision representations of emotion for video keyframes  . Yang et al.  compared their method with multiple low-level vision features, including SIFT, HOG, and Gabor.\nRao et al.  first employed bag-of-visual-words of SIFT features for each image block from multiple scales and then represented each block by extracting latent topics based on probabilistic latent semantic analysis. While such low-level vision representations are still used, such as LBP and optical flows , they do not effectively bridge the semantic gap and cannot bridge the more challenging affective gap . More robust approaches to exploring visual emotion features employ theories on art and aesthetics to design and develop features.\nArt is often created with the intention of evoking emotional reactions from the audience.\nAs Pablo Picasso claims, “Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life,” and as Paul Cézanne asserts, “A work of art which did not begin in emotion is not art,”  [ref]188 . Generally, art theory includes elements of art and principles of art. The elements of art, such as color, line, texture, shape, and form, serve as building blocks in creating artwork. Meanwhile, the principles of art correspond to the rules, tools, or guidelines for arranging and orchestrating the elements of art, such as balance, emphasis, harmony, variety, and gradation. Among these elements, color is the most commonly used artistic feature        , followed by texture. Lu et al.  investigated the relationship between shape and emotions through an in-depth statistical analysis. Zhao et al. [ref]188 systematically formulated and implemented six artistic principles except for rhythm and proportion and combined them into a unified representation. Aesthetics is widely acknowledged to have a strong correlation with emotion  . Artwork that is aesthetically designed tends to attract viewers’ attention and create a sense of immersion. As early as 2006, Datta et al. developed computer algorithms to predict the aesthetic quality of images . Among the various aesthetic features, composition, such as the rule of thirds, has been the most popular      . The figure-ground relationship, which refers to cognitive feasibility in distinguishing the foreground and the background, and several other aesthetic features were designed . Sartori et al.  to analyze the influence of different color combinations on evoking binary sentiment from abstract paintings. Artistic principles and aesthetics were used to organize artistic elements from different but correlated perspectives, which were sometimes not clearly differentiated and extracted together  . By considering relationships among different elements, artistic principles and aesthetics have been demonstrated to be more interpretable, robust, and accurate than artistic elements and low-level vision representations for recognizing evoked emotions  [ref]188. To bridge the gap between low-level visual features and high-level semantics, an intermediate level of attributes and characteristics was designed. These intermediate attributes and characteristics were then applied to the prediction of evoked emotions    . For example, in addition to generic scene attributes, eigenface-based facial expressions were also considered . These attributes performed better than low-level vision representations, but the interpretability was still limited. High-level content and concept play an essential role in evoking emotions for images with obvious semantics, such as natural images. The number and size of faces and skins contained in an image have been used as an early and simple content representation . Facial expressions of images containing faces are a direct cue for viewers to produce emotional reactions and are therefore often employed as content representation  . Jiang et al.  developed a method that involved detecting objects and scenes from keyframes. Based on the observation that general nouns like “baby” were detectable but had a weak link to emotion, whereas adjectives like “crying” could provide strong emotional information but were difficult to detect, Borth et al.  introduced adjective noun pairs (ANPs) by adding an adjective before a noun, such as “crying baby.” The combination enabled strong ability to map concepts to emotions while remaining detectable. A large visual sentiment ontology named SentiBank was proposed to detect the probability of 1,200 ANPs. Thus, as a milestone, SentiBank cannot be ignored as a baseline in performance evaluation, even in the current deep learning era. A multilingual visual sentiment ontology (MVSO)  was later extended to deal with different cultures and languages. About 16K sentiment-biased visual concepts across 12 languages are constructed and detected. ANP representations are widely used as high-level semantic representations     . These content and concept representations achieve the best performance for the images containing such semantics but fail for abstract paintings. Fortunately, the rise of deep and very deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in image classification has led to deep learning becoming the primary learning strategy in various fields, including computer vision and natural language processing. This is also the case for evoked emotion modeling . Given sufficient annotated data, deep learning models can be trained to achieve superior performance on various types of images, including natural and social photographs, as well as abstract and artistic paintings. In many cases, features are automatically learned without the need for manual crafting. Recently, global representation at the image level has been demonstrated to hold promise for evoked emotion analysis.\nOne approach to extract deep features is to directly apply pretrained CNNs, such as AlexNet , VGGNet , and ResNet , to the given images and obtain responses of the last (few) fully connected (FC) layers           . Other methods have begun to use the output of a transformer’s encoder as visual reorientation  . Xu et al.  demonstrated that the deep features from the last but one FC layer outperformed those from the last FC layer. The extracted CNN features were transformed to another kernelized space via discrete Fourier transform and sparse representation to suppress the impact of noise in videos .\nChen et al.  first obtained event, object, and scene scores with state-of-the-art pretrained detectors based on deep neural networks. They then integrated these into a context fusion network to generate a unified representation. More recently, Song et al.  used the pretrained MS Azure Cognitive Service API to extract objects contained in an image and corresponding confidence scores as visual hints, which were then transformed to TF-IDF representation.\nThis pretrained deep feature can be essentially viewed as another handcrafted feature since the classifier used for the final emotion prediction needs to be separately trained. To enable end-to-end training, fine-tuning is widely employed to adjust the deep features to be more correlated with evoked emotions    . Other inspiring improvements include multitask learning   and emotion correlation mining    to better learn emotion-specific deep features. The image-level global representation extracts deep features from the global aspect taking the original image as input. To deal with the temporal correlations among successive frames in videos, 3-D CNN (C3D)  is adopted taking a series of frames as input . Although contextual information is considered, the global representation treats local regions equally without considering their importance. Strategies such as attention     and sentiment maps   have been widely used to extract region-level representations in order to emphasize the importance of local regions in evoked emotion prediction. Spatial attention is used to determine the correspondence between local image regions and detected textual visual attributes . Besides operating on the global representation to obtain attended local representation, the spatial attention map is enforced to be consistent with prior knowledge contained in the detected saliency map . Both spatial and channel-wise attentions are considered to reflect the importance of the spatial local regions and the interdependency\nbetween different channels . In contrast, Fan et al.  investigated how image emotion could be used to predict human attention and found that emotional content could strongly and briefly attract human visual attention. Yang et al.  designed a weakly supervised coupled CNN to explore local information by detecting a sentiment-specific map using a cross-spatial pooling strategy, which only required image-level labels. The holistic and local representations were combined by coupling the sentiment map. To address the issue of overemphasis on local information and neglect of some discriminative sentiment regions, a discriminate enhancement map was recently constructed by spatial weighting and channel weighting . Both the discriminate enhancement map and sentiment map were coupled with the global representation. In recent years, a growing body of research has focused on developing effective multilevel representations  [ref]230         [ref]238. One strategy has been to view different CNN layers as different levels   . Multiple levels of features were extracted at different branches (four  and four plus one main  branches). The features from different levels were then integrated by a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit  or a fusion layer with basic operations like the mean.\nThese two methods both claim that features from global to local levels can be extracted at different layers, but the correspondence between them is still unclear. This issue is partially addressed in the multilevel dependent attention network (MDAN) . Based on the assumption that different semantic levels and affective levels are correlated, affective semantic mapping disentangles the affective gap by one-to-one mapping between semantic and affective levels. Besides the global-level learning at the highest affective level with emotion hierarchy preserved, local learning is incorporated at each semantic level to differentiate\namong emotions at the corresponding affective level .\nFurther, multihead cross channel attention and level-dependent class activation maps are designed to model level-wise channel dependencies and spatial attention within each semantic level, respectively. Further research is needed to explore more effective ways to map semantic and affective levels, particularly when the number of levels varies significantly. Another strategy for extracting multilevel representations involves utilizing object, saliency, and affective region detection     [ref]238 [ref]230 . Inspired by the Stimuli-Organism-Response (S-O-R) emotion model in psychology, Yang et al.  selected specific emotional stimuli, including image-level color and region-level objects and faces, using off-the-shelf detection models. Corresponding to the selected stimuli, three specific networks were designed to extract the features, including CNN-based color and other global representations, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based semantic correlations between different objects, and CNN-based facial expressions. Besides the correlations between different objects based on graph\nconvolutional network (GCN), Yang et al.  also mined the correlations between scenes and objects using a scene-based attention mechanism, motivated by the assumption that scenes guide objects to evoke distinct emotions. A similar approach was applied by Cheng et al., but with the input to the object detector being the extracted temporal-spatial features by C3D [ref]238.\nThese methods treat objects, typically detected by Faster R-CNN, as regions, and reflect the importance of different regions through attention  or graph reasoning  [ref]238. Objects and faces were also respectively detected in  and , and corresponding CNN features were extracted. Rao et al. [ref]230 employed an emotional region proposal method to select emotional regions and remove non-emotional ones. The region’s emotion score was a combination of the probability of the region containing an object and that of the region evoking emotions. A similar approach for selecting emotionally charged regions was used by Zhang et al., but the emotion score was a weighted combination of two probabilities . Efforts have been made to combine handcrafted and deep representations in order to take advantage of their complementary information. For example, Liu et al.  combined them after feature dimension reduction, whereas Chen et al.  used AlexNet-style deep CNNs  to train ANP detectors and achieved improved ANP classification accuracy. The DeepSentiBank has also been used to extract keyframe features in videos  . More recently, the correlations of content features based on pretrained CNN and color features from color moments have been taken into consideration . Specifically, the proposed cross-correlation model consists of two modules: an attention module to enhance color representation using content vectors and a convolution module to enrich content representation using pooled color embedding matrices. Further research is needed to investigate the potential of this approach to interact between handcrafted and deep representations.\n\nReference markers found: [188]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]188: from the audience.\nAs Pablo Picasso claims, “Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life,” and as Paul Cézanne asserts, “A work of art which did not begin in emotion is not art,”  [ref]188 .

The elements of art, such as color, line, texture, shape, and form, serve as building blocks in creating artwork.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
