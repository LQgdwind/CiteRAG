      "content": "Paper Title: TabEAno: Table to Knowledge Graph Entity Annotation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe categorize the tasks of table annotation as two main tasks e.g., structure, and semantic annotation. The structure annotation contains many sub-tasks as table type prediction, data type prediction, table header annotation, core attribute prediction, and holistic matching across tables . In this paper, we assume that the input tables are relational vertical types, and these are independence to each other. So that, we only perform the sub-tasks of data-type prediction, table header annotation, and core attribute prediction in TabEAno. Semantic annotation involves of matching table elements into knowledge concepts such as schema-level matching e.g, tables to classes, columns to properties    or classes2, and data-level matching e.g., rows   or cells  2 [ref]12 to entities. In this study, we focus on the task of rows to entities annotation.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: of matching table elements into knowledge concepts such as schema-level matching e.g, tables to classes, columns to properties    or classes2, and data-level matching e.g., rows   or cells  2 [ref]12 to entities. In this study, we focus on the task of rows to entities annotation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
