      "content": "Paper Title: Temporal Kernel Consistency for Blind Video Super-Resolution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMulti-frame Super Resolution (MFSR) uses a set of 2​N2𝑁2N supporting LR frames {yt−N,⋯,yt−1,yt+1,⋯,yt+N}subscript𝑦𝑡𝑁⋯subscript𝑦𝑡1subscript𝑦𝑡1⋯subscript𝑦𝑡𝑁\\{y_{t-N},\\dotsb,y_{t-1},y_{t+1},\\dotsb,y_{t+N}\\} to upscale the reference LR frame ytsubscript𝑦𝑡y_{t} at time t𝑡t, utilizing temporal information across frames. The degradation process is usually expressed as follows: where y𝑦y and x𝑥x are the LR and HR image respectively, k𝑘k is the blur kernel, ↓ssubscript↓𝑠\\downarrow_{s} is the downscaling operation (e.g. sub-sampling) using scaling factor s𝑠s, n𝑛n is the additive noise, i=−N,⋯,N𝑖𝑁⋯𝑁i={-N,\\dotsb,N}, and F𝐹F is the warping matrix w.r.t the optical flow applied on xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x_{t}. The image warping process can either be done explicitly via an optical flow or implicitly via dynamically-generated filters  or deformable convolutions .\nThe process of applying k𝑘k together with the ↓ssubscript↓𝑠\\downarrow_{s} is also referred to as applying a downscaling kernel or SR kernel  [ref]12.\nTraditionally, a prior term is individually hand-crafted for xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x_{t}, kt+isubscript𝑘𝑡𝑖k_{t+i} and Ft→t+isubscript𝐹→𝑡𝑡𝑖{F_{t\\rightarrow{t+i}}}, but most deep learning-based approaches capture the prior [ref]6 through CNNs by training it using a large amount of examples. In order to solve for k𝑘k and x𝑥x, state-of-the-art blind image-based algorithms split the problem into two sub-problems, estimating k𝑘k and restoring x𝑥x, and address each problem sequentially  [ref]12 or alternately [ref]41 .\nMFSR solutions, on the other hand, include an additional sub-problem of estimating the motion between each supporting frame and its reference frame in order to perform motion compensation and hence leverage the temporal frame information during restoration.\nAlthough previous traditional video SR approaches   assume that the kernel varies across frames, recent works  0 assume a fixed kernel.\nIn our work, we study and highlight the implications of both assumptions and advocate for the per-frame kernel approach, resulting in the following optimization problem: where x^^𝑥\\hat{x}, k^^𝑘\\hat{k}, and F^^𝐹\\hat{F} are the estimated HR image x𝑥x, kernel k𝑘k, and warping matrix F𝐹F respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: filters  or deformable convolutions .\nThe process of applying k𝑘k together with the ↓ssubscript↓𝑠\\downarrow_{s} is also referred to as applying a downscaling kernel or SR kernel  [ref]12.\nTraditionally, a prior term is individually hand-crafted for xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x_{t}, kt+isubscript𝑘𝑡𝑖k_{t+i} and Ft→t+isubscript𝐹→𝑡𝑡𝑖{F_{t\\rightarrow{t+i}}}, but most deep learning-based\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
