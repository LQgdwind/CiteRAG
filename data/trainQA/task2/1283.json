      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Reduce Defocus Blur by Realistically Modeling Dual-Pixel Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate our proposed RDPD and other existing defocus deblurring methods: the DP deblurring network (DPDNet) , the edge-based defocus blur (EBDB) , the defocus map estimation network (DMENet) [ref]24, and the just noticeable blur (JNB)  estimation. DPDNet  is the only method that utilizes DP data for deblurring, and the others  [ref]24  use only a single image as input (i.e., IlsubscriptI𝑙\\mathrm{I}_{l}) and estimate the defocus map in order to feed it to an off-the-shelf deconvolution method (i.e.,  ). EBDB  and JNB  are not learning-based methods; thus, we can test them directly. For the learning-based DMENet method, we cannot retrain it with the Canon data , as it does not provide the ground truth defocus map. However, with our data generator we are able to generate defocus maps, which allows us to retrain DMENet with our synthetically generated data. Settings to generate DP data. For our DP data generator, we define five camera parameter sets – namely, {4,5,6},{5,8,6},{7,5,8},{10,13,12},{22,10,30}456586758101312221030\\{4,5,6\\},\\{5,8,6\\},\\{7,5,8\\},\\{10,13,12\\},\\{22,10,30\\} – such that each set represents focal length, aperture size, and focus distance. Given the depth range found in the SYNTHIA dataset 6, these camera sets cover a wide range of front- as well as back-focus CoC sizes. For each image sequence in the SYNTHIA dataset, we generate five sequences based on the predefined camera sets. The radial distortion coefficients are set accordingly for each camera set. For the DP PSFs, we generate many representative PSF shapes by varying the parameters in the given ranges n∈{3,6,9}𝑛369n\\in\\{3,6,9\\}, α∈{0.4,0.6,0.8,1}𝛼0.40.60.81\\alpha\\in\\{0.4,0.6,0.8,1\\}, β∈{0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4}𝛽0.10.20.30.4\\beta\\in\\{0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4\\}, and κ=0.14𝜅0.14\\kappa=0.14. Image noise layer strength is chosen randomly, where σ∈{5​e−2,5.5​e−2,⋯,5​e−1}𝜎5superscript𝑒25.5superscript𝑒2⋯5superscript𝑒1\\sigma\\in\\{5e^{-2},5.5e^{-2},\\cdots,5e^{-1}\\}. These parameters are set empirically to model real camera hardware. More detail is provided in the supplemental material. We divide the SYNTHIA dataset 6 into training and testing sequences. We generate five sets of blurred images for each image sequence. In total, we synthesize 2023 training and 201 testing blurred DP views. Though our synthetic DP data generator enables an unlimited number of images to be generated, we found this number of images sufficient for training. In addition to our synthetically generated DP data, we use the DP ground truth data from  with 300300300 training, 747474 validation, and 767676 testing pairs of blurred images (with DP views) and corresponding sharp images. RDPD settings and training procedure. We set the size of the convLSTM to 512512512 units. For patch-wise training, we fix the size of input and output layers to 512×512×75125127512\\times 512\\times 7 and 512×512×35125123512\\times 512\\times 3, respectively. We initialize the weights of the convolutional layers using He’s initialization 5 and use the Adam optimizer  to train the model. The initial learning rate is 5×10−55superscript1055\\times 10^{-5}, which is decreased by half every 40 epochs. For domain generalization from synthetic to real data 2 [ref]41, we train our model iteratively using mini-batches of real (i.e., single image) as well as synthetic data (i.e., image sequence), where the patches are randomly cropped at each iteration. This type of iterative image/image sequence training becomes feasible since our recurrent model RDPD allows training and testing with any number of frames, and it does not need to be preset beforehand. We set the mini-batch size for the real data iteration to eight batches, because the dataset of real data has only single-image examples (i.e., no image sequences). For the synthetic data iteration, we set the mini-batch size to two sequences each of size four frames. We define three scales for our edge loss – namely, m∈{3,7,11}𝑚3711m\\in\\{3,7,11\\}. The λ𝜆\\lambda terms are found to be effective at λx=0.03subscript𝜆𝑥0.03\\lambda_{x}=0.03 and λy=0.02subscript𝜆𝑦0.02\\lambda_{y}=0.02. To avoid overfitting, the dropout layer in the convLSTM is set to 0.40.40.4. Our model converges after 140 epochs. Although we train on image patches, our RDPD (with convLSTM) is fully convolutional and enables testing on full-resolution inputs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in our model, an ablation study of different training settings is provided in the supplemental material. Single image results. We evaluate our proposed RDPD against existing defocus deblurring methods for single-image inputs. For methods that utilize DP views for the input image (i.e., RDPD and DPDNet ), we introduce variations on the training data used for more comprehensive evaluations. The variations are RDPD+ and DPDNet+ that are trained on both Canon DP data from  combined with synthetic DP data generated by the process described in Sec. 2. The RDPD without the ++ sign is our baseline trained with synthetically generated DP data only. The DPDNet without the ++ is trained on Canon data only. In Table 1, we report quantitative results on real Canon DP data from  using standard metrics – namely, MAE, PSNR, SSIM, and time. We also report the Naturalness Image Quality (NIQE) metric of the output deblurred images with respect to a reference model derived from the DP GT images. In general, our RDPD+ has the best overall PSNR compared to other methods. Particularly, RDPD+ achieves the best PSNR and MAE for both indoor and combined categories, and all with our lighter-weight network that enabled the fastest inference time. For the Outdoor dataset, the PSNR of RDPD+ is slightly lower (i.e., 0.080.080.08dB) due to the fact that the Outdoor dataset is imperfect as a result of the capturing process (see Fig. 3). DP cameras do not enable simultaneous capture of the DP images and corresponding ground truth sharp image (i.e., the image pairs can be captured only in succession at different times). As a result, the Outdoor ground-truth is imperfect with small local motion and illumination variations. The Indoor ground-truth is captured in more controlled conditions and has fewer imperfections. The slightly better performance of DPDNet for outdoor scenes is because DPDNet is learning to compensate for imperfections in the Outdoor dataset. A key strength of our work is the ability to synthetically generate DP data that is not impeded by imperfections of manual capture. RDPD+ is trained on the Outdoor dataset as well as the synthetically generated data (without such imperfections) debiasing the result from the imperfect ground-truth. The consequence is reduced fidelity to the imperfect ground-truth (in terms of PSNR/SSIM), but better defocus deblur performance overall. Similar behavior is observed when DPDNet is trained with Canon data and our synthetically generated data (i.e., DPDNet+). In Fig. 7, we also provide qualitative results of RDPD compared to other methods on data captured by Canon DSLR and Pixel 4 cameras. In general, RDPD+ is able to recover more details from the input deblurred image. Additionally, Fig. 7 demonstrates that the baseline RDPD achieves good deblurring results on Canon and Pixel 4 data despite being trained with synthetic data only. This result demonstrates the accuracy of the proposed framework for synthetic DP data generation and the ability of the recurrent model to generalize to different cameras. It can also be seen that DPDNet+ has improved results compared to DPDNet, demonstrating the benefit gained by DPDNet+ through the addition of synthetic DP data on training. The supplemental material contains more quantitative results, visual comparisons, and animated deblurring examples for both Canon and Pixel 4 cameras. Image sequence results. Our RDPD is designed to handle input image sequences. Here, we investigate the improvement gained by training with image sequences vs. single frames. For this comparison, we introduce the RDPD+ variant sRDPD+, which is trained with single-frame inputs. As previously mentioned, there is no camera that enables access to DP views for video data. Nevertheless, we mimic the same capturing procedure in  in order to capture a sequence of images. We performed four captures of the same scene with small camera motion introduced between the captures. Each image has its own DP views and is captured at narrow and wide apertures. Fig. 8 presents the results on the sequence of images. The effectiveness of training with image sequences with RDPD+ can be seen from the average PSNR gain (i.e., +0.40.4+0.4dB) compared to sRDPD+ trained using single-image inputs. Table 2 shows the quantitative results on our synthetically generated DP image sequences. Our method RDPD+ (trained on multiple frames) achieves the best results as it utilizes the convLSTM architecture to better model the temporal dependencies in an image sequence. Recall that our RDPD network is lighter and has a much lower number of weights compared to DPDNet.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: We evaluate our proposed RDPD and other existing defocus deblurring methods: the DP deblurring network (DPDNet) , the edge-based defocus blur (EBDB) , the defocus map estimation network (DMENet) [ref]24, and the just noticeable blur (JNB)  estimation.
