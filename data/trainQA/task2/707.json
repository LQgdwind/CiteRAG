Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

More recently,¬†  [ref]8 showed that deep RL agents are also vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, including adversarial perturbations on agents‚Äô observations and actions¬†  [ref]8, mis-specification on the environment¬†[ref]20, adversarial disruptions on the agents¬† and other adversarial agents ¬†. For a review of different attack and defense settings in RL see Ilahi et al. . In this paper, we focus on ‚Ñìpsubscript‚Ñìùëù\\ell_{p}-norm adversarial perturbations on agents‚Äô observations since this threat model is adopted by many of the existing works investigating adversarial robustness of deep RL¬†  [ref]8      . However, our framework is not limited to ‚Ñìpsubscript‚Ñìùëù\\ell_{p}-norm perturbation and in fact can be easily extended to semantic perturbations (e.g. rotations, color/brightness changes, etc) for vision-based deep RL agents (e.g. atari games) by leveraging the techniques proposed in¬†.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: The topic of adversarial examples in supervised learning tasks has been extensively studied, especially for DNN classifiers¬† [ref]19.
