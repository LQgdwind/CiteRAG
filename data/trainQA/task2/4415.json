      "content": "Paper Title: PhishSim: Aiding Phishing Website Detection with a Feature-Free Tool\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis study proposes a feature-free method for detecting phishing websites, which we argue would be suitable with the dynamic characteristics of phishing attacks. As reported by PhishLabs [ref]32, phishing attackers have been persistently adapting to new opportunities and changing the manner in which they adapt. Furthermore, a study by Cui et al.  found that around 90% of phishing websites are variations or replicas of other phishing websites. There has also been an increased use of phishing kits, which ease the process of setting up phishing websites, enabling attackers to launch a large number of phishing attacks in a short period of time. As discussed in Section 5.1, we found that these kits make the process of changing the phishing website layout and style more effortless. Based on the experiments in Section 8.1 and Section 8.3, our proposed method is able to outperform the hierarchical-clustering based method by Cui et al.  and Doc2Vec based method by Feng et al.  based on its AUC score. PhishSim achieves a high TPR of around 90% while maintaining a low FPR of 0.58%. We can also apply this method to build a model which can incrementally learn using one week of data to perform phishing detection with relative success. Evaluating our detection method in comparison with state-of-the-art methods, it has also been shown that PhishSim is able to outperform past studies with significant improvements in terms of true positive rate and with a relatively low FPR which is suitable for phishing detection. It has also been shown that we are able to improve the phishing detection performance when combining PhishSim with proportional distance, as shown in Table 4. Using this combined method, we could operate at an even lower FPR of 0.09% with a TPR of 88.37% and accuracy of 99.82%. The method that we proposed is a feature-free method, which means that our method is not tied to a fixed website representation (Table 1) and is more robust compared to feature-based methods which rely on specific features. On the other hand, the method by Cui et al.  uses the proportional distance which measures website similarity based on the number of occurrences of a set of predefined HTML tags and assumes that similar websites have a nearly identical number of HTML tag counts. While phishing websites that use custom HTML tags are not very common currently, the use of WebComponents  provide a method to perform novel website obfuscation technique using custom HTML tags to avoid detection from content-based methods which heavily relies on the analysis of the HTML content. While adding HTML tag definition and model training are possible, phishing attacks are very dynamic and aggressive with changes in evasive phishing campaign methods every 37 days in average . Having the flexibility to perform detection based on similarities without reliance on a preset corpus would be a great benefit to counteract the dynamics of phishing. Similarly, the approach by Feng et al.  uses a trained Doc2Vec model to generate vector representation for each website. It is not guaranteed that the generated vectors are always representative over time. To have an accurate detection, these methods rely on the assumption that the website representation would always remain relevant, which might not always be the case. Some features that were previously used to detect phishing websites accurately (e.g., bad forms, bad action fields, and non-matching URLs ) may no longer be relevant to phishing attacks. A past study investigated the relevance of these features in a phishing dataset collected in 2020 and has shown that only 8.90% of the phishing websites contain bad forms, while only 19.95% and 47.92% of them contain bad action fields and non-matching URLs respectively . On the other hand, NCD as a similarity measure is universal and is purely based on the shared information between measured websites. Every phishing cluster is represented by a data instance, while the NCD value is used for measuring the relationship between all pairs of websites. Furthermore, the use of the Furthest Point First (FPF) algorithm provides a systematic way for prototype learning such that it does not require the data to be represented in a fixed vector representation or data structure. This is unlike most clustering and classification algorithms which require the data to be represented as a vector of representative feature values. Once the selected feature values are no longer relevant for phishing attacks, there is a risk of missing malicious phishing attacks. Meanwhile, our feature-free method would still be able to continuously identify these attacks with a maintained up-to-date phishing data and without the reliance on a specific feature set. Robustness against code obfuscation is generally a concern when the detection approach evaluates the website’s HTML source code. However, as stated in Section 4, PhishSim evaluates the HTML of the rendered page instead of the HTML source code. A web browser will produce the same HTML code regardless of the HTML obfuscation or hidden alterations in the CSS or JavaScript files. Furthermore, we also removed the text and HTML comments in the content prior to performing compression, leaving only the HTML tags which are rendered and visually shown on the browser. Thus, the performance will also be unaffected by addition of invisible elements in the HTML.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: This study proposes a feature-free method for detecting phishing websites, which we argue would be suitable with the dynamic characteristics of phishing attacks.
