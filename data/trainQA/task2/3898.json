      "content": "Paper Title: Scene Consistency Representation Learning for Video Scene Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSelf-Supervised Learning in Images and Videos.\nTo address the problems of the insufficient and expensive manual annotation, many approaches explore the inherent knowledge in unlabeled data by designing a lot of pretext tasks, including predicting the transformations of images, e.g., image rotation [ref]20, inpainting , colorizing , jigsaw , etc.\nIn short, these Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods use the information explored from the data themselves for the supervision.\nRecently,   [ref]13      introduce the contrastive similarity metrics to learn invariant feature representation of various views augmented from the original image,\nwhere strong data augmentations [ref]13 are frequently used in image-level SSL methods to improve the robustness of the learned representations.\nFrom another aspect, by finetuning the model with a small amount of labeled data, SSL methods can achieve competitive performance compared with supervised learning methods, furthermore, the pretrained model can be used in specific downstream tasks.\nFor video-oriented SSL methods,        show the appealing performance and potential on the task of video classification, while their positive pairs are selected from the adjacent clips within a same video. Meanwhile, most of studies are based on short videos and the quality of learned features is assessed based on video classification.\nHence, it is meaningful to explore a suitable SSL scheme for tasks with long-term videos. Video Shot Boundary Detection and Scene Segmentation.\nFor Video Scene Segmentation, shot boundary detection is often conducted in advance, which is specified as a task of locating the transition positions in videos based on the similarity of the frames.\n3D convolutional networks and color histogram differencing  are used to identify the transition boundaries.\nBased on the shot boundaries,  learns the local and global shot representations and utilizes them to split the continuous shots into scenes according to the transition of the story.\nMore specifically, identification of each shotâ€™s segmentation point is treated as a binary classification, which is free to the location of the shot. [ref]1 leverages unlabeled video data to obtain shot representations, which outperforms many supervised learning methods on the downstream task of Video Scene Segmentation. However, this method is pretrained on the entire video data of MovieNet  that include the testing videos, i.e. the training protocol is inconsistent with that of conventional Self-Supervised Learning methods  .\nFor evaluating Video Scene Segmentation approaches, the datasets of OVSD , BBC planet earth , MovieNet  and AdCuepoints [ref]1 are frequently employed. In this work, we propose an unsupervised representation learning method based on scene consistency and a reasonable evaluation scheme for Video Scene Segmentation task.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: manual annotation, many approaches explore the inherent knowledge in unlabeled data by designing a lot of pretext tasks, including predicting the transformations of images, e.g., image rotation [ref]20, inpainting , colorizing , jigsaw , etc.\nIn short, these Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods use the information explored from the data themselves for the supervision.\nRecently,   [ref]13\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
