      "content": "Paper Title: Evaluation of creating scoring opportunities for teammates in soccer via trajectory prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the tactical behaviors of team sports,\nagents select an action that follows a policy (or strategy) in a state, receives a reward from the environment and others, and updates the state .\nThis is similar to a reinforcement learning framework (e.g., [Bernstein02]).\nDue to the difficulty in modeling the entire framework from data for various reasons  (e.g., a sparse reward and difficulty in estimating intents), we can adopt two approaches: to estimate the related variables and functions from data (i.e., inverse approach) as a sub-problem, and to build a model (e.g., reinforcement learning model) to generate data in virtual space (i.e., forward approach, e.g.,  ).\nHere, we focus on the former approach and introduce the research from the view of inverse approaches. There have been many approaches to quantitatively evaluate the actions of attacking players about the scoring, such as based on the expected scores using tracking data    0 ,\naction data such as dribbling and passing [ref]10 , and estimating state-action value function (Q-function)  3 2.\nSome researchers have evaluated passes 6  , and others evaluated actions to receive a ball by assigning a value to the location with the highest expected score 5 1 and a rule-based manner [ref]21.\nIn particular, Spearman 5 proposed an evaluation metric called OBSO to evaluate behavior based on location data and rule-based modeling.\nDefensive behaviors have also been evaluated based on data-driven 8 8 and rule-based manners (e.g., 7).\nHowever, these score evaluations do not often reflect the position of multiple defenders and goal angles in rule-based manner. From the perspective of reinforcement learning,\nthere have been many studies on inverse approaches.\nAs for the study of state evaluation, there are several studies based on score expectation (e.g.,   ) and based on the value of space (e.g.,  ).\nThere is also research on estimating reward functions by inverse reinforcement learning 5 7.\nResearchers performed trajectory prediction sometimes in terms of the policy function estimation, as imitation learning   7  and behavioral modeling 3 1 0  to mimic (not optimize) the policy using neural network approaches.\nIn this paper, we first propose a method to evaluate how the actual “off-ball” movement contributes to scoring opportunity\nbased on the difference between the state values generated from the actual and the reference policies.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: approaches to quantitatively evaluate the actions of attacking players about the scoring, such as based on the expected scores using tracking data    0 ,\naction data such as dribbling and passing [ref]10 , and estimating state-action value function (Q-function)  3 2.\nSome researchers have evaluated passes 6  , and others evaluated actions to receive a ball by assigning a value to the location\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
