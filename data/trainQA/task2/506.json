To truly understand complex systems and processes, it is not enough to view their functions as an amalgamation of independent contributors. Rather, they are a complex web of inter-operating influences. For much of the past, explainable deep learning has concerned itself with identifying important features, feature vectors, and isolated concepts. However, in the real world, humans intuitively understand that decisions are consequences of complex relations, not merely extrapolated from rankings of singular phenomena. To explain an agent’s strategy in any task — be it computer vision, natural language processing, physics, biomedicine, reinforcement learning, autonomous driving, economics, or future forecasting — is imprecise without an interactional approach.\nHowever, interactional strategies are not always summarizable by heatmaps   7 [ref]53  or ordered rankings   ; and they often require an understanding of many dependencies — complex dependencies, such as those between higher-level concepts (e.g. vector representations in deep neural networks  4 5 ) — not just single-dimensional features as typically explored in the statistical interaction effects literature   [ref]44 .\nIn light of all of this, we propose a number of contributions towards explaining interactions in deep learning: T-NID, an algorithm for statistical interaction effects that outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines with both pairwise and higher-order interactions. Interaction effects are a fundamental notion in statistics . We make this computation tractable by translating local interaction effects into global interaction effects via representative samples and employing a simple subsampling heuristic. Taylor-CAM, an explanatory tool that extends Grad-CAM , which assigns importances to feature vectors based on input gradients, by generalizing it to the 2-way and higher-order setting using the same formalism of interaction effects as for T-NID. This method is demonstrated on multi-object detection and relational reasoning in visual question-answering (VQA). Visualizations of Taylor-CAM’s explanations that enable a human cohort to reverse engineer questions in relational VQA without knowing the answers and interpret relational reasoning better than with existing explanatory tools like Grad-CAM and GLIDER [ref]44 from just a convolutional neural network’s (CNN) feature maps.\n\nReference markers found: [53]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]53: learning, autonomous driving, economics, or future forecasting — is imprecise without an interactional approach.\nHowever, interactional strategies are not always summarizable by heatmaps   7 [ref]53  or ordered rankings   ; and they often require an understanding of many dependencies — complex dependencies, such as those between higher-level concepts (e.g. vector representations in deep\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
