A natural way to provide structure to the set of all triangulations is to consider a graph, called flip graph, with the triangulations as vertices and with pairs of triangulations adjacent if they can be obtained from each other by a minimal local change, called a flip (see below for the precise definition). One of the first and most prominent results on flip graphs of planar points sets (for edge flips), proved by Lawson  in 1972, is that they are connected. The corresponding question of connectedness of flip graphs in higher dimensions remained a mystery until Santos [ref]32 showed, in 2000, that in dimension 555 and higher, there exist point sets for which the graph (for bistellar flips) is not connected. The question is still open in dimension 333 and 444. Here, we concentrate on point sets in general position in the plane and investigate “how” connected the flip graphs are, i.e., determine the largest k𝑘k (in terms of n𝑛n, the size of the underlying point set) such that k𝑘k-vertex connectivity holds. Moreover, we supply some structural results for the flip graph. The preceding discussion swept under the rug that there are several types of triangulations, most prominently full triangulations (as mostly considered in computational geometry), partial triangulations (as primarily considered in discrete geometry), and regular triangulations (also called coherent triangulations or weighted Delaunay triangulations). We will address the vertex-connectivity for full and partial triangulations, and we will discuss some implications for regular triangulations, for which the vertex-connectivity of the flip graph has been known since the late eighties via the secondary polytope introduced by Gelfand et al.  (see [11, Cor. 5.3.2]). Let us first supply the basic definitions and then discuss the results in more detail. Throughout this paper we let P𝑃P denote a finite planar point set in general position (i.e., no three points on a line) with n≥3𝑛3n\\geq 3 points. The set of extreme points of P𝑃P (i.e., the vertices of the convex hull of P𝑃P) is denoted by 𝗑𝗍𝗋​P𝗑𝗍𝗋𝑃{\\sf xtr}P, and we let P∘:=P∖𝗑𝗍𝗋​Passignsuperscript𝑃𝑃𝗑𝗍𝗋𝑃P^{\\circ}:=P\\setminus{\\sf xtr}P denote the set of inner (i.e., non-extreme) points in P𝑃P. We consistently use the notation h=h​(P):=|𝗑𝗍𝗋​P|ℎℎ𝑃assign𝗑𝗍𝗋𝑃h=h(P):=|{\\sf xtr}P| and n∘=n∘​(P):=|P∘|=n−hsuperscript𝑛superscript𝑛𝑃assignsuperscript𝑃𝑛ℎn^{\\!\\circ}=n^{\\!\\circ}(P):=|P^{\\circ}|=n-h, and we let 𝖤𝗁𝗎𝗅𝗅=𝖤𝗁𝗎𝗅𝗅​(P)⊆(P2)subscript𝖤𝗁𝗎𝗅𝗅subscript𝖤𝗁𝗎𝗅𝗅𝑃binomial𝑃2{\\sf E_{\\mathsf{hull}}}={\\sf E_{\\mathsf{hull}}}(P)\\subseteq{P\\choose 2} denote the set of edges of the convex hull of P𝑃P, |𝖤𝗁𝗎𝗅𝗅|=hsubscript𝖤𝗁𝗎𝗅𝗅ℎ|{\\sf E_{\\mathsf{hull}}}|=h. For graphs G=(P′,E)𝐺superscript𝑃′𝐸G=(P^{\\prime},E), P′⊆Psuperscript𝑃′𝑃P^{\\prime}\\subseteq P, E⊆(P′2)𝐸binomialsuperscript𝑃′2E\\subseteq{P^{\\prime}\\choose 2}, on P′superscript𝑃′P^{\\prime} we often identify edges {p,q}∈E𝑝𝑞𝐸\\{p,q\\}\\in E with their corresponding straight line segments p​q𝑝𝑞pq. We let 𝖵​G:=P′assign𝖵𝐺superscript𝑃′\\mathrm{\\sf V}G:=P^{\\prime} and 𝖤​G:=Eassign𝖤𝐺𝐸\\mathrm{\\sf E}G:=E. A graph G𝐺G on P𝑃P is plane if no two straight line segments corresponding to edges in 𝖤​G𝖤𝐺\\mathrm{\\sf E}G cross (i.e., they are disjoint except for possibly sharing an endpoint). For G𝐺G plane, the bounded connected components of the complement of the union of the edges are called regions, the set of regions of G𝐺G is denoted by 𝖱​G𝖱𝐺\\mathrm{\\sf R}G. Note that regions are open sets. Note also that isolated points in a plane graph are ignored in the definition of regions. A full triangulation of P𝑃P is a maximal plane graph T=(P,E)𝑇𝑃𝐸T=(P,E). A partial triangulation of P𝑃P is a full triangulation T=(P′,E)𝑇superscript𝑃′𝐸T=(P^{\\prime},E) with 𝗑𝗍𝗋​P⊆P′⊆P𝗑𝗍𝗋𝑃superscript𝑃′𝑃{\\sf xtr}P\\subseteq P^{\\prime}\\subseteq P (hence 𝖤𝗁𝗎𝗅𝗅⊆𝖤​Tsubscript𝖤𝗁𝗎𝗅𝗅𝖤𝑇{\\sf E_{\\mathsf{hull}}}\\subseteq\\mathrm{\\sf E}T). A regular triangulation of P𝑃P is a triangulation obtained by projecting (back to ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2}) the edges of the lower convex hull of a generic lifting of P𝑃P to ℝ3superscriptℝ3\\mathbb{R}^{3} (i.e., we add third coordinates to the points in P𝑃P so that no four lifted points are coplanar). Points in 𝖵∘​T:=P∘∩𝖵​Tassignsuperscript𝖵𝑇superscript𝑃𝖵𝑇\\mathrm{\\sf V^{\\circ}}T:=P^{\\circ}\\cap\\mathrm{\\sf V}T are called inner points of T𝑇T and points in P∘∖𝖵∘​Tsuperscript𝑃superscript𝖵𝑇P^{\\circ}\\setminus\\mathrm{\\sf V^{\\circ}}T are called skipped in T𝑇T (clearly, for a full triangulation 𝖵∘​T=P∘superscript𝖵𝑇superscript𝑃\\mathrm{\\sf V^{\\circ}}T=P^{\\circ} and no points are skipped). Edges in 𝖤∘​T:=𝖤​T∖𝖤𝗁𝗎𝗅𝗅assignsuperscript𝖤𝑇𝖤𝑇subscript𝖤𝗁𝗎𝗅𝗅\\mathrm{\\sf E^{\\circ}}T:=\\mathrm{\\sf E}T\\setminus{\\sf E_{\\mathsf{hull}}} are called inner edges and edges in 𝖤𝗁𝗎𝗅𝗅subscript𝖤𝗁𝗎𝗅𝗅{\\sf E_{\\mathsf{hull}}} are called boundary edges. 𝒯𝖿𝗎𝗅𝗅​(P)subscript𝒯𝖿𝗎𝗅𝗅𝑃{\\cal T}_{\\mathsf{full}}(P), 𝒯𝗉𝖺𝗋𝗍​(P)subscript𝒯𝗉𝖺𝗋𝗍𝑃{\\cal T}_{\\mathsf{part}}(P), and 𝒯𝗋𝖾𝗀​(P)subscript𝒯𝗋𝖾𝗀𝑃{\\cal T}_{\\mathsf{reg}}(P) will denote the set of all full, partial, and regular triangulations of P𝑃P, respectively. Every full and every regular triangulation of P𝑃P is also a partial triangulation of P𝑃P. If P𝑃P is in convex position (i.e., 𝗑𝗍𝗋​P=P𝗑𝗍𝗋𝑃𝑃{\\sf xtr}P=P), all three notions coincide. It is well-known, that there are point sets with non-regular triangulations, , see Sec. 10.2 and Fig. 29. Let T∈𝒯𝗉𝖺𝗋𝗍​(P)𝑇subscript𝒯𝗉𝖺𝗋𝗍𝑃T\\in{\\cal T}_{\\mathsf{part}}(P). An edge e∈𝖤∘​T𝑒superscript𝖤𝑇e\\in\\mathrm{\\sf E^{\\circ}}T is called flippable in T𝑇T if removing e𝑒e from T𝑇T creates a convex quadrilateral region Q𝑄Q. In this case, we denote by T​[e]𝑇delimited-[]𝑒T[e] the triangulation with the other diagonal e¯¯𝑒\\overline{e} of Q𝑄Q added instead of e𝑒e, i.e., 𝖵​T​[e]:=𝖵​Tassign𝖵𝑇delimited-[]𝑒𝖵𝑇\\mathrm{\\sf V}T[e]:=\\mathrm{\\sf V}T and 𝖤​T​[e]:=𝖤​T∖{e}∪{e¯}=𝖤​T⊕{e,e¯}assign𝖤𝑇delimited-[]𝑒𝖤𝑇𝑒¯𝑒direct-sum𝖤𝑇𝑒¯𝑒\\mathrm{\\sf E}T[e]:=\\mathrm{\\sf E}T\\setminus\\{e\\}\\cup\\{\\overline{e}\\}=\\mathrm{\\sf E}T\\oplus\\{e,\\overline{e}\\};111Here and throughout this paper, we use the notation ⊕direct-sum\\oplus for the symmetric difference between sets. we call this an edge flip. Occasionally, when we want to emphasize the new edge e¯¯𝑒\\overline{e}, we will also use the alternative notation T​[e/e¯]𝑇delimited-[]𝑒¯𝑒T[\\nicefrac{{e}}{{\\overline{e}}}] instead of T​[e]𝑇delimited-[]𝑒T[e], or write T​[e]=T​[e/e¯]𝑇delimited-[]𝑒𝑇delimited-[]𝑒¯𝑒T[e]=T[\\nicefrac{{e}}{{\\overline{e}}}]. A point p∈P∘𝑝superscript𝑃p\\in P^{\\circ} is called flippable in T𝑇T if p∈P∘∖𝖵∘​T𝑝superscript𝑃superscript𝖵𝑇p\\in P^{\\circ}\\setminus\\mathrm{\\sf V^{\\circ}}T, or if p∈𝖵∘​T𝑝superscript𝖵𝑇p\\in\\mathrm{\\sf V^{\\circ}}T is of degree 333 in T𝑇T.\n(a) If p∈P∘∖𝖵∘​T𝑝superscript𝑃superscript𝖵𝑇p\\in P^{\\circ}\\setminus\\mathrm{\\sf V^{\\circ}}T then T​[p]𝑇delimited-[]𝑝T[p] is the triangulation with p𝑝p added as a point of degree 333 (there is a unique way to do so); we call this a point insertion flip.\n(b)\nIf p∈𝖵∘​T𝑝superscript𝖵𝑇p\\in\\mathrm{\\sf V^{\\circ}}T is of degree 333 in T𝑇T then T​[p]𝑇delimited-[]𝑝T[p] is obtained by removing p𝑝p and its incident edges; we call this a point removal flip. See Fig. 1. A bistellar flip is one of the three: an edge flip, a point insertion flip, or a point removal flip. Hence, whenever we write T​[x]𝑇delimited-[]𝑥T[x] for a partial triangulation T𝑇T, then x𝑥x is either a flippable point in P∘superscript𝑃P^{\\circ} or a flippable edge in 𝖤∘​Tsuperscript𝖤𝑇\\mathrm{\\sf E^{\\circ}}T. We will use T​[x,y]𝑇𝑥𝑦T[x,y] short for (T​[x])​[y]𝑇delimited-[]𝑥delimited-[]𝑦(T[x])[y], etc. The bistellar flip graph of P𝑃P is the graph with vertex set 𝒯𝗉𝖺𝗋𝗍​(P)subscript𝒯𝗉𝖺𝗋𝗍𝑃{\\cal T}_{\\mathsf{part}}(P) and edge set {{T,T​[x]}|T∈𝒯𝗉𝖺𝗋𝗍​(P)​, x∈P∘∪𝖤∘​T flippable in ​T}conditional-set𝑇𝑇delimited-[]𝑥𝑇subscript𝒯𝗉𝖺𝗋𝗍𝑃, x∈P∘∪𝖤∘T flippable in 𝑇\\{\\{T,T[x]\\}\\,|\\,T\\in{\\cal T}_{\\mathsf{part}}(P)\\mbox{, $x\\in P^{\\circ}\\cup\\mathrm{\\sf E^{\\circ}}T$ flippable in~{}}T\\}.
