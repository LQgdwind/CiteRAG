      "content": "Paper Title: Modeling the Data-Generating Process is Necessary for Out-of-Distribution Generalization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnlike the full causal graph, attribute values as well as the relationships between class labels and attributes is often known. CACM assumes access to attribute labels 𝑨𝑨\\bm{A} only during training time, which are collected as part of the data collection process (e.g., as metadata with training data [ref]15). We start by discussing the availability of attributes in WILDS , a set of real-world datasets adapted for the domain generalization setting. Attribute labels available in the datasets include, the time (year) and region associated with satellite images in FMoW dataset  for predicting land use category, hospital from where the tissue patch was collected for tumor detection in Camelyon17 dataset  and the demographic information for CivilComments dataset .  create different domains in WILDS using this metadata, consistent with our definition of E∈𝑨𝐸𝑨E\\in\\bm{A} as a special domain attribute. In addition, CACM requires the type of relationship between label Y𝑌Y and attributes. This is often known, either based on how the dataset was collected or inferred based on domain knowledge or observation. While the distinction between 𝑨i​n​dsubscript𝑨𝑖𝑛𝑑\\bm{A}_{ind}\\> and 𝑨i​n​d¯subscript𝑨¯𝑖𝑛𝑑\\bm{A}_{\\overline{ind}}\\> can be established using a statistical test of independence on a given dataset, in general, the distinction between 𝑨c​a​u​s​e,𝑨s​e​lsubscript𝑨𝑐𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑒subscript𝑨𝑠𝑒𝑙\\bm{A}_{cause}\\>,\\bm{A}_{sel}\\> and 𝑨c​o​n​fsubscript𝑨𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑓\\bm{A}_{conf}\\> within 𝑨i​n​d¯subscript𝑨¯𝑖𝑛𝑑\\bm{A}_{\\overline{ind}}\\> needs to be provided by the user. As we show for the above datasets, the type of relationship can be inferred based on common knowledge or information on how the dataset was collected. For FMoW dataset, time can be considered an Independent attribute (𝑨i​n​dsubscript𝑨𝑖𝑛𝑑\\bm{A}_{ind}\\>) since it reflects the time at which images are captured which is not correlated with Y𝑌Y; whereas region is a Confounded attribute since certain regions associated with certain Y𝑌Y labels are over-represented due to ease of data collection. Note that region cannot lead to Causal shift since the decision to take images in a region was not determined by the final label nor Selected for the same reason that the decision was not taken based on values of Y𝑌Y. Similarly, for the Camelyon17 dataset, it is known that differences in slide staining or image acquisition leads to variation in tissue slides across hospitals, thus implying that hospital is an Independent attribute (𝑨i​n​dsubscript𝑨𝑖𝑛𝑑\\bm{A}_{ind}\\>)   ; As another example from healthcare, a study in MIT Technology Review222https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/30/1030329/machine-learning-ai-failed-covid-hospital-diagnosis-pandemic/ discusses biased data where a person’s position (𝑨c​o​n​fsubscript𝑨𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑓\\bm{A}_{conf}\\>) was spuriously correlated with disease prediction as patients lying down were more likely to be ill. As another example,   adapt MultiNLI dataset for OoD generalization due to the presence of spurious correlation between negation words (attribute) and the contradiction label between “premise” and “hypothesis” inputs. Here, negation words are a result of the contradiction label (Causal shift), however this relationship between negation words and label may not always hold. Finally, for the CivilComments dataset, we expect the demographic features to be Confounded attributes as there could be biases which result in spurious correlation between comment toxicity and demographic information. To provide examples showing the availability of attributes and their type of relationship with the label, Table 5 lists some popular datasets used for DG and the associated auxiliary information present as metadata. In addition to above discussed datasets, weinclude the popularly used Waterbirds dataset  where the type of background (land/water) is assigned to bird images based on bird label; hence, being a Causal attribute (results on Waterbirds dataset are in Table 2).\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: is often known.
