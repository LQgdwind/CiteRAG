      "content": "Paper Title: It’s Raw! Audio Generation with State-Space Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGenerative modeling of raw audio waveforms is a challenging frontier for machine learning due to their high-dimensionality—waveforms contain tens of thousands of timesteps per second and exhibit long-range behavior at multiple timescales.\nA key problem is developing architectures for modeling waveforms with the following properties: Globally coherent generation, which requires modeling unbounded contexts with long-range dependencies. Computational efficiency through parallel training, and fast autoregressive and non-autoregressive inference. Sample efficiency through a model with inductive biases well suited to high-rate waveform data. Among the many training methods for waveform generation, autoregressive (AR) modeling is a fundamentally important approach.\nAR models learn the distribution of future variables conditioned on past observations, and are central to\nrecent advances in machine learning for\nlanguage and image generation  5 [ref]2.\nWith AR models, computing the exact likelihood is tractable, which makes them simple to train, and lends them to applications such as lossless compression  and posterior sampling .\nWhen generating, they can condition on arbitrary amounts of past context to sample sequences of unbounded length—potentially even longer than contexts observed during training.\nMoreover, architectural developments in AR waveform modeling can have a cascading effect on audio generation more broadly.\nFor example, WaveNet—the earliest such architecture 9—remains a central component of\nstate-of-the-art approaches for text-to-speech (TTS) ,\nunconditional generation ,\nand non-autoregressive (non-AR) generation . Despite notable progress in AR modeling of (relatively) short sequences found in domains such as natural language (e.g. 111K tokens),\nit is still an open challenge to develop architectures that are effective for the much longer sequence lengths of audio waveforms (e.g. 111M samples).\nPast attempts have tailored standard sequence modeling approaches like CNNs 9, RNNs , and Transformers  to fit the demands of AR waveform modeling,\nbut these approaches have limitations.\nFor example, RNNs lack computational efficiency because they cannot be parallelized during training, while CNNs cannot achieve global coherence because they are fundamentally constrained by the size of their receptive field. We introduce SaShiMi, a new architecture for modeling waveforms that yields state-of-the-art performance on unconditional audio generation benchmarks in both the AR and non-AR settings.\nSaShiMi is designed around recently developed deep state space models (SSM), specifically S4 .\nSSMs have a number of key features that make them ideal for modeling raw audio data. Concretely, S4: Incorporates a principled approach to modeling long range dependencies with strong results on long sequence modeling, including raw audio classification. Can be computed either as a CNN for efficient parallel training, or an RNN for fast autoregressive generation. Is implicitly a continuous-time model, making it well-suited to signals like waveforms. To realize these benefits of SSMs inside SaShiMi, we make 333 technical contributions.\nFirst, we observe that while stable to train, S4’s recurrent representation cannot be used for autoregressive generation due to numerical instability.\nWe identify the source of the instability using classical state space theory,\nwhich states that SSMs are stable when the state matrix is Hurwitz,\nwhich is not enforced by the S4 parameterization.\nWe provide a simple improvement to the S4 parameterization that theoretically ensures stability. Second, SaShiMi incorporates pooling layers between blocks of residual S4 layers to capture hierarchical information across multiple resolutions. This is a common technique in neural network architectures such as standard CNNs and multi-scale RNNs, and provides empirical improvements in both performance and computational efficiency over isotropic stacked S4 layers. Third, while S4 is a causal (unidirectional) model suitable for AR modeling, we provide a simple bidirectional relaxation to flexibly incorporate it in non-AR architectures.\nThis enables it to better take advantage of the available global context in non-AR settings. For AR modeling in audio domains with unbounded sequence lengths (e.g. music),\nSaShiMi can train on much longer contexts than existing methods including WaveNet (sequences of length 128128128K vs 444K),\nwhile simultaneously having better test likelihood, faster training and inference, and fewer parameters.\nSaShiMi outperforms existing AR methods in modeling the data (>0.15absent0.15>0.15 bits better negative log-likelihoods), with substantial improvements (+0.40.4+0.4 points) in the musicality of long generated samples (161616s) as measured by mean opinion scores.\nIn unconditional speech generation,\nSaShiMi achieves superior global coherence compared to previous AR models\non the difficult SC09 dataset both quantitatively (80%percent8080\\% higher inception score) and qualitatively (2×2\\times higher audio quality and digit intelligibility opinion scores by human evaluators). Finally, we validate that SaShiMi is a versatile backbone for non-AR architectures.\nReplacing the WaveNet backbone with SaShiMi in the state-of-the-art diffusion model DiffWave improves its quality, sample efficiency, and robustness to hyperparameters with no additional tuning. The central contribution of this paper is showing that deep neural networks using SSMs are a strong alternative to conventional architectures for modeling audio waveforms, with favorable tradeoffs in training speed, generation speed, sample efficiency, and audio quality. We technically improve the parameterization of S4, ensuring its stability when switching into recurrent mode at generation time. We introduce SaShiMi, an SSM-based architecture with high efficiency and performance for unconditional AR modeling of music and speech waveforms. We show that SaShiMi is easily incorporated into other deep generative models to improve their performance.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: important approach.\nAR models learn the distribution of future variables conditioned on past observations, and are central to\nrecent advances in machine learning for\nlanguage and image generation  5 [ref]2.\nWith AR models, computing the exact likelihood is tractable, which makes them simple to train, and lends them to applications such as lossless compression  and posterior sampling .\nWhen\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
