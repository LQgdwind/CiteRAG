Having a representation of the scene in the BEV can be beneficial to downstream tasks such as tracking, prediction and navigation. Compared to the camera point of view, the size of the objects in the BEV does not vary depending on their distance to the robot. Semantic grids are one type of BEV representation that allow a dense representation of the space around the robot. In a semantic grid, each cell contains a semantic label corresponding to the class of the object or area occupying it. The interest over semantic grid prediction has increased in recent years. Existing approaches in the literature can be grouped along three lines: camera-based, LiDAR-based and sensor fusion based methods. For camera-based methods, the main challenge is how the projection to the BEV is performed from the image plane. Some methods rely on MLPs to find the relationships between camera plane and BEV [ref]1 [ref]2 [ref]3 . Others perform categorical depth prediction to do this projection  , whereas Xie et al. assume an uniform depth distribution along the camera ray . More recently, the use of attention mechanisms has also been proposed as a solution to this challenge   . For LiDAR-based approaches, some follow a bayesian approach , whereas others leverage geometric relationships in the point cloud as well as occupancy features . Sensor fusion approaches leverage information from different modalities such as camera and LiDAR by processing each one with separate encoders and then fusing them via heuristics , convolutions   or self-attention mechanisms . In the proposed LAPTNet-FPN, we use the geometric information about the scene coming from a LiDAR sensor to guide the projection of camera features. By doing this projection at multiple image scales given by a convolutional backbone, we are able to associate BEV cells to pixels in the images and do semantic grid prediction in real time.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: For camera-based methods, the main challenge is how the projection to the BEV is performed from the image plane.
