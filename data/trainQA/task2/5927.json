      "content": "Paper Title: AutoQNN: An End-to-End Framework for Automatically Quantizing Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe heavy computational burden immensely hinders the deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-limited devices in real application scenarios.\nQuantization is a technique which compresses DNN weight and activation values from high-precision to low-precision.\nThe low-precision weights and activation occupy smaller memory bandwidth, registers, and computing units, thus significantly improving the computing performance. For example, AlexNet with 32-bit floating-point (FP32) can only achieve the performance of 1.93TFLOPS on RTX2080Ti since the bandwidth constraints.\nHowever, the low-precision AlexNet with 16-bit floating-point (FP16) can achieve the performance of 7.74TFLOPS on the same device because the required bandwidth is halved while the available computing units are doubled111The results are computed with the Roofline algorithm  using the memory access quantity and operations of an official AlexNet model from the PyTorch community (https://github.com/pytorch/vision) and the peak performance and memory bandwidth of RTX2080Ti GPU.. The FP16 AlexNet is four times faster than the FP32 one on RTX2080Ti GPU.\nTherefore, quantization can reduce the computing budgets in DNN inference phases and enable DNN model deployment on resource-limited devices. However, unreasonable quantizing strategies, such as binary  and ternary , tend to seriously affect DNN model accuracy   and lead to customer frustration.\nLower bitwidth usually leads to higher computing performance but larger accuracy degradation.\nThe quantization strategy selection dominates the computing performance and inference accuracy of models.\nIn order to balance the computing performance and inference accuracy, many previous investigations have tried to select a unified bitwidth for all layers in DNNs   cautiously.\nHowever, many studies show that different layers of DNNs have different sensitivities [ref]8  and computing budgets 0.\nUsing the same bitwidth for different layers is hard to obtain superior speed-up and accuracy.\nTo strike a fine-grained balance between efficiency and accuracy, it is strongly demanded to explore desirable quantizing schemes 1 and reasonable mixed-precision policies 0 2 for various neural architectures.\nThe brute force approaches are not feasible for this exploration since the search space grows exponentially with the number of layers [ref]8.\nHeuristic explorations work in some scenarios but greatly rely on the heavy workloads of domain experts 1.\nBesides, it is impractical to find desirable strategies for various neural architectures through manual-participated heuristic explorations because there are a large number of different neural architectures, and the number of neural architectures is still explosively increasing. Therefore, it is expected to propose an automatic DNN quantization without manual intervention.\nThe challenge of automatic quantization lies in efficiently exploring the large search space that exponentially increases with the number of layers in DNNs.\nMany studies have made substantial efforts and gained tremendous advances in this area, such as mixed-precision (MixedP) 2, HAQ 0, AutoQB 3, and HAWQ [ref]8.\nNevertheless, there are still some issues that have not been resolved well yet, as follows.\nFirstly, it is widely acknowledged that different quantizing schemes can impose an impact on the accuracy of quantized DNNs even with the same quantizing bitwidth 4  5.\nHowever, few studies investigate seeking quantizing schemes for specific architectures, to our best knowledge.\nSecondly, mixed-precision quantization is an efficient way to improve the accuracy of quantized DNNs without increasing the average bitwidth 0 2 3.\nThe presented algorithms include reinforcement learning 0 3, evolution-based search 6, and hessian-aware methods [ref]8 .\nHowever, these algorithms for mixed-precision search are highly complex and inefficient in exploring the exponential search space.\nThe algorithms usually require lots of computing resources, making it challenging to deploy them in online learning scenarios.\nBesides, these algorithms can easily fall into sub-optimal solutions because they usually skip the search steps of unusual bitwidths, such as a bitwidth of 5 2, to reduce search time. To address the above issues and challenges, we propose AutoQNN, an end-to-end framework for automatically quantizing neural networks without manual intervention.\nAutoQNN seeks desirable quantizing strategies for arbitrary architectures by involving three techniques: quantizing scheme search (QSS), quantizing precision learning (QPL), and quantized architecture generation (QAG).\nThe extensive experiments demonstrate that AutoQNN has the ability to find expected quantizing strategies within finite time and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art quantization methods for various models on ImageNet.\nOur contributions are summarised as follows. We propose QSS to automatically find desirable quantizing schemes for weights and activation with various distributions. We present QPL to efficiently learn the relatively optimal mixed-precision policies by minimizing the classification and precision losses. We design QAG to automatically convert the computing graphs of arbitrary DNNs into quantized architectures without manual intervention. Extensive experiments highlight that AutoQNN can find the expected quantizing strategies to reduce accuracy degradation with low bitwidth. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.\nWe first discuss the related work in Section 2 and then elaborate QSS and QPL in Section 3 and Section 4, respectively.\nNext, we introduce QAG and end-to-end framework in Section 5, and evaluate AutoQNN in Section 6.\nFinally, we conclude this paper in Section 7.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: many previous investigations have tried to select a unified bitwidth for all layers in DNNs   cautiously.\nHowever, many studies show that different layers of DNNs have different sensitivities [ref]8  and computing budgets 0.\nUsing the same bitwidth for different layers is hard to obtain superior speed-up and accuracy.\nTo strike a fine-grained balance between efficiency and accuracy, it is\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
