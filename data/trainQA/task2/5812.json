      "content": "Paper Title: POTTER: Pooling Attention Transformer for Efficient Human Mesh Recovery\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince the HMR is one of the fundamental tasks in computer vision with a long history, here we focus on the more recent and relevant approaches. Readers can explore more detailed information about HMR in a recent and comprehensive HMR survey 0. HMR from a single image.\nHMR has attracted increasing attention in recent years.\nMost of the HMR methods  [ref]44     utilize a parametric human model such as SMPL  to reconstruct human mesh by estimating the pose and shape parameters of the parametric model.\nKolotouros et al.  present a graph convolution neural network to learn the vertex-vertex relations. They regress the 3D mesh vertices directly instead of the SMPL model parameters. SPIN   combines the regression and optimization process in a loop. The regressed output served as better initialization for optimization (SMPLify). Similarly, PyMAF [ref]44 propose a pyramidal mesh alignment feedback where the mesh-aligned evidence is exploited to correct parametric errors. ProHMR  is a probabilistic model that outputs a conditional probability distribution using conditional normalizing flow. Dwivedi et al.  propose a differentiable semantic rendering loss to exploit richer image information about clothed people. Transformers in HMR.\nTransformers are first proposed by  in the field of NLP. Inspired by the success of transformer’s attention mechanism when dealing with token input, many researchers apply the transformer in various vision tasks such as object detection   , image classification   , segmentation  , human pose estimation   , etc. METRO 8 is the first transformer-based method for HMR. After extracting the image features by CNN backbone, a transformer encoder is proposed to model vertex-vertex and vertex-joint interaction. Although METRO outperforms the previous SOTA methods by a large margin (more than 10 MPJPE on Human3.6M and 3DPW datasets), METRO requires substantial memory and computational costs to achieve this impressive performance. As an extended version of METRO, MeshGraphormer 9 further combines the graph convolutional network (GCN) with a transformer to model local and global interactions among mesh vertices and joints. It still incurs substantial memory and computational overhead. Zeng et al.  propose a Token Clustering Transformer (TCFormer) to merge tokens from different locations by progressive clustering procedure. However, the performance of TCFormer can not beat METRO and MeshGraphormer. Efficient models for HMR.\nAs mentioned above, 8 9 pursue higher accuracy by sacrificing computational and memory efficiency. For real-world applications, model efficiency is also a key metric when evaluating HMR models, while less studied before. Although FastMETRO  reduces the computational and memory costs for the transformer part, it still relies on the heavy CNN backbone to achieve impressive performance. Another attempt is to reconstruct human mesh from a 2D human pose, which is proposed by GTRS . A lightweight transformer model employing a lightweight 2D pose detector can reduce computational and memory costs significantly.\nHowever, the performance of GTRS is not comparable to the SOTA methods since it only uses the 2D pose as input, some information such as human shape is missing.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: can explore more detailed information about HMR in a recent and comprehensive HMR survey 0.
