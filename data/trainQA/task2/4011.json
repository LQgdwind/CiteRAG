      "content": "Paper Title: FeatER: An Efficient Network for Human Reconstruction via Feature Map-Based TransformER\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince Vision Transformer (ViT)  introduced the transformer architecture to image classification with great success, it has also been shown to have enormous potential in various vision tasks such as object detection  , facial expression recognition\n, and re-identification  . Since the related work of HPE and HMR is vast, we refer interested readers to the recent and comprehensive surveys:  for HPE and  for HMR. In this section, we discuss the more relevant transformer-based approaches. Transformers in HPE: HPE can be categorized into 2D HPE and 3D HPE based on 2D pose output or 3D pose output. Recently, several methods [ref]39 3  utilize transformers in 2D HPE. TransPose [ref]39 uses a transformer to capture the spatial relationships between keypoint joints. PRTR  builds cascade transformers with encoders and decoders based on DETR . Although achieving impressive performance, TransPose [ref]39 and PRTR  suffer from heavy computational costs. HRFormer 1 integrates transformer blocks in the HRNet structure to output 2D human pose. TokenPose 3 embeds each keypoint to a token for learning constraint relationships by transformers, but it is limited to the 2D HPE task.\nAt the same time, PoseFormer 8 and Li et al. 1 first apply transformers in 3D HPE. MHFormer 2 generates multiple plausible pose hypotheses using transformers to lift 2D pose input to 3D pose output. As 2D-3D lifting approaches, these methods 8 1 2 rely on the external 2D pose detector, which is not end-to-end.\nIn contrast, our FeatER is an end-to-end network for the 2D HPE, 3D HPE, and HMR in a resource-friendly manner. Transformers in HMR: THUNDR 2 introduces a model-free transformer-based architecture for human mesh reconstruction.\nGTRS 7 proposes a graph transformer architecture with parallel design to estimate 3D human mesh only from detected 2D human pose. METRO 4 combines a CNN backbone with a transformer network to regress human mesh vertices directly for HMR. MeshGraphormer 5 further injects GCNs into the transformer encoder in METRO to improve the interactions among neighboring joints. Despite their excellent performance, METRO and MeshGraphormer still incur substantial memory and computational overhead. Efficient Methods for HPE and HMR: The SOTA methods for HPE and HMR 4 5 mainly pursue higher accuracy without considering computation and memory cost. While less studied, model efficiency is also a key characteristic of HPE and HMR applications. Lite-HRNet 0 applies the efficient shuffle block in ShuffleNet 6 9 to HRNet , but it is only limited to 2D HPE. GTRS 7 is a lightweight pose-based method that can reconstruct human mesh from 2D human pose. However, to reduce the computation and memory cost, GTRS only uses 2D pose as input and therefore misses some information such as human shape. Thus, the performance is not comparable to the SOTA HMR methods  5. Our FeatER is an efficient network that can outperform SOTA methods while reducing computation and memory costs significantly.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: we discuss the more relevant transformer-based approaches.
