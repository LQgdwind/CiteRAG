      "content": "Paper Title: Distribution Aware Metrics for Conditional Natural Language Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA metric’s sensitivity to the full distribution has the power to give us novel insights into the visual description task. Consider the two models, VLP , a standard transformer-based model pre-trained on large-scale vision and language data, and CLIPCap , a transformer-based model which is initialized with a large language model, and uses prefix-tuning with CLIP [ref]30 embeddings (Additional details in appendix A.3). While VLP  outperforms CLIPcap  in the standard scoring methods, CLIPcap outperforms VLP in the TRMMETEORsubscriptTRMMETEOR\\text{TRM}_{\\text{METEOR}} metric. Why is there such an inversion? We can begin to understand the results when looking a bit closer at Figure 5, which plots sampling temperature from the model, against the performance on the TRMMETEORsubscriptTRMMETEOR\\text{TRM}_{\\text{METEOR}} and standard METEOR metrics. We can see that at low temperatures, where the model is sampling from single maximum-likelihood estimates, VLP outperforms the CLIPcap method. As the temperature increases, we see that there is an inversion in the model performance, and at higher temperatures, CLIPcap outperforms VLP. On the other hand, in the standard METEOR metric, as we increase temperature, performance monotonically decreases, giving little insight. Figure 5 illustrates that TRMMETEORsubscriptTRMMETEOR\\text{TRM}_{\\text{METEOR}} captures a subtlety in the model comparisons that METEOR does not capture alone: while VLP produces better descriptions at low temperatures, it becomes less fluent (likelihood) on average as we introduce diversity, leading to a change in position. The result is also visible in qualitative samples, given in Figure 4, where we see TRM metrics prioritize both diversity and likelihood.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: model pre-trained on large-scale vision and language data, and CLIPCap , a transformer-based model which is initialized with a large language model, and uses prefix-tuning with CLIP [ref]30 embeddings (Additional details in appendix A.3).
