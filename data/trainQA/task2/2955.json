      "content": "Paper Title: On the complexity of quantum partition functions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNext we consider the computational complexity of approximating the free energy F𝐹F\nfor more general Hamiltonians\ndescribing a system of n𝑛n qubits with k𝑘k-qubit interactions, where k=O​(1)𝑘𝑂1k=O(1).\nSuch a system can be described by a k𝑘k-local Hamiltonian where each term HSsubscript𝐻𝑆H_{S} is a hermitian operator acting non-trivially only on the subset of qubits S𝑆S\nand HS=0subscript𝐻𝑆0H_{S}=0 unless |S|≤k𝑆𝑘|S|\\leq k.\nBelow we assume that ‖HS‖≤poly​(n)normsubscript𝐻𝑆poly𝑛\\|H_{S}\\|\\leq\\mathrm{poly}(n) for all S𝑆S.\nSince a small additive error approximation of the free energy is equivalent to a small relative error approximation\nof the partition function, we shall focus on the latter.\nThus we are interested in the following problem. Given a k𝑘k-local Hamiltonian H𝐻H acting on n𝑛n qubits,\ninverse temperature β≤poly​(n)𝛽poly𝑛\\beta\\leq\\mathrm{poly}(n),\nand a precision parameter δ≥poly​(1/n)𝛿poly1𝑛\\delta\\geq\\mathrm{poly}(1/n). Compute an estimate Z~~𝑍\\tilde{Z} such that Here 𝒵=Tr​(e−β​H)𝒵Trsuperscript𝑒𝛽𝐻{\\cal Z}=\\mathrm{Tr}(e^{-\\beta H}). We note that it is crucial here that we consider relative error estimation of the partition function. Previous works have considered the less challenging problem of additively approximating the (normalized) partition function [ref]20  . These works show that the latter problem admits an efficient quantum algorithm and, for Hamiltonians with locality k=O​(log⁡(n))𝑘𝑂𝑛k=O(\\log(n)), is complete for the complexity class 𝖣𝖰𝖢1subscript𝖣𝖰𝖢1\\mathsf{DQC}_{1} of problems that can be solved in polynomial time with only “one clean qubit” . In contrast to the ground energy, the partition function 𝒵𝒵{\\cal Z} depends on all eigenvalues\nof the Hamiltonian as well as their degeneracy. Thus\none can view the QPF problem as a quantum analogue of\napproximate counting — a fundamental task in classical computational complexity.\nIn particular, it is known that the problem of approximating the partition function of a classical local\nHamiltonian with a small relative error is\ncontained in the complexity class 𝖡𝖯𝖯𝖭𝖯superscript𝖡𝖯𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{BPP}^{\\mathsf{NP}}, essentially due to a fundamental result of Stockmeyer . We can interpret this result as stating that the\nclassical version of the QPF problem is not much harder than 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP},\nwhich is surprising because computing the partition function exactly is #​𝖯#𝖯\\#\\mathsf{P}-hard.\nOn the other hand, if we allow β𝛽\\beta to be complex, the\ntask of approximating 𝒵𝒵{\\cal Z}\nwith a constant relative error is known to be #​𝖯#𝖯\\#\\mathsf{P}-hard ,\neven in the case of classical Hamiltonians. The discrepancy between the problem complexity for real and complex β𝛽\\beta’s suggests that non-negativity of the Gibbs state should play an important role in the complexity analysis. The fact that Stockmeyer’s approximate counting method does not generalize to the quantum case has been observed previously .\nThis may explain why the complexity of the QPF problem\n– a basic and natural\nquestion from a physics perspective, remains largely open.\nA recent result by Cubitt et al.  gives us hope that this question may have\na mathematically appealing answer. The work  introduced the notion of universal quantum Hamiltonians\nand showed (among other things) that the QPF problem for\nk𝑘k-local Hamiltonian has the same complexity for any constant k≥2𝑘2k\\geq 2. (In fact, one can further specialize 222-local Hamiltonians to the anti-ferromagnetic Heisenberg\nmodel on a two-dimensional lattice of qubits or even certain 1D qudit systems  .)\nThe same universality result also applies to natural families of fermionic Hamiltonians\nrelevant for quantum chemistry and material science .\nThis suggests that the QPF problem is complete\nfor some “universal” complexity class that can be\ndefined in terms of a suitable computational model and does not depend\non details of the considered Hamiltonians, such as the locality parameter k𝑘k\n(as long as k≥2𝑘2k\\geq 2)\nor whether the underlying system consists of qubits (spins) or fermions. Given this state of affairs, and the apparently challenging nature of characterizing the complexity of the QPF\nproblem in terms of known complexity classes, here we use a standard computer science dodge – we look for other computational problems which are equivalent to QPF under polynomial time reductions\nwith the hope that these other problems may ultimately be easier to understand.\nNamely, we show that the QPF problem is equivalent to approximating the following quantities: The expected value of a local observable\nin the Gibbs state of a k𝑘k-local Hamiltonian. The number of eigenvalues of a k𝑘k-local Hamiltonian H𝐻H within a given interval. The number of witness states accepted by a 𝖰𝖬𝖠𝖰𝖬𝖠\\mathsf{QMA} verifier777Here 𝖰𝖬𝖠𝖰𝖬𝖠\\mathsf{QMA} verifier is a polynomial-size quantum circuit\nfollowed by a measurement of some designated output qubit. The circuit\ntakes as input a witness state and possibly ancilla qubits\ninitialized in |0⟩ket0|0\\rangle. A witness state is accepted if the\nprobability of the measurement outcome ‘1’ is above a specified threshold. We require an approximation within a small additive error in case (1) and\na small relative error in cases (2,3). For a formal definition of the above problems\nsee Section 3.1.\nProblems (1,2) are ubiquitous in condensed matter physics\nsince expected values of local observables and the density of states\n(i.e. the number of eigenstates contained in a given energy interval)\nprovide important insights into properties of a quantum material.\nProblem (3) can be viewed as a natural quantum generalization of the approximate counting task (the exact version of this problem introduced by Brown et al \nis known to be #​𝖯#𝖯\\#\\mathsf{P}-hard).\nWe also reproduce the result of Cubitt et al.  showing that\nthe QPF problems for 222-local and k𝑘k-local Hamiltonians with any\nconstant k𝑘k are equivalent to each other. Our proof is slightly more direct than the one of  as we do not use perturbation theory gadgets; our technique appears to share some features of later works which used Kitaev’s circuit-to-Hamiltonian mapping   0. Note however that reducing k𝑘k-local partition functions to 2-local partition functions is simpler than showing that such Hamiltonians are universal in the sense considered in Refs.    0.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: here that we consider relative error estimation of the partition function.
