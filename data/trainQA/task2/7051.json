      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Pauli channel estimation with logarithmic quantum memory\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur lower bounds are proved using the ‚Äúlearning tree‚Äù framework introduced in¬†[ref]10    for reasoning about adaptive protocols for quantum learning. As this technique is by now rather standard, we only emphasize here the key technical points of departure from existing approaches. Previously, [ref]14 used this framework to prove an Œ©‚Äã(2n/3)Œ©superscript2ùëõ3\\Omega(2^{n/3}) measurement complexity lower bound for ancilla-free protocols for Pauli channel estimation. Their approach was based on extending the truncation technique of¬†, originally used to show a lower bound for shadow tomography, to channel learning. Like the bound in¬† however, the bound in¬†[ref]14 was off from the optimal bound by a factor of 333 in the exponent. One might wonder whether the subsequent improved lower bound of¬† for shadow tomography could be similarly adapted to Pauli channel estimation. Unfortunately, that technique crucially exploited a certain convexity argument that breaks down in the presence of channel concatenations. To address this, we instead leverage a probabilistic argument based on likelihood ratio martingales, introduced in¬†[ref]16. To further demonstrate the utility of this technique, we also show in¬†Appendix¬†A how to prove a refined version of the lower bound in¬† for shadow tomography. Finally, our proof of¬†Theorem¬†2 is based on carefully adapting another set of techniques from¬† for showing a lower bound for shadow tomography with bounded memory. As the details for this are rather technical, we defer them to Section¬†7.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: Our lower bounds are proved using the ‚Äúlearning tree‚Äù framework introduced in¬†[ref]10    for reasoning about adaptive protocols for quantum learning.
