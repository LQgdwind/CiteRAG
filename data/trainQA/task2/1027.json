      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe ability to efficiently distribute large-scale optimisation over several computing nodes has been one of the key enablers of recent progress in machine learning, and the last decade has seen significant attention dedicated to efficient distributed optimisation.\nOne specific area of focus has been on reducing the communication cost of distributed machine learning, i.e. the total number of bits sent and received by machines in order to jointly optimise an objective function. To this end, communication-efficient variants are known for most classical optimisation algorithms, and in fact entire families of communication-compression methods have been introduced in the last decade. We consider a standard setting in which N𝑁N machines communicate by sending point-to-point binary messages to each other. Given dimension d𝑑d, and a domain 𝔻⊆ℝd𝔻superscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{D}\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^{d}, each machine i𝑖i is given an input function fi:𝔻→ℝ:subscript𝑓𝑖→𝔻ℝf_{i}\\colon\\mathbb{D}\\to\\mathbb{R}, corresponding to a subset of the data, and the machines need to jointly minimise the empirical risk\n∑i=1Nfi​(x)superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑁subscript𝑓𝑖𝑥\\sum_{i=1}^{N}f_{i}(x)\nwith either deterministic or probabilistic guarantees on the output, within ε𝜀\\varepsilon additive error tolerance. That is, at least one node needs to output z∈[ref]0 [ref]1d𝑧superscript01𝑑z\\in[ref]0 [ref]1^{d} such that This setting models data-parallel optimisation, and covers virtually all practical settings, from large-scale regression, to the training of deep neural networks. The key parameters governing communication complexity are the problem dimension d𝑑d, the solution accuracy ε𝜀\\varepsilon, and the number of machines N𝑁N.\nMost communication-efficient approaches can be linked to (at least) one of the following strategies: dimensionality-reduction methods, such as the sparsification of model updates     , or projection  4 5,\nwhich attempt to reduce the dependency on the parameter d𝑑d, quantisation methods 1 [ref]2  , whose rough goal is to improve the dependency on the accuracy ε𝜀\\varepsilon, and communication-reduction methods such as reducing the frequency of communication 6 0  relative to the number of optimisation steps, or communicating via point-to-point messages via, e.g., gossiping  . Although these methods use a diverse range of algorithmic ideas, upon close inspection, they all appear to have a worst-case total communication cost of at least N​d​log⁡(d/ε)𝑁𝑑𝑑𝜀{Nd\\log(d/\\varepsilon)} bits, even for simple convex d𝑑d-dimensional problems, and even for variations of the above standard setting. For instance, even though dimensionality-reduction or quantisation methods might send asymptotically less than d𝑑d bits per algorithm iteration, they have to compensate for this in the worst case by running for asymptotically more iterations. (See e.g. [ref]2 for a simple example of this trade-off.)\nIt is therefore natural to ask whether this complexity threshold is inherent, or whether it can be circumvented via improved algorithmic techniques. This is our motivating question. A partial answer is given by the foundational work of Tsitsiklis and Luo 2, who gave a lower bound of Ω​(d​log⁡(d/ε))Ω𝑑𝑑𝜀\\Omega(d\\log(d/\\varepsilon)) in the case where two nodes communicate to optimise over quadratic functions.\nTheir argument works by counting the total number of possible ε𝜀\\varepsilon-approximate solutions in the input volume: communication has to be at least the logarithm of this number.\nSubsequent work has considered more complex input functions, e.g. , or stronger notions of approximation 3. The original argument generalises directly to N𝑁N nodes under the strong assumption that each node has to return the correct output: in this case, communication complexity is asymptotically N𝑁N times the 2-node cost . In this context, it is surprisingly still unknown whether the Ω​(N​d​log⁡(d/ε))Ω𝑁𝑑𝑑𝜀\\Omega(Nd\\log(d/\\varepsilon)) communication threshold is actually inherent for distributed optimisation in the standard case where only a single node needs to return the output.\nThis question is not just of theoretical interest, since there are many practical settings in large-scale optimisation, such as federated learning  or the parameter server setting , where only a single node coordinates the optimisation, and knows the final answer.\nThis raises the question whether more communication-efficient algorithms are possible in such settings, in which communication cost is a key concern.\nAt the same time, it is also not clear under which conditions algorithms achieving this asymptotic complexity exist.\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: either deterministic or probabilistic guarantees on the output, within ε𝜀\\varepsilon additive error tolerance.
