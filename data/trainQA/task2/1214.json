      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Learning-based Resource Allocation For Device-to-Device Communication\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGiven that DNNs can approximate an arbitrary continuous function,\nallowing them to mimic the behavior of highly nonlinear and complex systems\nand making them universal approximators , they can also\nbe applied for resource allocation in WCS. More specifically, DNNs can be\ntrained based on the gradient of a loss function, i.e., by back propagation,\nto emulate the function which characterizes the optimal solution of\na resource allocation problem without having to solve a complicated\noptimization problem explicitly [ref]14. Accordingly, a near-optimal\nresource allocation strategy can be found by feeding appropriate input data, e.g., the\nchannel gains of the system, to the trained DNN. DL-based resource allocation is beneficial compared to conventional approaches\nin view of its high adaptability, high flexibility, and low complexity. First,\nDL-based resource allocation does not rely on a theoretical channel model and\ncan adapt its operation to the actual environment, leading to a higher performance\nin practice.\nSecond, DL-based resource allocation is flexible\nbecause the same DNN structure can be used to achieve different design goals\nby changing the loss function [ref]14. Finally,\nthe computation time111The training of the DNN, which\ncan be time consuming, can be performed offline before the\nDNN is actually used. Hence, the potentially long training time\nis not an obstacle to real-time operation of DNN-based systems.\nrequired by the trained DNN to obtain the resource allocation policy is much lower\nthan that of conventional resource allocation schemes because\nDNNs perform only simple matrix operations  . Due to its merits, DL has been applied for resource allocation in WCS recently\n [ref]14 [ref]34    [ref]38 .\nSpecifically, according to the type of training, DL-based resource allocation schemes can be\ndivided into two categories, namely 1) supervised learning-based schemes and\n2) unsupervised learning-based schemes. For resource allocation design based on supervised\nlearning, the optimal resource allocation strategy for a given\nchannel realization is provided as training data and the DNN is\ntrained to regenerate that optimal strategy  .\nIn this case, the DNN is used to reduce the computational complexity required\nfor obtaining the optimal resource allocation policy by emulating iterative computations.\nIn , a DNN was trained to reconstruct the optimal transmit power control\nwith respect to the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE).\nOn-off transmit power control was considered in [ref]34,\nwhere each device decided whether to transmit or not in a distributed manner\nbased on the estimated CSI of the channel to other devices. Moreover, EE maximization\nin a multi-user network was studied\n. Furthermore, in ,\nthe transmit power for max-min and max-prod power allocation in\na downlink massive MIMO system was investigated, and the optimal transmit power\nwas determined based on the location of the users. In addition, in ,\nthe transmit power of the pilot and data symbols in a massive MIMO system was\ncontrolled via DNNs where the user activity in each cell was\ntaken into account. Although resource allocation based on supervised learning was\nshown to significantly reduce computational complexity,\nit requires the collection of label data for the training of the DNNs.\nTo this end, the optimal resource allocation strategy has\nto be obtained for a large number of channel realization\nwhich can be challenging for complex communications systems with large numbers of\nusers. Moreover, this approach is not flexible because completely new\nlabel data has to be generated when the system model changes, e.g., when\na new constraint is added. On the other hand, for unsupervised\nlearning-based resource allocation schemes, the data is not labeled and the DNNs\nautonomously determine the optimal resource allocation strategy\nbased on the input samples, e.g., the channel gains. Accordingly, the collection of\ntraining data is much easier compared to supervised learning-based schemes.\nIn [ref]14, the transmit power was optimized for maximization of\nthe SE and EE using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and\nunsupervised learning. Specifically, the SE and EE were directly used as loss functions\nfor training and the DNNs were trained\nwithout label data for the optimal power allocation. However, only a constraint on\nthe total transmit power was considered and more general constraints,\ne.g., QoS requirements, were not taken into account. In\n and [ref]38, QoS constraints were considered in addition to\na total transmit power constraint by including the QoS violation probability in the loss\nfunction. With this approach, the DNN was trained to increase the SE while concurrently\nreducing the probability of violating the constraints. Moreover,\nto further improve the performance, an ensemble of DNN models was proposed in\n. However, both  and [ref]38\ndo not consider multi-channel systems which limits the\napplicability of the derived schemes. In  and ,\nDL-based resource allocation schemes with QoS constraints were\nproposed for multi-channel CR and D2D communications, respectively.\nFinally, in , a generic DL-based resource allocation\nframework to handle non-convex constrained optimization problems\nwas provided and its distributed implementation was considered.\nMost existing proposals for unsupervised learning-based resource allocation\nassume that perfect global CSI is available and the optimization variables are continuous.\nHowever, these assumptions are not realistic because the global CSI has to be collected\nvia a feedback channel which has a limited capacity in practice. Furthermore,\nsome optimization variables may be integer such as the index of the assigned\nchannels, which requires a special training methodology to ensure that the output of the DNN is discrete.\nAccordingly, in this work, we propose new\nDL-based resource allocation schemes which address the aforementioned shortcomings of\nprevious approaches.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: i.e., by back propagation,\nto emulate the function which characterizes the optimal solution of\na resource allocation problem without having to solve a complicated\noptimization problem explicitly [ref]14. Accordingly, a near-optimal\nresource allocation strategy can be found by feeding appropriate input data, e.g., the\nchannel gains of the system, to the trained DNN.
