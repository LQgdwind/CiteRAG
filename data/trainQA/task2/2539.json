      "content": "Paper Title: UniNet: A Unified Scene Understanding Network and Exploring Multi-Task Relationships through the Lens of Adversarial Attacks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nScene understanding concerns the breakdown of a perceived scene into meaningful attributes which help autonomous systems understand and operate in the real world. With the aid of vision tasks which infer semantic and geometric information from monocular images, autonomous systems can deduce various relevant aspects of the world. While deep learning has provided numerous breakthroughs in single tasks such as object detection  1 [ref]23 , semantic segmentation   , instance segmentation  , monocular depth estimation  , and monocular instance depth prediction [ref]5, multi-task learning (MTL) and inter-task relationships have not been fully explored. A multi-task network could be designed to have either a feature representation shared for all tasks [ref]5  or task-specific feature representations . While both designs benefit from complementary task information, the former provides added benefits such as reduced memory usage and inference time. We propose UniNet, a unified multi-task scene understanding network which is designed to jointly predict five crucial vision tasks - object detection (OD), semantic segmentation (SS), instance segmentation (IS), depth estimation (D), and instance depth prediction (ID). UniNet is based on an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder is shared between all tasks while the decoder is only used for the lighter tasks. Hence, it provides an acceptable trade-off between accuracy and inference efficiency. Learning multiple tasks together serves as an inductive bias prioritizing a learned representation that favours all tasks . However, the training procedure must factor in inter-task relationships to effectively search for this representation. Related tasks would promote complementary information sharing while unrelated tasks would interfere with each other, hindering attainment of an optimal shared representation. Therefore, understanding inter-task relationships can provide insights to leverage complementary task information. We consider UniNet as a simple and effective multi-task framework containing a wide variety of vision tasks to study the interaction between different tasks and their relatedness. Existing works define task relatedness using similarity between features learned by single-task networks , using empirical results obtained when tasks are jointly learned 7, and based on domain knowledge such as the alignment of semantic edges and depth discontinuities 0. Adversarial attacks center around the efficacy of fooling neural networks by making imperceptible changes to the input image. We hypothesise that these attacks can be used to study task relationships as they exploit learned biases in the neural networks. We therefore study task relationships in a multi-task network through the lens of adversarial attacks. Using adversarial attacks, we study multi-task relationships and uncover intriguing findings such as - (1) semantic tasks interact strongly amongst themselves and the same holds for geometric tasks, (2) semantic and geometric tasks do not affect each other equally, and (3) while the interaction between semantic and geometric tasks is strong in low-level representations, it becomes weaker in high-level representations. Additionally, we find that intra-task interaction between bounding box classification and regression in object detection promotes a bias towards object shapes. The contributions of this work are summarized as follows: We propose UniNet, a unified multi-task scene understanding network designed to infer five tasks which shows competitive performance with existing multi-task approaches while being efficient at inference. We uncover inter-task relationships in multi-task networks (UniNet and a modified version of MTI-Net 1) with the aid of adversarial attacks such as Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) and semantic category hiding. Specifically, semantic tasks and geometric tasks show greater interaction in low-level representation relative to high-level representation. We show that intra-task relationship between classification and regression in object detection induces a desirable bias towards object shapes.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: from monocular images, autonomous systems can deduce various relevant aspects of the world.
