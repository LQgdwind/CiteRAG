      "content": "Paper Title: Wasserstein barycenters are NP-hard to computeThis work was partially supported by NSF Graduate Research Fellowship 1122374, a Siebel PhD Fellowship, and a TwoSigma PhD fellowship.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWasserstein barycenters provide a natural approach for averaging probability distributions in a way that respects their geometry. In words, Wasserstein barycenters are the Riemannian centers of mass (a.k.a. Fréchet means) with respect to the Optimal Transport distance . More precisely, given probability distributions μ1,…,μksubscript𝜇1…subscript𝜇𝑘\\mu_{1},\\dots,\\mu_{k} over ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} and non-negative weights λ1,…,λksubscript𝜆1…subscript𝜆𝑘\\lambda_{1},\\dots,\\lambda_{k} summing to 111, the corresponding Wasserstein barycenters are the probability distributions ν𝜈\\nu over ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} that minimize Here, 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} denotes the 222-Wasserstein distance (a.k.a. the standard Optimal Transport distance) between probability distributions 6, which we recall is defined as where ℳ​(μ,ν)ℳ𝜇𝜈\\mathcal{M}(\\mu,\\nu) is the set of joint distributions with first marginal μ𝜇\\mu and second marginal ν𝜈\\nu. Wasserstein barycenters have received considerable research attention over the past decade due to their elegant mathematical properties (see, e.g., ) and many data-science applications (see, e.g., the surveys  ).\nFor example, illustrative applications include improving Bayesian learning by averaging posterior distributions 4, improving sensors by averaging their measurements , interpolating between shapes by averaging them (viewed as point clouds in Euclidean space) , clustering documents (viewed as distributions over word embeddings)  , multilevel clustering of datasets [ref]30 , and unsupervised representation learning in natural language processing . Note that some of these applications are in low-dimensional settings (e.g., graphics, imaging, and physical applications), while others are in high-dimensional settings (e.g., natural language processing, machine learning, and statistics applications). A key issue that determines how useful Wasserstein barycenters are in applications is whether they can be computed efficiently. Note that in most computational applications, each measure μisubscript𝜇𝑖\\mu_{i} is a discrete distribution: it is a “point cloud” over data points. This motivates the following fundamental question, which has remained open despite considerable research attention (see the previous work section). That is, can the optimization problem (1.1) be solved in time that is polynomial in the number of distributions k𝑘k, the dimension d𝑑d, the maximum support size n𝑛n of the input distributions μisubscript𝜇𝑖\\mu_{i}, and the bit complexity log⁡U𝑈\\log U of each entry in the input measures and weights? This constitutes a running time that is polynomial in the input size since each discrete measure is naturally described as a list of at most n𝑛n point locations and the corresponding probability masses. Recent work has shown that Wasserstein barycenters can in fact be computed in polynomial time in any fixed dimension d𝑑d . However, the dependence of this algorithm is exponential in d𝑑d, and it is unclear whether this can be improved.111In the special case of constant k𝑘k, it is possible to avoid the curse of dimensionality by simply using standard LP solvers to solve a well-known Multimarginal Optimal Transport reformulation of the problem 6   . This takes poly​(nk,d)=poly​(n,d)polysuperscript𝑛𝑘𝑑poly𝑛𝑑\\mathrm{poly}(n^{k},d)=\\mathrm{poly}(n,d) time for constant k𝑘k. Exponential dependence in d𝑑d prohibits scalability of Wasserstein barycenter computation to high-dimensional settings often encountered in data-science applications such as clustering [ref]30   , representation learning , and more 7 9. Thus it is of both practical and theoretical significance to understand whether there exists a provably accurate and efficient algorithm for computing high-dimensional Wasserstein barycenters.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: interpolating between shapes by averaging them (viewed as point clouds in Euclidean space) , clustering documents (viewed as distributions over word embeddings)  , multilevel clustering of datasets [ref]30 , and unsupervised representation learning in natural language processing .
