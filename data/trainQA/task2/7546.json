      "content": "Paper Title: MIMDRAM: An End-to-End Processing-Using-DRAM System for High-Throughput, Energy-Efficient and Programmer-Transparent Multiple-Instruction Multiple-Data Processing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo our knowledge, MIMDRAM is the first end-to-end processing-using-DRAM (PUD) system for general-purpose applications that executes operations in a multiple-instruction multiple-data (MIMD) fashion, where independent PUD operations are executed concurrently across the DRAM mats of a DRAM subarray. We highlight MIMDRAM’s key contributions by contrasting it with state-of-the-art processing-in-memory (PIM) designs. We already compared MIMDRAM to SIMDRAM , DRISA , and Fulcrum  both quantitatively and qualitatively in section 8 and demonstrated MIMDRAM’s benefits over them.  Processing-Using-DRAM.\nPrior works propose different ways of implementing PUD operations, either by\n(i) using the memory arrays themselves to perform operations in bulk [ref]122     [ref]114   [ref]117         or\n(ii) modifying the DRAM sense amplifier design with logic gates for computation  .\n\nSince prior PUD architectures execute PUD operations at a coarse granularity (i.e., at the granularity of a DRAM row access), they can suffer from the underutilization issue we highlight.\nAs in MIMDRAM, prior PUD architectures can employ fine-grained DRAM for PUD operations to mitigate underutilization.\nWe believe that the principles employed in MIMDRAM  can benefit other PUD architectures, leading to performance, energy-efficiency, and programmability improvements for the underlying PUD substrate. Programming Support for PUM.\nPrior works propose programming models for different types of PUM architectures, as\n(i) CUDA/OpenAcc   for in-cache computing ;\n(ii) tensor dataflow graphs for in-ReRAM computing . By enabling fine-grained DRAM, we believe such programming models can be now easily ported to PUD computing (for example, by assuming that each DRAM mat executes a different CUDA thread block).\nCHOPPER  improves SIMDRAM’s programming model by leveraging bit-slicing compilers and employing optimizations to reduce the latency of a µProgram. Even though CHOPPER simplifies programmability compared to SIMDRAM, it still requires the programmer to re-write applications using the bit-slicing compiler’s syntax. Compared to CHOPPER, MIMDRAM has two main advantages. First, MIMDRAM automatically generates code for the PUD engine without any code refactoring. Second, since CHOPPER maintains the very-wide SIMD programming model of SIMDRAM, it also suffers from SIMD underutilization.\n\nReference markers found: [122]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]122: benefits over them.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
