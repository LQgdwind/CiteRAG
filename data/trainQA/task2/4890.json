      "content": "Paper Title: PaST-NoC: A Packet-Switched Superconducting Temporal NoC\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSuperconducting digital computing is a promising alternative to CMOS due to its ability to operate at several tens of GHz at a higher energy efficiency than CMOS  .\nHowever, the full potential of superconducting digital computing is hindered by three major factors: First, the majority of superconducting digital  rapid single flux quantum (RSFQ) 111RSFQ is currently the most developed superconducting logic family. gates such as AND, OR, and XOR are synchronous, increasing the clock tree overhead and making scaling up challenging due to the need for precise timing   . Second, superconducting technology suffers from limited device density [ref]6. In fact, recent RSFQ chips were restricted to just a few tens of thousands of Josephson junctions, the fundamental switching device in superconducting computing. This limited density is exacerbated by the need of splitters which are interconnection cells that implement fanout, because of the severely limited inherent fanout of gates   . Third, superconducting memory is particularly area expensive . These limitations, combined with adopting large, CMOS-inspired NoC control circuits and complicated wiring for wide buses to represent packets in binary, reduce area efficiency and restrict recent binary RSFQ NoCs to eight inputs and eight outputs at most   0 1 2 3 4. In this work, we propose PaST-NoC that addresses current superconducting area density limitations by maximizing throughput per unit area. The key for the area efficiency of PaST-NoC is mapping control information such as packet destination as well as operating router control paths according to the time of arrival of RSFQ pulses using RL , instead of binary representation. In RL, information is mapped to the time of arrival of an RSFQ pulse (Figure 1). PaST-NoC is the first packet-switched NoC in RSFQ that operates its control path entirely in the temporal domain using RL and uses bufferless deflection flow control to avoid the elevated area cost of superconducting memory. As such, PaST-NoC provides tradeoffs that are more favorable to the unique characteristics of superconducting technology than traditional CMOS 5 6. The additional dynamic power due to deflections has a minimal impact in RSFQ 7 . In addition, we propose a round-robin deflection policy 8 with randomization to provide probabilistic livelock freedom 9.\nThese novel contributions are described in Sections III and IV. Although PaST-NoC’s control path operates entirely in RL for superior area efficiency, data can be encoded as serialized binary or unary, or a different encoding. Examples of unary encoding are RSFQ pulse streams, RL, or stochastic streams 0. This makes PaST-NoC a candidate for conventional architectures that use typical binary encoding, but also for non-conventional architectures that use alternative data representations. These non-conventional architectures have demonstrated the potential for integrating hundreds of processing elements on today’s superconducting chips 0 1 2 3 4 5 6. Not only do these scales motivate the use of a NoC but in fact previously-demonstrated binary superconducting NoCs are far from reaching the scales of hundreds that these emerging architectures call for.\nIn addition, temporal PEs can readily generate control information such as packet destinations in the temporal domain that naturally fits PaST-NoC, instead of converting to binary in order to use binary NoCs. PaST-NoC uses 2×\\times2 routers as a building block to reduce the area and complexity of its RL-based routing logic. Based on these 2×\\times2 routers, we describe how PaST-NoC easily scales up to a 4×\\times4 butterfly and an 8×\\times8 mesh that form the basis for a variety of larger topologies.\nTo achieve this, we extend previous methods as described in Section V in order to effectively use them for PaST-NoC.\nWhen the data portion of packets is encoded using RL, PaST-NoC provides a higher throughput per port per area (calculated as number of JJs) compared to state-of-the-art binary RSFQ NoCs by over 5×\\times, and a statically-scheduled RSFQ temporal NoC 7 by as much as 2×\\times.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: are synchronous, increasing the clock tree overhead and making scaling up challenging due to the need for precise timing   .
