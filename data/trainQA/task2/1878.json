      "content": "Paper Title: Memory Capacity of Recurrent Neural Networks with Matrix Representation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe note that conventional neural networks follow vector-based representation, and our focus in this paper is matrix-based neural networks. The broader work on the memory capacity and the general capacity of conventional neural networks provides multiple notions of the memory capacity of neural networks. Baldi and Vershynin [ref]30 defined log2⁡|S|subscript2𝑆\\log_{2}\\left|S\\right| as the memory capacity of the architecture, where S𝑆S is the set of all functions that it can realize. It has been shown that for a recurrent neural network with N𝑁N total neurons, the\nmemory capacity is proportional to N3superscript𝑁3N^{3} [ref]30. Furthermore, the same definition is used to derive that the capacity of a usual L𝐿L layered neural network with only threshold activation is upper bounded by a cubic polynomial in size of each layer with bottleneck layers limiting this upper bound . However, the definition of capacity in this case from a memory standpoint is only expressive in the sense that it does not refer to any capability of the network to remember the past inputs. A stronger argument has been\nfor the definition of memory capacity where the existence of a realizable function such that the given architecture can perfectly remember past inputs [ref]30. That is, the largest value of K𝐾K such that there exists a function F𝐹F in the space of all functions realizable by the given architecture S𝑆S, so that for a given set of data xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} and label yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i}, {(x1,y1),…,(xK,yK)}subscript𝑥1subscript𝑦1…subscript𝑥𝐾subscript𝑦𝐾\\{(x_{1},y_{1}),\\dots,(x_{K},y_{K})\\}, it’s true that This definition has been used to develop the memory capacity of multilayered neural networks with threshold and rectifier linear unit (ReLU) activation functions , where it was shown that the memory capacity is lower bounded by the number of total weights. This definition allows deeper mathematical analysis as visible by the remarkable results in other works . However, this definition is not easily portable to higher-order representations and their analysis. We gather that most of the analysis done  depends on the vector representations retrieved from the affine transform 𝑾​𝒙+𝒃𝑾𝒙𝒃{\\bm{W}}{\\bm{x}}+{\\bm{b}}, whereas this paper focuses on the bilinear transform 𝑼T​𝑿​𝑽+𝑩superscript𝑼𝑇𝑿𝑽𝑩{\\bm{U}}^{T}{\\bm{X}}{\\bm{V}}+{\\bm{B}} to generate matrix representations of input data. Apart from this, the set of functions realized by the bilinear transforms are fundamentally different from affine transformation. The extension of the theory would at the very least need extension of the probabilistic view of the realizable function F𝐹F to their matrix counterpart, which further makes the situation unmanageable  . Some of the earlier works on neural networks from a dynamical systems viewpoint provides a possible alternative definition of the memory capacity purely in terms of a statistic. A discrete-time recurrent system   is given by where 𝑾𝑾{\\bm{W}} is the recurrent connectivity matrix and the time-dependent scalar signal s​(n)𝑠𝑛s(n) is passed through this system via feedforward connection 𝒗𝒗{\\bm{v}} which contains an additive noise content 𝒛​(n)𝒛𝑛{\\bm{z}}(n). Additionally, we can consider an output layer that transforms the state 𝒙​(n)𝒙𝑛{\\bm{x}}(n) of length N𝑁N to an output vector 𝒚​(n)𝒚𝑛{\\bm{y}}(n) of length M𝑀M such that yi​(n)=𝒙​(n)T​𝒖isubscript𝑦𝑖𝑛𝒙superscript𝑛𝑇subscript𝒖𝑖y_{i}(n)={\\bm{x}}(n)^{T}{\\bm{u}}_{i} for i=1,…,M𝑖1…𝑀i=1,\\dots,M. The objective of the system is to have output yj​(n)subscript𝑦𝑗𝑛y_{j}(n) equal to the past signal observed s​(n−j)𝑠𝑛𝑗s(n-j). Given this premise in place, the memory trace m​(k)𝑚𝑘m(k) has been defined  as where expectation is over time. The (asymptotic) memory capacity can be now defined naturally as the following extension of Eq. 3, Using this definition, we are only shifting our focus on a particular task of past recall, which is orthogonal to our aim of determining the memory capacity of the system itself, invariant of the task it’s performing. To achieve this aim, we clearly need to focus more on the memory capacity induced by the state transition of the system. There has been an extension to a more general notion of memory capacity , with the trace of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) or equivalently the Fisher Memory Matrix (FMM). This depends upon the context of interpretation of the state 𝒙​(n)𝒙𝑛{\\bm{x}}(n) with the vector of temporal scalar inputs 𝒔𝒔{\\bm{s}}, as the parameters of the conditional p​(𝒙​(n)|𝒔)𝑝conditional𝒙𝑛𝒔p({\\bm{x}}(n)|{\\bm{s}}). Hence, the Fisher information matrix of p​(𝒙​(n)|𝒔)𝑝conditional𝒙𝑛𝒔p({\\bm{x}}(n)|{\\bm{s}}) measures the memory capacity by the capability of past inputs s​(i)𝑠𝑖s(i) for i≤n𝑖𝑛i\\leq n to perturb the current state 𝒙​(n)𝒙𝑛{\\bm{x}}(n), which in turn shows the reluctance or permeability of the state 𝒙​(n)𝒙𝑛{\\bm{x}}(n) to change under a new 𝒔𝒔{\\bm{s}}. Note that such a measure does not depend explicitly on the structure of the state 𝒙​(n)𝒙𝑛{\\bm{x}}(n) as that information is portrayed by p​(𝒙​(n)|𝒔)𝑝conditional𝒙𝑛𝒔p({\\bm{x}}(n)|{\\bm{s}}). Thus, as long as we are able to determine the conditional for a given type of state and discrete dynamics (even for matrix representations shown in Eq. 5), we can use this definition for obtaining a measure of memory capacity. However, its reliance on statistical information about the sensitivity of state rather than an explicit measure of the maximum size of the input data which the architecture can map correctly, makes this definition weaker\nthan that given by Vershynin  for artificial neural networks. However, due to its invariance on the state structure explicitly, and dependence only on the conditional distribution of the current state given past inputs, it becomes ideal for analysis on a much more diverse set of representations in neural networks.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: networks.
