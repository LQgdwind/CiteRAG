Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

DETR [ref]2  propose a novel object detection paradigm based on Transformers, which largely simplifies the traditional detection pipeline, and achieves on excellent performances compared with CNN-based detectors .\nBesides, there is a popularity of using transformer architecture in other vision tasks, such as segmentation , object tracking [ref]34   and even backbone construction .\nLately, some works [ref]34  show using a transformer in processing sequential visual data also make remarkable shots, especially for temporal tasks.\nMOTR  introduce a novel concept of track query and the contiguous query passing mechanism for multiple-object Tracking and long-range temporal relation.\nTransTrack [ref]34 track object by applying object features from the previous frame as a query of the current frame.\nAll the above methods prove the good capacity of transformer in modeling temporal relation,\nbut for video text spotting or multi-orient text tracking, to the best of our knowledge, there are still no transformer-based solutions.\nTherefore, we propose a simple, but effective TransDeTR method, which shows convincingly high performance on the popular benchmark.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: Transformer was first proposed in [ref]35 as a new paradigm for the machine translation task.\nSince the 2020 year,\nTransformers start to show promises in solving computer vision tasks.
