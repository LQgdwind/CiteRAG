      "content": "Paper Title: Image-Guided Navigation of a Robotic Ultrasound Probe for Autonomous Spinal Sonography Using a Shadow-aware Dual-Agent Framework\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMedical ultrasound (US) imaging has been widely accepted in a broad range of clinical applications because of its ease of use, non-invasiveness, low cost and real-time capabilities.\nIn spinal applications, US imaging is a commonly practiced diagnostic tool for various spine diseases such as scoliosis and low-back pain , and is also frequently used in preprocedural scan  and real-time needle guidance during minimally invasive spine procedures [ref]4. In standardized US acquisitions, the standard views are a number of view planes defined by expert consensus to perform US imaging of specific anatomical structures, which usually contain essential information of the anatomy for diagnosis, biometric measurement or interventional guidance . For example, an overview of the lumbar spine anatomy is show in Fig. 1(a). Each lumbar vertebra is composed of a vertebral body, a spinous process, two laminae, two transverse processes, two articular processes and two pedicles . The US examination of the lumbar spine typically involves the imaging of three standard views, namely, the paramedian sagittal lamina (PSL) view, paramedian sagittal articular processes (PSAP) view, and transverse spinous process (TSP) view , as illustrated in Fig. 1(b).\nThe PSL and PSAP views can be acquired during the paramedian sagittal scan at the level of the lamina and articular process, respectively, and the TSP view is acquired during the transverse scan when the probe is placed over the spinous process. Acquiring these standard views can help the physician identify and locate the spinal anatomical landmarks to perform diagnosis or spine procedures . However, the current standard view acquisition procedure requires manual navigation of the probe based on the interpretation of the US images and the knowledge of the internal anatomy, which usually requires substantial experience and extensive training of sonographers. Therefore, the sonographers are suffering from heavy physical and cognitive burdens due to excessive workload 0, and the imaging quality is strongly dependent on the operator 1. In addition, the direct patient contact would increase the risk of infection for frontline medical staff during a pandemic such as COVID-19 2. In view of this, an autonomous robotic system for US acquisitions holds great promise for relieving user workload, improving imaging results, and reducing the need for direct patient contact 3.\nHowever, the robot decision-making in medical US acquisitions is a highly challenging task, as it requires the robot to interpret real-time US images and perform visual navigation of the probe, which mimics the decision-making process of an experienced sonographer. As an active field of research in artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful tool for solving complex sequential decision-making problems in real-world applications 4. Meanwhile, deep learning (DL) has superior ability in learning high-level representation from raw image data and has been intensively studied in US image analysis tasks 5.\nIn this paper, we innovatively introduce a learning-based pipeline to achieve autonomous spinal sonography with a robotic platform, which integrates the RL, DL techniques and a shadow-aware approach to autonomously acquire the standard views of the spine based on real-time US images. An overview of our proposed framework is illustrated in Fig. 2.\nThe main contributions of this paper are as follows. A deep RL agent is delicately designed and trained end-to-end to plan the 6-DOF movement of a US probe based on real-time US images, in order to autonomously navigate towards the standard views of the lumbar spine. Furthermore, inspired by the nature of US propagation and the characteristics of the spinal anatomy, we introduce a novel view-specific acoustic shadow reward that utilizes the acoustic shadow information to implicitly guide the RL-based navigation. A location-sensitive DL agent is proposed to recognize the standard views of the lumbar spine from real-time US images to provide feedback for the RL agent and jointly determine the movement of the probe through a dual-agent collaborative navigation workflow. A general approach is presented to build a simulation environment for modeling probe-patient interaction in US imaging based on real US data, which can realistically reproduce the real-world US acquisitions and realize continuous state and action spaces for the development of US-guided navigation algorithms. While the work presented in this paper was targeted at the spinal applications, the ideas and methods can also be generalized to the robotic US imaging of other human tissues. The remainder of this article is organized as follows: Section II provides an overview of the related work in the fields of US standard view detection and robotic US acquisitions. Then, we introduce the details of our presented method in Section III, before experiments and results are presented in Section IV. Conclusions and future perspectives are discussed in Section V.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: tool for various spine diseases such as scoliosis and low-back pain , and is also frequently used in preprocedural scan  and real-time needle guidance during minimally invasive spine procedures [ref]4.
