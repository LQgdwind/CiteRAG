      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Local Displacements for Point Cloud Completion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe second architecture aims at showing the diversity of the operators to improve the state-of-the-art from PoinTr [ref]44 that uses transformers.\nWe therefore propose a transformer-based architecture that is derived from [ref]44 and our operators as summarized in Fig. 4. Before computing the attention mechanisms in the transformer, the partial scan are subsampled due to the memory constraint of the GPU.\nPoinTr [ref]44 implements the Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) to reduce the number of points and MLP to convert the points to features. Conversely, our architecture applies the proposed operators. Similar to Sec. 4.1, this involves alternating the features extraction and neighbor pooling.\nSince the Fourier feature  and SIRENs  have proven that the sinusoidal activation is helpful in presenting complex signals and their derivatives in layer-by-layer structures, a positional coding based on the 3D coordinates is then added to the features.\nIn Fig. 4, we refer this block as points-to-token.\nThereafter, we use the geometry-aware transformers from [ref]44 which produces a coarse point cloud. From the coarse point cloud, we then replace their coarse-to-fine strategy with our operators. This includes a series of alternating feature extraction and up-sampling operators as shown in Fig. 4. It it noteworthy to emphasize the difference between our architecture from PoinTr [ref]44 and to understand the implication of the changes.\nThe contributions of points-to-tokens and coarse-to-fine to the overall architecture is illustrated in Fig. 5.\nWe can observe from this figure that the FPS from PoinTr [ref]44 only finds the distant points while the results of our neighbor pooling sketches the contours of the input point cloud to capture the meaningful structures of the object. Notably, by looking at our sketch, we can already identify the that the object is a table. This is contrary to the random points from PoinTr [ref]44.\nMoreover, our coarse-to-fine strategy uniformly reconstructs the planar region on the table as well as its base.\nLater, in Sec. 7, we numerically evaluate these advantages in order to show that the individual components has their own merits. Since we previously discussed in Sec. 3.1 the difference of our down-sampling operation against 3D-GMP , we became curious to see the reconstruction in Fig. 5 if we replace the FPS in PoinTr [ref]44 with the cosine similarity and GMP of . Similar to PoinTr, the new combination selects distant points as its tokens while the table in their final reconstruction increased in size.\nIn contrast, our tokens are more meaningful and the final results are more accurate.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: The second architecture aims at showing the diversity of the operators to improve the state-of-the-art from PoinTr [ref]44 that uses transformers.\nWe therefore propose a transformer-based architecture that is derived from [ref]44 and our operators as summarized in Fig. 4.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
