      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamic Data Structures for 𝑘-Nearest Neighbor Queries\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn case we wish to\nsupport both insertions and deletions, the problem becomes more\ncomplicated, and the existing solutions thereby much more involved. When we\nagain consider the plane, and we wish to report only one nearest\nneighbor (i.e. 111-NN searching), several efficient fully dynamic data\nstructures exist   . Actually, all these\ndata structures are variants of the same data structure by Chan\n. For the Euclidean distance, the current best result\nusing linear space achieves O​(log2⁡n)𝑂superscript2𝑛O(\\log^{2}n) worst-case query time,\nO​(log2⁡n)𝑂superscript2𝑛O(\\log^{2}n) insertion time, and O​(log4⁡n)𝑂superscript4𝑛O(\\log^{4}n) deletion\ntime . These results are deterministic, and the update\ntimes are amortized. The variant by Kaplan et al. \nachieves similar results for general distance functions: O​(n​log3⁡n)𝑂𝑛superscript3𝑛O(n\\log^{3}n) space, O​(log2⁡n)𝑂superscript2𝑛O(\\log^{2}n) worst-case query time, and expected O​(polylog⁡n)𝑂polylog𝑛O(\\operatorname{polylog}n) amortized update time. Using recent results on shallow\ncuttings by Liu  the space can be reduced to\nO​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n), the insertion time to O​(log2⁡n)𝑂superscript2𝑛O(\\log^{2}n), and the deletion time to O​(log4⁡n)𝑂superscript4𝑛O(\\log^{4}n). The update times remain expected amortized. These data structures can also be used to answer k𝑘k-NN\nqueries, but when answering a query we run into the same\nproblem as in the insertion-only case. That is, we consider O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) subsets, which results in a query time of\nO​(log2⁡n+k​log⁡n)𝑂superscript2𝑛𝑘𝑛O(\\log^{2}n+k\\log n)  . For the Euclidean case, Chan argues that the above data structure for\n111-NN searching can be extended to obtain\nO​(log2⁡n/log⁡log⁡n+k)𝑂superscript2𝑛𝑛𝑘O(\\log^{2}n/\\log\\log n+k) query time, while still retaining\npolylogarithmic updates [ref]8. Chan’s data structure\nessentially maintains a collection of k𝑘k-NN data structures built on\nsubsets of the sites. A careful analysis shows that some of these\nstructures can be rebuilt during updates, and that the cost of these\nupdates is not too large. Queries are then answered by performing\nkisubscript𝑘𝑖k_{i}-NN queries on several disjoint subsets of sites S1,..,StS_{1},..,S_{t}\nthat together are guaranteed to contain the k𝑘k nearest sites. However, perhaps because the details of the 111-NN searching data structure\nare already fairly involved, one aspect in the query algorithm is\nmissing: how to determine the value kisubscript𝑘𝑖k_{i} to query\nsubset Sisubscript𝑆𝑖S_{i} with. While it seems that this issue can be fixed using\nrandomization The main idea is that the data\nstructure as is can be used to efficiently report all sites\nwithin a fixed distance from the query point (reporting all planes\nbelow a query point in ℝ3superscriptℝ3\\mathbb{R}^{3}). Combining this with an earlier\nrandom sampling idea  one can then also answer k𝑘k-NN\nqueries., our general k𝑘k-NN query technique\n(Section 3) allows us to recover deterministic, worst-case\nO​(log2⁡n/log⁡log⁡n+k)𝑂superscript2𝑛𝑛𝑘O(\\log^{2}n/\\log\\log n+k) query time.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: that the above data structure for\n111-NN searching can be extended to obtain\nO​(log2⁡n/log⁡log⁡n+k)𝑂superscript2𝑛𝑛𝑘O(\\log^{2}n/\\log\\log n+k) query time, while still retaining\npolylogarithmic updates [ref]8.
