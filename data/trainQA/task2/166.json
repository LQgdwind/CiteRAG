      "content": "Paper Title: Cognitively-Inspired Model for Incremental Learning Using a Few Examples\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMost of the recent class-incremental learning methods rely on storing a fraction of old class data when learning a new class [ref]39  [ref]7  . iCaRL [ref]39 combines knowledge distillation  and NCM for class-incremental learning. Knowledge distillation uses a distillation loss term that forces the labels of the training data of previously learned classes to remain the same when learning new classes. iCaRL uses the old class data while learning a representation for new classes and uses the NCM classifier for classification of the old and new classes. EEIL [ref]7 improves iCaRL with an end-to-end learning approach. Hou et al.  uses cosine normalization, less-forget constraint and inter-class separation for reducing the data imbalance between old and new classes. The main issue with these approaches is the need to store old class data which is not practical when the memory budget is limited. To the best of our knowledge, there are only two approaches that do not use old class data and use a fixed memory budget: LWF-MC [ref]39 and LWM . LWF-MC is simply the implementation of LWF [ref]27 for class-incremental learning. LWM uses attention distillation loss and a teacher model trained on old class data for better performance than LWF-MC. Although both of these approaches meet the conditions for class-incremental learning proposed in [ref]39, their performance is inferior to approaches that store old class data [ref]39 [ref]7 . An alternative set of approaches increase the number of layers in the network for learning new classes  . Another novel approach is presented in  which grows a tree structure to incorporate new classes incrementally. These approaches also have the drawback of rapid increase in memory usage as new classes are added. Some researchers have also focused on using a deep network pre-trained on ImageNet as a fixed feature extractor for incremental learning. Belouadah et al.  uses a pre-trained network for feature extraction and then trains shallow networks for classification while incrementally learning classes. They also store a portion of old class data. The main issue with their approach is that they test their approach on the ImageNet dataset using the feature extractor that has already been trained on ImageNet which skews their results. FearNet  uses a ResNet-50 pre-trained on ImageNet for feature extraction and uses a brain-inspired dual memory system which requires storage of the feature vectors and co-variance matrices for the old class images. The feature vectors and co-variance matrices are further used for generating augmented data during learning. Our approach does not store any base class data or use any data augmentation, although it uses a ResNet pre-trained on ImageNet for feature extraction but we do not test our approach on ImageNet.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: Most of the recent class-incremental learning methods rely on storing a fraction of old class data when learning a new class [ref]39  [ref]7  . iCaRL [ref]39 combines knowledge distillation  and NCM for class-incremental learning.
