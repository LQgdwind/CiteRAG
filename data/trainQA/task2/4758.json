      "content": "Paper Title: Monte Carlo Tree Search based Variable Selection for High Dimensional Bayesian Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nScaling BO to high-dimensional problems is a challenge due to the curse of dimensionality and the computation cost. As the dimension increases, the search space increases exponentially, requiring more samples, and thus more expensive evaluations, to find a good solution. Furthermore, the computation cost of updating the GP model and optimizing the acquisition function will be very time-consuming¬†. There have been a few common approaches to tackle high-dimensional BO with different assumptions. Decomposition. Assuming that the function can be decomposed into the sum of low-dimensional functions with disjoint subspaces,¬†Kandasamy et¬†al.  proposed the Add-GP-UCB algorithm to optimize those low-dimensional functions separately, which was further generalized to overlapping subspaces¬† .¬†Wang et¬†al. 3 proposed ensemble BO that uses an ensemble of additive GP models for scalability.¬†Han et¬†al.  constrained the dependency graphs of decomposition to tree structures to facilitate the decomposition learning and optimization. For most problems, however, the decomposition is unknown, and also difficult to learn. Embedding. Assuming that only a few dimensions affect the high-dimensional function significantly, embedding-based methods embed the high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional subspace, and optimize in the subspace while projecting the point back for evaluation. REMBO and its variants use a random matrix to embed the search space into a low-dimensional subspace¬†  2.¬†Nayebi et¬†al.  used a hash-based method for embedding.¬†Letham et¬†al.  proposed ALEBO, focusing on several misconceptions in REMBO to improve the performance. The VAE-based approaches were also employed to project a structured input space (e.g., graphs and images) to a low-dimensional subspace¬†[ref]12 . Variable Selection. Based on the same assumption as embedding, variable selection methods iteratively select a subset of variables to build a low-dimensional subspace and optimize through BO. The selected variables can be viewed as important variables that are valuable for exploitation, or having high uncertainty that are valuable for exploration. A classical method is Dropout¬†, which randomly chooses dùëëd variables in each iteration.¬†Spagnol et¬†al. 7 uses Hilbert Schmidt Independence criterion to guide variable selection. When evaluating the sampled point, the values of those unselected variables are obtained by random sampling or using historical information. VS-BO¬†3 selects variables with larger estimated gradients and uses CMA-ES¬† to obtain the values of unselected variables. Note that variable selection can be faster than embedding, because the embedding cost (e.g., matrix inversion) is time-consuming for high-dimensional optimization. Both embedding and variable selection methods need to specify the parameter dùëëd, i.e., the dimension of low-dimensional subspace, which will affect the performance significantly, but is not easy to set. There are also some methods to improve the basic components of BO directly for high-dimensional problems. For example, DNGO¬†6 uses the neural network as an alternative of GP to speed up inference; BO-PP¬† generates pseudo-points (i.e., data points whose objective values are not evaluated) to improve the GP model; SAASBO¬†[ref]9 uses sparsity-inducing prior to perform variable selection implicitly, making the coefficients of unimportant variables near to zero and thus restraining over-exploration on these variables. Note that different from Dropout and our proposed MCTS-VS, SAASBO still optimizes all variables, and also due to its high computational cost of inference, it is very time-consuming as reported in¬†[ref]9. These methods can be combined with the above-mentioned dimensionality reduction methods, which may bring further improvement.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: on several misconceptions in REMBO to improve the performance.
