      "content": "Paper Title: DN-DETR: Accelerate DETR Training by Introducing Query DeNoising\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nObject detection is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims to predict the bounding boxes and classes of objects in an image. While having made remarkable progress, classical detectors ¬†  were mainly based on convolutional neural networks, until Carion et al.¬† recently introduced Transformers ¬† into object detection and proposed DETR (DEtection TRansformer). In contrast to previous detectors, DETR uses learnable queries to probe image features from the output of Transformer encoders and bipartite graph matching to perform set-based box prediction. Such a design effectively eliminates hand-designed anchors and non-maximum suppression (NMS) and makes object detection end-to-end optimizable. However, DETR suffers from prohibitively slow training convergence compared with previous detectors. To obtain a good performance, it usually takes 500500500 epochs of training on the COCO detection dataset, in contrast to 121212 epochs used in the original Faster-RCNN training. Much work ¬†[ref]21 5  9 4  has tried to identify the root cause and mitigate the slow convergence issue. Some of them address the problem by improving the model architecture. For example, Sun et al.¬†9 attributed the slow convergence issue to the low efficiency of the cross-attention and proposed an encoder-only DETR. Dai et al.¬† designed an RoI-based dynamic decoder to help the decoder focus on regions of interest. More recent works propose to associate each DETR query with a specific spatial position rather than multiple positions for more efficient feature probing ¬†[ref]21 5  4. For instance, Conditional DETR ¬†5 decouples each query into a content part and a positional part, enforcing a query to have a clear correspondence with a specific spatial position. Deformable DETR ¬† and Anchor DETR ¬†[ref]21 directly treat 2‚ÄãD2ùê∑2D reference points as queries to perform cross-attention. DAB-DETR ¬†4 interprets queries as 444-D anchor boxes and learns to progressively improve them layer by layer. Despite all the progress, few works pay attention to the bipartite graph matching part for more efficient training. In this study, we find that the slow convergence issue also results from the discrete bipartite graph matching component, which is unstable especially in the early stages of training due to the nature of stochastic optimization. As a consequence, for the same image, a query is often matched with different objects in different epochs, which makes optimization ambiguous and inconstant. To address this problem, we propose a novel training method by introducing a query denoising task to help stabilize bipartite graph matching in the training process. Since previous works have shown effectiveness in interpreting queries as reference points ¬† [ref]21 or anchor boxes ¬†4, which contain positional information, we follow their viewpoint and use 444D anchor boxes as queries.\nOur solution is to feed noised GT bounding boxes as noised queries together with learnable anchor queries into Transformer decoders. Both kinds of queries have the same input format of (x,y,w,h)ùë•ùë¶ùë§‚Ñé(x,y,w,h) and can be fed into Transformer decoders simultaneously. For noised queries, we perform a denoising task to reconstruct their corresponding GT boxes. For other learnable anchor queries, we use the same training loss and bipartite matching as in the vanilla DETR.\nAs the noised bounding boxes do not need to go through the bipartite graph matching component, the denoising task can be regarded as an easier auxiliary task, helping DETR alleviate the unstable discrete bipartite matching and learn bounding box prediction more quickly.\nMeanwhile, the denoising task also helps lower the optimization difficulty because the added random noise is usually small.\nTo maximize the potential of this auxiliary task, we also regard each decoder query as a bounding box + a class label embedding so that we are able to conduct both box denoising and label denoising. In summary, our method is a denoising training approach. Our loss function consists of two components. One is a reconstruction loss and the other is a Hungarian loss which is the same as in other DETR-like methods. Our method can be easily plugged into any existing DETR-like method. For convenience, we utilize DAB-DETR ¬†4 to evaluate our method since their decoder queries are explicitly formulated as 444D anchor boxes (x,y,w,h)ùë•ùë¶ùë§‚Ñé(x,y,w,h). For DETR variants that only support 222D anchor points such as anchor DETR ¬†[ref]21, we can do denoising on anchor points. For those that do not support anchors like the vanilla DETR ¬†, we can do linear transformation to map 444D anchor boxes to the same latent space as for other learnable queries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce the denoising principle into detection models. We summarize our contribution as follows: We design a novel training method to speed up DETR training. Experimental results show that our method not only accelerates training convergence but also leads to a remarkably better training result ‚Äî achieving the best result among all detection algorithms in the 121212-epoch setting. Moreover, our method shows a remarkable improvement (+1.91.9+\\textbf{1.9} AP) over our baseline DAB-DETR and can be easily integrated into other DETR-like methods. We analyze the slow convergence of DETR from a novel viewpoint and give a deeper understanding of DETR training. We design a metric to evaluate the instability of bipartite matching and verify that our method can effectively lower the instability. We conduct a series of ablation studies to analyze the effectiveness of different components of our model, such as noise, label embedding, and attention mask. This paper is an extension of our previous paper 0 that was accepted to CVPR‚Äô2022 as an oral presentation. Compared with its conference version, this paper brings some new contributions as follows. We achieve better results and faster convergence by introducing deformable attention into our decoder layer. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of denoising training by adding it to other DETR-like models without 4D anchor design, including Vanilla DETR without explicit anchors and Anchor DETR with only 2D anchors. We also show denoising training can improve segmentation models such as Mask2Former and Mask DINO. We incorporate denoising training to the traditional CNN detector Faster R-CNN to show its generalization ability. We provide more experimental results and analysis to get a better understanding of our method.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: To obtain a good performance, it usually takes 500500500 epochs of training on the COCO detection dataset, in contrast to 121212 epochs used in the original Faster-RCNN training.
