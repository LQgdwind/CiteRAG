      "content": "Paper Title: A Heuristically Self-Organised Linguistic Attribute Deep Learning in Edge Computing For IoT Intelligence\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, Deep Learning has been put a lot of attention by researchers. It uses multiple processing layers of computational models to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. Each successive layer is fed by the outputs of previous layer, forming a hierarchy of attributes from bottom to top. Deep learning uses the back-propagation algorithm to learn internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer, thus to find the hidden structure or information in large data sets. Various deep learning architectures such as deep neural networks, convolutional deep neural networks, deep belief networks and recurrent neural networks have been developed. Deep learning has been successfully applied in the areas of speech recognition [ref]15 [ref]16 , image processing , object detection [ref]18 , drug discovery  and genomics , etc. Especially, deep convolutional nets (ConvNets) have brought about breakthroughs in processing images , video , speech  and audio , whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech . ConvNets are constructed layer by layer for data processing. A classic application of a ConvNet is in image processing, utilising the properties of a colour image, consisting of the RGB channels of pixel values. Since the early 2000s, ConvNets have been successfully applied for the detection, segmentation and recognition of objects and regions based on images, for example, face recognition . Druzhkov and Kustikova  did a survey on deep learning methods for image classification and object detection, covering autoencoders, restricted Boltzmann machines and convolutional neural networks. For example, Szegedy et al.  used deep neural networks to solve the problem of object detection for both classifying and precisely locating objects of various classes; Simonyan et al.  used deep fisher networks for the classification of large-scale images from ImageNet (http://image-net.org/); Krizhevsky et al.  trained a large deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.3 million high-resolution images in the LSVRC-2010 ImageNet training set into the 1000 different classes; and He et al.  proposed an unsupervised feature learning framework, Deep Sparse Coding, which extends sparse coding to a multi-layer architecture for visual object recognition tasks. Acoustic modeling is another area, where large, deep neural networks have been successfully applied. Like ImageNet, the massive quantities of existing transcribed speech data provide rich resources for deep learning. Dahl  provided a brief review of the deep neural net approach to large vocabulary speech recognition (LVSR) in his thesis. Mohamed et al. showed that hybrid acoustic models of pre-trained deep neural networks, instead of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), could greatly improve the performance of a small-scale phone recognition; By using rectified linear units and dropout, Dahl et al.  further improve the model for a large vocabulary voice search task. A combination of a set of deep learning techniques has led to more than 1/3 error rate reduction over the conventional state-of-the-art GMM-HHM (Hidden Markov Model) framework on many real-world LVCSR tasks . The qualitative properties of text data, very different to that of other modality data, provide critical challenges in use of machine learning. Recently Socher et al.  developed recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank, and improved the accuracy. Natural language understanding is another exploration of deep learning application, which could make a large impact over the next few years . The property of compositional hierarchies of some signals is\nwell exploited by deep neural networks through composing\nlower-level features to abstract the high-level one. For example,\nan image can be represented by a hierarchy from local edges,\nmotifs, parts, to objects. Similarly, speech and text also have a\nhierarchy from sounds to phones, phonemes, syllables, words\nand sentences. In other words, this properties promote the capacities\nof deep neural networks. However, the interpretability\nof the decision making process is still an issue. Also, we cannot\nalways explicitly see the semantics of higher-level features in\nother application domains. With rapid progress and significant successes in a wide spectrum\nof applications, deep learning is being applied in many\nsafety-critical environments. Ching et al.  forecasted that deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside\nwith the potential to transform several areas of biology and\nmedicine, although the limited amount of labelled data for\ntraining presents problems as well as legal and privacy constraints\non work with sensitive health records. However, deep\nneural networks (DNNs) have been recently found vulnerable\nto well-designed input samples called adversarial examples,\nand adversarial perturbations are imperceptible to human but\ncan easily fool DNNs in the testing/deploying stage . The\ntransparency of LAH allows the observation of the decision\nprocess. He et al.  have investigated the effect of different input attributes on different positions in a linguistic attribute hierarchy. This might indicate a linguistic attribute deep learning could provide good transparency to help people to defend\nadversarial perturbations to IoT Intelligence, which is out of\nthe scope of this research. GPU has become the necessary hardware facility for the research\non deep learning due to its complexity. Justus et al. \nanalysed various factors that influence the complexity of deep\nlearning, and divided these factors to three categorises: (1)\nLayer features, such as activate function, optimiser of weights\n(e.g. Gradient Descent) and number of training samples; (2)\nlayer specific features, including four subcategories: i. Multi-\nLayer Perception features (e.g. number of inputs, number\nof neurons and number of layers), ii. Convolutional features\n(e.g. matrix size, kernel size, stride size, input padding, input\ndepth and output depth, etc.); iii. Pooling features (e.g. matrix\nsize, stride size, input padding), iv. Recurrent features (e.g.\nRecurrence type, bi-directionality); (3) Hardware Features (e.g.\nGPU technology, GPU count, GPU memory, GPU memory\nbandwidth, GPU clock speed, GPU cord count, GPU peak\nperformance, Card Connectivity). The first two categories of\nfactors determine the performance of the function represented\nby a deep learning model, while the GPU feature directly\naffect the efficiency of the computing. It is hard to express the\npolynomial relationship between the computing cost and all the\nvarious factors, or use a big O(*) to represent the computing\ncomplexity.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: networks, convolutional deep neural networks, deep belief networks and recurrent neural networks have been developed. Deep learning has been successfully applied in the areas of speech recognition [ref]15 [ref]16 , image processing , object detection [ref]18 , drug discovery  and genomics , etc. Especially, deep convolutional nets (ConvNets) have brought about breakthroughs in processing\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
