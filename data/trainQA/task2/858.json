Fences.  Fences, including LFENCE and MFENCE [ref]1, are placed before memory operations to serialize the program execution and prevent speculative execution. Kernel Isolation.  KAISER (Kernel Address Isolation to have Side-channels Efficiently Removed) and its Linux implementation named Kernel Page Table Isolation (KPTI) isolate user-space memory from kernel space to prevent Meltdown attacks, by unmapping kernel pages from user-space [ref]4. Prevent Mis-training.  As many Spectre variants (v1, v1.1, v1.2, v2) leverage the mis-training of the branch predictors, Intel, AMD and ARM have proposed defenses to prevent mis-training, e.g., Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (IBRS), Single Thread Indirect Branch Prediction (STIBP) and Indirect Branch Predictor Barrier (IBPB). Some AMD CPUs allow invalidating branch predictor and Branch Target Buffer (BTB) on context switches [ref]5. Retpoline.  Retpoline is a method where indirect branches, which use potentially poisoned BTBs, are replaced by return instructions that use the return stack. Address Masking.  To address the problem of software-defined boundary bypass, the V8 JavaScript engine and the Linux kernel implement software address masking by forcing the accessed memory to be within the legal range . Industrial Defenses against Other Specific Variants.  ARM implemented Speculative Store Bypass Barrier (SSBB) and proposed Speculative Store Bypass Safe (SSBS) to avoid speculative store bypass. Intel implemented Return Stack Buffer (RSB) stuffing, e.g., inserting interrupts to increase call depth, to defend against the Spectre-RSB attack. Intel also announced a silicon-based solution, i.e., the next-generation Cascade Lake processor . Academia defenses. \nRecent defenses against speculative attacks have also been proposed in academia, e.g., Context-sensitive fencing , Secure automatic bounds checking , SpectreGuard , NDA , ConTExT , Specshield , STT , DAWG , InvisiSpec , Safespec , Conditional Speculation , Efficient invisible speculative execution  and CleanupSpec . We discuss and model them in Section V.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Table II shows some industry defenses that have been implemented to mitigate some speculative attacks.
