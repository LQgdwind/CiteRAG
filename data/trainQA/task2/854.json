      "content": "Paper Title: Multilingual Music Genre Embeddings for Effective Cross-Lingual Music Item Annotation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnder the music genre translation framework introduced in Section 2, the main goal boils down to quantifying the degree of relatedness of two textual tags.\nThis task is widely popular in the natural language processing (NLP) community and contemporary approaches resort to expressing the relatedness as distance between corresponding word embeddings  [ref]9 [ref]10.\nThe mapping of words on embeddings is guided by the distributional hypothesis , which states that words in similar contexts are likely to have similar meanings.\nWord embeddings have been proven effective in capturing word syntactic and semantic similarities and in improving downstream NLP tasks such as natural language understanding  and information retrieval . In order to measure the relatedness of multilingual words using embeddings learnt from monolingual corpora, an alignment between the language-specific embedding spaces is required.\nThrough the alignment [ref]25, we ensure that multilingual word embeddings are projected into a common space where they are comparable.\nPractically, a mapping function between two monolingual word embedding spaces is learnt, for instance by using a bilingual lexicon .\nEffective alignments have been also found using orthogonal Procrustes [ref]25 . Starting from multilingual word vectors, we discuss strategies to initialize the music genre embeddings.\nMusic genres can contain multiple words.\nWe claim that the compositionality principle, stating that the meaning of a multi-word expression is dictated by the meaning of each word, often holds for our case.\nFor instance, Dance pop is related to dance and pop or Balada romántica is a type of ballad which is romantic111Exceptions from the principle also exist (e.g. hard rock)..\nThe contemporary approach for compositional embeddings is to learn a function which derives the embeddings of a multi-word expression from the embeddings of its words .\nThe function is learnt by minimizing the distance for each multi-word expression between its distributional embedding and its embedding computed from its word embeddings.\nObtaining the distributional embedding for multi-word music genres would be however challenging because sufficiently large corpora with all tags in multiple languages are required. For this reason, the first music genre initialization strategy we propose consists of a simple compositionality function such as averaging word embeddings (avg).\nLet V={c1,c2,…,cn}𝑉subscript𝑐1subscript𝑐2…subscript𝑐𝑛V=\\{c_{1},c_{2},...,c_{n}\\} be the multilingual vocabulary, cisubscript𝑐𝑖c_{i} being a concept composed of at least one word.\nWe aim to compute Q^∈I​Rn×d^QIsuperscriptR𝑛𝑑\\hat{\\textbf{Q}}\\in{\\rm I\\!R}^{n\\times d}, the embedding matrix for the vocabulary V𝑉V, where q^i∈I​Rdsubscript^q𝑖IsuperscriptR𝑑\\hat{\\textbf{q}}_{i}\\in{\\rm I\\!R}^{d} denotes the embedding of concept cisubscript𝑐𝑖c_{i}.\nIf cisubscript𝑐𝑖c_{i} is composed of the following words, {w1,w2,…,wM}subscript𝑤1subscript𝑤2…subscript𝑤𝑀\\{w_{1},w_{2},\\dots,w_{M}\\}, q^isubscript^q𝑖\\hat{\\textbf{q}}_{i} can be computed as 1M​∑m=1Mwm1𝑀superscriptsubscript𝑚1𝑀subscriptw𝑚\\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{m=1}^{M}{\\textbf{w}_{m}}, where wmsubscriptw𝑚\\textbf{w}_{m} is the embedding of the word wmsubscript𝑤𝑚w_{m}.\nOf note is that if cisubscript𝑐𝑖c_{i} contains words absent from the pretrained word embedding vocabulary, the d𝑑d-dimensional null vector, 0dsubscript0𝑑\\textbf{0}_{d}, is used as a default. The second music genre initialization strategy we propose exploits the fact that some words in a compounded expression may be more illustrative than others.\nThe more frequently a word is observed in a corpus, the more likely it is that the word is common for a language and semantically less informative (e.g. music in post industrial music).\nThus, the compositional embedding computation of a multi-word expression can be modified such that the contribution of each word embedding is inversely proportional to its frequency.\nPre-trained word embeddings are generally released sorted by decreasing word corpus frequency.\nLet zwmsubscript𝑧subscript𝑤𝑚z_{w_{m}} be the rank of wmsubscript𝑤𝑚w_{m} in this vocabulary.\nThen, based on the Mandelbrot’s generalization  of the Zipf’s law , its frequency fwmsubscript𝑓subscript𝑤𝑚f_{w_{m}} can be estimated to fwm=1/(zwm+2.7)subscript𝑓subscript𝑤𝑚1subscript𝑧subscript𝑤𝑚2.7f_{w_{m}}=1/(z_{w_{m}}+2.7). Further, we rely on the smooth inverse frequency (sif) based averaging proposed by Arora et al.  to compute the multi-word expression embeddings.\nThis method is aligned with our previous observations and proven highly effective compared to more complex neural network-based models on a large diversity of NLP tasks .\nGiven fwmsubscript𝑓subscript𝑤𝑚f_{w_{m}} the estimated frequency of the word wmsubscript𝑤𝑚w_{m} and a𝑎a a fixed hyper-parameter222Experimentally, it has been shown that a=10−3𝑎superscript103a=10^{-3} is a suitable choice when using different types of pre-trained word embeddings ., q^isubscript^q𝑖\\hat{\\textbf{q}}_{i} is computed as: where u is the first singular vector from the singular value decomposition of Q¯¯Q\\overline{\\textbf{Q}} obtained with the Equation 2 .\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: task is widely popular in the natural language processing (NLP) community and contemporary approaches resort to expressing the relatedness as distance between corresponding word embeddings  [ref]9 [ref]10.\nThe mapping of words on embeddings is guided by the distributional hypothesis , which states that words in similar contexts are likely to have similar meanings.\nWord embeddings have\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
