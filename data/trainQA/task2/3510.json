      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Effective and Robust Neural Trojan Defenses via Input Filtering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDue to space limit, in this section we only discuss related work about\nTrojan defenses. Related work about Trojan attacks are provided in\nAppdx.¬†0.A. A large number of Trojan\ndefenses have been proposed so far, among which Neural Cleanse (NC)\n[ref]47, Network Pruning (NP) ,\nSTRIP , Neural Attention Distillation (NAD)\n, and Februus [ref]5 are representative\nfor five different types of defenses and are carefully analyzed in\nSection¬†5.1. DeepInspect ,\nMESA 5 improve upon NC by synthesizing a distribution\nof triggers for each class instead of just a single one. TABOR \nadds more regularization losses to NC to better handle large and scattered\ntriggers. STS  restores triggers by minimizing\na novel loss function which is the pairwise difference between the\nclass probabilities of two random synthetic Trojan images. This makes\nSTS independent of the number of classes and more efficient than NC\non datasets with many classes. ABS  is a quite\ncomplicated defense inspired by brain stimulation. It analyzes all\nneurons in the classifier ùô≤ùô≤\\mathtt{C} to find ‚Äúcompromised‚Äù\nones and use these neurons to validate whether ùô≤ùô≤\\mathtt{C} is attacked\nor not. DL-TND , B3D \nfocus on detecting Trojan-infected models in case validation data\nare limited. However, all the aforementioned defenses derived from\nNC still make the same ‚Äúinput-agnostic trigger‚Äù and ‚Äúsingle\ntarget class‚Äù assumptions as NC, and hence, are supposed to be ineffective\nagainst attacks that break these assumptions such as input-specific\n2 3 and all-target attacks. Activation\nClustering  and Spectral Signatures \nregard hidden activations as a clue to detect Trojan samples from\nBadNet . They base on an empirical observation\nthat the hidden activations of Trojan samples and clean samples of\nthe target class usually form distinct clusters in the hidden activation\nspace. These defenses are of the same kind as STRIP and are not applicable\nto all-target attacks. Mode Connectivity Repair (MCR) \nmitigates Trojans by choosing an interpolated model near the two end\npoints of a parametric path connecting a Trojan model and its fine-tuned\nversion. MCR was shown to be defeated by InpAwAtk in 2.\nAdversarial Neuron Pruning (ANP)  leverages\nadversarial learning to find compromised neurons for pruning. Our\nAIF is different from ANP in the sense that we use adversarial learning\nto train an entire generator ùô∂ùô∂\\mathtt{G} for filtering input instead\nof pruning neurons.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: discuss related work about\nTrojan defenses. Related work about Trojan attacks are provided in\nAppdx.¬†0.A. A large number of Trojan\ndefenses have been proposed so far, among which Neural Cleanse (NC)\n[ref]47, Network Pruning (NP) ,\nSTRIP , Neural Attention Distillation (NAD)\n, and Februus [ref]5 are representative\nfor five different types of defenses and are carefully analyzed in\nSection¬†5.1.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
