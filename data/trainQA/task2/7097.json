      "content": "Paper Title: Fast Inner-Product Algorithms and Architectures for Deep Neural Network Accelerators\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThroughput, defined in Eq. (31a), motivation and explanation provided in Section 6.2.1. Throughput per compute area, defined in\nEq. (31b), motivation and explanation provided in Section 6.2.1. Throughput per compute area per clock cycle, defined in Eq. (31l), motivation and explanation provided in Section 6.2.1. See the corresponding definitions from Table 6.2.2. Weights and layer outputs are quantized to 8 bits. Layer input is quantized to 16-bit due to Winograd convolutional transformations. These works use Winograd’s minimal filtering algorithms  to reduce multiplication complexity. This is a central processing unit (CPU)-FPGA heterogeneous work where portions of the inference are performed on CPU. See the corresponding definitions from Table 6.2.2. Weights and layer inputs are quantized to 8 and 16 bits, respectively. Weights are quantized to 8 bits and layer input/output is quantized to 8 or 16 bits at different stages. As derived in Eqs. (24) -\n(26) versus\n(28) -\n(30), (F)FIP increases the theoretical roof of the\nperformance metrics defined in Eqs. (31a) -\n(31l) in the general case, regardless of the\nimplementation technology. To empirically validate this, we compare our results\nin this section against the prior state-of-the-art, and since our FFIP algorithm\nand generalized architecture were validated on FPGA,\nwe confirm our theoretical insights by comparing the benefits of the proposed\nFFIP architecture against the best-in-class prior\nsolutions also evaluated on FPGA. We demonstrate that FFIP is extremely\ncompetitive and\nsurpasses the prior works in the evaluated performance metrics. Due to the clear advantages, increasing the theoretical limits of the\nperformance metrics defined in Eqs. (31a) -\n(31l) from Section 6.2.1 has been\nfocused on recently in other works as well. The works by\nYepez et al. [ref]18 and Jiang et al. \ndo this by\nexploiting Winograd’s minimal filtering algorithms applied to convolutional\nneural networks as shown by the work from Lavin et al. . However,\nas shown in Table 6.2.2, the FFIP architectures surpass the prior works\nin effective ability to reduce the multiplication complexity of the neural\nnetwork workloads,\nshown by\ncomparing the operations/multiplier/clock cycle metric defined in\nEq. (31l).\nFurthermore,\nWinograd’s minimal filtering algorithms\nare applicable only to convolutional layers, whereas FIP and FFIP are applicable\nto all deep learning models and layer types that mainly decompose to matrix\nmultiplication, such as fully-connected, convolutional, recurrent, and\nattention/transformer layers.\nFinally, the Winograd convolution technique\n still results in matrix multiplication, which can therefore\nstill achieve further compute efficiency improvements by also\nexecuting the\nresulting matrix multiplication on a systolic array architecture housing FFIP\nPEs. Additionally, the Arria 10 DSPs 6 can each perform two\nmultiplications between one\n18-bit and one 19-bit integer input. As demonstrated in the works by Liu et al. 7 and Fan et al. 8, it is possible to pack the\nmultiplier inputs\nsuch that each 18×\\times19-bit multiplier performs two multiplications of 6-bit\ninputs.\nThe remaining two 2×\\times8-bit multiplications\nand two 2×\\times6-bit multiplications required are then performed\nand summed using extra ALMs. The works by Liu et al. 7 and Fan\net al. 8 use this technique to improve the DSP efficiency for\n8-bit inputs. However, this technique requires a noticeable extra cost in ALMs,\nit is specific to the particular DSP architecture currently being used in\nIntel/Altera\nFPGAs 6, and it does not work for 16-bit inputs.\nWe also note that the works from Liu et al. 7 and Fan et al. 8\nreport the total resources available on the FPGA in their comparison with prior\nwork, however, we list their total instantiated resources that are also reported\nin their work\nin our comparison since it is the more common practice and\nis more favourable for them to use in the comparison here. We also note that, while our system implementation required more FPGA memory\nresources than some of the other works, the FFIP architecture proposed in this\nwork affects only to the systolic array of an accelerator and does not consume\nany of the memory resources itself. The memory subsystem design used in our\nexample accelerator implementation that is consuming the majority of the FPGA\nmemory resources was used to ensure that off-chip memory bandwidth was not a\nbottleneck on the Arria 10 SoC Developement Kit available to us in order to\nensure we could properly evaluate the benefits of FFIP on that platform. FFIP\ncan be used in any accelerator system that uses traditional fixed-point systolic\narrays for the arithmetic without fundamentally altering the accelerator’s\nfunctionality or internal interfaces in any way, and its usage is orthogonal to\nthe memory subsystem being used in the accelerator. To make comparisons as fair as possible, we aligned as many variables as\npossible to the best of our ability in the comparisons in Tables\n6.2.2 - 6.2.2 in regards to making comparisons against\nimplementations on the same FPGA, the same input/datapath bitwidths, and the\nsame ML models. However, since it is not feasible in implementation time to\nevaluate any one solution for all ML models on all platforms, Tables\n6.2.2 and 6.2.2 compare\nprior works on the same FPGA family and the same datapath/input\nbitwidths but for varying ML models.\nHowever, since it was not possible to find any more recent prior works\nevaluated on Arria 10 devices that also evaluate identical\nML models as we did, we also provide Table 6.2.2, which compares prior\nworks sometimes evaluated on different FPGAs than our validation platform, but\nfor identical ML models and identical or similar input/datapath bitwidths. Despite the strategies used in some prior works for increasing the theoretical\nlimits of the performance metrics defined in Eqs. (31a) -\n(31l), the results from Tables 6.2.2 -\n6.2.2, demonstrate that the proposed FFIP approach is the most\neffective at doing so and can provide performance improvements against the\nbest-in-class prior works in almost all evaluated performance metrics and every\nevaluated comparison criteria. When comparing the lowest to highest performing\nmodels evaluated on FFIP for throughput per compute area per clock cycle against the\nnext-most competitive result from the prior works in each table,\nFFIP is approximately 1.6-2×\\times higher in Table 6.2.2, it is overall on-par in Table 6.2.2 (even when including\nthe CPU-FPGA heterogeneous system in the comparison ), and\n1.6-3.7×\\times higher in Table 6.2.2. Furthermore, once we account\nfor the higher clock frequency achieved due to the inherent hardware-efficient\nnature of FFIP, it is further improved over the next-most\ncompetitive works in each table, achieving approximately a 3.7-4.6×\\times improvement\nin Table 6.2.2, a 1.4-1.8×\\times improvement in Table 6.2.2, and a\n2.8-6×\\times improvement in Table 6.2.2. Finally, our FFIP\nimplementation allowed us to achieve the highest overall throughput over the\nnext-most competitive prior works in each table, achieving approximately a 1.4-1.8×\\times improvement in Table 6.2.2, a 1.1-1.4×\\times improvement in Table 6.2.2, and\na 1.7-4.6×\\times improvement in Table 6.2.2, allowing us to increase the\nthroughput limits of the evaluation device well beyond its theoretical\nthroughput limits determined by Eq. (24c).\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: increasing the theoretical limits of the\nperformance metrics defined in Eqs.
