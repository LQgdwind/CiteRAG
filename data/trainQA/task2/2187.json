      "content": "Paper Title: Self-supervised Incremental Deep Graph Learning for Ethereum Phishing Scam Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe thriving Ethereum market has also bred a lot of criminal activities like phishing scam6[ref]5[ref]34, Ponzi scheme, ransomware0, etc. For the phishing scam detection problem on Ethereum, there are two main categories of existing methods, the former mainly employs shallow models such as 1) traditional machine learning methods with dedicated feature engineering, and 2) some random-walk based network embedding methods[ref]34, such as DeepWalk, Node2Vec4, etc. The latter applies some deep graph models like the graph convolutional network9 (GCN) based methods. These methods show pretty good performance in their data collected. However, as mentioned in Section 1, two problems limit the practical application of these methods. 1) Most of the existing methods are transductive, which make predictions in a single fixed graph. Therefore, they do not naturally generalize to unseen nodes or sub-graphs, and for a high-throughput active blockchain platform like Ethereum, an inductive method to process fast-evolving in-coming transaction data is in need. 2) A biased sampling process is employed in graph data generation. To alleviate the label scarcity problem and scalability problem, existing methods[ref]5 generate the graph data by a random walk sampling process with labeled phishing nodes as the start, which will result in different node distribution between the sampled graph and original graph. Hence, in this paper, we propose SIEGE to learn useful node representations from the original transaction without sampling. It is also inductive and can be used for phishing node detection in an entirely new transaction graph.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: The thriving Ethereum market has also bred a lot of criminal activities like phishing scam6[ref]5[ref]34, Ponzi scheme, ransomware0, etc. For the phishing scam detection problem on Ethereum, there are two main categories of existing methods, the former mainly employs shallow models such as\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
