      "content": "Paper Title: Strategy Synthesis for Zero-Sum Neuro-Symbolic Concurrent Stochastic Games\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGame theory offers an attractive framework for analysing strategic interactions among agents in machine learning, with application to, for instance, the game of Go [ref]1, autonomous driving  and robotics . An important class of dynamic games is stochastic games , which move between states according to transition probabilities controlled jointly by multiple agents (also called players). Extending both strategic-form games to dynamic environments and Markov decision processes (MDPs) to multiple players, stochastic games have long been used to model sequential decision-making problems with more than one agent, ranging from multi-agent reinforcement learning , to quantitative verification and synthesis for equilibria [ref]6. Recent years have witnessed encouraging advances in the use of neural networks (NNs) to approximate either value functions or strategies  for stochastic games that model large, complex environments.\nSuch end-to-end NNs directly map environment states to Q-values or actions.\nThis means that they have a relatively complex structure and a large number of weights and biases,\nsince they interweave multiple tasks (e.g., object detection and recognition, decision making) within a single NN.\nAn emerging trend in autonomous and robotic systems is neuro-symbolic approaches,\nwhere some components that are synthesized from data (e.g., perception modules) are implemented as NNs,\nwhile others (e.g., nonlinear controllers) are formulated using traditional symbolic methods.\nThis can greatly simplify the design and training process, and yield smaller NNs. Even with the above advances, there remains a lack of modelling and verification frameworks\nwhich can reason formally about the correctness of neuro-symbolic systems.\nProgress has been made on techniques for both multi-agent verification  \nand safe reinforcement learning  in this context,\nbut without the ability to reason formally about stochasticity,\nwhich is crucial for modelling uncertainty.\nElsewhere, concurrent stochastic games (CSGs) have been widely studied     ,\nand also integrated into formal modelling and verification frameworks [ref]6,\nbut primarily in the context of finite state spaces,\nwhich are insufficient for many real-life systems. We propose a new modelling formalism called neuro-symbolic concurrent stochastic games (NS-CSGs),\nwhich comprise two finite-state agents endowed with perception mechanisms implemented via NN classifiers and conventional, symbolic decision-making mechanisms.\nNN perception mechanisms assume real-valued inputs, which naturally result in continuous-state spaces that are partitioned according to the observations made by the NNs.\nUnder the assumption that agents have full state observability and working with Borel state spaces, we establish restrictions on the modelling formalism\nwhich ensure that the NS-CSGs belong to a class of uncountable state-space CSGs \nthat are determined for zero-sum discounted cumulative objectives, and therefore prove the existence and measurablity of the value function for such objectives. Next, we propose a new Borel measurable piecewise-constant (B-PWC) representation for the value function and show its closure under the minimax operator. Using this (finite) representation, we develop an implementable B-PWC VI algorithm for NS-CSGs that approximates the value of the game and prove the algorithm’s convergence. Then, we present a\nMinimax-action-free PI algorithm for NS-CSGs inspired by recent work for finite state spaces [ref]17, which we generalise by using novel representations for the value functions and strategies, constant-piecewise-linear (CON-PWL)\nand constant-piecewise-constant (CON-PWC),\nto ensure finite representability and measurability. This allows us to overcome the main issue that arises when solving Borel state space CSGs\nwith PI, namely that the value function may change from a Borel measurable function to a non-Borel measurable function across iterations. The PI algorithm adopts the alternating player choices proposed in [ref]17 and removes the need to solve normal-form games and MDPs at each iteration.\nTo the best of our knowledge, these are the first implementable algorithms for solving zero-sum CSGs over Borel state spaces with convergence guarantees.\nFinally, we illustrate our approach by modelling a dynamic vehicle parking as an NS-CSG and synthesizing (approximately optimal) strategies using a prototype implementation of our B-PWC VI algorithm. We note that we assume a fully observable game setting. While it is relatively straightforward to generalise NS-CSGs with partial observability, since NS-CSGs already include perception functions that generate observations, there are no general algorithmic methods for value and strategy computation in the partially observable game setting. We believe that an approach similar to  , which converts imperfect-information games to perfect-information, can potentially be used to enable the solution of partially observable NS-CSGs.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Game theory offers an attractive framework for analysing strategic interactions among agents in machine learning, with application to, for instance, the game of Go [ref]1, autonomous driving  and robotics .
