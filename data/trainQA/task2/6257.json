Textual inversion   and Hard prompt made easy (PEZ) [ref]34 find text representations (e.g., embedding, token) corresponding to a set of images of an object without changing parameters of the text-to-image model. DreamBooth  fine-tunes an entire text-to-image model on a few images describing the subject of interest. As such, it is more expressive and captures the subject with greater details. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA [ref]13 or adapter tuning , are adopted to improve its efficiency [ref]3 . Custom diffusion  and SVDiff  have extended DreamBooth to synthesize multiple subjects simultaneously.\nUnlike these methods built on text-to-image diffusion models, we build StyleDrop on Muse , a generative vision transformer.  [ref]34  have shown learning styles with text-to-image diffusion models, but from a handful or a dozen of style reference images, and are limited to painting styles. We demonstrate on a wide variety of visual styles, including 3d rendering, design illustration, and sculpture, using a single style reference image. Neural Style Transfer (NST). A large body of work     has investigated style transfer using deep networks by solving a composite objective of style and content consistency . Recently,  has shown that quantizing the latent space leads to improved visual and style fidelity of NST compared to continuous latent spaces.\nWhile both output stylized images, StyleDrop is different from NST in many ways; ours is based on text-to-image models to generate content, whereas NST uses an image to guide content (e.g., spatial structure) for synthesis; we use adapters to capture fine-grained visual style properties; we incorporate feedback signals to refine the style from a single input image. Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) is a new paradigm for fine-tuning of deep learning models by only tuning a much smaller number of parameters, instead of the entire model. These parameters are either subsets of the original trained model, or small number of parameters that are added for the fine-tuning stage. PEFT has been introduced in the context of large language models   [ref]13, and then applied to text-to-image diffusion models   with LoRA [ref]3 or adapter tuning . Fine-tuning of autoregressive (AR)    and non-autoregressive (NAR)    generative vision transformers has been studied recently , but without the text modality.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: Text-to-Image Synthesis has been studied to edit images of personal assets by leveraging the power of pre-trained text-to-image models.
