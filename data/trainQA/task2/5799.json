      "content": "Paper Title: Uncertainty Calibration for Counterfactual Propensity Estimation in Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Missing Not At Random (MNAR) is an critical issue in modern recommendation systems, which is derived from the missing ratings of the users .\nThere are two kind of selections bias that leads to MNAR : (a) user selection bias: a user only rate the items that he likes and (b) item selection bias: items’ exposure are selectively provided by recommendation systems.\nTo solve this problem, the inverse propensity scoring (IPS) approach is used to deal with the selection bias from the perspective of solving MNAR using counterfactual estimation  . It inversely scores the prediction error of every rating using the propensity of that rating  . The robustness and accuracy of the inverse probability estimation is the key to the counterfactual learning for the recommendation systems. The imputation errors and propensities are simultaneously considered in a doubly robust way for recommendation on MNAR [ref]38 and reinforcement learning 1. For machine learning methods which are widely used in recommending systems, the uncertainty quantification is often not well characterized and tends to produce over-confident predictions, not only for the deep learning models [ref]8 but also for the shallow models, such as the logistic regression .\nThe uncertainty quantification can be characterized by using Bayesian methods, ensemble methods or calibration with binning and scaling .\nThe uncertainty of personalized ranking probabilities is learned by uncertainty calibration methods  5 and later applied in the online advertising systems  . The propensity scoring probabilities are, in fact, miscalibrated which further limits the effectiveness of IPS, although validated in recommendation system and other applications.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, the expected propensity-scores are not calibrated with the fraction of the observed samples, compared with the perfectly calibration (the diagonal line).\nIn the sense of uncertainty calibration, the expected or predicted propensity scoring, for example 95%percent9595\\%, should have the same level of the fraction of the observed sample (95%percent9595\\%).\nThe uncertainty originates in the inaccurate prediction of the inverse propensity scoring part and the following recommendation on MNAR with miscalibrated inverse propensities would be inaccurate. In this paper, we propose the uncertainty calibration method for the propensity estimation in recommendation, which is the first work on the uncertainty quantification and calibration for the recommendation systems with selection biases. The contribution of this paper are as follows: We analyze the inverse propensity-scores approach and reveal the uncertainty miscalibration which limits the debiasing performance of the inverse propensity scoring estimator in the recommendation systems. We propose to use calibration error to estimate the quality of propensity-scores and propose the thoughtful uncertainty calibration methodology for the propensity-scores. We give the theoretical analysis and experimental results to show the show the superiority of uncertainty calibration for the unbiased performance estimation in recommendation systems.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: is the key to the counterfactual learning for the recommendation systems.
