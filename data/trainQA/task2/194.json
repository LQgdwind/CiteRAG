      "content": "Paper Title: ESBM: An Entity Summarization BenchMark\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRDF data describes entities with triples representing property values. In an RDF dataset, the description of an entity comprises all the RDF triples where the entity appears as the subject or the object. An example entity description is shown in Fig. 1. Entity descriptions can be large. An entity may be described in dozens or hundreds of triples, exceeding the capacity of a typical user interface. A user served with all of those triples may suffer information overload and find it difficult to quickly identify the small set of triples that are truly needed. To solve the problem, an established research topic is entity summarization , which aims to compute an optimal compact summary for the entity by selecting a size-constrained subset of triples. An example entity summary under the size constraint of 5 triples is shown in the bottom right corner of Fig. 1. Entity summarization supports a multiplicity of applications  . Entity summaries constitute entity cards displayed in search engines , provide background knowledge for enriching documents [ref]26, and facilitate research activities with humans in the loop  [ref]4. This far-reaching application has led to fruitful research as reviewed in our recent survey paper . Many entity summarizers have been developed, most of which generate summaries for general purposes. Research Challenges.\nHowever, two challenges face the research community. First, there is a lack of benchmarks for evaluating entity summarizers. As shown in Table 1, some benchmarks are no longer available. Others are available    but they are small and have limitations. Specifically,  has a task-specific nature, and   exclude classes and/or literals. These benchmarks could not support a comprehensive evaluation of general-purpose entity summarizers. Second, there is a lack of evaluation efforts that cover the broad spectrum of existing systems to compare their performance and assist practitioners in choosing solutions appropriate to their applications. Contributions.\nWe address the challenges with two contributions. First, we create an Entity Summarization BenchMark (ESBM) which overcomes the limitations of existing benchmarks and meets the desiderata for a successful benchmark . ESBM has been published on GitHub with extended documentation and a permanent identifier on w3id.org111https://w3id.org/esbm under the ODC-By license. As the largest available benchmark for evaluating general-purpose entity summarizers, ESBM contains 175 heterogeneous entities sampled from two datasets, for which 30 human experts create 2,100 general-purpose ground-truth summaries under two size constraints. Second, using ESBM, we evaluate 9 existing general-purpose entity summarizers. It represents the most extensive evaluation effort to date. Considering that existing systems are unsupervised, we also implement and evaluate a supervised learning based entity summarizer for reference. In this paper, for the first time we comprehensively describe the creation and use of ESBM. We report ESBM v1.2—the latest version, while early versions have successfully supported the entity summarization shared task at the EYRE 2018 workshop222https://sites.google.com/view/eyre18/sharedtasks and the EYRE 2019 workshop.333https://sites.google.com/view/eyre19/sharedtasks We will also educate on the use of ESBM at an ESWC 2020 tutorial on entity summarization444https://sites.google.com/view/entity-summarization-tutorials/eswc2020. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related work and limitations of existing benchmarks. Section 3 describes the creation of ESBM, which is analyzed in Section 4. Section 5 presents our evaluation. In Section 6 we discuss limitations of our study and perspectives for future work.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: of Fig. 1.
