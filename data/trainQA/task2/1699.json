      "content": "Paper Title: Structured Scene Memory for Vision-Language Navigation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVision-Language Navigation (VLN). Since the release of R2R dataset‚Äã¬†[ref]3, numerous VLN methods are proposed, which mainly focus on the use of deep multimodal learning to arrive at navigation policies. For instance, from imitation learning (IL)‚Äã¬†[ref]3, to the hybrid of model-free and model-based RL‚Äã¬†, to the ensemble of IL and RL‚Äã¬†8, different learning regimes are developed. For further boosting learning, some methods try to mine extra supervisory signals from synthesized samples‚Äã¬†   or auxiliary tasks¬†8   . Hence, for more intelligent path planning, the abilities of self-correction¬†  and active exploration¬† are addressed. Some other recent studies also address environment-agnostic representation learning¬†, fine-grained instruction grounding¬†  , web image-text paired data based self-pretraining¬† , or perform VLN in continuous environments¬†. Existing VLN agents are built upon Seq2Seq models¬†[ref]3, where past observations are encoded as the hidden states of recurrent units. Thus they struggle to precise memorization over long time lags and fail to explore environment layouts. In contrast, our agent is empowered with an external, structured memory for effective space representation and efficient memory operation. It provides a global action space and allows flexible decision making. A concurrent work‚Äã¬†[ref]11 also addresses planning over topological space representation. In [ref]11, visual and geometric information of the environment are mixed together in the scene map. But these two are disentangled in ours, facilitating instruction grounding. Hence, to avoid a huge action space, we propose a frontier-exploration based decision making strategy, with a navigation utility driven policy learning regime. However, [ref]11 requires a specifically designed planner with a subset of the decision space and trains the agent only with IL. ùí¢tsubscriptùí¢ùë°\\mathcal{G}_{t}ùí¢t+1subscriptùí¢ùë°1\\mathcal{G}_{t+1} Neural Networks with External Memory. Many tasks require capturing structures within sequential data, such as machine translation and question answering.\nThough recurrent networks¬† have been shown Turing-Complete¬† and applicable for sequential learning, their ability in modeling long-term data structure is limited, as their memory are latent network states. Recent work¬† further explores augmenting networks with outside memory, which allows for long-term memorization as well as explicit memory manipulation (such as read and write operations). Some representative ones show remarkable success in language modeling¬†   , robot control¬† , and meta-learning 1. Inspired by their novel ideas, we develop a structured, external memory architecture, which can store percepts during long-time exploration and capture environment layouts. With a collect-read controller that addresses adaptive context information gathering, we believe our memory design is well-suited to the performance of the VLN task. Space Representation and Path Planning in Navigation. To perform autonomous navigation, it is crucial to humanize a robot into learning spatial environments and making planning. Classic strategies typically build space representation via SLAM 6 , fusing multi-modal signals, such as LIDAR, depth, or structure from motion. With the estimated maps, path planning is made    for traveling to goal locations. Recent efforts focus on learning navigation policies over spatial representations¬†  4, topological maps¬†2  2  , or designing trainable planners¬† [ref]11. As for VLN, current methods rarely make use of scene maps, and thus cannot make robust planning. Although some ones address better planning through rule-based beam search¬†, self-correction¬† , or active perception¬†, they still suffer from a local action space and latent memory. Instead, we explore and store scene representation through a structured memory, which provides a global action space and facilitates long-term reasoning. Hence, a frontier-exploration based decision making strategy is adopted to prevent the rapidly expanding action space from causing expensive learning and slow convergence.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN).
