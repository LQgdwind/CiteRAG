      "content": "Paper Title: Rare Gems: Finding Lottery Tickets at Initialization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA large body of research since the 1980s empirically observed that large neural networks can be compressed or sparsified to a small fraction of their original size while maintaining their predictive accuracy\n [ref]28     . Although several pruning methods have been proposed during the past few decades, many of them follow the “train, prune, re-train” paradigm. Although the above methods result in very sparse, accurate models, they typically require several rounds of re-training, which is computationally intensive. Frankle & Carbin [ref]9 suggest that this computational burden may be avoidable.\nThey conjecture that given a randomly initialized network, one can find a sparse subnetwork that can be trained to accuracy comparable to that of its fully trained dense counterpart. This trainable subnetwork found at initialization is referred to as a lottery ticket.\nThe study above introduced iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) as a means of finding these lottery tickets. Their experimental findings laid the groundwork for what is now known as the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH). Although Frankle & Carbin [ref]9 establish that the LTH is true for tasks like image classification on MNIST, they were not able to get satisfactory results for more complex datasets like CIFAR-10 and ImageNet when using deeper networks, such as VGG and ResNets [ref]10. In fact, subsequent work brought the effectiveness of IMP into question. Su et al.  showed that even randomly sampled sparse subnetworks at initialization can beat lottery tickets found by IMP as long as the layerwise sparsities are chosen carefully. Gale et al.  showed that methods like IMP which train tickets from initialization cannot compete with the accuracy of a model trained with pruning as part of the optimization process. Frankle et al. [ref]10 explain the failures of IMP using the concept of linear mode connectivity which measures the stability of these subnetworks to SGD noise. Extensive follow-up studies propose several heuristics for finding trainable sparse subnetworks at initialization   . However, subsequent work by Frankle et al. , Su et al.  show experimentally that all of these methods fail simple sanity checks. Most methods seem to merely identify good sparsities at each layer, but given those, random sparse subnetworks can be trained to similar or better accuracy. Frankle et al. [ref]10 show that with a small modification, IMP can beat these sanity checks; the caveat is that it no longer finds these subnetworks at initialization, but after a few epochs of warm-up training. Since these subnetworks are found after initialization, IMP with warmup does not find lottery tickets. As noted in the original work by Frankle & Carbin [ref]9, the importance of finding trainable subnetworks at initialization is computational efficiency. It is far preferable to train a sparse model from scratch, rather than having to deal with a large dense model, even if that is for a few epochs (which is what IMP with warmup does).\nTo the best of our knowledge, the empirical validity of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, i.e., the hunt for subnetworks at initialization trainable to SOTA accuracy, remains an open problem. We resolve this open problem by developing Gem-Miner, an algorithm that finds sparse subnetworks at initialization, trainable to accuracy comparable or better than IMP with warm-up.\nGem-Miner does so by first discovering rare gems. Rare gems are subnetworks at initialization that attain accuracy far above random guessing, even before training. Rare gems can then be refined to achieve near state-of-the-art accuracy. Simply put, rare gems are lottery tickets that also have high accuracy at initialization. High accuracy at initialization is not a requirement for a network to be defined as a lottery ticket. However, if our end goal is high accuracy after training, then having high accuracy at initialization likely helps. Rare gems found by Gem-Miner are the first lottery tickets to beat all baselines in  . In Fig. 1 we give a sketch of how our proposed algorithm Gem-Miner compares with IMP with warm start.\nGem-Miner finds these subnetworks in exactly the same number of epochs that it takes to train them, and is up to 19×\\times faster than IMP with warmup.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: of research since the 1980s empirically observed that large neural networks can be compressed or sparsified to a small fraction of their original size while maintaining their predictive accuracy\n [ref]28     .
