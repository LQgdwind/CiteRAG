      "content": "Paper Title: Grounding is All You Need? Dual Temporal Grounding for Video Dialog\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVideo dialog aims to generate a free-form answer to a follow-up question, which is based on the content of video data and the history of multi-turn question-answer pairs, as shown in Fig. 1. This task is related to a series of vision-and-language tasks such as video sentence grounding 0 [ref]23  , video question answering  , and video relation detection  , etc. Unlike image-grounded dialog  , video dialog requires hierarchical cognition and reasoning (such as action, event, et al.) of video data, which involves much more abundant information than image. The main challenge of video dialog is to accurately comprehend the content depicted in the video, and to effectively utilize the dialog history between the user and the dialog agent. Addressing these two challenges simultaneously is crucial for generating coherent and sensible responses. Recent endeavors in the domain of video dialog have harnessed the power of large-scale pretrained models like GPT , UniVL [ref]27 and LLaMA . Such models, which accept video frames, dialog history, and questions, have been fine-tuned to address video dialog-specific challenges. The strength of pretrained visual-language models lies in their capacity to exploit vast pre-existing knowledge, addressing the shortcomings of limited video dialog datasets. Yet, for all their prowess in many vision-and-language tasks, these models stumble in accurately modeling temporal relations in dialog history, occasionally yielding suboptimal outcomes by accommodating irrelevant video content   4. On the flip side, object-centric methodologies, such as those by Geng et al. , Kim et al. , and Pham et al. , delve into temporal relations via object trajectories, extracting them from video sequences with tools like Faster-RCNN and the DeepSort algorithm. Despite their intricate spatial-temporal graphs and alignment strategies, these approaches encounter limitations, particularly when different objects in a single video clip correspond to diverse question-answer pairs, and their computational demands can be prohibitive. A more holistic perspective acknowledges the dynamic nature of video dialog; attention across multiple question-answer pairs frequently spans the entire video sequence. Therefore, Enhancing the granularity of temporal localization for each question-answer pairing can amplify response generation accuracy. By seamlessly linking related conversational turns, a richer contextual understanding is achieved, thereby optimizing answer generation and boosting the model’s overall interpretability. Still, it’s noteworthy that numerous prior strategies, as depicted in Fig. 1, have somewhat simplistically leaned on the immediate preceding question-answer turns or processed the collective history linearly, often neglecting the distinct temporal relevance of each pairing to the video content. Therefore, we introduce the Dual Temporal Grounding-enhanced Video Dialog (DTGVD) model. This innovative approach capitalizes on the dual temporal dynamics inherent in both video sequences and dialog histories. At its foundation, DTGVD employs the UniVL pretrained visual-language model [ref]27 to discern the critical temporal segments of each dialog interaction. This allows for a focused response generation that is rooted in contextually relevant video segments while simultaneously leveraging pertinent dialog turns. The model’s design exhibits a meticulous attention to the temporal intricacies of conversations. To further enhance this alignment, we incorporate a list-wise contrastive learning paradigm: accurately grounded turn-clip pairings are treated as positive benchmarks, guiding the system away from less accurate predictions. This strategy culminates in a comprehensive end-to-end training mechanism that prioritizes reference response fidelity.\nOverall, our main contributions are summarized as follows: We propose a temporal grounding module to explicitly model the attention shift of each dialog turn over the video, and generate the temporal masks to filter out irrelevant video frames and irrelevant dialog history. Based on the predicted temporal region of each QA pair, we design a novel contrastive objective function to enhance the selection of related video clips. We achieve promising performance as compared with SOTA methods. Experiments on two popular benchmark datasets verified the effectiveness of our method. And experiments on various pretrained models verified the expandability of the method.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: on the content of video data and the history of multi-turn question-answer pairs, as shown in Fig. 1.
