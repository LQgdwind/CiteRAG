      "content": "Paper Title: Improved Adversarial Training Through Adaptive Instance-wise Loss Smoothing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe experiments in this section were based on the following setup unless otherwise specified. We evaluated our method with model architectures Wide ResNet34-10 (WRN34-10)  on dataset CIFAR10  and PreAct ResNet18 (PRN18)  on datasets CIFAR100  and SVHN [ref]31.\nModels were trained by stochastic gradient descent for 200 epochs with an initial learning rate 0.1 for CIFAR10/100 and 0.01 for SVHN, divided by 10 at 50% and 75% of epochs. The momentum was 0.9, the weight decay was 5e-4 and the batch size was 128. The default data augmentation for CIFAR10/100 was horizontal flip (applied at half chance) and random crop (with 4 pixel padding). No data augmentation was applied to SVHN. Experiments were run on Tesla V100, A100 and RTX 3080Ti GPUs. All results generated by us were averaged over 3 runs. For AT, we used ‚Ñì‚àûsubscript‚Ñì\\ell_{\\infty} projected gradient descent attack [ref]3 with a perturbation budget, œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon, of 8/255. The number of steps was 10 and the step size was 2/255 for CIFAR10/100 and 1/255 for SVHN.\nTo stabilize the training on SVHN, the perturbation budget, œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon, was increased from 0 to 8/255 linearly in the first five epochs and then kept constant for the remaining epochs, as suggested by . Robustness was evaluated against AutoAttack  using the implementation of . Note that, following , we tracked PGD10 robustness on the test set at the end of each epoch during training and selected the checkpoint with the highest PGD10 robustness, i.e., the ‚Äùbest‚Äù checkpoint to report robustness. We compare our method with related works including AWP , TRADE , InfoAT , RWP , GAIRAT , FAT , MART  and LAS-AT  on CIFAR10. All their result were copied from the original work or other published source like RobustBench . They used the same model architecture and the same, or very similar, training settings as we did. We additionally evaluated the performance of our method when combined with the data augmentation method IDBH (weak variant)  and with extra data like RST [ref]10 to benchmark state-of-the-art robustness. We observed that our method when combined with IDBH, akin to , benefited from training longer so the total number of training epochs was increased to 400. Note that AT alone with IDBH (IBDH+AT) degenerated as the length of training was increased, so we report its performance with the default settings. For experiments with extra data, we used WideResNet28-10 instead of WideResNet34-10 to align with experimental protocols used in related works for a fair comparison. We adopted the same extra data as [ref]10, i.e., 500K unlabled data from dataset 80 Million TinyImages (80M-TI) with pseudo-labels333The extra data was downloaded from the official git repository of [ref]10: https://github.com/yaircarmon/semisup-adv..\nAs in [ref]10, extra data was included in the ratio 1:1 with the CIFAR10 data in each training mini-batch, so the effective batch size became 256. The hyper-parameters of our method were optimized using grid search. The optimal values found were: Œª=0.1ùúÜ0.1\\lambda=0.1 and Œ≥=0.007ùõæ0.007\\gamma=0.007 for CIFAR10; Œª=0.1ùúÜ0.1\\lambda=0.1 and Œ≥=0.005ùõæ0.005\\gamma=0.005 for CIFAR10 with IDBH; Œª=0.01ùúÜ0.01\\lambda=0.01 and Œ≥=0.005ùõæ0.005\\gamma=0.005 for CIFAR10 with extra data; Œª=0.1ùúÜ0.1\\lambda=0.1 and Œ≥=0.005ùõæ0.005\\gamma=0.005 for CIFAR100; Œª=0.1ùúÜ0.1\\lambda=0.1 and Œ≥=0.009ùõæ0.009\\gamma=0.009 for SVHN. We observed that jointly smoothing input and weight loss with a large learning rate (0.1 in this case) degraded both accuracy and robustness due to over-regularization. Therefore, we adopted a warm-up strategy for ŒªùúÜ\\lambda on CIFAR10/100: ŒªùúÜ\\lambda was set to 0 during the initial epochs when the learning rate was large, and ŒªùúÜ\\lambda was set to the optimal value after first decay of the learning rate. Note that this strategy was not applied to the experiments with SVHN because the initial learning rate on SVHN was already small.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: setup unless otherwise specified.
