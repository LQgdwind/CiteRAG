Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: How Far Can I Go ? : A Self-Supervised Approach for Deterministic Video Depth Forecasting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDataset: We use the KITTI [ref]12 and Cityscapes  datasets to evaluate our method for outdoor scenes. For KITTI, we adopt the training protocols used in Eigen et al. [ref]9, and specifically, we use the KITTI Eigen splits that contain 22600 train, 888 validation, and 697 test stereo image pairs. For Cityscapes, it is a more challenging dataset with many dynamic scenes. With a few exceptions   [ref]17 it has not been used\nfor depth estimation evaluation. It has 38675 training examples. We use depth from the disparity data for evaluation on a standard evaluation set of 1250 samples  . We evaluate on both these datasets following the same evaluation strategy used in semantic forecasting  . Implementation Details: We implement our framework in PyTorch and conduct experiments on a 11 GB Nvidia RTX 2080-Ti GPU. The ResNext  backbone is pre-trained on ImageNet  using batch normalisation. The input dimensions of\nthe video frames are set as 512√ó10245121024512\\times 1024 i.e H‚Ä≤=512superscriptùêª‚Ä≤512H^{{}^{\\prime}}=512 and W‚Ä≤=1024superscriptùëä‚Ä≤1024W^{{}^{\\prime}}=1024. Optical Flow for the video frames are computed using the flow network\nin FlowNet2.0 . Our DeFNet and Ego-Motion Network is jointly trained for 30 epochs with learning rate of 0.00010.00010.0001 using Adam Optimizer . The entire network takes 535353 mins to converge. The learning objective hyperparameters Œ±/Œª/Œ≥ùõºùúÜùõæ\\alpha/\\lambda/\\gamma are set to 0.4/0.5/0.6. For fair comparison, we follow existing work [ref]17, where we consider k = 5 and k = 10 frames in the future (corresponding to respectively 0.29s and 0.59s). The mean inference speed of our DeFNet on image of size 512√ó10245121024512\\times 1024 is 131313 FPS on 2080GTX GPU. Evaluation Metric: We quantify our approach following standard monocular depth estimation setting in short and mid term setting. Specifically, we report the square relative error ( Sq Rel), absolute relative error (Abs Rel), root mean square error (RMSE), log scale invariant RMSE (RMSE-Log) and the amount of inliers (Œ¥ùõø\\delta) for both KITTI and Cityscapes dataset. We refer the reader to [ref]9 or appendix for a complete description of these metrics.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Dataset: We use the KITTI [ref]12 and Cityscapes  datasets to evaluate our method for outdoor scenes.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
