      "content": "Paper Title: Whole-Graph Representation Learning For the Classification of Signed Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlthough much less common than for unsigned graphs, many vertex representation learning methods have been developed for signed graphs. Historically, the first type of such method relied on random walks, e.g., Signed Network Embedding (SNE)  or Signed Directed Embeddings (SIDE) . The general idea is to sample the graph using random walks and feed them to a standard neural network, which learns a representation that preserves both graph structure and edge signs. Put differently, the representations of two well-connected vertices tend to be close in the embedding space, whereas those of two vertices connected by a negative edge tend to be distant. Signed Network Embedding (SiNE)  relies on a deep learning framework. Unlike the previous methods, it does not use random walks to decompose the network, but simpler subgraphs as it extracts all the open triads. The neural network is trained to learn a representation of a vertex that is similar to its direct positive neighbors, and dissimilar to its direct negative neighbors. We describe SiNE in further detail in Section 4.1. More recently, a group of methods leveraged GNN (Graph Neural Networks) to learn a representation of vertices in signed graphs. The first one, Signed Graph Convolutional Network (SGCN) , directly generalizes Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) [ref]32 to signed graphs, by proposing a dual representation and a dual message passing rule to take positive and negative paths into account (cf. Section 4.3 for more details). Methods such as Signed Graph Attention Networks (SiGAT)  or Signed Network Embedding via Graph Attention (SNEA) [ref]35 introduce attention in the process, to give more importance to relevant neighbors during the message passing step. Hierarchical Signed Graph Representation Learning (HSGRL)  extends SNEA by including an additional pooling module. Based on an information-based centrality metric, it selects a fixed number of vertices and uses their individual representations to build an overall representation of the whole signed graph. According to our review of the literature, HSGRL is the only method able to do so. However, it is designed only for fully connected graphs: this restricts its application to a very specific type of graphs and constitutes a serious limitation of this method. Indeed, the signed networks used in the literature to model and study real-world systems are typically sparse, see for instance  .\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: (Graph Neural Networks) to learn a representation of vertices in signed graphs.
