A benefit of such an objective is that it promotes exploration to find a more effective policy for minimizing the surprise . In particular, in , they maximize surprise according to all prior experiences while minimizing surprise according to the current episode. However, they find that it only helps in some cases. The challenge is to find an effective way to optimize these two opposite objectives since if we add the two objectives, it would simply yield a linear interpolation of the two objectives, which still corresponds to either maximizing or minimizing. A previous work , dubbed Adversarial Surprise (AS), resolves this challenge using an adversarial game where two policies compete against each other: one maximizes surprise while the other minimizes surprise. AS  requires training two policies that do not share parameters or data. Instead, we propose a novel yet simple mixture of policies to maximize and minimize surprise simultaneously. Our mixture of policies does not rely on an adversarial game  in which training is known to be challenging  and uses a single network for both objectives resulting in higher sample efficiency. Mainly, our method only requires a minor change to CIC  that does not involve any additional computational cost during training. In particular, our mixture of policies builds on a competence-based approach , meaning we use two disjoint skill sets. We separate the two opposite objectives using a different skill set for each objective: one skill set for surprise maximization and another for surprise minimization. Specifically, we define the mixture of policies using a binary random variable M𝑀M, where we associate each mixture component with a continuous uniform distribution 𝒰d​(a,b)superscript𝒰𝑑𝑎𝑏\\mathcal{U}^{d}(a,b) on an interval [a,b]𝑎𝑏[a,b]. Each uniform distribution constitutes a skill distribution. Maintaining two different skill distributions allows us to define a different objective for each distribution. In particular, we define two distributions 𝐙max∼P​(𝐙∣M=0)similar-tosubscript𝐙𝑃conditional𝐙𝑀0\\mathbf{Z}_{\\max}\\sim P(\\mathbf{Z}\\mid M=0) and 𝐙min∼P​(𝐙∣M=1)similar-tosubscript𝐙𝑃conditional𝐙𝑀1\\mathbf{Z}_{\\min}\\sim P(\\mathbf{Z}\\mid M=1). Since we do not assume any priors on the entropy of the environment’s dynamics, we deterministically set M=0𝑀0M=0 for the first half of the steps and M=1𝑀1M=1 for the other half of the steps in the episode.\nCompared to more sophisticated methods (e.g., appendix B) for setting M𝑀M (i.e., switching the objective), such a heuristic adds no computational cost during training, requires no hyper-parameter tuning, and performs well. Moreover, motivated by the discussions in Section 3.2, we build our method on top of the CIC\n222The implementation provided by CIC (https://github.com/rll-research/cic) is based on the arxiv version (https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00161v2) which is an updated version of the ICLR version (https://openreview.net/forum?id=kOtkgUGAVTX). In particular, in the arxiv version, the intrinsic reward only relies on the KNN estimates and the NCE term is only used to train ϕs,ϕz,ψsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑠subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑧𝜓\\phi_{s},\\phi_{z},\\psi. While, the ICLR version includes the NCE term in the intrinsic reward.\n framework. This framework is appealing as it bypasses the chicken and egg problem and supports high-dimensional skills. In addition, it significantly outperforms previous competence-based methods on the URLB benchmark [ref]32. Hence, following CIC , we use the decomposition in Eq. (1) In particular, we define surprise as the joint entropy, which corresponds to maximizing and minimizing ℍ​[𝐒′,𝐒]ℍsuperscript𝐒′𝐒\\mathbb{H}[\\mathbf{S}^{\\prime},\\mathbf{S}], and as in CIC  we use Eq. (4) to approximate the joint entropy. We approximate the conditional entropy ℍ​[𝐒′,𝐒∣𝐙]ℍsuperscript𝐒′conditional𝐒𝐙\\mathbb{H}[\\mathbf{S}^{\\prime},\\mathbf{S}\\mid\\mathbf{Z}] using a noise contrastive estimation following Eq. (5). By minimizing the conditional entropy, we distill behaviors into skills. Doing so also serves as representation learning for computing the joint entropy .\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: is appealing as it bypasses the chicken and egg problem and supports high-dimensional skills.
