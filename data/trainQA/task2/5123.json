      "content": "Paper Title: Multimodal Data Augmentation for Visual-Infrared Person ReID with Corrupted Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nData division. SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets have well-established V-I cross-modal protocols    [ref]49, but multimodal protocols remain to be built. Following SYSU-MM01 authors‚Äô cross-modal protocol, 395 identities were used for the training set, and 96 identities were used for the testing set. For RegDB, the 412 identities are kept as well into the two identical sets of 206 individuals. The SYSU-MM01 train/test ratio is kept for ThermalWORLD, leading to 325 training identities and 84 for testing. A 5-fold validation [ref]37 is performed over the data used for training, using folds of respectively 797979, 414141, and 656565 distinct identities for SYSU-MM01, RegDB, and ThermalWORLD. Data augmentation (DA). The Augmix, S-PATCH, or S-REA were evaluated following the original papers settings. Our proposed multimodal extensions M-PATCH and MS-REA were used with the same appearance augmentation probability as S-PATCH and S-REA. Modality Masking is applied randomly on one or another modality, with equiprobability, and occurs with a default probability of 1/8181/8. For RegDB, the validation set uses the same DA as the training set. This way, better performances were observed, since they maxed out in the early epochs, or otherwise do not learn complex cues for the model. Pre-processing. A data normalization is done at first by re-scaling RBG and IR images to 144√ó288144288144\\times 288. Random cropping with zero padding and horizontal flips are adopted for base DA. Those parameters were proposed by 0 on RegDB and SYSU-MM01 datasets. The same normalization is kept under ThermalWORLD for consistency among protocols. Hyperparameters. The hyperparameters values in our models were set based on the default AGW 0 baseline. The SGD is used for training optimization, combined with a Nesterov momentum of 0.90.90.9, and a weight decay of 5‚Äãe‚àí45ùëí45e-4. Our models are trained through 100100100 epochs. Early stopping is applied based on validation mAP performances. The learning rate is initialized at 0.10.10.1 and follows a warming-up strategy . The batch size is set to 32, with 8 distinct individuals and 4 images per individual. The paired image is selected by default for RegDB and ThermalWORLD. For the SYSU-MM01 dataset, the images from the hetero modality are randomly selected through the available ones for a given identity. Losses. The Batch Hard triplet loss  ‚ÑíBH_trisubscript‚ÑíBH_tri\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{BH\\_tri}} and the cross-entropy with regularization via Label smoothing  ‚ÑíCE_lssubscript‚ÑíCE_ls\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{CE\\_ls}} are used as loss functions for our models. Indeed, the former is widely used in person ReID approaches   0, so the same margin value is fixed at 0.30.30.3, and the latter is part of the CIL implementation . The total loss corresponds to the sum of both losses. The batch hard triplet loss aims at reducing the distance in the embedding space for the hardest positives while increasing the distance for the hardest negatives. The regularization with label smoothing works at reducing the gap between logits, which makes the model less confident on predictions and hence improves generalization . Leave-one-out query strategy.  The single-shot and the multi-shot settings  are widely used in cross-modal papers to form the query and gallery sets. For these settings, one or ten images from the hetero modality are selected per identity and camera to join the gallery, while the other modality forms the probe set. However, such an approach is not so realistic in a surveillance context, as the video makes the gallery number of frames per person vary much. These variations cannot be controlled as individuals are unknown in the final environment. Hence, a new strategy is developed, inspired by the leave-one-out cross-validation strategy [ref]37, named Leave-One-Out Query (LOOQ). The LOOQ strategy treats the extreme but meaningful case in which one would have only a unique image of the person to ReID and multiple footages containing images of this same person in the gallery. Every pair of images is alternatively used as a probe set while all the other pairs join the gallery. This allows us to respect the original dataset statistics (see Table 1) by authorising the gallery images per individual to vary. Also, the mINP metric relates to the hardest test sample from the same individual. Hence, computing this metric over multiple gallery images makes it more consistent, appearing even more important in a corrupted context. Concerning the implementation, the images are paired for both RegDB and ThermalWORLD datasets, so the paired image from the hetero modality joins the query and gallery set directly during the formation of those sets. However, SYSU-MM01 needs personal treatment since its images are not paired. Plus, the image number per modality for a given individual varies (Table 1). To solve this issue, as many pairs of images as possible are randomly selected with the constraint that one image from one modality or another must not appear in two distinct pairs. Because random image pairs are formed for SYSU-MM01, a mean of 30 trials is performed to present robust and reliable results according to the Central Limit Theorem.\n\nReference markers found: [49]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]49: Data division.
