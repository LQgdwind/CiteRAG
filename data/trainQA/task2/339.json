      "content": "Paper Title: Robust testing of low-dimensional functions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn adapting the outline above to the setting of tolerant testing, the\nmain challenge is to imitate step I above.\nOur main structural result roughly shows that if f𝑓f has correlation c𝑐c\nwith some linear k𝑘k-junta of surface area at most s𝑠s, then with high probability f𝑓f is at least c−ϵ𝑐italic-ϵc-\\epsilon correlated with an s𝑠s-smooth linear k𝑘k-junta defined on E𝐸E.\nIn fact, we need to define E𝐸E more carefully than what is outlined above, and a good error\nanalysis is crucial. If we were to combine our new structural result with a naive error analysis, it would\ngive a query complexity that is exponential in poly​(k)poly𝑘\\mathrm{poly}(k). The proof of our structural result is non-trivial. At the intuitive level it is related to the idea of using SVD for PCA. In our case, we have a function, rather than a collection of data, and the right geometric information is encoded by gradients (of a smoothed version of this function). The procedure of using SVD to extract informative directions from the data can be thought of as “Gradient Based PCA”. The proof that this procedure actually extracts the relevant dimensions requires combining linear algebraic and Poincare style geometric estimates in just the right way.\nAnother challenge comes from the fact that gradients are only approximate due to sampling effect. We use results from random matrix theory to control the effect of sampling. The methodology of Gradient Based PCA also allows us to improve on the results of  in the noiseless case for finding an approximation of the Junta. This has to do with the fact that the results of  used a more naive Gram–Schmidt based process to extract the linear structure which resulted in exponential query complexity, compared with the polynomial query complexity we achieve in the current work. Another key new ingredient of this current work is the net argument outlined above.\nWe show that\nthe class of s𝑠s-smooth linear k𝑘k juntas has an ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-net of size\nexp⁡exp⁡((s2​log⁡k)/ϵ2)superscript𝑠2𝑘superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\exp\\exp((s^{2}\\log k)/\\epsilon^{2}). For each function in the net, we can use the implicit projection algorithm to compute the correlation between this function and f𝑓f up to error ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon.\nThe maximum of these correlations gives a good estimate of the best correlation\nbetween f𝑓f and any linear k𝑘k-junta with surface area s𝑠s.\nThis concludes the proof sketch of Theorem 1.3. We note that there is a high-level similarity between the current proof and the proof that Boolean juntas are tolerant testable .\nBoth strategies are based on oracle access to influential “directions” followed by a search\nfor juntas depending only on those influential directions.\nIn the Boolean case, the “directions” are influential variables, while here the directions are given by gradients of the function f𝑓f.\nNote, however, that the Boolean case is easier, since the coordinates on the Boolean cube are automatically orthogonal, while in the continuous setup, “relevant directions” as sampled from data are often not orthogonal and indeed can be close to parallel. This is one of the major reasons we needed to introduce and analyze the methodology of gradient based PCA. Besides being related to the long line of work on junta testing, the current work is also connected to the rich area of learning and testing of threshold functions. In particular, an immediate corollary of Theorem 1.6 gives a fully noise tolerant tester for any function of k𝑘k-halfspaces over the Gaussian space. Despite prior work on testing of halfspaces   , until this work, no non-trivial noise tolerant tester was known even for a single halfspace. Finally, we remark that the notion of noise in property testing (including this paper) is the so-called adversarial label noise . This is stronger than many other noise models in literature such as the random classification noise  and Massart noise . Both these models are important from the point of view of learning theory – in particular, halfspaces (and polynomial threshold functions) are known to be efficiently learnable  [ref]20 in both these models of noise even when the background distribution is arbitrary. On the other hand, for arbitrary background distributions, halfspaces are hard to learn in the adversarial label noise model  [ref]16. In contrast, the tester in the current paper is in the adversarial label noise model but works only when the background distribution is the Gaussian. This discussion raises the intriguing possibility that halfspaces (and more generally linear juntas) can be tested in the distribution free model  with weaker models of noise such as the Massart noise.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: and Massart noise .
