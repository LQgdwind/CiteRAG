This work was supported by the Spanish MINECO under contract TEC2017-90034-C2-1-R (ALLIANCE), the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA) and the Secretariat for Universities and Research of the Ministry of Business and Knowledge of the Government of Catalonia as well as the European Social Fund.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraffic Engineering (TE) is a well-established mechanism that plays a fundamental role in the performance of today’s Internet . Particularly, its main goal is to provide efficient and reliable network operations, while optimizing the network resources . As a result, there exists a rich body of proposals based on different technologies (e.g., flow-based routing, link-state protocols, overlay networking) that target various optimization goals and network scenarios  . Beyond this broad definition, a fundamental TE problem traditionally addressed in the literature is intradomain TE, where the classic optimization goal is to minimize the maximum link load within a self-administered network domain (e.g., a carrier-grade network)   . This is a well-known NP-hard problem . The last few years have seen an increasing interest in the application of Machine Learning (ML) to complex network control and management problems [ref]9. Particularly, the outstanding results of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in other domains (see 0 and references therein) have awakened the interest of the networking community in understanding the true potential of this new technology for online network optimization tasks, such as TE (e.g., 1 2 3 4). In this paper, we raise an open question: Is ML ready for Traffic Engineering optimization? Here we refer to ready as achieving -at least- comparable performance and speed to state-of-the-art TE solutions based on classical optimization methods. In order to answer this question, we seek to create a TE solution leveraging the latest advancements in the ML field, and then experimentally compare it to the best TE approach available in the literature. We present a novel TE optimizer based on a combination of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) 5 and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) 6, which can be considered as the most advanced ML technologies for online optimization problems over graphs, such as TE. The proposed solution is distributed over the network devices and is tasked to address the intradomain TE problem. In particular, given a set of estimated traffic demands, the distributed agents of our MARL system cooperate to jointly optimize the link weights used by OSPF 7, with the ultimate goal of minimizing the most loaded link in the network. The proposed system is compatible with any network running a link-state intradomain routing protocol (e.g., OSPF, IS-IS, etc)111The source code and all data needed to reproduce our experiments is available at https://github.com/BNN-UPC/Papers/wiki/MARL-GNN-TE. Unlike previous ML-based proposals for TE (e.g., 1 2 8), the combination of MARL and GNN allows us to handle topologies of various sizes and structures in a distributed fashion; and more importantly, to achieve combinatorial generalization over the information exchanged by agents in the network, which is naturally represented as a graph 9 0. At the time of this writing, the most advanced proposals for TE are based on refined optimization algorithms, such as Constraint Programming , Local Search 1, Mixed Integer Linear Programming 2 or Column Generation 3. All these solutions offer significant performance improvements with respect to traditional routing strategies, such as shortest path routing or load balancing. In our evaluation, we focus on DEFO  as a benchmark for comparison, which is arguably among the best performing and most advanced TE solutions available 4. DEFO is a sophisticated proposal that represents the result of decades of research in TE. One of the main challenges in TE optimization is to reduce the dimensionality of the vast search space. To this end, DEFO proposes iddlepoint Routing (MR), a smart abstraction of routing inspired by Segment Routing 5. With this approach, and leveraging the SDN paradigm to implement a fully centralized optimization algorithm, the authors are able to optimize a network with close-to-optimal performance within few minutes, which allows for near real-time operation. In our experimental evaluation, we benchmark the proposed MARL system against DEFO across a wide variety of network scenarios. We first evaluate the performance of our solution in a set of real-world network topologies with realistic traffic matrices, and report comparable performance to DEFO. Then, we analyze the execution time (speed) of both solutions and show that our MARL system only requires few seconds to optimize a network, while DEFO operates at the scale of minutes . This improvement in terms of execution time is a result of the inherent distributed nature of our MARL system, which allows us to share the computation among the network devices without requiring any centralized entity. This enables for sub-minute real-time operation with comparable performance to the state-of-the-art in TE.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: network)   .
