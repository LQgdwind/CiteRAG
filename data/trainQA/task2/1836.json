      "content": "Paper Title: Parameterized Complexity of Elimination Distance to First-Order Logic Properties An extended abstract of this paper was accepted for 36th Annual Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS 2021). The two first authors have been supported by the Research Council of Norway via the project “MULTIVAL”. The third author has been supported by the ANR projects DEMOGRAPH (ANR-16-CE40-0028) and ESIGMA (ANR-17-CE23-0010) and the French-German Collaboration ANR/DFG Project UTMA ANR-20-CE92-0027.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe main reason why we give informal statements of our theorems in the introduction is due to the following issue.\nThe definition of elimination distance is tailored to the graph properties 𝒫𝒫{\\cal P} with the condition that G∈𝒫𝐺𝒫G\\in{\\cal P} if and only if C∈𝒫𝐶𝒫C\\in{\\cal P} for every component C𝐶C of G𝐺G.\nGraph properties defined by FOL do not necessarily satisfy such a condition. This leads to ambiguities. As an example, consider graph property 𝒫={G∣G⊧∀x​∀y​x=y}𝒫conditional-set𝐺models𝐺for-all𝑥for-all𝑦𝑥𝑦{\\cal P}=\\{G\\mid G\\models\\forall x\\forall y~{}x=y\\}. Thus G∈𝒫𝐺𝒫G\\in{\\cal P} if and only if G𝐺G is a single-vertex graph. Let G𝐺G be an edgeless graph with n≥2𝑛2n\\geq 2 vertices.\nSince G∉𝒫𝐺𝒫G\\notin{\\cal P} it would be a natural assumption that the elimination distance from G𝐺G to 𝒫𝒫{\\cal P} is positive. However, it is not:\nevery connected component of G𝐺G is in 𝒫𝒫{\\cal P} and, therefore, To avoid such ambiguities, we refine the definition of the elimination distance. Since we consider graph properties 𝒫φ={G∣G⊧φ}subscript𝒫𝜑conditional-set𝐺models𝐺𝜑{\\cal P}_{\\varphi}=\\{G\\mid G\\models\\varphi\\} for formulas φ𝜑\\varphi, we define the distances with respect to formulas. Notice that the notion of elimination distance combines “connectivity” and “inclusion” in a graph class. Depending on which of these two properties we want to\nprioritize, we give different definitions. Let φ𝜑\\varphi be a FOL formula. The first definition prioritize on connectivity. For a graph G𝐺G, we set if G𝐺G is connected. We set when G𝐺G is not connected. The second definition prioritize on the graph property We assume that 𝖾𝖽φconn​(G)=𝖾𝖽φprop​(G)=0superscriptsubscript𝖾𝖽𝜑conn𝐺superscriptsubscript𝖾𝖽𝜑prop𝐺0{\\sf ed}_{\\varphi}^{\\text{\\sf conn}}(G)={\\sf ed}_{\\varphi}^{\\text{\\sf prop}}(G)=0 if G=(∅,∅)𝐺G=(\\emptyset,\\emptyset) for any formula φ𝜑\\varphi. If\nφ𝜑\\varphi is such that G∈𝒫φ𝐺subscript𝒫𝜑G\\in{\\cal P}_{\\varphi} if and only if C∈𝒫φ𝐶subscript𝒫𝜑C\\in{\\cal P}_{\\varphi} for every component C𝐶C of G𝐺G, then 𝖾𝖽𝒫φ​(G)=𝖾𝖽φconn​(G)=𝖾𝖽φprop​(G)subscript𝖾𝖽subscript𝒫𝜑𝐺superscriptsubscript𝖾𝖽𝜑conn𝐺superscriptsubscript𝖾𝖽𝜑prop𝐺{\\sf ed}_{{\\cal P}_{\\varphi}}(G)={\\sf ed}_{\\varphi}^{\\text{\\sf conn}}(G)={\\sf ed}_{\\varphi}^{\\text{\\sf prop}}(G). However, in general\n𝖾𝖽φconn​(G)superscriptsubscript𝖾𝖽𝜑conn𝐺{\\sf ed}_{\\varphi}^{\\text{\\sf conn}}(G) and 𝖾𝖽φprop​(G)superscriptsubscript𝖾𝖽𝜑prop𝐺{\\sf ed}_{\\varphi}^{\\text{\\sf prop}}(G) may differ significantly.\nConsider φ=∃u​∃v​¬(u=v)∧¬(u∼v)𝜑𝑢𝑣𝑢𝑣similar-to𝑢𝑣\\varphi=\\exists u\\exists v~{}\\neg(u=v)\\wedge\\neg(u\\sim v) that defines the property that a graph has two nonadjacent vertices. Let G𝐺G be the disjoint union of the complete n𝑛n-vertex graph Knsubscript𝐾𝑛K_{n} and an isolated vertex. Then G⊧φmodels𝐺𝜑G\\models\\varphi and, therefore, 𝖾𝖽φprop​(G)=0superscriptsubscript𝖾𝖽𝜑prop𝐺0{\\sf ed}_{\\varphi}^{\\text{\\sf prop}}(G)=0. On the other hand, G𝐺G is not connected and it is easy to see that 𝖾𝖽φconn​(Kn)=nsuperscriptsubscript𝖾𝖽𝜑connsubscript𝐾𝑛𝑛{\\sf ed}_{\\varphi}^{\\text{\\sf conn}}(K_{n})=n. Given the above, a more precise statement of Theorems 1 and 2 is that they hold for both distances 𝖾𝖽φconnsuperscriptsubscript𝖾𝖽𝜑conn{\\sf ed}_{\\varphi}^{\\text{\\sf conn}} and 𝖾𝖽φpropsuperscriptsubscript𝖾𝖽𝜑prop{\\sf ed}_{\\varphi}^{\\text{\\sf prop}}. We also define another interesting type of elimination distance 𝖾𝖽φdepthsuperscriptsubscript𝖾𝖽𝜑depth{\\sf ed}_{\\varphi}^{\\text{\\sf depth}} that focuses on the depth of the elimination set. We prove Theorems 1 and 2 hold for that distance as well. Precise statements of both theorems and their proofs are given in Sections 4 and 5. Related work.\nResults of this work fit into two popular trends in logic and parameterized complexity. A\nsignificant amount of research in descriptive complexity is devoted to the study of prefix classes of certain logics. We refer to the book of\nBörger, Grädel, and Gurevich\n, as well as the aforementioned\nwork of\nGottlob, Kolaitis and Schwentick  for further references.\nThe study of graph modification problems is a well-established trend in parameterized complexity. The books     provide a comprehensive overview of the area.\nIn particular, Fomin, Golovach, and Thilikos \nstudied parameterized complexity of computing vertex deletion distance and edge editing to graph properties defined by first-order logic formulas; [15, Theorem 1] establishes fixed-parameter tractability for vertex removal to a graph property 𝒫φsubscript𝒫𝜑{\\cal P}_{\\varphi} for φ∈Σ3𝜑subscriptΣ3\\varphi\\in\\Sigma_{3} and shows that the problem is 𝖶⁡𝖶2\\operatorname{{\\sf W}}-hard for some\nφ∈Π3𝜑subscriptΠ3\\varphi\\in\\Pi_{3}. While our Theorem 1 reaches the same tractability border for the elimination distance, the proof is significantly more complicated. The general question on the parameterized complexity of elimination distance to graph properties was settled by Bulian and Dawar [ref]5 . Properties\nthat have been considered so far are minor-free graph classes , cluster graphs  , bounded degree graphs [ref]5 3, and H𝐻H-free graphs . Moreover,\nHols et al. 1 studied the existence of polynomial kernels for the Vertex Cover problem parameterized by the size of a deletion set to graphs of bounded elimination distance to certain graph classes.\nLindermayr, Siebertz, and Vigny 3 proved that computing the elimination distance to graphs of bounded degree is fixed-parameter tractable when the input does not contain K5subscript𝐾5K_{5} as a minor.\nWhile preparing our paper, we have learned about the very recent work of Agrawal et al. .\nAgrawal et al. established fixed-parameter tractability of\ncomputing an elimination distance to any graph property characterized\nby a finite set of graphs as forbidden induced subgraphs. Since graphs of bounded vertex degree can be characterized by a finite set of forbidden induced subgraphs, the work of Agrawal et al. answers the question of Bulian and Dawar \nabout the elimination distance to graphs of bounded degree. Comparing with the result of Agrawal et al. , our Theorem 1 is more general. First, it provides the tractability of the elimination ordering to a strictly larger family of graph properties. Every graph property described by a finite set of forbidden induced subgraphs is also definable by a formula from Σ3subscriptΣ3\\Sigma_{3}. However, properties like having a universal vertex or bounded diameter, which are expressible in Σ3subscriptΣ3\\Sigma_{3}, cannot be described by forbidden subgraphs. Second, Theorem 1 holds for three variants of the elimination distance:\n𝖾𝖽φconnsuperscriptsubscript𝖾𝖽𝜑conn{\\sf ed}_{\\varphi}^{\\text{\\sf conn}}, 𝖾𝖽φpropsuperscriptsubscript𝖾𝖽𝜑prop{\\sf ed}_{\\varphi}^{\\text{\\sf prop}}, and 𝖾𝖽φdepthsuperscriptsubscript𝖾𝖽𝜑depth{\\sf ed}_{\\varphi}^{\\text{\\sf depth}}. With this terminology, the result of Agrawal et al. is only about computing 𝖾𝖽φconnsuperscriptsubscript𝖾𝖽𝜑conn{\\sf ed}_{\\varphi}^{\\text{\\sf conn}}. When it comes to the proof techniques, both Theorem 1 and the result of Agrawal et al. use recursive understanding, which seems to be a very natural technique for approaching problems about elimination distances. However, the details are quite different.\nTo deal with various types of elimination distances and FOL formulas in a uniform way,\nwe need different combinatorial characterizations of the distances via sets of bounded elimination depths. Furthermore, while solving our problems on unbreakable graphs is done by recursive branching algorithms, similarly to Agrawal et al., we do it in\ndifferent way that exploits the random separation technique to deal with our more general FOL framework. Moreover, the analysis of components of the graph obtained by the deletion of an elimination set for\ncomputing 𝖾𝖽φdepth​(G)superscriptsubscript𝖾𝖽𝜑depth𝐺{\\sf ed}_{\\varphi}^{\\text{\\sf depth}}(G), and especially, 𝖾𝖽φprop​(G)superscriptsubscript𝖾𝖽𝜑prop𝐺{\\sf ed}_{\\varphi}^{\\text{\\sf prop}}(G), is great deal more challenging. In particular, this is the reason why we apply the random separation technique contrary to the more straightforward tools used by Agrawal et al. Overview of the approach.\nThe firsts two variants of the elimination distance that we examine are defined recursively using the containment in the graph class 𝒫φsubscript𝒫𝜑{\\cal P}_{\\varphi} as the base case. We start by providing equivalent formulations that are more suitable from the algorithmic perspective. For this, we introduce the notion of elimination set of depth at most d𝑑d that is a set X⊆V​(G)𝑋𝑉𝐺X\\subseteq V(G) that can be bijectively mapped to a rooted tree T𝑇T of depth d𝑑d expressing selection of elimination vertices in recursive calls.\nWe next prove that 𝖾𝖽φconn​(G)≤ksuperscriptsubscript𝖾𝖽𝜑conn𝐺𝑘{\\sf ed}_{\\varphi}^{\\text{\\sf conn}}(G)\\leq k if and only if G𝐺G has an elimination set of X𝑋X depth at most k−1𝑘1k-1\nsuch that C⊧φmodels𝐶𝜑C\\models\\varphi for every component C𝐶C of G−X𝐺𝑋G-X. Similar, however more technical,\nequivalent formulations is given for 𝖾𝖽φpropsuperscriptsubscript𝖾𝖽𝜑prop{\\sf ed}_{\\varphi}^{\\text{\\sf prop}}. All alternative definitions and the proofs of their equivalences to the recursive ones are gathered in Section 3. The new definitions allows to certify a solution by a set X𝑋X of bounded elimination depth. However, the size of X𝑋X could be unbounded. Moreover, there could be many connected components of G−X𝐺𝑋G-X and the sizes of these components could be immense. We use the recursive understanding technique, introduced by Chitnis et al. in  to reduce the solution of the initial problem to a much more structured problem. In the reduced problem, we can safely assume that each yes-instance is certified by an elimination set X𝑋X whose size,\nas well as the size of the union of all but one of the components of G−X𝐺𝑋G-X, is also bounded by a function of k𝑘k. More precisely, by making use of recursive understanding, we can consider only instances that are (p​(k),k)𝑝𝑘𝑘(p(k),k)-unbreakable for some suitably chosen function p𝑝p. Roughly speaking, a graph is (p​(k),k)𝑝𝑘𝑘(p(k),k)-unbreakable when it has no separator of size at most k𝑘k that partitions the graph in two parts of size at least p​(k)+1𝑝𝑘1p(k)+1 each. The application of recursive understanding uses the meta-algorithmic result of Lokshtanov et al. 4\nand the fact that all variants of the elimination distance to 𝒫φsubscript𝒫𝜑{\\cal P}_{\\varphi}\nare expressible in monadic-second order logic (MSOL) when ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi is a formula in FOL (5). The (p​(k),k)𝑝𝑘𝑘(p(k),k)-unbreakability permits us to assume that |X|≤p​(k)+k𝑋𝑝𝑘𝑘|X|\\leq p(k)+k. Moreover, exactly one connected component CXsubscript𝐶𝑋C_{X} of G−X𝐺𝑋G-X, is big, that is of size at least p​(k)+1𝑝𝑘1p(k)+1, and\nthe size of G−V​(CX)𝐺𝑉subscript𝐶𝑋G-V(C_{X}) is bounded by some function of k𝑘k (see 6).\nGiven that CXsubscript𝐶𝑋C_{X} is the big component corresponding to a solution X𝑋X, we also\nconsider the set SXsubscript𝑆𝑋S_{X} of the neighbours of the vertices of CXsubscript𝐶𝑋C_{X} in G𝐺G\nand we set UX=V​(G)∖(V​(CX)∪SX)subscript𝑈𝑋𝑉𝐺𝑉subscript𝐶𝑋subscript𝑆𝑋U_{X}=V(G)\\setminus(V(C_{X})\\cup S_{X}).\nWe show that |SX|≤ksubscript𝑆𝑋𝑘|S_{X}|\\leq k and |UX|≤p​(k)subscript𝑈𝑋𝑝𝑘|U_{X}|\\leq p(k). Our next step is to use the random separation technique, introduced by Cai, Chan, and Chan in .\nWe construct in FPT-time a family ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} of at most f​(k)⋅log⁡n⋅𝑓𝑘𝑛f(k)\\cdot\\log n partitions (R,B)𝑅𝐵(R,B) of V​(G)𝑉𝐺V(G) to “red” and “blue” vertices such that for every elimination set X𝑋X corresponding to a potential solution, ℱℱ{\\cal F}\ncontains some (R,B)𝑅𝐵(R,B) where UX⊆Rsubscript𝑈𝑋𝑅U_{X}\\subseteq R and SX⊆Bsubscript𝑆𝑋𝐵S_{X}\\subseteq B. In our algorithm, we go over all these blue-red partitions and, for each one of them, we\ncheck whether there exists an elimination set X𝑋X (called colorful elimination set) where all vertices in SXsubscript𝑆𝑋S_{X} are blue and all vertices in UXsubscript𝑈𝑋U_{X} are red. The correct “guess” of the above red-blue partition permits us to design a recursive procedure that solves the latter problem, i.e., finds a colourful elimination set X𝑋X.\nThis procedure is different for each of the three versions of the problem and its variants are presented in Subsection 4.2. The key task here is to identify the big component CXsubscript𝐶𝑋C_{X}.\nIt runs in FPT-time and its correctness is based on the prefix structure of the formula ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: elimination distance, the proof is significantly more complicated. The general question on the parameterized complexity of elimination distance to graph properties was settled by Bulian and Dawar [ref]5 .
