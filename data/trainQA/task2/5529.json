      "content": "Paper Title: Generation of Highlights from Research Papers Using Pointer-Generator Networks and SciBERT Embeddings\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe advancement of sequence-to-sequence models  has significantly improved the state-of-the-art in abstractive summarization [ref]13. Attention-based encoder of with a beam-search decoder has achieved significant performance in abstractive text summarization on DUC 2004 dataset . Convolutional attention-based conditional recurrent neural network was used to further improve the performance on Gigaword Corpus and DUC 2004 dataset . Nallapati et al.  proposed a model for abstractive text summarization based on attentional encoder decoder recurrent neural networks. To remove out-of-vocabulary words (OOV) and repeating words, a hybrid approach called pointer-generator network with coverage mechanism has been proposed [ref]7. It can copy words from the source text by pointing and uses coverage to keep track of what is summarized to avoid repetition. To represent the semantic information of words more correctly, Anh and Trang  have used two pre-trained word embeddings, namely, word2vec and FastText, with a pointer-generator model for the CNN/Daily Mail dataset and achieved an impressive performance. Du et al.  proposed a model to extract summary based on fuzzy logic rules, multi-feature set and genetic algorithm on DUC2002 dataset. Recently, pre-trained language models that generate contextual embeddings have become extremely popular and shown to achieve state-of-the-art results in many NLP tasks. Their mode of operation is as follows: train the model on a large corpus and then fine-tune it on various downstream task in NLP. Radford et al.  proposed Generative Pre-Training (GPT), which combines unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning, to improve language understanding. The implementation of the transformer architecture and its bidirectional encoder model BERT resulted in improved performance in downstream NLP tasks including text summarization [ref]20. BERT trains a deep bidirectional transformer encoder, which learns interactions between left and right context, using a masked language modelling objective [ref]20. For a new corpus, BERT can be fine-tuned for sentence-label and token-label tasks. Knowledge graphs (KGs) can be combined with BERT to capture the lexical, syntactic, and knowledge information at the same time . Researchers have also made available a few large deep neural models that are pre-trained specifically for the summarization task. A pre-trained model PEGASUS, trained using large pre-training corpora and a gap sentence generating task has been evaluated on 12 downstream summarization tasks . To overcome the disadvantages of limited input size in a BERT-based architecture, the BERT windowing method can be used . Raffel et al. proposed T5, which is an encoder-decoder model pre-trained on a multi-task mixture of unsupervised and supervised workloads, with each task transformed to text-to-text processing. BART  is a transformer encoder-encoder (seq2seq) model with a bidirectional BERT encoder and an autoregressive decoder (more specifically, generative pre-trained transformer or GPT). The pre-training task in BART entails changing the sequence of the original phrases at random and using a novel in-filling strategy that replaces text spans with a single mask token. BART is especially effective when fine-tuned for text generation, but it also performs well for comprehension tasks. Early work on extractive summarization of scientific documents was done with limited datasets, such as one of 188 document and summary pairs  where all the documents were gathered from 21 scientific/technical publications. A summarizing technique that focuses on the rhetorical status of assertions in 80 scientific articles, part of a larger corpus of 260 articles, has been developed by Teufel and Moens . A sentence-based automatic summarizing system has been built based on feature extraction and query-focused methods . Lloret et al.  have proposed a method to automatically generate the abstract of a research paper in the biomedical domain. They used two approaches – extractive as well as abstractive.\nTo better deal with the long text of a research paper in abstractive summarization, a multiple timescale model of the gated recurrent unit (MTGRU) has been used in . They have contributed a new corpus containing pairs of (introduction, abstract) of computer science papers from arXiv.org. Souza et al.  have proposed a multi-view extractive text summarization approach for long scientific texts. Recent advancements have attempted to summarize entire research papers, focusing specifically on the generation of the paper title from the abstract (title-gen) and the generation of the abstract from the body of the paper (abstract-gen) in biomedical domain . Since the keyphrases in a paper may be assumed to capture the main aspects of the paper, extraction   or generation   of keyphrases is a related area of research. However, we do not discuss it further as it does not produce sentential forms typically observed in a summary. Generating research highlights from scientific articles is different than document summarization. Collins, Augenstein and Riedel  have developed supervised machine learning methods to identify relevant highlights from the full text of a paper using a binary classifier. They also contributed a new benchmark dataset of URLs, which includes approximately 10,000 articles from computer science domain, labelled with relevant author-written highlights. Using multivariate regression methods for the same problem, Cagliero and Quatra in  selected the top-k𝑘k most relevant sentences from a paper as research highlights, unlike a simple binary classification of sentences as highlights or not. Note that this is also extractive in nature. Rehman et al.  proposed an abstractive summarization model based on pointer-generator network with coverage and GloVe embeddings to generate research highlights from abstracts. Later, Rehman et al.  combined named entity recognition with pointer-generator networks to improve the performance of their method.\nIn contrast to previous works, in the current one we use pre-trained SciBERT word embeddings and propose a new dataset.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: The advancement of sequence-to-sequence models  has significantly improved the state-of-the-art in abstractive summarization [ref]13.
