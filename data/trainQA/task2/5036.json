      "content": "Paper Title: Rewards Encoding Environment Dynamics Improves Preference-based Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate on the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC) [ref]44 and Meta-World  environments. DMC provides locomotion tasks with varying degrees of difficulty, while MetaWorld contains object manipulation tasks. For each task from DMC and MetaWorld, we evaluate performance on varying amounts of teacher feedback, i.e.¬†different preference dataset sizes, and different teacher labelling strategies. The number of queries (MùëÄM) presented to the teacher every KùêæK steps is set such that for a given task, teacher feedback always stops at the same episode across the different total teacher feedback amounts. Feedback is provided by simulated teachers following [ref]1    [ref]31, where six different labelling strategies are used to evaluate model performance in the face of different types and amounts of labelling noise. These teaching strategies were first proposed as a configurable stochastic preference model in . An overview of the labelling strategies is provided in Appendix A.2. Following [ref]1 and , an ensemble of three networks is used to model r^œàsubscript^ùëüùúì\\hat{r}_{\\psi} with a corresponding ensemble for the REED temporal consistency task. The ensemble is key for disagreement-based query sampling (see Section A.1) and was shown in  to improve final policy. All queried segments are of a fixed length (l=50ùëô50l=50)222Fixed segments lengths are not strictly necessary. However, when evaluating with simulated humans, the importance of fixed length segments depends on the environment ground truth reward function. For example, variable length segments are necessary when the reward is a constant step penalty.. The Adam optimizer  with (Œ≤1=0.9subscriptùõΩ10.9\\beta_{1}=0.9, Œ≤2=0.999subscriptùõΩ20.999\\beta_{2}=0.999, & no L2subscriptùêø2L_{2}-regularization)  is used to train on both the REED and non-REED tasks. For all PEBBLE-related methods, intrinsic policy training is reported in the learning curves and occurs over the first 9000 steps. None of the hyper-parameters or network architectures are altered from the original SAC , PPO , PEBBLE  nor PrefPPO  algorithms. The batch size for training on the preference dataset is MùëÄM, matching the number of queries presented to the teacher, and varies based on the amount of feedback. For details about model architectures and hyper-parameters, refer to Appendices A.4 and A.5. All experiments were run on a single GPU (Tesla V100) with 10 CPU cores (Intel Xeon Gold). The policy and preference learning implementations provided in the B-Pref repository 333https://github.com/rll-research/BPref are used for all experiments.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: We evaluate on the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC) [ref]44 and Meta-World  environments.
