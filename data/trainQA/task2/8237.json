      "content": "Paper Title: An Exposition of Pathfinding Strategies Within Lightning Network Clients\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNumerous studies have examined off-chain payment channel networks like the Lightning Network, encompassing evaluations of network topology, enhancements to routing schemes, and considerations of security and reliability. The study by [ref]14 concentrates on the reliability and privacy of LN payments by introducing a mathematical framework to model uncertainty in channel balances using probability theory. Furthermore,  explores the privacy properties of the Lightning Network through simulations.  investigates the structure of the Lightning Network and the routing algorithms used by LND, CLN and Eclair. It then explores the effects of routing choices by analyzing the feasibility of Denial-of-Service attacks and route hijacking across these three implementations. In our work, we specifically analyze the effects of design elements in the pathfinding algorithm and evaluate their empirical performance from an operational perspective.  examines the potential presence of the Braess paradox in off-chain networks and proposes solutions to mitigate its impact through analysis employing three routing algorithms, including LND and CLN.  analyzes the Lightning Network’s topology and introduces a strategy called ProfitPilot for connecting new nodes in payments by encouraging cycle creation in payment channel networks. Studies such as ,\n, and  present topological analyses of the Lightning Network. In our study, we utilize insights into the Lightning Network topology, including the node connectivity levels, to analyze the performance of pathfinding strategies for different network participants. While our research focuses on existing implementations of single-path pathfinding strategies within the current LN protocol, several studies have proposed modifications to the routing protocol that go beyond the current capabilities of LN. Flare [ref]21 proposes a routing methodology in the Lightning Network that relies on routing tables and beacon nodes to determine paths. Spider  presents a routing solution that segments transactions into packets and utilizes a multi-path transport protocol to ensure balanced channel usage. Boomerang  introduces redundant payments on existing multi-path routing schemes to reduce latency. Beyond the scope of our exposition are payment delivery strategies based on (atomic) multi-part payments [6, Chapter 12], which have been introduced as an extension to the original LN protocol [ref]24.  argues that multipart payment delivery benefits from integrating payment probability and the formulation via minimum cost flows instead of following a shortest-path framework.  proposes a variation of Boomerang which requires less computing power and latency for faster multi-path payments. While multi-part payments are very promising, they do currently not (yet) represent the mainstream practice in LN, where single-path payments still dominate. Thus, our study focuses on single-path payments, but the conducted analysis could be extended to multi-part payments in future work. A paper with a similar scope as our exposition is , which undertakes a comparative examination of routing clients, analyzing weight functions of LND, CLN, and Eclair. However, significant developments and enhancements have occurred in these routing clients since that study, and  does not consider constraints or modification of Dijkstra’s algorithm which are necessary to account for certain choices of cost functions, e.g., the ones used by LND. As an additional routing client, our research also includes LDK alongside these clients. The distinct experimental methodology to evaluate the performance of different pathfinding strategies is further different than that of , as we also consider different connectivity levels of nodes. Finally, the systematic analysis of weight function design elements as presented in Section IV is novel to the best of our knowledge.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: payment channel networks like the Lightning Network, encompassing evaluations of network topology, enhancements to routing schemes, and considerations of security and reliability.
