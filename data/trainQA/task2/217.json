      "content": "Paper Title: Lower Bounds on the Running Time of Two-Way Quantum Finite Automata and Sublogarithmic-Space Quantum Turing Machines\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nQuantum algorithms, such as Shor’s quantum polynomial time integer factorization algorithm , Grover’s algorithm for unstructured search , and the linear system solver of Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd , provide examples of natural problems on which quantum computers seem to have an advantage over their classical counterparts. However, these algorithms are designed to be run on a quantum computer that has the full power of a quantum Turing machine, whereas current experimental quantum computers only possess a rather limited quantum part. In particular, current state-of-the-art quantum computers have a very small amount of quantum memory. For example, Google’s “Sycamor” quantum computer, used in their famous recent quantum supremacy experiment , operates on only 535353 qubits. In this paper, we study the power quantum computers that have only a small amount of memory. We begin by considering two-way finite automata with quantum and classical states (2QCFA), originally defined by Ambainis and Watrous [ref]2. Informally, a 2QCFA is a two-way deterministic finite automaton (2DFA) that has been augmented by a quantum register of constant size. 2QCFA are surprisingly powerful, as originally demonstrated by Ambainis and Watrous, who showed that a 2QCFA, with only a single-qubit quantum register, can recognize, with bounded error, the language Le​q={am​bm:m∈ℕ}subscript𝐿𝑒𝑞conditional-setsuperscript𝑎𝑚superscript𝑏𝑚𝑚ℕL_{eq}=\\{a^{m}b^{m}:m\\in\\mathbb{N}\\} in expected time O​(n4)𝑂superscript𝑛4O(n^{4}) and the language Lp​a​l={w∈{a,b}∗:w​ is a palindrome}subscript𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑙conditional-set𝑤superscript𝑎𝑏𝑤 is a palindromeL_{pal}=\\{w\\in\\{a,b\\}^{*}:w\\text{ is a palindrome}\\} in expected time 2O​(n)superscript2𝑂𝑛2^{O(n)}. In a recent paper 1, we presented further evidence of the power of few qubits by showing that 2QCFA are capable of recognizing many group word problems with bounded error. It is known that 2QCFA are more powerful than 2DFA and two-way probabilistic finite automata (2PFA). A 2DFA can only recognize regular languages 0. A 2PFA can recognize some nonregular languages with bounded error, given sufficient running time: in particular, a 2PFA can recognize Le​qsubscript𝐿𝑒𝑞L_{eq} with bounded error in expected time 2O​(n)superscript2𝑂𝑛2^{O(n)} . However, a 2PFA cannot recognize Le​qsubscript𝐿𝑒𝑞L_{eq} with bounded error in expected time 2o​(n)superscript2𝑜𝑛2^{o(n)}, by a result of Greenberg and Weiss ; moreover, a 2PFA cannot recognize Lp​a​lsubscript𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑙L_{pal} with bounded error in any time bound . More generally, the landmark result of Dwork and Stockmeyer  showed that a 2PFA cannot recognize any nonregular language in expected time 2no​(1)superscript2superscript𝑛𝑜12^{n^{o(1)}}. In order to prove this statement, they defined a particular “hardness measure” DL:ℕ→ℕ:subscript𝐷𝐿→ℕℕD_{L}:\\mathbb{N}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{N} of a language L𝐿L. They showed that, if a 2PFA recognizes some language L𝐿L with bounded error in expected time at most T​(n)𝑇𝑛T(n) on all inputs of length at most n𝑛n, then there is a positive real number a𝑎a (that depends only on the number of states of the 2PFA), such that T​(n)=Ω​(2DL​(n)a)𝑇𝑛Ωsuperscript2subscript𝐷𝐿superscript𝑛𝑎T(n)=\\Omega\\left(2^{D_{L}(n)^{a}}\\right) [10, Lemma 4.3]; we will refer to this statement as the “Dwork-Stockmeyer lemma.” Very little was known about the limitations of 2QCFA. Are there any languages that a single-qubit 2QCFA can recognize with bounded error in expected exponential time but not in expected subexponential time? In particular, is it possible for a single-qubit 2QCFA to recognize Lp​a​lsubscript𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑙L_{pal} in subexponential time, or perhaps even in polynomial time? More generally, are there any languages that a 2QCFA (that is allowed to have a quantum register of any constant size) can recognize with bounded error in exponential time but not in subexponential time? These natural questions, to our knowledge, were all open (see, for instance, [ref]2   for previous discussions of these questions). In this paper, we answer these and other related questions. We first prove an analogue of the Dwork-Stockmeyer lemma for 2QCFA. If a 2QCFA recognizes some language L𝐿L with bounded error in expected time at most T​(n)𝑇𝑛T(n) on all inputs of length at most n𝑛n, then there a positive real number a𝑎a (that depends only on the number of states of the 2QCFA), such that T​(n)=Ω​(DL​(n)a)𝑇𝑛Ωsubscript𝐷𝐿superscript𝑛𝑎T(n)=\\Omega\\left(D_{L}(n)^{a}\\right). This immediately implies that the result of Ambainis and Watrous [ref]2 cannot be improved. 2QCFA (of any size) cannot recognize Lp​a​lsubscript𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑙L_{pal} with bounded error in time 2o​(n)superscript2𝑜𝑛2^{o(n)}. One of the key tools used in our proof is a quantum version of Hennie’s  notion of a crossing sequence, which may be of independent interest. Crossing sequences played an important role in the aforementioned 2PFA results of Dwork and Stockmeyer  and of Greenberg and Weiss . We note that, while our lower bound on the running time of a 2QCFA is exponentially weaker than the lower bound on the running time of a 2PFA provided by the Dwork-Stockmeyer lemma, both lower bounds are in fact (asymptotically) tight; the exponential difference provides yet another example of a situation in which quantum computers have an exponential advantage over their classical counterparts. We also establish a lower bound on the expected running time of a 2QCFA recognizer of L𝐿L in terms of the one-way deterministic communication complexity of testing membership in L𝐿L. We then generalize our results to prove a lower bound on the expected running time T​(n)𝑇𝑛T(n) of a quantum Turing machine (QTM) that uses sublogarithmic space (i.e., o​(log⁡n)𝑜𝑛o(\\log n) space) and recognizes a language L𝐿L with bounded error, where this lower bound is also in terms of DL​(n)subscript𝐷𝐿𝑛D_{L}(n). In particular, we show that Lp​a​lsubscript𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑙L_{pal} cannot be recognized with bounded error by a QTM that uses sublogarithmic space and runs in expected time 2n1−Ω​(1)superscript2superscript𝑛1Ω12^{n^{1-\\Omega(1)}}. This result is particularly intriguing, as Lp​a​lsubscript𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑙L_{pal} can be recognized by a deterministic TM in O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) space (and, trivially, polynomial time); therefore, Lp​a​lsubscript𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑙L_{pal} provides an example of a natural problem for which polynomial time quantum TMs have no (asymptotic) advantage over polynomial time deterministic TMs in terms of the needed amount of space. Furthermore, we show that the class of languages recognizable with bounded error by a 2QCFA in expected polynomial time is contained in 𝖫/𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝖫𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒\\mathsf{L/poly}. This result, which shows that the class of languages recognizable by a particular quantum model is contained in the class of languages recognizable by a particular classical model, is a type of dequantization result. It is (qualitatively) similar to the Adleman-type  derandomization result 𝖡𝖯𝖫⊆𝖫/𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝖡𝖯𝖫𝖫𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒\\mathsf{BPL}\\subseteq\\mathsf{L/poly}, where 𝖡𝖯𝖫𝖡𝖯𝖫\\mathsf{BPL} denotes the class of languages recognizable with bounded error by a probabilistic Turing machine (PTM) that uses O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) space and runs in expected polynomial time. The only previous dequantization result was of a very different type: the class of languages recognizable by a 2QCFA, or more generally a QTM that uses O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) space, with algebraic number transition amplitudes (even with unbounded error and with no time bound), is contained in 𝖣𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤​(O​(log2⁡n))𝖣𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤𝑂superscript2𝑛\\mathsf{DSPACE}(O(\\log^{2}n)) . This dequantization result is analogous to the derandomization result: the class of languages recognizable by a PTM that uses O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) space (even with unbounded error and with no time bound), is contained in 𝖣𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤​(O​(log2⁡n))𝖣𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤𝑂superscript2𝑛\\mathsf{DSPACE}(O(\\log^{2}n)) . We also investigate which group word problems can be recognized by 2QCFA or QTMs with particular resource bounds. Informally, the word problem of a finitely generated group is the problem of determining if the product of a sequence of elements of that group is equal to the identity element. There is a deep connection between the algebraic properties of a finitely generated group G𝐺G and the complexity of its word problem WGsubscript𝑊𝐺W_{G}, as has been demonstrated by many famous results; for example, WG∈𝖱𝖤𝖦⇔G⇔subscript𝑊𝐺𝖱𝖤𝖦𝐺W_{G}\\in\\mathsf{REG}\\Leftrightarrow G is finite , WG∈𝖢𝖥𝖫⇔G⇔subscript𝑊𝐺𝖢𝖥𝖫𝐺W_{G}\\in\\mathsf{CFL}\\Leftrightarrow G is virtually free  , WG∈𝖭𝖯⇔G⇔subscript𝑊𝐺𝖭𝖯𝐺W_{G}\\in\\mathsf{NP}\\Leftrightarrow G is a subgroup of a finitely presented group with polynomial Dehn function . We have recently shown that if G𝐺G is virtually abelian, then WGsubscript𝑊𝐺W_{G} may be recognized with bounded error by a single-qubit 2QCFA in polynomial time, and that, for any group G𝐺G in a certain broad class of groups of exponential growth, WGsubscript𝑊𝐺W_{G} may be recognized with bounded error by a 2QCFA in time 2O​(n)superscript2𝑂𝑛2^{O(n)} 1. We now show that, if G𝐺G has exponential growth, then WGsubscript𝑊𝐺W_{G} cannot be recognized by a 2QCFA with bounded error in time 2o​(n)superscript2𝑜𝑛2^{o(n)}, thereby providing a broad and natural class of languages that may be recognized by a 2QCFA in time 2O​(n)superscript2𝑂𝑛2^{O(n)} but not 2o​(n)superscript2𝑜𝑛2^{o(n)}. We also show that, if WGsubscript𝑊𝐺W_{G} is recognizable by a 2QCFA with bounded error in expected polynomial time, then G𝐺G must be virtually nilpotent (i.e., G𝐺G must have polynomial growth), thereby obtaining progress towards an exact classification of those word problems recognizable by a 2QCFA in polynomial time. Furthermore, we show analogous results for sublogarithmic-space QTMs. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly recall the fundamentals of quantum computation and the definition of 2QCFA. In Section 3, we develop our notion of a quantum crossing sequence. The Dwork-Stockmeyer hardness measure DLsubscript𝐷𝐿D_{L} of a language L𝐿L, as well as several other related hardness measures of L𝐿L, play a key role in our lower bounds; we recall the definitions of these hardness measures in Section 4.1. Then, in Section 4.2, using our notion of a quantum crossing sequence, we prove an analogue of the Dwork-Stockmeyer lemma for 2QCFA. Using this lemma, in Section 4.3, we establish various lower bounds on the expected running time of 2QCFA for particular languages and prove certain complexity class separations and inclusions. In Section 5, we establish lower bounds on the expected running time of sublogarithmic-space QTMs. In Section 6, we study group word problems and establish lower bounds on the expected running time of 2QCFA and sublogarithmic-space QTMs that recognize certain word problems. Finally, in Section 7, we discuss some open problems related to our work.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: power quantum computers that have only a small amount of memory.
