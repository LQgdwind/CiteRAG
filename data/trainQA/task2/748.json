      "content": "Paper Title: Compositional Generalization via Neural-Symbolic Stack Machines\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere has been an increasing interest in studying the compositional generalization of deep neural networks for natural language understanding [ref]26   1. A line of literature develops different techniques for the SCAN domain proposed in [ref]26, including architectural design 2  , training data augmentation , and meta learning  [ref]38. Note that we have already provided a more detailed discussion in Section 4.1. In particular, the rule synthesis approach in [ref]38 also achieves 100%percent100100\\% generalization performance as NeSS. However, they design a meta-grammar space to generate training samples, which contains grammars with the format close to the SCAN grammar, and their model requires a search process to sample candidate grammars during the inference time. On the other hand, NeSS does not assume the knowledge of a restricted meta-grammar space as in  [ref]38. In addition, no search is needed for model evaluation, thus NeSS could be more efficient especially when the task requires more examples as the test-time input specification. Some recent work also studies compositional generalization for other applications, including semantic parsing  , visual question answering    5  , image captioning , and other grounded language understanding domains 1. In particular, a line of work proposes neural-symbolic approaches for visual question answering  5  , and the main goal is to achieve generalization to new composition of visual concepts, as well as scenes with more objects than training images. Compared to vision benchmarks measuring the compositional generalization, our tasks do not require visual understanding, but typically need much longer execution traces. On the other hand, length generalization has been emphasized for program induction, where the learned model is supposed to generalize to longer test samples than the training ones 7  0 [ref]6 . A line of approaches learn a neural network augmented with a differentiable data structure or a differentiable machine 7     8. However, these approaches either can not achieve length generalization, or are only capable of solving simple tasks, as also shown in our evaluation. Another class of approaches incorporate a symbolic machine into the neural network 0 [ref]6   9 , which enables length generalization either with training supervision on execution traces [ref]6, or well-designed curriculum learning schemes  9 . In particular, our neural-symbolic architecture is inspired by the neural parser introduced in , which designs a parsing machine based on classic SHIFT-REDUCE systems 0   . By serializing the target parse tree, our machine fully covers the usages supported by the parsing machine. Meanwhile, the incorporation of a memory module and enhanced instructions for sequence generation enables NeSS to achieve generalization for not only algorithmic induction, but also natural language understanding domains. Some recent work also studies length generalization for other tasks, including relational reasoning 4, multi-task learning , and structure inference .\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: There has been an increasing interest in studying the compositional generalization of deep neural networks for natural language understanding [ref]26   1.
