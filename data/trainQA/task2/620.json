      "content": "Paper Title: Applying recent advances in Visual Question Answering to Record Linkage\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecord linkage is the process of joining records from multiple data sources that represents the same entity. Record linkage is used in domains where storing data is essential, therefore government agencies, the health sector, security agencies, online stores and other various organization would benefit immensely by any advances in this field. The task is commonly used for improving data quality, improving the order of items within databases and to reduce costs and give computational efficiency to data acquisition and data re-usage . All the research in record linkage has been done on textual data. Researchers have used various metrics to compute the similarity between textual fields and have proposed different machine learning methods to classify the output of these metrics . The problem with this approach is that for different domains, researches needed to use different similarity metrics and needed to design a lot of hand-crafted features, so the metric would be able to represent the similarity more accurately. This led to inefficient system development and systems that are not robust. In recent years Deep Learning has emerged as a solution to hand-crafting features, because of the ability of deep neural networks to extract features and knowledge from raw data . For record linkage, [ref]31 proposes three architectures that are based on Recurrent Neural Networks and they outperform the state-of-the-art record linkage system (that uses classical machine learning methods) on raw text. One thing that hasn’t been researched in record linkage is the linkage of multi-modal records. The rise of the Internet has introduced more visual content which provides more information about the entities. Our motivation is to build on top of the success that [ref]31 had with Deep Learning methods and we do this by proposing two Deep Learning architectures that will learn how to model multi-modal records and learn how to compute their similarity successfully. Another field that uses multi-modal data and combines them jointly is Visual Question Answering (VQA)[ref]2. In VQA they use Deep Learning architectures to combine an image and a question and they use the output of the fusion module to predict the answer to the question. In this way, VQA relates to Record Linkage, because both problems need to jointly encode both the visual and textual data. The solutions that we propose consist of two parts: two fusion modules that combine the visual and textual information for each record in the pair separately and a Siamese Neural Network that computes the similarity between the outputs of the fusion modules. For the fusion modules we propose, two solutions that were inspired by the fusion modules introduced in [ref]2 and [ref]46. The first proposed module is the Recurrent Neural Network + Convolutional Neural Network fusion module that uses recurrent neural networks to model the textual data and a pre-trained convolutional neural network that extracts features from images. The outputs of the networks are then fused by point-wise multiplication. An extension to this module is the Stacked Attention Network fusion module, that uses multiple attention layers to create a more refined encoding of the multi-modal data. To train the whole network we used the Avito Duplicate Ads Detection dataset . This dataset hasn’t been used in any previous research, so we also propose a simple baseline model that we will use to compare our two proposed solutions. The baseline model is a logistic regression model and for each pair of records, we compute two features: the Jaccard similarity coefficient between the textual data of each advertisement and the Euclidian distance between the feature vectors of the images associated with each advertisement. We hypothesized that by increasing the complexity of the structure of the fusion module we would get better results. We were also interested in how the models perform when the textual data in the advertisements is long. Finally, we hypothesised that the Stacked Attention Network fusion module would be able to learn how to find similar regions in the images of similar advertisements. For the Recurrent Neural Network + Convolutional Neural Network fusion module we did a small hyperparameter search and choose the model that performed best on the validation set. For the Stacked Attention Network we trained only one model because of time constraints. From the experiments, we concluded that the Recurrent Neural Network + Convolutional Neural Network performs better than the baseline model. We failed to prove our hypothesis that the increase in fusion module complexity (upgrading the RNN + CNN module to the Stacked Attention Network module) would result in better model performance. We also failed to prove that the Stacked Attention Network solution can learn how to attend similar regions in the images of similar advertisements, due to time constraints. We did however found out that the hyperparameter setting used in [ref]2 and  didn’t work for the Recurrent Neural Network + Convolutional Neural Network solution. Another interesting discovery was that the Recurrent Neural Network + Convolutional Neural Network model, both struggle with advertisements that have very different description lengths and advertisements that have long descriptions. This is because the Recurrent Neural Network + Convolutional Neural Network model tends to overfit the distribution of pairs of advertisements that have an average description length smaller than 40 words. The distribution of these type of pairs consists of more similar pairs and it is different than the distribution of pairs of advertisements that have an average description length of more then 40 words. The code used for this project is available at https://github.com/msmilevski/nrl. The following paragraph outlines the structure for the rest of the document. In Chapter 2 we talk about the related work done in Record Linkage and provide the needed background for the proposed models. Section 2.1 explores different similarity metrics and machine learning methods (supervised and unsupervised) that are widely used in record linkage. Section 2.2 introduces the reader to Deep Learning, explains the connection between Deep Learning and Record Linkage and also gives a short introduction to Recurrent and Convolutional Neural Networks. Section 2.3 explores the link between Visual Question Answering and Record Linkage, explains what Visual Question Answering is in more detail and also introduces the concept of the Attention mechanism. Section 2.4 introduces Siamese Neural Networks. Chapter 3 is for the Methodology. In Section 3.1 we describe the dataset that we are using and all the preprocessing that we have done to it. Section 3.2 outlines the baseline model. Section 3.3 describes the Siamese Neural Network architecture in detail and provides an illustration of the architecture of the proposed framework. Section 3.4 describes the Recurrent Neural Network + Convolutional Neural Network fusion module and provides an illustration of its architecture. Section 3.5 explains the concept of the Stacked Attention Network, provides mathematical formulas to better understand the fusion module and a diagram of how the Stacked Attention Network looks when it uses one attention layer. Chapter 4 presents the results from the experiments. In Section 4.1 we introduce the evaluation metric we use to compare our models. Section 4.2 presents the results for the baseline model. Section 4.3 explains the training process for neural networks. Section 4.4 presents the results from the hyperparameter search for the Recurrent Neural Network + Convolutional Neural Network fusion module and we explain the thought process behind our experiments. Section 4.5 presents the results for the Stacked Attention Network fusion module. Section 4.6 compares all three models that we trained. It also looks into how well the models perform for different text lengths. Chapter 5 summarizes our work and introduces some possibilities for future work.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: recent years Deep Learning has emerged as a solution to hand-crafting features, because of the ability of deep neural networks to extract features and knowledge from raw data .
