      "content": "Paper Title: FibeRed: Fiberwise Dimensionality Reduction of Topologically Complex Data with Vector Bundles\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMotivation.\nWe take the manifold hypothesis at face value and consider data consisting of a finite sample of a Riemannian manifold.\nWe take the goal of dimensionality reduction to be that of learning an embedding of the input data in low dimension, in such a way that the differentiable structure of the underlying manifold is preserved.\nThis is different from charting, whose objective we take to be that of producing local parametrizations of the data that, together, cover the entire manifold. We refer to dimensionality reduction algorithms which aim to preserve metric relationships and do not explicitly incorporate large scale topology in their objective function as metric-based.\nMetric-based algorithms work best when the Riemannian manifold underlying the data can be isometrically embedded in the target dimension.\nFor example, algorithms such as Isomap , Local Tangent Space Alignment (LTSA) , and Hessian Eigenmaps (HLLE) \nassume that the manifold 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} underlying the data is isometrically developable, in the sense that\n𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} is a d𝑑d-dimensional Riemannian manifold for which there exists an embedded d𝑑d-dimensional manifold 𝒳′⊆ℝdsuperscript𝒳′superscriptℝ𝑑\\mathcal{X}^{\\prime}\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^{d} and a diffeomorphism 𝒳′→𝒳→superscript𝒳′𝒳\\mathcal{X}^{\\prime}\\to\\mathcal{X} which is a Riemannian isometry.\nAn isometrically developable manifold 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} is necessarily flat (i.e., locally isometric to Euclidean space) and developable (i.e., diffeomorphic to an embedded d𝑑d-dimensional manifold 𝒳′⊆ℝdsuperscript𝒳′superscriptℝ𝑑\\mathcal{X}^{\\prime}\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^{d}).\nBut a manifold can be flat and developable without it being isometrically developable: a simple example is that of a straight cyilinder in ℝ3superscriptℝ3\\mathbb{R}^{3} (\\creffigure:cylinder-example).\nAs observed in , and shown in \\creffigure:cylinder-example, already in the setting of a flat and developable d𝑑d-dimensional manifold, metric-based dimensionality reduction algorithms can fail to find an embedding of the data in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}.\nOn the mathematical side, while Whitney’s embedding theorem [ref]60 guarantees that any closed d𝑑d-dimensional manifold admits a smooth (C∞superscript𝐶C^{\\infty}) embedding in 2​d2𝑑2d dimensions, a smooth, Riemannian isometric embedding of a closed d𝑑d-dimensional Riemannian manifold can require in the order of d2superscript𝑑2d^{2} dimensions .\nThus, the preservation of distances requires more complicated embeddings than the preservation of topology. If we remove a small portion of the cylinder of \\creffigure:cylinder-example, in order to make it a curved rectangle, most metric-based dimensionality reduction algorithms have no problem finding an embedding in ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2}.\nIt is thus the non-trivial topology of the cylinder—its circularity—that causes difficulties.\nThis suggests that embeddings of topologically non-trivial manifolds can be built by gluing local representations along a representation of the global topological structure:\nin the case of the cylinder, one would try to glue 2D patches around a circle in a globally consistent manner.\nThis leads to the following problem, formalized as the vector bundle embedding problem (\\crefproblem:main-problem): Given a dataset X𝑋X and an initial map X→ℝD→𝑋superscriptℝ𝐷X\\to\\mathbb{R}^{D} capturing the large scale topology of X𝑋X, find a new representation X→ℝD→𝑋superscriptℝ𝐷X\\to\\mathbb{R}^{D} that captures the large scale topology as well as the local geometry. We call our approach to the above problem fiberwise dimensionality reduction (FibeRed).\nIn the examples of \\crefsection:examples, we focus on manifolds with an essential loop, and, as initial map, we use circular coordinates based on persistent cohomology  [ref]40, a technique from Topological Data Analysis  .\nNevertheless, the approach is not restricted to the case of a circular initial embedding and one could use as initial map one constructed by, e.g., other cohomological coordinates [ref]38  , standard non-linear dimensionality reduction methods  , or lens functions as in [53, Section 4]. Contributions.\nWe show that the theory of vector bundles is useful in abstracting (\\crefsection:main-problem), devising solutions to (\\crefsection:main-algorithm), and computing obstructions to solving (\\crefsection:obstructions) the problem of extending an initial coarse representation of data to a new, more descriptive representation.\nWe demonstrate with computational examples (\\crefsection:examples) that topological inference for vector bundles can be carried out in practice.\nIn particular, we show that efficient embeddings and chartings of topologically non-trivial data can be learned with this approach and give examples supporting the claim that metric-based dimensionality reduction algorithms are often not able to find such representations.\nWe implement our main algorithm in . Related work.\nVarious dimensionality reduction schemes    learn a global alignment of local linear models from the local interactions of the models, which can be challenging in the presence of non-trivial topology.\nIn contrast, our approach assumes a global topological representation is given and builds and aligns the local linear models along this representation. There has been recent interest in designing topology-preserving dimensionality reduction schemes    .\nOur approach is different from previous approaches we are aware of, as it builds a new representation around an initial topological representation, instead of using topology to regularize an essentially metric objective. Our cut-unfold technique of\n\\crefsection:cut-unfold\nhas a similar goal to that of  , which propose to tear a data manifold in order to find efficient representations of it.\nA main difference is that our technique allows the user to select a specific hole to cut and to use topological persistence to guide this choice.\n\nReference markers found: [60]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]60: manifold, metric-based dimensionality reduction algorithms can fail to find an embedding of the data in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}.\nOn the mathematical side, while Whitney’s embedding theorem [ref]60 guarantees that any closed d𝑑d-dimensional manifold admits a smooth (C∞superscript𝐶C^{\\infty}) embedding in 2​d2𝑑2d dimensions, a smooth, Riemannian isometric embedding of a closed\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
