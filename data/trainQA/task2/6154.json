      "content": "Paper Title: SuSana Distancia is all you need: Enforcing class separability in metric learning via two novel distance-based loss functions for few-shot image classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDespite recent advances in deep learning research in various computer vision and NLP tasks [ref]40, it remains a challenge for the standard supervised learning setting to achieve satisfactory results when learning from just a small amount of labeled data [ref]37. Current deep learning algorithms tend to overfit when they are given a small dataset for training, limiting their generalization capabilities . Moreover, there are many problem domains where obtaining labeled data can be difficult to obtain or it entails a lot of manual work to get the data with the corresponding annotations or ground truth. This represents a major problem in many real-world applications (i.e., medicine) as some of the instances we are interested in are very rare . Therefore in recent years the Few-shot learning (FSL) paradigm has been proposed (  [ref]41   ) as a way to deal with this data scarcity problem. For classification tasks, the main goal of such methods is to categorize previously unseen data into a set of new classes, given only a small amount of labeled instances per class. The main challenge for FSL is to apply a fine-tuning process to an existing embedding network to adapt it to new classes; as a matter of fact, the main issue is that such process can easily lead to overfitting, due to the few labeled samples available for each class. Currently, two main approaches to FSL exist: the first one is based on meta-learning methods (   ), where the basic idea is to learn from diverse tasks and datasets and adapt the learned model to new datasets. A second approach is based on metric-learning methods ( ), where the objective is to learn a pairwise similarity metric such that a score (given by some distance) is high for similar samples, whilst dissimilar samples get a low score. Subsequently, these metric learning methods undertook a hybrid approach, as they started to adopt the meta-learning policy to learn across tasks ( [ref]41 ). The main objective of these methods is to learn an effective embedding network in order to extract useful features from a given task and discriminate on the classes which we are trying to predict. From this basic learning setting, many extensions have been introduced to improve the performance of metric learning methods. Some of these works focus on pre-training the embedding network (), others introduce task attention modules (  ), whereas others seek to optimize the embeddings () and yet others employ a variety of loss functions ().\nHowever, only a few methods have explored mechanisms for enforcing class separability via a custom loss function during training. Our approach introduced herein can be seen as a hybrid between some of the above-mentioned approaches, as we attempt to improve jointly the embeddings and we also investigate the impact of two loss functions for FSL-based classification tasks. More specifically, we explore the use of two different loss functions based on the concepts of inter-class and intra-class distance. The first one is the well-known proto-triplet loss, which to the best of our knowledge has not been explored in the context of few shot learning; the second, which we dubbed ICNN loss (based on the Inter and Intra Class Nearest Neighbor score first introduced in 3) represents a novel loss function that evaluates the quality of the features obtained based on the inter/intra class, the variance and the class ratio from nearest neighbors. The basic working principle of our proposed approach is shown in Figure 1. As it can be observed in the figure, the used loss functions allow us to jointly optimize the embedding network and learn more discriminative features across tasks. In our experiments, we obtained an accuracy performance of 61.32% and 79.93% in the 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot settings respectively using the proto-triplet loss, and 60.79% and 80.41% using our novel ICNN Loss on the MiniImagenet dataset which represents an improvement of about 2% compared to the state of the art. We further test our methods on the CUB, Caltech, Stanford Dogs and Stanford Cars datasets to assess the generalization capabilities of the proposed framework, obtaining satisfactory results. The ICNN Loss and Proto-Triplet Loss are two methods used for optimizing an embedding network based on the quality of the generated features. As shown in Figure 2, the ICNN Loss measures the intra and inter class distances of batch points and assigns each data point an Inter and Intra Class Nearest Neighbors score. The Proto-Triplet Loss, on the other hand, is based on triplet loss and calculates the similarity between points using prototypes of different classes as anchor, positive, and negative points. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we describe the related work in the few-shot learning problem. In Section 3 we describe the proposed loss functions. We first explain the Proto-triplet loss function, and then we explain the rationale for the ICNN Loss function and its derivation. Then we discuss some of the design choices we needed to take for the ICNN loss. In Section 4 we detail the experimental setup used for the implementation of the models. In Section 5 we show the results obtained and discuss about its performance. Finally, in Section 6 we present our conclusions and discuss future work.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: Despite recent advances in deep learning research in various computer vision and NLP tasks [ref]40, it remains a challenge for the standard supervised learning setting to achieve satisfactory results when learning from just a small amount of labeled data [ref]37.
