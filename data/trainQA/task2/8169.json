      "content": "Paper Title: AIM 2024 Challenge on Efficient Video Super-Resolution for AV1 Compressed Content\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe training of the proposed model consists of two stages. In the first stage, a combined perceptual loss function, as described in [ref]32, is employed to optimise the model, The training configurations of the CVEGAN and EDSR_base model can be found in their original paper [ref]32 8, and they are trained on the same datasets. In the second stage, a similar knowledge distillation strategy as in  is utilised, where the pre-trained model in the first stage is considered as the student model, while a pre-trained CVEGAN is used as the teacher model. The total loss ℒ𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙subscriptℒ𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathit{total}} at this stage is given as follows: where ℒL​a​p​(Is​t​u,Ig​t)subscriptℒ𝐿𝑎𝑝subscript𝐼𝑠𝑡𝑢subscript𝐼𝑔𝑡\\mathcal{L}_{Lap}(I_{stu},I_{gt}) denotes the original loss between the ground truth Ig​tsubscript𝐼𝑔𝑡I_{gt} and the student model’s prediction Is​t​usubscript𝐼𝑠𝑡𝑢I_{stu}, and α𝛼\\alpha is a tunable weight, set to 0.1, following [ref]34. ℒL​a​p​(Is​t​u,It​c​h​r)subscriptℒ𝐿𝑎𝑝subscript𝐼𝑠𝑡𝑢subscript𝐼𝑡𝑐ℎ𝑟\\mathcal{L}_{Lap}(I_{stu},I_{tchr}) represents the loss between the student Is​t​usubscript𝐼𝑠𝑡𝑢I_{stu} and the teacher’s predictions It​c​h​rsubscript𝐼𝑡𝑐ℎ𝑟I_{tchr}. Here ℒL​a​psubscriptℒ𝐿𝑎𝑝\\mathcal{L}_{Lap} is the Laplacian loss . Table 5 summarises the performance of the proposed RTVSR method for the test sequences, compared to the provided anchor results (upsampling by a Lanczos5 filter), EDSR_baseline, and CVEGAN (teacher model). The average improvement of VMAF against the provided results is up to 4.16, the figure for PSNR-Y is nearly 0.24 dB. Since this challenge mainly focus on VMAF, so our model provide better VMAF performance. By using , the analysis of our proposed RTVSR model is displayed in Table 6. As observed in the Table, the processing speed for each frame is 0.8 ms for the ×3absent3\\times 3 track and 2 ms for the ×4absent4\\times 4 track. These rapid processing times demonstrate the model’s ability to handle high-resolution upscaling tasks with impressive efficiency. The coding framework is illustrated in Figure 7(b). To generate the training sets, prior to encoding, the original input 1080p video is downsampled by a factor of 3 using a Lanczos5 filter. The SVT-AV1 version 1.8.0  serves as the Host Encoder that compresses the low resolution video. At the decoder, when the low resolution video stream is decoded, the proposed RTVSR model is applied to reconstruct the full resolution video content. For ×\\times4 task, the input is 4K video, downsampled at the encoder and later upsampled at the decoder by a factor of 4. The employed network was implemented in PyTorch version 1.10 . We used the following configuration during training:\nAdam optimization 3 with the hyper-parameters: β1=0.9subscript𝛽10.9\\beta_{1}=0.9 and β2=0.999subscript𝛽20.999\\beta_{2}=0.999; the batch size of 16; 200 training epochs (100 for both stage one and two); initial learning rate of 10−4superscript10410^{-4}; weight decay of 0.1. The training and evaluation operations were executed on NVIDIA RTX3090.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: The training of the proposed model consists of two stages.
