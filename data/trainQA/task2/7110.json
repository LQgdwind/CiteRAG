      "content": "Paper Title: Hardness of linearly ordered 4-colouring of 3-colourable 3-uniform hypergraphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeciding whether a given finite graph is 333-colourable (or, more generally, k𝑘k-colourable, for a fixed k≥3𝑘3k\\geq 3) was one of the first problems shown to be \\NP-complete by Karp . Since then, the complexity of approximating the chromatic number of a graph has been studied extensively. The best-known polynomial-time algorithm approximates the chromatic number of an n𝑛n-vertex graph within a factor of O​(n​(log⁡log⁡n)2(log⁡n)3)𝑂𝑛superscript𝑛2superscript𝑛3O(n\\frac{(\\log\\log n)^{2}}{(\\log n)^{3}}) (Halldórsson ); conversely, it is known that the chromatic number cannot be approximated in polynomial time within a factor of n1−εsuperscript𝑛1𝜀n^{1-\\varepsilon}, for any fixed ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, unless 𝖯=\\NP𝖯\\NP\\mathsf{P}=\\NP (Zuckerman ). However, this hardness result only applies to graphs whose chromatic number grows with the number of vertices, and the case of graphs with bounded chromatic number is much less well understood. Given an input graph G𝐺G that is promised to be 333-colourable, what is the complexity of finding a colouring of G𝐺G with some larger number k>3𝑘3k>3 of colours? Khanna, Linial, and Safra  showed that this problem is \\NP-hard for k=4𝑘4k=4, and it is generally believed that the problem is \\NP-hard for any constant k𝑘k. However, surprisingly little is known, and the only improvement and best result to date, hardness for k=5𝑘5k=5, was obtained only relatively recently by Bulín, Krokhin, and Opršal . On the other hand, the best polynomial-time algorithm, due to Kawarabayashi and Thorup , uses a number of colours (slightly less less than n1/5superscript𝑛15n^{1/5}) that depends on the number n𝑛n of vertices of the input graph. More generally, it is a long-standing conjecture that finding a k𝑘k-colouring of a c𝑐c-colourable graph is \\NP-hard for all constants k≥c≥3𝑘𝑐3k\\geq c\\geq 3, but the complexity of this approximate graph colouring problem remains wide open. The results from  generalise to give hardness for k=2​c−1𝑘2𝑐1k=2c-1 and all c≥3𝑐3c\\geq 3. For c≥6𝑐6c\\geq 6, this was improved by Wrochna and Živný 1, who showed that it is hard to colour c𝑐c-colourable graphs with k=(c⌊c/2⌋)𝑘binomial𝑐𝑐2k=\\binom{c}{\\lfloor c/2\\rfloor} colours. We remark that conditional hardness (assuming different variants of Khot’s Unique Games Conjecture) for approximate graph coloring for all k≥c≥3𝑘𝑐3k\\geq c\\geq 3 were obtained by Dinur, Mossel, and Regev , Guruswami and Sandeep , and Braverman, Khot, Lifshitz, and Mulzer . Given the slow progress on approximate graph colouring, we believe there is substantial value in developing and extending the available methods for studying this problem and related questions, and we hope that the present paper contributes to this effort. As our main result (Theorem 1.1 below), we establish \\NP-hardness of a relevant hypergraph colouring problem that falls into a general scope of promise constraint satisfaction problems; in the process, we considerably extend a topological approach and toolkit for studying approximate colouring that was introduced by Krokhin, Opršal, Wrochna, and Živný [ref]21 1 . Graph colouring is a special case of the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), which has several different, but equivalent formulations. For us, the most relevant formulation is in terms of homomorphisms between relational structures. The starting point is the observation that finding a k𝑘k-colouring of a graph G𝐺G is the same as finding a graph homomorphism (an edge-preserving map) G→Kk→𝐺subscript𝐾𝑘G\\to K_{k} where Kksubscript𝐾𝑘K_{k} is the complete graph with k𝑘k vertices. The general formulation of the constraint satisfaction problem is then as follows (see Section 2.1 below for more details): Fix a relational structure 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} (e.g., a graph, or a uniform hypergraph), which parametrises the problem. CSP⁡(𝐀)CSP𝐀\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbf{A}) is then the problem of deciding whether a given structure 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} allows a homomorphism 𝐗→𝐀→𝐗𝐀\\mathbf{X}\\to\\mathbf{A}. One of the celebrated results in the complexity theory of CSPs is the Dichotomy Theorem of Bulatov  and Zhuk , which asserts that for every finite relational structure 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}, CSP⁡(𝐀)CSP𝐀\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbf{A}) is either \\NP-complete, or solvable in polynomial time. The framework of CSPs can be extended to promise constraint satisfaction problems (PCSPs), which include approximate graph colouring. PCSPs were first introduced by Austrin, Guruswami, and Håstad , and the general theory of these problems was further developed by Brakensiek and Guruswami , and by Barto, Bulín, Krokhin, and Opršal . Formally, a PCSP is parametrised by two relational structures 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} and 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} such that there exists a homomorphism 𝐀→𝐁→𝐀𝐁\\mathbf{A}\\to\\mathbf{B}. Given an input structure 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X}, the goal is then to distinguish between the case that there is a homomorphism 𝐗→𝐀→𝐗𝐀\\mathbf{X}\\to\\mathbf{A}, and the case that there does not even exist a homomorphism 𝐗→𝐁→𝐗𝐁\\mathbf{X}\\to\\mathbf{B} (these cases are distinct but not necessarily complementary, and no output is required in case neither holds); we denote this decision problem by PCSP⁡(𝐀,𝐁)PCSP𝐀𝐁\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{B}). For example, PCSP⁡(K3,Kk)PCSPsubscript𝐾3subscript𝐾𝑘\\operatorname{PCSP}(K_{3},K_{k}) is the problem of distinguishing, given an input graph G𝐺G, between the case that G𝐺G is 333-colourable and the case that G𝐺G is not k𝑘k-colourable. This is the decision version of the approximate graph colouring problem whose search version we introduced above. We remark that the decision problem reduces to the search version, hence hardness of the former implies hardness of the latter. PCSPs encapsulate a wide variety of problems, including versions of hypergraph colouring studied by Dinur, Regev, and Smyth 3 and Brakensiek and Guruswami . A variant of hypergraph colouring that is closely connected to approximate graph colouring and generalises (monotone111In the present paper, we will only consider the monotone version of 1-in-3SAT, i.e., the case where clauses contain no negated variable, and we will often omit the adjective “monotone” in what follows.)1-in-3SAT is linearly ordered (LO) hypergraph colouring.\nA linearly ordered k𝑘k-colouring of a hypergraph H𝐻H is an assignment of the colours [k]={1,…,k}delimited-[]𝑘1…𝑘[k]=\\{1,\\ldots,k\\} to the vertices of H𝐻H such that, for every hyperedge, the maximal colour assigned to elements of that hyperedge occurs exactly once. Note that for graphs, linearly ordered colouring is the same as graph colouring. Moreover, LO 222-colouring of 333-uniform hypergraphs corresponds to (monotone) 1-in-3SAT (by viewing the edges of the hypergraph as clauses). In the present paper, we focus on 333-uniform hypergraphs; whether such a graph has an LO k𝑘k-colouring can be expressed as CSP⁡(𝐋𝐎k)CSPsubscript𝐋𝐎𝑘\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbf{LO}_{k}) for a specific relational structure 𝐋𝐎ksubscript𝐋𝐎𝑘\\mathbf{LO}_{k} with one ternary relation (see Section 2.1); in particular, 1-in-3SAT corresponds to CSP⁡(𝐋𝐎2)CSPsubscript𝐋𝐎2\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbf{LO}_{2}). The promise version of LO hypergraph colouring was introduced by Barto, Battistelli, and Berg [ref]2, who studied the promise 1-in-3SAT problem. More precisely, let 𝐁𝐁{\\mathbf{B}} be a fixed ternary structure such that there is a homomorphism 𝐋𝐎2→𝐁→subscript𝐋𝐎2𝐁\\mathbf{LO}_{2}\\to{\\mathbf{B}}. Then PCSP⁡(𝐋𝐎2,𝐁)PCSPsubscript𝐋𝐎2𝐁\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\mathbf{LO}_{2},{\\mathbf{B}}) is the following decision problem: Given an instance 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} of 1-in-3SAT, distinguish between the case that 𝐗𝐗{\\mathbf{X}} is satisfiable, and the case that there is no homomorphism 𝐗→𝐁→𝐗𝐁\\mathbf{X}\\to{\\mathbf{B}}. For structures 𝐁𝐁{\\mathbf{B}} with three elements, Barto et al. [ref]2 obtained an almost complete dichotomy; the only remaining unresolved case is 𝐁=𝐋𝐎3𝐁subscript𝐋𝐎3{\\mathbf{B}}=\\mathbf{LO}_{3}, i.e., the complexity of PCSP⁡(𝐋𝐎2,𝐋𝐎3)PCSPsubscript𝐋𝐎2subscript𝐋𝐎3\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\mathbf{LO}_{2},\\mathbf{LO}_{3}). They conjectured that this problem is \\NP-hard, and more generally that PCSP⁡(𝐋𝐎c,𝐋𝐎k)PCSPsubscript𝐋𝐎𝑐subscript𝐋𝐎𝑘\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\mathbf{LO}_{c},\\mathbf{LO}_{k}) is \\NP-hard for all k≥c≥2𝑘𝑐2k\\geq c\\geq 2 [2, Conjecture 27]. Subsequently, the following conjecture emerged and circulated as folklore (first formally stated by Nakajima and Živný ): PCSP⁡(𝐋𝐎2,𝐁)PCSPsubscript𝐋𝐎2𝐁\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\mathbf{LO}_{2},{\\mathbf{B}}) is either solved by the affine integer programming relaxation, or \\NP-hard (see Ciardo, Kozik, Krokhin, Nakajima, and Živný 0 for recent progress in this direction). Promise LO hypergraph colouring was further studied by Nakajima and Živný , who found close connections between promise LO hypergraph colouring and approximate graph colouring. In particular, they provide a polynomial time algorithm for LO-colouring 2-colourable 3-uniform hypergraphs with a superconstant number of colours, by adapting methods used for similar algorithms for approximate graph colouring, e.g., . In the other direction, \\NP-hardness of PCSP⁡(𝐋𝐎k,𝐋𝐎c)PCSPsubscript𝐋𝐎𝑘subscript𝐋𝐎𝑐\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\mathbf{LO}_{k},\\mathbf{LO}_{c}) for 4≤k≤c4𝑘𝑐4\\leq k\\leq c follows relatively easily from \\NP-hardness of the approximate graph colouring PCSP⁡(Kk−1,Kc−1)PCSPsubscript𝐾𝑘1subscript𝐾𝑐1\\operatorname{PCSP}(K_{k-1},K_{c-1}), as was observed by Nakajima and Živný and by Austrin (personal communications).222To see why, observe that (𝐋𝐎k,𝐋𝐎c)subscript𝐋𝐎𝑘subscript𝐋𝐎𝑐(\\mathbf{LO}_{k},\\mathbf{LO}_{c}) promise primitive-positive defines (Kk−1,Kc−1)subscript𝐾𝑘1subscript𝐾𝑐1(K_{k-1},K_{c-1}); in particular, we can define x≠y𝑥𝑦x\\neq y by ∃z⋅R​(z,z,x)∧R​(z,z,y)∧R​(x,y,z)⋅𝑧𝑅𝑧𝑧𝑥𝑅𝑧𝑧𝑦𝑅𝑥𝑦𝑧\\exists z\\cdot R(z,z,x)\\land R(z,z,y)\\land R(x,y,z). We then see that if R𝑅R is interpreted in 𝐋𝐎ksubscript𝐋𝐎𝑘\\mathbf{LO}_{k}, then the required z𝑧z exists if and only if x≠y𝑥𝑦x\\neq y, as required. Our main result is the following, which cannot be obtained using these arguments. PCSP⁡(𝐋𝐎3,𝐋𝐎4)PCSPsubscript𝐋𝐎3subscript𝐋𝐎4\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\mathbf{LO}_{3},\\mathbf{LO}_{4}) is \\NP-complete. Apart from the intrinsic interest of LO hypergraph colouring, we believe that the main contribution of this paper is on a technical level, by extending the topological approach of  and bringing to bear more advanced methods from algebraic topology, in particular equivariant obstruction theory. To our knowledge, this paper is the first that uses these methods in the PCSP context; we view this as a “proof of concept” and believe these tools will be useful to make\nfurther progress on approximate graph colouring and related problems. The proof of Theorem 1.1 has two main parts. For a natural number n𝑛n, let (𝐋𝐎3)nsuperscriptsubscript𝐋𝐎3𝑛(\\mathbf{LO}_{3})^{n} be the n𝑛n-fold power of the relational structure 𝐋𝐎3subscript𝐋𝐎3\\mathbf{LO}_{3} (see Section 2.2). In the first part of the proof, we use topological methods to show (Lemma 3.2 below) that with every homomorphism f:(𝐋𝐎3)n→𝐋𝐎4:𝑓→superscriptsubscript𝐋𝐎3𝑛subscript𝐋𝐎4f\\colon(\\mathbf{LO}_{3})^{n}\\to\\mathbf{LO}_{4}, we can associate an affine map χ​(f):ℤ3n→ℤ3:𝜒𝑓→superscriptsubscriptℤ3𝑛subscriptℤ3\\chi(f)\\colon\\mathbb{Z}_{3}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{Z}_{3} (i.e., a map of the form (x1,…,xn)↦∑i=1nαi​ximaps-tosubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛subscript𝛼𝑖subscript𝑥𝑖(x_{1},\\dots,x_{n})\\mapsto\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\alpha_{i}x_{i}, for some αi∈ℤ3subscript𝛼𝑖subscriptℤ3\\alpha_{i}\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{3} and ∑i=1nαi≡1(mod3)superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛subscript𝛼𝑖annotated1pmod3\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\alpha_{i}\\equiv 1\\pmod{3}); moreover, the assignment f↦χ​(f)maps-to𝑓𝜒𝑓f\\mapsto\\chi(f) preserves natural minor relations that arise from maps π:[n]→[m]:𝜋→delimited-[]𝑛delimited-[]𝑚\\pi\\colon[n]\\to[m], i.e., χ𝜒\\chi is a minion homomorphism (see Section 2.2 for the precise definitions). In the second part of the proof, we show by combinatorial arguments that the maps χ​(f):ℤ3n→ℤ3:𝜒𝑓→superscriptsubscriptℤ3𝑛subscriptℤ3\\chi(f)\\colon\\mathbb{Z}_{3}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{Z}_{3} form a very restricted subclass of affine maps: They are projections ℤ3n→ℤ3→superscriptsubscriptℤ3𝑛subscriptℤ3\\mathbb{Z}_{3}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{Z}_{3}, (x1,…,xn)↦ximaps-tosubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛subscript𝑥𝑖(x_{1},\\dots,x_{n})\\mapsto x_{i} (Corollary 3.4). Theorem 1.1 then follows from a hardness criterion (Theorem 2.6) obtained as part of a general algebraic theory of PCSPs . In a nutshell, topology enters in the first part of the proof as follows. First, with every homomorphism f:(𝐋𝐎3)n→𝐋𝐎4:𝑓→superscriptsubscript𝐋𝐎3𝑛subscript𝐋𝐎4f\\colon(\\mathbf{LO}_{3})^{n}\\to\\mathbf{LO}_{4} we associate a continuous map f∗:Tn→P2:subscript𝑓∗→superscript𝑇𝑛superscript𝑃2f_{\\ast}\\colon T^{n}\\to P^{2}, where Tnsuperscript𝑇𝑛T^{n} is the n𝑛n-dimensional torus (the n𝑛n-fold power of the circle S1superscript𝑆1S^{1}) and P2superscript𝑃2P^{2} is a suitable target space that will be described in more detail later; moreover, the cyclic group ℤ3subscriptℤ3\\mathbb{Z}_{3} naturally acts on both Tnsuperscript𝑇𝑛T^{n} and P2superscript𝑃2P^{2}, and the map f∗subscript𝑓f_{*} preserves these symmetries (it is equivariant). This first step uses homomorphism complexes (a well-known construction in topological combinatorics that goes back to the work of Lovász , see Section 2.3). Second, we show that equivariant continuous maps Tn→P2→superscript𝑇𝑛superscript𝑃2T^{n}\\to P^{2},\nwhen considered up to a natural equivalence relation of symmetry-preserving continuous deformation (equivariant homotopy), are in bijection with affine maps ℤ3n→ℤ3→superscriptsubscriptℤ3𝑛subscriptℤ3\\mathbb{Z}_{3}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{Z}_{3}. This second step uses equivariant obstruction theory.333By contrast, the topological argument in  required understanding maps from Tnsuperscript𝑇𝑛T^{n} to the circle S1superscript𝑆1S^{1} that preserve natural ℤ2subscriptℤ2\\mathbb{Z}_{2}-symmetries on both spaces, again up to equivariant homotopy; such maps can be classified by more elementary arguments using the fundamental group because S1superscript𝑆1S^{1} is 111-dimensional. We remark that, with some additional work, our method could be extended to prove \\NP-hardness of PCSP⁡(𝐋𝐎k,𝐋𝐎2​k−2)PCSPsubscript𝐋𝐎𝑘subscript𝐋𝐎2𝑘2\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\mathbf{LO}_{k},\\mathbf{LO}_{2k-2}) (but as remarked above, this already follows from known hardness results for approximate graph colouring).\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: satisfaction problems; in the process, we considerably extend a topological approach and toolkit for studying approximate colouring that was introduced by Krokhin, Opršal, Wrochna, and Živný [ref]21 1 .
