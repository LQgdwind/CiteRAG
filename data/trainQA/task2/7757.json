Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

Despite its essentiality, eye tracking is known to be slow and power-hungry .\nIn our measurement of commercial eye trackers (e.g., HTC Vive Pro Eyes and Tobii), its latency is usually in excess of 15 msmillisecond\\mathrm{ms}, enough to introduce visual artifacts (e.g., in gaze-contingent rendering), and its always-on status constantly consumes over 2 Wwatt\\mathrm{W} , eating up half of the power budget of a typical VR system   . Most of today's efforts in optimizing eye tracking focus on the algorithm pipeline, either by\noptimizing the tracking algorithms 9   1  or by designing dedicated hardware accelerators  , while largely ignoring the indispensable front-end of any eye tracking pipeline: the image sensor, which generates near-eye images for the tracking algorithms to consume.\n\nReference markers found: [116]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]116: Eye tracking provides a fundamental utility in many fields, ranging from medical studies  6 and human-machine interaction  [ref]116    to augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) and spatial computing       .\nAccurately and efficiently tracking eye gazes play an important role in understanding human cognition , enabling\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
