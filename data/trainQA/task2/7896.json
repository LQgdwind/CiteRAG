      "content": "Paper Title: Formally Certified Approximate Model CountingThe first two authors contributed equally.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGiven a Boolean formula F𝐹F, the model counting problem is to calculate\nthe number of models (also called solutions or satisfying assignments) of F𝐹F. Model counting is known to be #P-complete, and\ntherefore has been a target of sustained interest for randomized approximation\ntechniques over the past four decades. The current state-of-the-art approximate approach,\n𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢\\mathsf{ApproxMC} , is a hashing-based\nframework that relies on reducing the model counting problem to SAT\nqueries, which are handled by an underlying solver. Importantly, 𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢\\mathsf{ApproxMC}\nis a probably approximately correct (PAC) projected model counter, i.e.,\nit takes in a\nformula F𝐹F, a projection set S⊆𝖵𝖺𝗋𝗌​(F)𝑆𝖵𝖺𝗋𝗌𝐹S\\subseteq\\mathsf{Vars}(F), a tolerance parameter ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, and a confidence parameter δ∈(0,1]𝛿01\\delta\\in(0,1], and\nreturns a count c𝑐c satisfying the PAC guarantee: Pr⁡[|𝗌𝗈𝗅​(F)↓S|1+ε≤c≤(1+ε)​|𝗌𝗈𝗅​(F)↓S|]≥1−δPr𝗌𝗈𝗅subscript𝐹↓absent𝑆1𝜀𝑐1𝜀𝗌𝗈𝗅subscript𝐹↓absent𝑆1𝛿\\Pr\\left[\\frac{|{\\mathsf{sol}({F})}_{\\mathsf{\\downarrow}S}|}{1+\\varepsilon}\\leq c\\leq(1+\\varepsilon)|{\\mathsf{sol}({F})}_{\\mathsf{\\downarrow}S}|\\right]\\geq 1-\\delta, where |𝗌𝗈𝗅​(F)↓S|𝗌𝗈𝗅subscript𝐹↓absent𝑆|{\\mathsf{sol}({F})}_{\\mathsf{\\downarrow}S}| denotes the number of the solutions of F𝐹F projected on S𝑆S. An outline of 𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢\\mathsf{ApproxMC} is shown in Algorithms 1\nand 2. At a high level, the key idea of 𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢\\mathsf{ApproxMC} is to\npartition the set of solutions into small cells of roughly equal size by\nrelying on the power of XOR-based hash\nfamilies  [ref]25, then\nrandomly picking one of the cells and enumerating all the solutions in the\nchosen small cell up to a threshold 𝗍𝗁𝗋𝖾𝗌𝗁𝗍𝗁𝗋𝖾𝗌𝗁\\mathsf{thresh} via calls to 𝖡𝗈𝗎𝗇𝖽𝖾𝖽𝖲𝖠𝖳​(F,S,𝗍𝗁𝗋𝖾𝗌𝗁)𝖡𝗈𝗎𝗇𝖽𝖾𝖽𝖲𝖠𝖳𝐹𝑆𝗍𝗁𝗋𝖾𝗌𝗁\\mathsf{BoundedSAT}(F,S,\\mathsf{thresh}). The estimated count is obtained by scaling the number of solutions\nin the randomly chosen cell by the number of cells, and the success probability\nof this estimation is amplified to the desired level by taking the median\nresult from several trials. Syntactically, the solution space partition and random cell selection is\naccomplished by introducing randomly generated XOR constraints of the form\n(⨁y∈Yy)=bsubscriptdirect-sum𝑦𝑌𝑦𝑏(\\bigoplus_{y\\in Y}y)=b for a random subset Y⊆S𝑌𝑆Y\\subseteq S and random\nbit b𝑏b. A crucial fact about random XOR constraints exploited by 𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢\\mathsf{ApproxMC}\nis their 2-universality when viewed as a hash family on assignments—briefly,\ngiven any two distinct Boolean assignments over the variable set S𝑆S, the\nprobability of each one satisfying a randomly chosen XOR constraint is\nindependent and equal to 1212\\frac{1}{2}. Accordingly, the 𝖡𝗈𝗎𝗇𝖽𝖾𝖽𝖲𝖠𝖳𝖡𝗈𝗎𝗇𝖽𝖾𝖽𝖲𝖠𝖳\\mathsf{BoundedSAT} queries made in Algorithms 1\nand 2 are conjunctions of the input formula and random XOR\nconstraints, i.e., CNF-XOR formulas. The current implementation of 𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢\\mathsf{ApproxMC}\nrelies on CryptoMiniSat for its ability to handle CNF-XOR formulas\nefficiently and\nincrementally  .\nFurthermore, the real-world implementation also relies on three key\noptimizations. \n\n(1) The search for the correct\nvalue of m𝑚m in Algorithm 2 (𝖥𝗂𝗇𝖽𝖬𝖥𝗂𝗇𝖽𝖬\\mathsf{FindM}) combines a linear\nneighborhood search, a galloping search, and a binary\nsearch . \n(2) The underlying SAT solver\nis used as a library, allowing to solve under a set of assumptions, a technique\nintroduced as part of MiniSat . This allows\nthe solver to keep learned lemmas between subsequent calls to solve(),\nsignificantly improving solving speed, which is especially helpful for proving\nunsatisfiability. \n(3) To improve the speed of finding satisfying\nassignments, a solution cache of past solutions is\nretained  which is especially helpful when the\noptimal number of XORs to add is N, but N+1 have been added and were\nfound to be too much. In these cases, all solutions that are valid for N+1\nXORs are also solutions to N XORs and can be reused.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: At a high level, the key idea of 𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢\\mathsf{ApproxMC} is to\npartition the set of solutions into small cells of roughly equal size by\nrelying on the power of XOR-based hash\nfamilies  [ref]25, then\nrandomly picking one of the cells and enumerating all the solutions in the\nchosen small cell up to a threshold 𝗍𝗁𝗋𝖾𝗌𝗁𝗍𝗁𝗋𝖾𝗌𝗁\\mathsf{thresh} via calls to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
