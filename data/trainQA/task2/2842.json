      "content": "Paper Title: One Timestep is all you need: Training Spiking Neural Networks with Ultra Low Latency\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep neural networks (DNNs) have revolutionized the fields of object detection, classification and natural language processing   , surpassing even human level performance. However, such performance boost has been achieved at the cost of extremely energy-intensive DNN architectures . Therefore, edge deployment of such DNNs remains a challenge, requiring specialized architectures and training schemes [ref]5. One approach\nto counter this is adopting model compression\ntechniques such as pruning [ref]6 , and data quantization . An alternative route for efficient computation is using Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)  0, which are bio-inspired learning frameworks and perform computations using binary spikes instead of analog activations used in standard networks. In this paper, standard networks are referred to as Analog Neural Networks (ANNs), while SNNs operate using spiking inputs.\nAs such, the sparse event-driven nature of SNNs make them an attractive alternative to ANNs 1, specially for\nresource-constrained machine intelligence. SNNs derive their energy efficiency primarily from the sparsity of computation at any given timestep and by substituting multiplyâ€“accumulate (MAC) operations in ANNs with additions. However, ANNs and current SNNs differ in terms of number of forward passes required for each input; ANNs infer in a single shot, whereas SNNs require computation over multiple timesteps, resulting in high inference latency. The requirement of multi-timestep processing causes threefold challenges in SNNs in terms of edge deployment- (i) too long latency might be unsuitable for real-time applications, (ii) accumulation of spikes over timesteps results in higher number of operations, thereby reducing efficiency, and (iii) accumulated neuronal membrane potentials of previous steps are used for computation at each timestep which adds the requirement of additional memory to store the intermediate potentials as well as the expensive memory access cost to the total power budget. As a result, reduction of inference latency while maintaining performance is a critical research problem in SNNs. Again, surrogate-gradient based SNN training with multiple timesteps is performed using backpropagation through time (BPTT) 2, similar to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), with membrane potential holding the internal state having recurrent connections. However, DNN topologies indicate that for static image classification tasks, recurrent connections are not required, rather feed-forward networks are enough to reach convergence. This motivates us to explore the possibility of obtaining SNNs where inference is performed with just one forward pass. Currently, most of the commonly used SNNs use Poisson rate coding 3 4, where the firing rate of the spiking neuron approximates the analog activation of corresponding ANN unit. This scheme provides comparable results to full precision ANNs, however it suffers from high inference latency 4 5. In rate-coding, the discretization error caused by representing analog values with spike-train is inversely proportional to the number of timesteps. Hence, a large number of timesteps is usually adopted to obtain high performance 4. As such, it is a challenge to reduce latency considerably without sacrificing performance degradation. On the other hand, with multiple timestep computation, the total energy consumption increases significantly due to the costly memory access operations for fetching membrane potentials. Though most of the previous SNN works ignore it and consider the computational cost only, the memory access cost can in fact be orders of magnitude higher compared to floating point arithmetic operations 6. This bottleneck can be overcome if SNNs can be trained to infer in one timestep, no longer requiring the excess memory access operations due to membrane potential. To that effect, our goal here is to reduce latency all the way up to unity (lowest limit) without hampering accuracy significantly. In this paper, we propose an iterative training scheme to reduce the latency requirement of SNNs. We adopt the hybrid method 7, so, first an ANN is trained, followed by ANN-SNN conversion and SNN domain training with backpropagation. The scheme utilizes direct input encoding 8 9, since it has enabled training SNNs with 5-6 timesteps only. The threshold of neurons at each layer is a learnable parameter in our method. Starting with an SNN trained with 5 timestep, we gradually reduce latency by iterative retraining. At each timestep reduction stage, the network trained at previous iteration with higher timestep is utilized as initialization for subsequent training with lower timestep. Direct transition from ANN or 5 timestep SNN to 1 timestep for deep SNNs results in training failures due to spike vanishing at the deeper layers. However, the proposed iterative process enables some spike propagation till the final layer through which backpropagation can start training and proper layerwise thresholds can be learnt for each corresponding timestep. This method gradually compresses the temporal axis of SNNs, since reduction of each timestep removes one forward pass from the computational graph. To summarize, the main contributions of this work are as follows, We present an iterative training technique to obtain deep SNNs which infer using a single timestep, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first SNN method to achieve competitive classification performance on ImageNet using unit timestep. Since inference is done in one timestep (single forward pass), our approach does not require the memory access cost of membrane potentials, unlike previously proposed SNNs. The proposed IIR-SNNs are able to infer with 5-2500X lower timesteps compared to other state-of-the-art SNNs, while achieving comparable or even better accuracy. 1 timestep inference also provides ultra-efficient computation due to low spike rate, resulting in SNNs which are 25-33X energy efficient compared to iso-architecture and iso-performing ANNs. The proposed sequential training scheme enables obtaining deep-Q network based reinforcement learning agents using SNN on Cartpole and Atari pong environments which infer using 1 timestep.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: has been achieved at the cost of extremely energy-intensive DNN architectures .
