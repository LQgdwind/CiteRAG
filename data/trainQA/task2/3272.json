      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Uniform Point Distribution in Feature-preserving Point Cloud Filtering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPosition-based methods.\nLOP was first proposed in . It is a parameterization-free method and does not rely on normal estimation. Besides fitting the original model, a density repulsion term was added to evenly control the point cloud distribution.\nWLOP  provided a novel repulsion term to solve the problem that the original repulsion function in LOP dropped too fast when the support radius became larger. The filtered points were distributed more evenly under WLOP. EAR  added an anisotropic weighting function to WLOP to smooth the model while preserving sharp features.\nCLOP 9 is another LOP-based approach. It redefined the data term as a continuous representation of a set of input points. Though only based on point positions, these approaches achieved fair smoothing results. Still, since they disregard normal information, these approaches tend to smear sharp features such as sharp edges and corners. Normal-based methods.\nFLOP  added normal information to the novel feature-preserving projection operator and preserved the features well. Meanwhile, a new Kernel Density Estimate (KDE)-based random sampling method was proposed for accelerating FLOP.\nMLS-based approaches   have also been applied to point cloud filtering. They relied upon the assumption that the given set of points implicitly defined a surface.\nIn , the authors presented an algorithm that allocated a MLS local reference domain for each point that was most suitable for its adjacent points and further projected the points to the underlying plane.\nThis approach used the eigenvectors of a weighted covariance matrix to obtain the normals when the input point cloud had no normal information.\nAPSS [ref]7, RMLS , and RIMLS  were implemented based on this, where RIMLS was based on robust local kernel regression and could obtain better results under the condition of higher noise.\nGPF  incorporated normal information to Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), which included two terms and performed well in preserving sharp features.\nA robust normal estimation method was proposed in  for both point clouds and meshes with a low-rank matrix approximation algorithm, where an application of point cloud filtering was demonstrated.\nTo keep the geometry features, 9 first filtered the normals by defining discrete operators on point clouds, and then present a bi-tensor voting scheme for the feature detection step. Inspired by image denoising, researchers have also investigated the nonlocal aspects of point cloud denoising.\nThe nonlocal-based point cloud filtering methods  [ref]4 6  often incorporated normal information and designed different similarity descriptions to update point positions in a nonlocal manner.\nAmong them,  proposed a similarity descriptor for point cloud patches based on MLS surfaces.\n[ref]4 designed a height vector field to describe the difference between the neighborhood of the point with neighborhoods of other points on the surface.\nInspired by the low-dimensional manifold model, 6 extends it from image patches to point cloud surface patches, and thus serves as a similarity descriptor for nonlocal patches.\n presented a new multi-patch collaborative method that regards denoising as a low-rank matrix recovery problem. They define the given patch as a rotation-invariant height-map patch and denoise the points by imposing a graph constraint. Filtering methods that rely on normal information usually yield good results, especially for point clouds with sharp features (e.g., CAD models).\nHowever, these methods have a strong dependence on the quality of input normals, and a poor normal estimation may lead to worse filtering results. Our proposed approach falls in the normal-based category. Inspired by GPF, we estimate normals of the input point cloud based on bilateral filtering  in order to get high-quality normal information. Note that if the input point cloud only contains positional information, PCA is used to compute the initial normals. The point positions are then updated in a local manner with the bilaterally filtered normals . We also add a repulsion term  to ensure a more uniform distribution for filtered points.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: projected the points to the underlying plane.\nThis approach used the eigenvectors of a weighted covariance matrix to obtain the normals when the input point cloud had no normal information.\nAPSS [ref]7, RMLS , and RIMLS  were implemented based on this, where RIMLS was based on robust local kernel regression and could obtain better results under the condition of higher noise.\nGPF\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
