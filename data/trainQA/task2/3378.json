      "content": "Paper Title: Abstract\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGiven an image x𝑥x, a label y^^𝑦\\hat{y} and the ensemble predictions yi,i∈[1,…,M]subscript𝑦𝑖𝑖1…𝑀y_{i},i\\in[1,...,M], all regularizers ℒr​e​gsubscriptℒ𝑟𝑒𝑔\\mathcal{L}_{reg} work as a regularizer to the cross-entropy (C​E𝐶𝐸CE) loss, where λr​e​gsubscript𝜆𝑟𝑒𝑔\\lambda_{reg} is a hyper-parameter that is chosen for each individual method. For our experiments, we select a set of regularization functions that compute a measure of similarity of the individual ensemble members’ predictions. An illustration of the general structure can be seen in Figure 1. Regularizers under consideration are our Sample Diversity regularizer, the ADP  regularizer, which was recently introduced for increasing robustness in ensembles to adversarial attacks, and the Negative Correlation regularizer. Additionally we consider the average pair-wise χ2superscript𝜒2\\chi^{2} distance (see Eq. 4). All these regularizers encourage the individual members to have diverse predictions given an input and can therefore be seen as increasing the functional diversity. The regularizers will be now described: Negative Correlation:\nThe Negative Correlation regularizer was first used by Liu et al.  to increase the diversity in neural network ensembles. The key insight was that the error of an ensemble depends upon the correlation of the errors between individual members [ref]5. Originally designed for regression tasks, it was already used by Shui et al. 6 to improve the diversity and calibration in neural network ensembles in classification tasks. This approach however reduces the accuracy of the ensemble and can easily lead to training instabilities. ADP: The ADP regularizer  orthogonalizes the predictions of the ensemble members on the non-correct classes during training. Given a correct class k𝑘k, the vector of the predictions for the non-correct classes are formed yi∖k=(yi1,…,yik−1,yk+1,…,yiC)superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑘subscriptsuperscript𝑦1𝑖…subscriptsuperscript𝑦𝑘1𝑖superscript𝑦𝑘1…subscriptsuperscript𝑦𝐶𝑖y_{i}^{\\setminus k}=(y^{1}_{i},\\dots,y^{k-1}_{i},y^{k+1},\\dots,y^{C}_{i}), re-normalized and stacked into a matrix Y∖k∈ℝ(C−1)×Msubscript𝑌𝑘superscriptℝ𝐶1𝑀Y_{\\setminus k}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{(C-1)\\times M}. Furthermore an entropy regularizer (H𝐻H) is used preventing extreme solutions. Together the regularizer is optimized using the hyperparameters α𝛼\\alpha and β𝛽\\beta. χ2superscript𝜒2\\chi^{2} distance:\nAs a distance measure between distributions, we implement the average pair-wise χ2superscript𝜒2\\chi^{2} distance between the members’ predictive distributions as a regularizer. Like the likelihood, the measure lives on the range [ref]0 [ref]0  and the regularizer can be computed as Sample Diversity:\nBuilding on the work of Jain et al.  and ADP , we introduce a similar regularizer for classification tasks, which we illustrate in Figure 1.\nInstead of regularizing diversity on the predictions of in-distribution data points, which could degrade performance, we generate out-of-distribution data points and enforce predictive orthogonality there. The loss reaches a minimum if all predictions are orthogonal on the sampled data points and thereby diverse but correct on the in-distribution data. Image batches are sampled from the uniform probability distribution and our regularizer encourages all ensemble members to have pairwise orthogonal logits on them.\nGiven all logits outputs for a sampled data point x~~𝑥\\tilde{x}, of all M𝑀M ensemble members (y~1,…,y~Msubscript~𝑦1…subscript~𝑦𝑀\\tilde{y}_{1},...,\\tilde{y}_{M}), normalized to length one and stacked in a matrix Y~∈ℝC×M~𝑌superscriptℝ𝐶𝑀\\tilde{Y}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{C\\times M}, we maximize Eq. 5 as our regularizer. In the out-of-distribution detection literature, multiple other approaches that utilize OOD data during training exist, however these approaches act on single neural networks, utilize adversarial generators and experiment in the out-of-distribution detection domain   . Our goal is to formulate a practical functional diversity regularizer that utilizes the strength of ensembles for robustness and calibration.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: used by Liu et al.  to increase the diversity in neural network ensembles. The key insight was that the error of an ensemble depends upon the correlation of the errors between individual members [ref]5.
