      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Single/Multi-Attribute of Object with Symmetry and Group\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisual Attribute.\nThe visual attribute was introduced into computer vision to reduce the gap between visual patterns and object concepts, such as reducing the difficulty in object recognition  or acting as an intermediate representation for zero-shot learning  .\nAfter that, attribute has been widely applied in recognition of face , people , pedestrian  or action , zero-shot learning   and so on. Therefore, attribute recognition is a fundamental problem to promote visual concept understanding. The typical approach for attribute recognition is to train a multi-attribute discriminative model same as object classification    . It ignores the intrinsic properties of attributes, such as compositionality and contextuality.\nFarhadi et al.  propose a visual feature selection method to recognize the attributes under the consideration of cross-category generalization. Gan et al.  further enhance the generalization by integrating kernel alignment with distributional variance.\nLiang et al.  think visual attributes are class-sensitive and utilize category information to predict attributes in a unified manner.\nAttribute correlation is essential information and gets explicitly considered in some works 6 1  .\nChoi et al. 6 propose a hyper-graph framework to learn the semantic attributes correlation and apply it to scene recognition.\nHand and Chellappa 1 designs a multi-task deep neural network with an auxiliary relation network for attribute prediction.\nFollowing these works, our SymNet explores attribute correlation from a novel perspective of attribute transformation.\nSome works   apply automatic learning techniques to design deep neural networks for multi-task attribute learning automatically.\nTang et al.  improve attribute recognition with weakly supervised attribute-specific localization.\nLater, some works start to consider the intrinsic properties by exploiting the attribute-object correlation   .\nConsidering the contextuality of attributes, Nagarajan et al. [ref]2 regard attributes as linear transformations operated upon object embeddings, and Misra et al.  map the attributes into model weight space to attain better representations. Adversarial learning is employed to model the discrepancy and correlations among attributes and objects.\nYang et al.  propose a hierarchical feature embedding framework with inter-class and intra-class relations.\nLi et al.  propose a structural attribute learning framework to extract domain-invariant attribute features.\nMoreover, multi-attribute compositions can also be used to describe objects in few-shot recognition .\nDifferent from our attribute correlation constraint (Sec. 3.4.2), Tokmakov et al.  adopts an orthogonal constraint to deal with attribute correlation. In Suppl Sec. 4.3, we compare two constraints and illustrate their respective advantages. Compositional Zero-Shot Learning.\nCZSL is a crossing field of compositional learning and zero-shot learning. In the CZSL setting, test compositions are unseen during training, while each component is seen in both the train and test sets. Chen et al.  construct linear classifiers for unseen compositions with tensor completion of weight vectors.\nMisra et al.  consider that the model space is more smooth, thus project the attributes or objects into it by training binary linear SVMs for the corresponding components. For CZSL, it composes attribute and object embeddings in model space as composition representation.\nWang et al.  address the attribute-object compositional problem via conditional embedding modification, which relies on attribute word embedding  transformation.\nNan et al.  map the image features and word vectors 6 into embedding space with the reconstruction constraint.\nNagarajan et al. [ref]2 regard attributes as linear operations for object embedding and map the image features and transformed object embeddings into a shared latent space. However, linear and explicit matrix transformation may be insufficient to represent various attribute concepts of different complexity, e.g., representing “red” and “broken” as matrices with the same capacity.\nVery recently, Naeem et al. 7 use a graph to learn the dependency and relevance between attributes, objects, and compositions.\nPrevious methods usually ignored or incompletely considered the natural principles within the coupling and decoupling of attributes and objects. Hence, we propose a unified framework inspired by group theory to learn these essential principles such as symmetry.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: localization.\nLater, some works start to consider the intrinsic properties by exploiting the attribute-object correlation   .\nConsidering the contextuality of attributes, Nagarajan et al. [ref]2 regard attributes as linear transformations operated upon object embeddings, and Misra et al.  map the attributes into model weight space to attain better representations.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
