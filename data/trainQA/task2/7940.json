      "content": "Paper Title: Fast-OverlaPIM: A Fast Overlap-driven Mapping Framework for Processing In-Memory Neural Network Acceleration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep neural networks (DNNs) have grown in popularity in a wide range of areas, such as image and video recognition , [ref]2,  IoT devices , [ref]5,  and natural language processing , . With continuously increasing network size  due to the demand for high accuracy, memory, and computation demands are rising dramatically for emerging neural networks (NNs), significantly slowing down the performance. Processing in-memory (PIM) has emerged as an acceleration solution to boost the performance of computational heavy applications, including DNNs.\nPIM exploits the large chunk of memory resources as both storage and processing elements to realize high compute and memory throughput simultaneously. The large capacity of memory allows the allocation of separate memory resources for different parts of the application, which significantly improves the computational throughput 0 12. Therefore, existing large-scale PIM accelerators spatially distribute all NN layers to exploit PIM parallelism 3 4 5. The spatial processing in PIM architectures leads to a unique design space for NN acceleration, which determines the execution order and distribution of DNN operations on the hardware 6 7 8.\nFigure 1 shows an example of two mappings for a 2D convolution on a PIM-enabled memory block. Different mappings vary in latency, data layout, and the order of producing outputs and consuming inputs. In large-scale DNNs, the design space for mapping DNNs onto the hardware accelerator is large. The mapping choices will be influential to latency and memory resource allocation. To tackle the mapping optimization problems, accelerators developed optimization for the mappings based on hardware configurations9. However, frameworks for conventional architecture 6     assume the accelerator processes one layer at a time, do not apply to spatially distributed acceleration on PIM architecture. PIM solutions are proposed     7 to consider optimization enabled by spatial memory. However, most PIM accelerators use heuristics for mapping and lack support for overlap optimization. In practice, the execution of a layer can start earlier when part of its input has been output from the preceding layer(s). Therefore, we overlap the execution of different layers to improve the performance. We call this improvement computational overlap optimization between consecutive layers. The lack of consideration for the computational overlap enabled by spatially distributed DNN acceleration between two consecutive layers leads to the undervaluing of the high parallelism of PIM. As a result, when considering the overlapping, the existing PIM-based framework, which only considers the end-to-end sequential latency, may generate sub-optimal mappings. This work proposes an optimized PIM-based DNN mapping framework, Fast-OverlaPIM, to enable efficient overlap-based mapping optimization for the\nwhole network on PIM architectures. Overlap analysis necessitates the generation of fine-grained data spaces, where a data space represents the range of data processed in a memory partition (e.g., bank, block) at each time step, to determine the ready time step for each data space. Considering each memory contains hundreds of banks and each DNN layer requires thousands of time steps, generating fine-grained data space information can be prohibitively costly. Moreover, the naive approach of analyzing output/input dependency by exhaustively comparing all data spaces among two consecutive layers in OverlaPIM also becomes the bottleneck. Meanwhile, mapping search becomes slow with the integration of overlap analysis so the exhaustive search strategy could be impossible. In response to these challenges, we propose several novel strategies them Fast-OverlaPIM. We modify the algorithm in OverlaPIM to a lightweight algorithm for generating fine-grained data spaces. We propose an analytical algorithm to determine the overlapping performance without exhaustive comparison. We propose a transformation mechanism that transforms an analyzed mapping into overlap-friendly mappings with a trivial overhead. We effectively increase the search space of the framework in a similar amount of time. We propose a novel search strategy that provides additional insights for map space exploration. Rather than initiating the search for map spaces from the first layer in the DNN, we opt to use the last layer or middle layers as the starting point for our whole network optimization. We implement the proposed framework in an open-source DNN mapping framework, Timeloop 6, and compare it against state-of-the-art mapping optimization without consideration of overlap. The analytical algorithms provided 3.4×\\times to 323.1×\\times runtime performance improvement as compared to exhaustive comparison for data dependencies analysis in OverlaPIM. Our evaluation of popular DNNs indicates Fast-OverlaPIM can produce mappings that are 4.6×\\times to 18.1×\\times faster than the mappings optimized by existing methods 6 7.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have grown in popularity in a wide range of areas, such as image and video recognition , [ref]2,  IoT devices , [ref]5,  and natural language processing , .
