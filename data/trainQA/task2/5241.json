Bringmann and Mulzer  approximate the discrete Fréchet distance in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} for constant d𝑑d.\nThey present an α𝛼\\alpha-approximation algorithm for the discrete Fréchet distance, that runs in time O​(n​log⁡n+n2/α)𝑂𝑛𝑛superscript𝑛2𝛼O(n\\log n+n^{2}/\\alpha), for any α𝛼\\alpha in [1,n]1𝑛[1,n].\nThis was improved by Chan and Rahmati  to O​(n​log⁡n+n2/α2)𝑂𝑛𝑛superscript𝑛2superscript𝛼2O(n\\log n+n^{2}/\\alpha^{2}) for any α𝛼\\alpha in [1,nlog⁡n]1𝑛𝑛[1,\\frac{n}{\\log n}].\nRecently at SODA 2023, van der Horst, van Kreveld, Ophelders, and Speckmann  show how to compute a α𝛼\\alpha-approximation in the same setting in O​((n+n​m/α)​log3⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛𝑚𝛼superscript3𝑛O((n+nm/\\alpha)\\log^{3}n) time for the continuous variant. Previous works have circumvented lower bounds by assuming that both curves come from some well-behaved class (each class has its own parameter).\nA curve P𝑃P is: κ𝜅\\kappa-straight (by Alt, Knauer and Wenk [ref]3) if for every i,j𝑖𝑗i,j the length of the subcurve from pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} to pjsubscript𝑝𝑗p_{j} is ℓ​(P​[i,j])≤κ⋅d​(pi,pj)ℓ𝑃𝑖𝑗⋅𝜅𝑑subscript𝑝𝑖subscript𝑝𝑗\\ell(P[i,j])\\leq\\kappa\\cdot d(p_{i},p_{j}), c𝑐c-packed (by Driemel, Har-Peled and Wenk ) if for every ball B𝐵B in 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} with radius r𝑟r: the length ℓ​(P∩B)≤c⋅rℓ𝑃𝐵⋅𝑐𝑟\\ell(P\\cap B)\\leq c\\cdot r (P∩B𝑃𝐵P\\cap B denotes all (continuous) curve segments of P𝑃P in B𝐵B), ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi-low-dense  if for every ball B𝐵B in 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} with radius r𝑟r, there exist at most ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi subcurves P​[i,j]⊆P∩B𝑃𝑖𝑗𝑃𝐵P[i,j]\\subseteq P\\cap B such that P​[i,j]≥r𝑃𝑖𝑗𝑟P[i,j]\\geq r.

If P𝑃P is a c𝑐c-straight path and Q𝑄Q is any walk in 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}, they compute a (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-approximation of Dℱ​(P,Q)subscript𝐷ℱ𝑃𝑄{D_{\\mathcal{F}}}(P,Q) in O​(|V|ε​log⁡|V|+|E|​log⁡|E|+c​mε2⋅log⁡|V|)𝑂𝑉𝜀𝑉𝐸𝐸⋅𝑐𝑚superscript𝜀2𝑉O(\\frac{|V|}{\\varepsilon}\\log|V|+|E|\\log|E|+\\frac{cm}{\\varepsilon^{2}}\\cdot\\log|V|) time. Note that the complexity of G𝐺G may easily exceed n𝑛n and m𝑚m. Realistic input assumptions have been applied to other geometric problems, e.g. for robotic navigation in ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi-low-dense environments , and map matching of ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi-low-dense graphs  or c𝑐c-packed graphs .\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: works have circumvented lower bounds by assuming that both curves come from some well-behaved class (each class has its own parameter).\nA curve P𝑃P is: κ𝜅\\kappa-straight (by Alt, Knauer and Wenk [ref]3) if for every i,j𝑖𝑗i,j the length of the subcurve from pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} to pjsubscript𝑝𝑗p_{j} is ℓ​(P​[i,j])≤κ⋅d​(pi,pj)ℓ𝑃𝑖𝑗⋅𝜅𝑑subscript𝑝𝑖subscript𝑝𝑗\\ell(P[i,j])\\leq\\kappa\\cdot\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
