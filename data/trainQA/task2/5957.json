      "content": "Paper Title: Beyond Submodularity: A Unified Framework of Randomized Set Selection with Group Fairness Constraints\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe increasing use of machine learning algorithms in decision-making has raised concerns about the possibility of biases and discrimination. However, various efforts are being made to develop fair algorithms that ensure equitable outcomes for individuals or groups, even in sensitive domains. These efforts involve creating techniques for classification , ranking , clustering , bandit learning 8, voting , college admission , matching 4, influence maximization [ref]30, and diverse data summarization 6. Various concepts of fairness have been proposed in the literature, including individual fairness, group fairness, and subgroup fairness. These concepts intend to tackle discrimination and bias in algorithmic decision-making, particularly in sensitive domains like employment, housing, and criminal justice. However, there is no universal measure of fairness since it often depends on the context and can be affected by various factors such as the decision-making process’s objectives and the sensitive attribute in question. In this paper, we propose a general group fairness notation that unifies many notations from previous works. We assume there are m𝑚m groups defined by a set of shared attributes like race, gender, or age. To assess the appropriateness of a particular solution set S𝑆S for a specific group t∈[m]𝑡delimited-[]𝑚t\\in[m], we introduce m𝑚m group utility functions g1,g2,⋯,gm:2V→ℝ≥0:subscript𝑔1subscript𝑔2⋯subscript𝑔𝑚→superscript2𝑉ℝ0g_{1},g_{2},\\cdots,g_{m}:2^{V}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}{\\geq 0}. Each group utility function gt​(S)subscript𝑔𝑡𝑆g_{t}(S) evaluates the utility that group t𝑡t derives from the solution set S𝑆S. For instance, in committee selection , gt​(S)subscript𝑔𝑡𝑆g_{t}(S) corresponds to the number of candidates chosen from group t𝑡t in the solution set S𝑆S. Given a set of feasible subsets ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}, let x∈ ℱ𝑥superscript01ℱx\\in ^{\\mathcal{F}} represent a distribution over solution sets in ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}, where xSsubscript𝑥𝑆x_{S} is the probability of choosing S∈ℱ𝑆ℱS\\in\\mathcal{F}. A distribution x𝑥x is deemed fair if ∑S∈ℱ​xS​gt​(S)≥αt,∀t∈[m]formulae-sequence𝑆ℱsubscript𝑥𝑆subscript𝑔𝑡𝑆subscript𝛼𝑡for-all𝑡delimited-[]𝑚\\sum{S\\in\\mathcal{F}}x_{S}g_{t}(S)\\geq\\alpha_{t},\\forall t\\in[m], meaning the expected utility from each group t∈[m]𝑡delimited-[]𝑚t\\in[m] is lower bounded by αtsubscript𝛼𝑡\\alpha_{t}. This enables the consideration of each group’s representation in the final outcome, promoting diversity and preventing under-representation of any particular group. In addition, there is a global utility function f:2V→ℝ≥0:𝑓→superscript2𝑉subscriptℝabsent0f:2^{V}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}. The expected (global) utility of a distribution x𝑥x can be computed as ∑S∈ℱxS​f​(S)subscript𝑆ℱsubscript𝑥𝑆𝑓𝑆\\sum_{S\\in\\mathcal{F}}x_{S}f(S). Our goal is to find a distribution x𝑥x that maximizes ∑S∈ℱxS​f​(S)subscript𝑆ℱsubscript𝑥𝑆𝑓𝑆\\sum_{S\\in\\mathcal{F}}x_{S}f(S) while ensuring that ∑S∈ℱxS​gt​(S)≥αt,∀t∈[m]formulae-sequencesubscript𝑆ℱsubscript𝑥𝑆subscript𝑔𝑡𝑆subscript𝛼𝑡for-all𝑡delimited-[]𝑚\\sum_{S\\in\\mathcal{F}}x_{S}g_{t}(S)\\geq\\alpha_{t},\\forall t\\in[m]. A formal definition of this problem is listed in P.0. We show that this formulation brings together and extends numerous noteworthy applications in both machine learning and operations research. We next summarize the main contributions of this paper. We develop a polynomial-time algorithmic framework for P.0 based on ellipsoid method. One main algorithmic finding (as formally presented in Theorem 3.1) is that suppose that for all z∈ℝ≥0m𝑧superscriptsubscriptℝabsent0𝑚z\\in\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}^{m}, there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that returns a set A∈ℱ𝐴ℱA\\in\\mathcal{F} such that for some ρ,μ∈ 𝜌𝜇01\\rho,\\mu\\in . Then there is a polynomial-time (ρ,μ)𝜌𝜇(\\rho,\\mu)-approximation algorithm for P.0. Here, the ρ𝜌\\rho represents the approximation ratio, while the μ𝜇\\mu indicates that the solution may violate the fairness constraint by at most a factor of μ𝜇\\mu. Hence, solving P.0 is reduced to finding an approximation algorithm for a combinatorial subset selection problem. We utilize this result to tackle various applications such as fairness-aware submodular maximization, sequential submodular maximization with group constraints, and assortment planning with market share constraints. Our approach outperforms existing methods for some of these applications, while for others, we introduce novel applications and develop the first approximation algorithms. Notably, when f𝑓f is non-negative monotone and submodular, and gtsubscript𝑔𝑡g_{t} is a modular function, our approach gives a feasible and optimal (1−1/e,1)11𝑒1(1-1/e,1)-approximation solution. We explore extensions to other commonly used fairness metrics and propose effective algorithms for solving them. In the first extension, we introduce additional upper bounds βtsubscript𝛽𝑡\\beta_{t} on the expected utility of each group t∈[m]𝑡delimited-[]𝑚t\\in[m]. Specifically, we require that αt≤∑S∈ℱxS⋅gt​(S)≤βt,∀t∈[m]formulae-sequencesubscript𝛼𝑡subscript𝑆ℱ⋅subscript𝑥𝑆subscript𝑔𝑡𝑆subscript𝛽𝑡for-all𝑡delimited-[]𝑚\\alpha_{t}\\leq\\sum_{S\\in\\mathcal{F}}x_{S}\\cdot g_{t}(S)\\leq\\beta_{t},\\forall t\\in[m]. In the second extension, we explore another frequently used measure of fairness that aims to achieve parity in pairwise utility between groups. The degree of fairness is defined by a parameter γ𝛾\\gamma. Specifically, we require that for any two groups t,t′∈[m]𝑡superscript𝑡′delimited-[]𝑚t,t^{\\prime}\\in[m], the difference between their expected utilities does not exceed γ𝛾\\gamma, i.e., ∑S∈ℱxS⋅gt​(S)−∑S∈ℱxS⋅gt′​(S)≤γ,∀t,t′∈[m]formulae-sequencesubscript𝑆ℱ⋅subscript𝑥𝑆subscript𝑔𝑡𝑆subscript𝑆ℱ⋅subscript𝑥𝑆subscript𝑔superscript𝑡′𝑆𝛾for-all𝑡superscript𝑡′delimited-[]𝑚\\sum_{S\\in\\mathcal{F}}x_{S}\\cdot g_{t}(S)-\\sum_{S\\in\\mathcal{F}}x_{S}\\cdot g_{t^{\\prime}}(S)\\leq\\gamma,\\forall t,t^{\\prime}\\in[m]. Over the years, there has been a significant effort to develop fair algorithms across various fields to address the issue of biased decision-making. In the domain of influence maximization and classification, researchers have been actively developing fair algorithms [ref]30 . Similarly, in voting systems, the focus has been on ensuring that election outcomes are a fair representation of the preferences of voters, leading to the development of fair algorithms . The field of bandit learning, which involves making sequential decisions based on uncertain information, has also seen a growing interest in the development of fair algorithms to address the issue of bias 8. Additionally, the field of data summarization has seen an increasing focus on the development of fair algorithms [ref]9 to provide a balanced representation of data and avoid biased decision-making. The choice of fairness metric in previous studies depends on the context and type of bias being addressed, resulting in a range of optimization problems and fair algorithms customized to the particular demands of each application. We adopt a general group utility function to assess the solution’s utility from each group’s perspective. Our framework is general enough to encompass numerous existing fairness notations, including the 80%percent8080\\%-rule , statistical parity 5, and proportional representation . While most previous research on fairness-aware algorithm design (such as [ref]9   ) aims to find a deterministic solution set, our goal is to compute a randomized solution that can meet the group fairness constraints on average. This approach offers more flexibility in attaining group fairness. Our framework is general enough to encompass various existing studies on achieving group fairness through randomization, such as those examined in  2 9.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: even in sensitive domains.
