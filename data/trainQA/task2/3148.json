      "content": "Paper Title: Joint Symmetry Detection and Shape Matching for Non-Rigid Point Clouds\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nShape correspondence is a fundamental problem in computer vision, computer graphics and related fields , since it facilitates many high level tasks such as texture or deformation transfer. Although shape correspondence has been studied from many viewpoints , we focus here on a functional map-based approaches  as this framework is quite general, scalable and thus, has been extended to various other applications such as pose estimation , matrix completion [ref]40 and graph matching [ref]45. While recent learning-based deep functional map approaches have made impressive gains in non-rigid isometric full shape matching    [ref]39, symmetry detection   has received little attention in the learning paradigm. This is despite the fact that the two problems are inherently linked and symmetry disambiguation remains a challenge in shape matching pipelines (see Figure 1). Sharma &\\& Ovsjanikov [ref]39 proposes to align the shapes rigidly and claims empirically that manual rigid alignment resolves some symmetry problems arising in shape matching. In this work, we go a step further and provide an alternative based on a principled approach that simultaneously models both self symmetry and shape matching and thereby, considers the intrinsic self-symmetry during training. Moreover, while there have been some attempts to learn shape matching in a noisy setup  , we are not aware of any learning setup that investigates the effect of noise for symmetry detection. Our key contribution is a novel commutative regularization that couples the self-symmetry map with a pairwise map and thus, enables knowledge transfer between the two maps during training. This significantly improves generalization and robustness to sampling resolution as well as the size of embedding. Our method obtains competitive results on multiple shape matching benchmarks such as FAUST remesh  and partial SHRECâ€™16  when compared to recent learning-based methods while being very robust to noisy set up. We also evaluate our method on symmetry detection on various benchmarks where it shows resilience to noise where other methods based on the Laplacian Beltrami operator fail. To summarize, our contributions are as follows: To the best of our knowledge, we propose a first method that simultaneously learns symmetry detection and shape matching for non-rigid point clouds. We propose a novel regularization that constrains the symmetry map and pairwise map which is of independent interest for future work in this direction.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: we focus here on a functional map-based approaches  as this framework is quite general, scalable and thus, has been extended to various other applications such as pose estimation , matrix completion [ref]40 and graph matching [ref]45.
