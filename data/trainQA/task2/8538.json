      "content": "Paper Title: gECC: A GPU-based high-throughput framework for Elliptic Curve Cryptography\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFinite fields have extensive applications in areas such as cryptography, computer algebra, and numerical analysis, playing a crucial role in ECC. The integer xx belongs to a finite field FqF_{q}, that is, x∈[0,q)x\\in[0,q). Here, qq represents a large prime modulus with a bit width ll that typically spans 256 to 1024. Generally, the large integer xx can be composed as ∑i=0m−1xi​Di\\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}x_{i}D^{i}, where DD symbolizes the base and and q≤Dmq\\leq D^{m}. DD usually set to 64 or 32, allowing the array X[m:0]={x0…xm−1}X[m:0]=\\{x_{0}\\dots x_{m-1}\\} to be stored in word-size integers. A finite field is where the results of m​o​d​m​u​lmodmul, m​o​d​a​d​dmodadd, and m​o​d​i​n​vmodinv over integers remain within the field. The most time-consuming operations are m​o​d​m​u​lmodmul and m​o​d​i​n​vmodinv, which have about 5 times and 500 times the latency of m​o​d​a​d​dmodadd on a mainstream server. These operations are the primary targets of our acceleration efforts. Montgomery multiplication  is designed for m​o​d​m​u​lmodmul.\nBy altering the structure of the upper-level loop, various optimization strategies such as SOS and CIOS have been extensively explored  to reduce read and write operations. As demonstrated in Algorithm 2 (Montgomery multiplication with SOS Strategy), the operation m​o​d​m​u​lmodmul comprises two phases: integer multiplication and modular reduction. The multiplication phase involves multiplying two integers, resulting in a value within the range of [0,q2)[0,q^{2}). Subsequently, the value is reduced to the interval [0,q)[0,q) through the modular reduction phase. As discussed previously, researchers are dedicated to studying the prime moduli of special forms, which provide opportunities to effectively reduce the number of arithmetic operations required for the operation m​o​d​m​u​lmodmul. In particular, the use of moduli with characteristics similar to Mersenne primes proves to be beneficial. For instance, the State Cryptography Administration (SCA) of China recommends q=2256−2224−296+264−1q=2^{256}-2^{224}-2^{96}+2^{64}-1, known as SCA-256  which is used in the SM2 curve.\nOn the one hand, the exponents in both cases are chosen as multiples of 32, which can expedite implementation on a 32-bit platform. On the other hand, the q​_​i​n​vq\\_inv values of the prime in the algorithm 2 are equal to 1, indicating that there is room for optimization in the modular reduction phase. The m​o​d​i​n​vmodinv operation can be calculated either via Fermat’s little theorem (i.e., x−1≡xq−2​ mod ​qx^{-1}\\equiv x^{q-2}\\text{ mod }q) or a variant of Extended Euclid Algorithm  [ref]45. The former converts a m​o​d​i​n​vmodinv operation into multiple m​o​d​m​u​lmodmul operations, allowing one to reduce the number of m​o​d​m​u​lmodmul based on known qq, as demonstrated in the solution . The latter employs binary shift, addition, and subtraction operations instead of m​o​d​m​u​lmodmul operations. This results in a performance improvement of about 3 times compared to the former. However, due to the presence of multiple branch instructions within the latter algorithm, it is typically used in CPU-based systems  and is not suitable for parallel execution on GPU-based systems.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: phase.

The former converts a m​o​d​i​n​vmodinv operation into multiple m​o​d​m​u​lmodmul operations, allowing one to reduce the number of m​o​d​m​u​lmodmul based on known qq, as demonstrated in the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
