      "content": "Paper Title: Algorithms and Lower Bounds for de Morgan Formulas of Low-Communication Leaf Gates\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA (de Morgan) Boolean formula over {0,1}01\\{0,1\\}-valued input variables x1,…,xnsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n} is a binary tree whose internal nodes are labelled by AND or OR gates, and whose leaves are marked with a variable or its negation. The power of Boolean formulas has been intensively investigated since the early years of complexity theory (see, e.g.,        7 ). The techniques underlying these complexity-theoretic results have also enabled algorithmic developments. These include learning algorithms 1 4, satisfiability algorithms (cf. 8), compression algorithms , and the construction of pseudorandom generators  for Boolean formulas of different sizes. But despite many decades of research, the current non-trivial algorithms and lower bounds apply only to formulas of less than cubic size, and understanding larger formulas remains a major open problem in circuit complexity. In many scenarios, however, understanding smaller formulas whose leaves are replaced by certain functions would also be very useful. Motivated by several recent works, we initiate a systematic study of the 𝖥𝖮𝖱𝖬𝖴𝖫𝖠∘𝒢𝖥𝖮𝖱𝖬𝖴𝖫𝖠𝒢{\\sf FORMULA}\\circ\\mathcal{G} model, i.e., Boolean formulas whose leaves are labelled by an arbitrary function from a fixed class 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G}. This model unifies and generalizes a variety of models that have been previously studied in the literature: Oliveira, Pich, and Santhanam [ref]43 show that obtaining a refined understanding of formulas of size n1+εsuperscript𝑛1𝜀n^{1+\\varepsilon} over parity (XOR) gates would have significant consequences in complexity theory. Note that de Morgan formulas of size n3+εsuperscript𝑛3𝜀n^{3+\\varepsilon} can simulate such devices. Therefore, a better understanding of the 𝖥𝖮𝖱𝖬𝖴𝖫𝖠∘𝒢𝖥𝖮𝖱𝖬𝖴𝖫𝖠𝒢{\\sf FORMULA}\\circ\\mathcal{G} model even when 𝒢=𝖷𝖮𝖱𝒢𝖷𝖮𝖱\\mathcal{G}=\\mathsf{XOR} is necessary before we are able to analyze super-cubic size formulas.111We remark that even a single layer of 𝖷𝖮𝖱𝖷𝖮𝖱\\mathsf{XOR} gates can compute powerful primitives, such as error-correcting codes and hash functions. Tal  obtains almost quadratic lower bounds for the model of bipartite formulas, where there is a fixed partition of the input variables into x1,…,xnsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n} and y1,…,ynsubscript𝑦1…subscript𝑦𝑛y_{1},\\ldots,y_{n}, and a formula leaf can compute an arbitrary function over either x→→𝑥\\vec{x} or y→→𝑦\\vec{y}. This model was originally investigated by Pudlák, Rödl, and Savický , where it was referred to as graph complexity. The model is also equivalent to PSPACE-protocols in communication complexity (cf. ). Abboud and Bringmann  consider formulas where the leaves are threshold gates whose input wires can be arbitrary functions applied to either the first or the second half of the input. This extension of bipartite formulas is denoted by ℱ2subscriptℱ2\\mathcal{F}_{2} in . Their work establishes connections between faster ℱ2subscriptℱ2\\mathcal{F}_{2}-SAT algorithms, the complexity of problems in P such as Longest Common Subsequence and the Fréchet Distance Problem, and circuit lower bounds. Polytopes (i.e. intersection of half-spaces), which corresponds to 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} being the family of linear-threshold functions, and the formula contains only AND gates as internal gates. The constructing of PRGs for this model has received significant attention in the literature (see  and references therein). We obtain in a unified way several new results for the 𝖥𝖮𝖱𝖬𝖴𝖫𝖠∘𝒢𝖥𝖮𝖱𝖬𝖴𝖫𝖠𝒢\\mathsf{FORMULA}\\circ\\mathcal{G} model, for natural classes 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} of functions which include parities, linear (and polynomial) threshold functions, and indeed many other functions of interest. In particular, we show that this perspective leads to stronger lower bounds, general satisfiability algorithms, and better pseudorandom generators for a broad class of functions.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: by an arbitrary function from a fixed class 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G}.
