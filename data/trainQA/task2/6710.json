      "content": "Paper Title: Fully 1×1 Convolutional Network for Lightweight Image Super-Resolution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBenefiting from the extremely few parameters in SC layer, there are more opportunities for us to explore different architectures. In detail, simply stacked by the basic SC-ResBlock, we exploit three SCNets with differen model sizes that contain larger latent dimensions up to 128 channels and deeper architectures up to 64 blocks. Quantitative Evaluation.\nThe performance of different SR models on five test datasets with scales 2, 3, and 4 is compared and reported in Table I. Along with PSNR and SSIM results, we also report the number of parameters. Besides LAPAR-B [ref]10, our SCNet-T outperforms all the tiny models when the number of parameters is less than 400k, demonstrating its effectiveness. It is reasonable to note that LAPAR-B contains nearly twice as many parameters. When the number of parameters is between 400k and 800k, SCNet-B outperforms some larger models such as IMDN [ref]9, LAPAR-A [ref]10, and FDIWN  on all scales. Specifically, SCNet-B achieves advanced results on all test datasets besides Set5 compared to LBNet , which contains well-designed architectures and more parameters. Furthermore, according to the average performance in Table I, one can observe that SCNet-B matches or even outperforms existing models across all scales, particularly for the x4 SR task. This effectively demonstrates the capability of our SCNet, which solely relies on 1×1111\\times 1 convolutions, to adeptly handle local feature aggregation for SR tasks. Lastly, the proposed SCNet-L outperforms DRCN [ref]38, CARN , SMSR , and SRResNet  and obtains the new SOAT performance in all test cases. SCNet-L achieves remarkable gains 0.26/0.0047 and 0.28/0.0062 in the terms of PSNR and SSIM compared to IMDN and SRResNet, respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability. Benefiting from the extremely few parameters in SC layer, there are more opportunities for us to explore different architectures. In detail, simply stacked by the basic SC-ResBlock, we exploit three SCNets with different model sizes that exploit larger latent dimensions up to 128 and deeper layers up to 64. We posit that by examining the results across varying architectures, we can provide a deeper understanding of the proposed SCNet and its performance nuances. * presents the average of test datasets besides Set5. Efficiency of SCNet.\nIn addition, we also report computational comparisons in Table II and show that SCNets obtain the advancded trade-off between performance, parameter count, and FLOPs compared to the LAPAR [ref]10 and SRResNet , while less complexity is obtained in ShuffleMixer. It is reasonable that SCNets only exploit the vanilla residual architecture to build a new lightweight SR benchmark. Exploiting well-designed operations is beyond the scope of this paper, which will be reached in next stage. Shift operation is promising for designing lightweight models as they require no extra computational cost. For our proposed SCNet, which contains fully 1×1111\\times 1 convolutions, we find that the 1×1111\\times 1 convolution and spatial-shift operation in the SC layer can be fused as one optimal operation by re-indexing output values of the matrix dot product according to the shift step. To evaluate this fusion, we adopt the widely used C++ inference library NCNN, and the results are presented in Table III. All models were converted from their official release without additional optimization. Compared to existing models, ShuffleMixer needs to be highly optimized for deployment due to complicated operations such as LayerNorm, channel-split-shuffle, and depth-wise convolution. IMDN and SRResNet perform well due to highly optimized implementations for widely used 3×3333\\times 3 convolutions. Finally, the proposed SCNet with vanilla fused Shift-Conv obtains comparable performance. Notably, SCNet contains only one type of computational operation (1×1111\\times 1 convolution). This simplicity makes it friendly and practical to achieve optimized implementation, which we believe will make it suitable for real-world applications in the future. In general, SCNets with all 1×1111\\times 1 convolutions obtain comparable and sometimes even better results than SR models with normal 3×3333\\times 3 convolutions with a larger model size, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed SCNets. In this regard, we believe that there are more opportunities to exploit efficient architectures for lightweight image restoration based on the proposed SCNet. .\n\n\n\n\nScale\nShift Step\nParams\nFLOPs\nSet5\nSet14\nB100\nUrban100\nManga109\n\nPSNR/SSIM\nPSNR/SSIM\nPSNR/SSIM\nPSNR/SSIM\nPSNR/SSIM\n\n×4absent4\\times 4\nShift4-Cross\n612K\n78G\n32.14/0.8946\n28.61/0.7819\n27.58/0.7360\n26.05/0.7836\n30.48/0.9086\n\nShift4-Diag\n612K\n78G\n31.83/0.8898\n28.39/0.7769\n27.44/0.7314\n25.65/0.7705\n29.90/0.9015\n\nShift8\n612K\n78G\n32.16/0.8949\n28.65/0.7830\n27.60/0.7368\n26.16/0.7864\n30.58/0.9100\n\nShift8-Dilated\n612K\n78G\n32.19/0.8953\n28.67/0.7832\n27.60/0.7369\n26.14/0.7868\n30.61/0.9102\n\n\nShift16\n612K\n78G\n32.10/0.8941\n28.57/0.7812\n27.55/0.7355\n26.02/0.7833\n30.34/0.9075\n\n Qualitative Evaluation.\nWe conducted a visual quality comparison of SR results between our proposed SCNet-L and five representative models, including LapSRN , VDSR 2, DRCN [ref]38, CARN , and IMDN [ref]9, for up-scaling tasks of ×2absent2\\times 2, ×3absent3\\times 3, and ×4absent4\\times 4. The ×4absent4\\times 4 SR results on Urban100 test dataset are presented in Figure 5. One can find that the results of CARN and IMDN appear blurry and contain more artifacts compared to our SCNet-L, which is able to recover the main structures with clear and sharp textures. In addition, results of the proposed SCNet with different model capacity are presented in Figure 6. When we have a look at image ‘BokuHaSitatakaKu‘, we can find that even SCNet-B can achieve clearer characters compared to results of IMDN or CARN.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: of different SR models on five test datasets with scales 2, 3, and 4 is compared and reported in Table I.
