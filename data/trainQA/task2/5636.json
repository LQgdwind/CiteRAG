      "content": "Paper Title: PlaNet-ClothPick: Effective Fabric Flattening Based on Latent Dynamic Planning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nModel-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) applications in P&P cloth-flattening are mainly Type I : planning or trajectory optimisation algorithms, where the agent needs access to the dynamic model of the environment for generating imaginary rollouts. The dynamic model can be either a known dynamic or a learned dynamic. Planning algorithms used in fabric-flattening are mainly based on model-predictive control (MPC), which can be further categorised into goal-conditioned MPC   and reward-based MPC systems [ref]13 [ref]14 . Visual Foresight (VSF)  by Hoque et al. (2022) and the Contrastive Forward Model (CFM)  by Yan et al. (2020) are the two example applications of goal-conditioned MPC to fabric flattening, where the cost function is calculated based on the difference between the current and goal states. Note that VSF’s cost function is calculated according to Visual MPC  framework, while the one of CFM is the distance of the two states at the latent space. reward-based MPC, on the other hand, selects top trajectories based on reward prediction from the prior rollout trajectories [ref]1 [ref]13 [ref]14. In contrast to goal-conditioned MPC, the application domain of reward-based MPC is limited by the reward prediction function given to the algorithm. DefOrmable Object Manipulation (G-DOOM) is a latent reward-based MPC method that generates the prior rollout trajectories in the latent space trained with unsupervised-keypoint graph dynamics [ref]13. In contrast, Visible Connectivity Dynamics (VCD) by Lin et al. (2022) [ref]14 is a mesh-based reward-based MPC method that applies rollout on the reconstructed mesh representation using a learned mesh dynamic ; they also proposed VCD Graph Imitation (VCD-GI), where a teacher dynamic model learns with the complete information of the cloth and distil the knowledge to the vision-based student. Mesh-based reward-based MPC methods, such as VCD, VCD-GI [ref]14, and MEDOR , outperform goal-conditioned MPC and latent reward-based MPC methods in cloth-flattening. Although they are invariant to the cloth shape, colour and camera pose, these methods cannot be easily applied to manipulating other kinds of objects, since the dynamic model is specially trained for CDOs. Most recent robotic systems focus on closing the simulation-to-reality gap of the mesh-based planning methods on garment-flattening tasks    by improving the mesh tracking accuracy in real-world trials. Deep Planning Network (PlaNet) [ref]1 is a latent reward-based MPC method that employs a learned latent dynamic based on a Recurrent State Space Model (RSSM). While it performs well on continuous control benchmark environments like the dm_control suite , numerous experiments have found it unsuitable for fabric flattening  [ref]13 . A possible reason is that the reconstructed observation from the visual model is fuzzy, which makes planning based on reconstructed vision hard due to the lack of precision around the edges and corners of the article [ref]14. Dreamer    is a model-based actor-critic (AC) reinforcement learning algorithm that uses RSSM [ref]1 for representation learning. It shows significant data efficiency and performance improvement compared to the PlaNet and AC baselines, and Dreamer V2  is the first MBRL algorithm to achieve super-human performance with a single GPU in discrete-action Atari benchmarks. The architecture and objective of the LDM of Dreamer are directly inherited from PlaNet’s [ref]1. Dreamer V2  leverages categorical latent state space representation and KL balancing to learn the LDM. Stochastic Latent Actor-Critic (SLAC) 7 combines the Soft Actor-Critic’s (SAC) 8 maximum-entropy RL objective 9 0 with latent dynamic representation learning to solve Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) 1. In contrast to RSSM-based algorithms such as PlaNet and Dreamer, it only learns stochastic latent representation. It exhibits stability, data efficiency and improved performance compared to SAC and PlaNet in several benchmarks 2 but has never been tested on CDO manipulation tasks. We evaluate the performance of SLAC’s policy learning and planning on the LDM in this paper. Note that we did not examine imitation learning approaches because we mainly focus on reinforcement learning methods in this paper. Nevertheless, Hoque et al. (2022)  have shown that VSF outperforms the behaviour-cloning approach DAgger  regarding primary metrics.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: dynamic.
