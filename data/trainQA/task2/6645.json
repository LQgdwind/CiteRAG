      "content": "Paper Title: Convergence Guarantees for Stochastic Subgradient Methods in Nonsmooth Nonconvex Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we introduce a general framework for analyzing the asymptotic behavior of discrete approximations of differential inclusions. All the results presented in this section are closely related to the results in [ref]4 [ref]13  . We consider the sequence {xk}subscript𝑥𝑘\\{{x_{k}}\\} generated by the following updating scheme, Here dksubscript𝑑𝑘d_{k} is an approximate evaluation for a set-valued mapping ℋ:ℝn⇉ℝn:ℋ⇉superscriptℝ𝑛superscriptℝ𝑛\\mathcal{H}:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightrightarrows\\mathbb{R}^{n} that has closed graph. Moreover, ξksubscript𝜉𝑘\\xi_{k} refers to the noises in the evaluation of dksubscript𝑑𝑘d_{k}. Our goal is to establish the convergence properties of the sequence xksubscript𝑥𝑘{{x_{k}}} generated by (3.1), within the context of the proposed general framework. To accomplish this, we demonstrate that its interpolated process tracks a trajectory of the following differential inclusion: Following the works from  , we make the following assumptions on (3.2). The sequence {xk}subscript𝑥𝑘\\{{x_{k}}\\} and {dk}subscript𝑑𝑘\\{d_{k}\\} are uniformly bounded, i.e., supk≥0‖xk‖+‖dk‖<+∞subscriptsupremum𝑘0normsubscript𝑥𝑘normsubscript𝑑𝑘\\sup_{k\\geq 0}\\left\\|{x_{k}}\\right\\|+\\left\\|d_{k}\\right\\|<+\\infty. The sequence of stepsizes {ηk}subscript𝜂𝑘\\{\\eta_{k}\\} satisfies ∑k=0+∞ηk=+∞superscriptsubscript𝑘0subscript𝜂𝑘\\sum_{k=0}^{+\\infty}\\eta_{k}=+\\infty, and limk→+∞ηk=0subscript→𝑘subscript𝜂𝑘0\\lim_{k\\to+\\infty}\\eta_{k}=0. For any T>0𝑇0T>0, the noise sequence {ξk}subscript𝜉𝑘\\{\\xi_{k}\\} is uniformly bounded and satisfies The set-valued mapping ℋ:ℝn⇉ℝn:ℋ⇉superscriptℝ𝑛superscriptℝ𝑛\\mathcal{H}:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightrightarrows\\mathbb{R}^{n} has closed graph. Moreover, for any unbounded increasing sequence {kj}⊂ℕ+subscript𝑘𝑗subscriptℕ\\{k_{j}\\}\\subset\\mathbb{N}_{+} such that {xkj}subscript𝑥subscript𝑘𝑗\\{x_{k_{j}}\\} converges to x~∈ℝn~𝑥superscriptℝ𝑛\\tilde{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}, it holds that Let x​(⋅)𝑥⋅x(\\cdot) be the interpolated solution to the sequence {xk}subscript𝑥𝑘\\{{x_{k}}\\}, and d:ℝ→ℝn:𝑑→ℝsuperscriptℝ𝑛d:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{n} be the piecewise constant mapping that satisfies d​(s)=dk𝑑𝑠subscript𝑑𝑘d(s)=d_{k} for any s∈[λη​(k),λη​(k+1))𝑠subscript𝜆𝜂𝑘subscript𝜆𝜂𝑘1s\\in[\\lambda_{\\eta}(k),\\lambda_{\\eta}(k+1)). Moreover, for any t≥0𝑡0t\\geq 0, let xt​(⋅)subscript𝑥𝑡⋅x_{t}(\\cdot) denotes the time-shifted solution to the following differential equation, Then the following auxiliary lemma shows the equivalence between the interpolated process x​(⋅)𝑥⋅x(\\cdot) and the time-shifted solution xt​(⋅)subscript𝑥𝑡⋅x_{t}(\\cdot). Suppose Assumption 3.1 holds, then we have For any s∈[t,t+T]𝑠𝑡𝑡𝑇s\\in[t,t+T], let q1=Λη​(t)subscript𝑞1subscriptΛ𝜂𝑡q_{1}=\\Lambda_{\\eta}(t) and q2=Λη​(s)subscript𝑞2subscriptΛ𝜂𝑠q_{2}=\\Lambda_{\\eta}(s). Moreover, we denote ∑i=kk−1ηi​ξi:=0assignsuperscriptsubscript𝑖𝑘𝑘1subscript𝜂𝑖subscript𝜉𝑖0\\sum_{i=k}^{k-1}\\eta_{i}\\xi_{i}:=0 for any k≥0𝑘0k\\geq 0. Then by the definitions of ΛηsubscriptΛ𝜂\\Lambda_{\\eta} and ληsubscript𝜆𝜂\\lambda_{\\eta}, we have that Moreover, from the definition of ΛηsubscriptΛ𝜂\\Lambda_{\\eta} and ληsubscript𝜆𝜂\\lambda_{\\eta}, it holds that Similarly, it holds that Furthermore, Assumption 3.1(3) guarantees that In addition, Assumption 3.1(1) and Assumption 3.1(2) show that As a result, from (3.7) and the arbitrariness of s∈[t,t+T]𝑠𝑡𝑡𝑇s\\in[t,t+T], we can conclude that This completes the proof.\n∎ Then for any t>0𝑡0t>0, let xt​(⋅)superscript𝑥𝑡⋅x^{t}(\\cdot) be the time-shifted curve of the interpolated solution x​(⋅)𝑥⋅x(\\cdot) corresponding to the sequence {xk}subscript𝑥𝑘\\{{x_{k}}\\} generated by framework (3.1), i.e., xt​(s)=x​(t+s)superscript𝑥𝑡𝑠𝑥𝑡𝑠x^{t}(s)=x(t+s). Moreover, we denote 𝒞​(ℝ+,ℝn)𝒞subscriptℝsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathcal{C}(\\mathbb{R}_{+},\\mathbb{R}^{n}) as the set of all continuous functions mapping from ℝ+subscriptℝ\\mathbb{R}_{+} to ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}, where for any γ1,γ2∈𝒞​(ℝ+,ℝn)subscript𝛾1subscript𝛾2𝒞subscriptℝsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\gamma_{1},\\gamma_{2}\\in\\mathcal{C}(\\mathbb{R}_{+},\\mathbb{R}^{n}), the metric is chosen as\nd​(γ1,γ2):=∑t=1+∞2−t​sups∈[0,t]min⁡{‖γ1​(s)−γ2​(s)‖,1}assigndsubscript𝛾1subscript𝛾2superscriptsubscript𝑡1superscript2𝑡subscriptsupremum𝑠0𝑡normsubscript𝛾1𝑠subscript𝛾2𝑠1\\mathrm{d}(\\gamma_{1},\\gamma_{2}):=\\sum_{t=1}^{+\\infty}2^{-t}\\sup_{s\\in[0,t]}\\min\\{\\left\\|\\gamma_{1}(s)-\\gamma_{2}(s)\\right\\|,1\\}. Under Assumption 3.1 and the validity of Lemma 3.2, the Theorem 3.3 below demonstrates that for any sequence tk→+∞→subscript𝑡𝑘t_{k}\\to+\\infty, the shifted curve xtk​(⋅)superscript𝑥subscript𝑡𝑘⋅{x^{t_{k}}(\\cdot)} subsequentially converges in 𝒞​(ℝ+,ℝn)𝒞limit-fromℝsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathcal{C}(\\mathbb{R}+,\\mathbb{R}^{n}) to a trajectory of (3.2), by following the results established in [19, Theorem 3.2] (restated in [18, Theorem 3.1]). We\nshould point out that while  assumes the sequence of stepsizes ηksubscript𝜂𝑘{\\eta_{k}} to be square-summable (i.e., ∑k=0+∞ηk2<+∞superscriptsubscript𝑘0superscriptsubscript𝜂𝑘2\\sum_{k=0}^{+\\infty}\\eta_{k}^{2}<+\\infty), the proof of [19, Theorem 3.2] only relies on Lemma 3.2 and the validity of Assumption 3.1. Consequently, the results in Theorem 3.3 can be established by following the proof steps and techniques in [19, Theorem 3.2] directly. For the sake of simplicity, we omit the proof of Theorem 3.3. Suppose Assumption 3.1 holds. Then for any sequence {τk}⊂ℝ+subscript𝜏𝑘subscriptℝ\\{\\tau_{k}\\}\\subset\\mathbb{R}_{+}, the set of functions {xτk​(⋅)}superscript𝑥subscript𝜏𝑘⋅\\{x^{\\tau_{k}}(\\cdot)\\} is relatively compact in 𝒞​(ℝ+,ℝn)𝒞subscriptℝsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathcal{C}(\\mathbb{R}_{+},\\mathbb{R}^{n}). If in addition τk→+∞→subscript𝜏𝑘\\tau_{k}\\to+\\infty as k→+∞→𝑘k\\to+\\infty, then any cluster point z​(⋅)𝑧⋅z(\\cdot) of {xτk​(⋅)}superscript𝑥subscript𝜏𝑘⋅\\{x^{\\tau_{k}}(\\cdot)\\} in 𝒞​(ℝ+,ℝn)𝒞subscriptℝsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathcal{C}(\\mathbb{R}_{+},\\mathbb{R}^{n}) is a trajectory of the differential inclusion (3.2). To establish the convergence properties of the sequence {xk}subscript𝑥𝑘\\{{x_{k}}\\} generated from (3.1), we make the following assumptions based on the work in . There exists a continuous function ψ:ℝn→ℝ:𝜓→superscriptℝ𝑛ℝ\\psi:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{R}, which is bounded from below and satisfies the following conditions. The set {ψ​(x):0∈ℋ​(x)}conditional-set𝜓𝑥0ℋ𝑥\\{\\psi(x):0\\in\\mathcal{H}(x)\\} has empty interior in ℝℝ\\mathbb{R}. That is, its complementary is dense in ℝℝ\\mathbb{R}. Whenever γ:ℝ+→ℝn:𝛾→subscriptℝsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\gamma:\\mathbb{R}_{+}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{n} is a trajectory of the differential inclusion (3.2) with 0∉ℋ​(γ​(0))0ℋ𝛾00\\notin\\mathcal{H}(\\gamma(0)), there exists T>0𝑇0T>0 satisfying With Assumption 3.4, the following theorem shows that under Assumption 3.1 and Assumption 3.4, for the sequence {xk}subscript𝑥𝑘\\{{x_{k}}\\} generated by (3.1), any cluster point x~~𝑥\\tilde{x} of {xk}subscript𝑥𝑘\\{{x_{k}}\\} satisfies 0∈ℋ​(x~)0ℋ~𝑥0\\in\\mathcal{H}(\\tilde{x}). Let {xk}subscript𝑥𝑘\\{{x_{k}}\\} be the sequence generated by (3.1), and suppose Assumption 3.1 and Assumption 3.4 hold. Then any limit point of {xk}subscript𝑥𝑘\\{{x_{k}}\\} lies in the set {x∈ℝn:0∈ℋ​(x)}conditional-set𝑥superscriptℝ𝑛0ℋ𝑥\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}:0\\in\\mathcal{H}(x)\\} and {ψ​(xk)}𝜓subscript𝑥𝑘\\{\\psi({x_{k}})\\} converges. It is worth mentioning that [18, Theorem 3.2] assumes the sequence of stepsizes ηksubscript𝜂𝑘{\\eta_{k}} to be square-summable. However, the proof of [18, Theorem 3.2] only relies on Assumption 3.1, Theorem 3.3, and Assumption 3.4. Therefore, Theorem 3.5 can be considered as a direct corollary of [18, Theorem 3.2], as it can be proved by following the same proof steps and techniques presented in [18, Theorem 3.2]. Consequently, we omit the proof of Theorem 3.5 for simplicity. Furthermore, if we impose stronger conditions on ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} by assuming that it is locally bounded, convex, and compact valued, then Theorem 3.3 and [4, Theorem 4.1] directly establish that x​(⋅)𝑥⋅x(\\cdot) is an asymptotic pseudo-trajectory for (3.2). By combining this result with [4, Theorem 4.3] and [4, Proposition 3.27], we obtain the same convergence properties as stated in Theorem 3.5, but under the stronger conditions on ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: a general framework for analyzing the asymptotic behavior of discrete approximations of differential inclusions.
