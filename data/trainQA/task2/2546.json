      "content": "Paper Title: Pointwise Distance Distributions of periodic point sets\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAny point p𝑝p in ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n} can be identified with the vector p→→𝑝\\vec{p} from the origin 00 to p𝑝p.\nThe Euclidean distance between p,q∈ℝn𝑝𝑞superscriptℝ𝑛p,q\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n} is denoted by |p−q|𝑝𝑞|p-q|, which is the length of the difference vector p→−q→→𝑝→𝑞\\vec{p}-\\vec{q}. Classical methods of Computational Geometry.\nIsometry questions related to Problem 1.1 were extensively studied for finite sets of points.\nThe fastest algorithm to test an isometry between m𝑚m-point sets in ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n} runs in time O​(m⌈n/3⌉​log⁡m)𝑂superscript𝑚𝑛3𝑚O(m^{\\lceil n/3\\rceil}\\log m) by\n[ref]12, which can be improved to O​(m​log⁡m)𝑂𝑚𝑚O(m\\log m) in ℝ4superscriptℝ4\\mathbb{R}^{4} .\nSignificant results on matching bounded rigid shapes and registration of finite point sets were obtained in    [ref]23.\nThese methods focus on true/false answers without continuous invariants. The classical isometry invariant of a finite set in any metric space is the distribution of pairwise distances who completeness in general position was proved in 2004 .\nThe same paper described an infinite family of singular counter-examples to the full completeness, see the non-isometric 4-point sets in Fig. 3 (left).\nPersistent homology is a more recent isometry invariant of finite point sets, which is continuous under perturbation but turned out to be weaker than previously anticipated    .\nMémoli’s seminal work on distributions of distances , also known as shape distributions     , for bounded metric spaces is closest to the proposed Pointwise Distance Distributions (PDD) for periodic point sets.\nHowever, Problem 1.1 is not reducible to the finite sets by taking a cube or a ball of a fixed (even very large) cut-off radius within a periodic point set.\nIndeed, one can easily find non-isometric subsets of the same lattice as in Fig. 4 (left). Traditional methods of Crystallography and Materials Science.\nNumerous crystal descriptors include quantities such as cell parameters and atomic coordinates that are not isometry invariants, hence cannot help in Problem 1.1.\nMany approaches produce finite subsets by using a fixed number of neighbors  or a fixed cut-off radius\n  .\nA reduction to one subset can never guarantee a complete and continuous classification because, under tiny perturbations, a primitive (minimal by volume) cell can become larger than any bounded subset of a fixed size, see Fig. 2 (right). Another inconvenience of the tools such as SOAP (Smooth Overlapped Atomic Positions ) and ACSF (Atom-Centered Symmetry Functions ) is their dependence on parameters such as cut-off radii that require manual choices.\nIf these parameters change, then so do the underlying invariants. One of the oldest invariants of crystals is the X-ray diffraction pattern whose single crystal form is best for determining a 3D structure of an experimental crystal .\nSince not all materials can be grown as single crystals, the powder X-ray diffraction pattern (PXRD) is more common.\nAll periodic structures with identical PXRDs are called homometric,1, see the periodic versions S​(1)={0,1,3,4}+8​ℤ𝑆101348ℤS(1)=\\{0,1,3,4\\}+8\\mathbb{Z} and Q​(1)={0,3,4,5}+8​ℤ𝑄103458ℤQ(1)=\\{0,3,4,5\\}+8\\mathbb{Z} of the 4-point set T,K𝑇𝐾T,K in Fig. 3.\nThe more general sets S​(r),Q​(r)𝑆𝑟𝑄𝑟S(r),Q(r) with identical Pair Distribution Functions (PDF) will be distinguished by PDDPDD\\mathrm{PDD} in section 3. The Mercury software visually compares periodic structures  by minimizing the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) of atomic positions from up to a given number m𝑚m (15 by default) of closest molecules in two structures.\nThis comparison depends on many parameters (maximum number of matched molecules, thresholds for matched distances and angles), fails the triangle inequality in condition (1.1c), and is too slow for pairwise comparisons, see section 6.\nIn fact, the above RMSD tries to measure the maximum displacement of atoms only by using finite subsets of crystals. For full infinite crystals, the theoretically better alternative is the bottleneck distance dB​(S,Q)subscript𝑑𝐵𝑆𝑄d_{B}(S,Q) equal to the maximum Euclidean distance needed to perturb every point p∈S𝑝𝑆p\\in S to its unique match in Q𝑄Q.\nFormally, dB​(S,Q)=infg:S→Qsupp∈S|p−g​(p)|subscript𝑑𝐵𝑆𝑄subscriptinfimum:𝑔→𝑆𝑄subscriptsupremum𝑝𝑆𝑝𝑔𝑝d_{B}(S,Q)=\\inf\\limits_{g:S\\to Q}\\sup\\limits_{p\\in S}|p-g(p)| is minimized over all bijections g𝑔g and maximized over all points p∈S𝑝𝑆p\\in S for a fixed bijection.\nBut dBsubscript𝑑𝐵d_{B} is not a metric on all periodic sets because dB=+∞subscript𝑑𝐵d_{B}=+\\infty for nearly identical lattices.\nAlso, dBsubscript𝑑𝐵d_{B} is discontinuous under perturbations of lattice bases. We show that S=ℤ𝑆ℤS=\\mathbb{Z} and Q=(1+δ)​ℤ𝑄1𝛿ℤQ=(1+\\delta)\\mathbb{Z} for any δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0 have dB​(S,Q)=+∞subscript𝑑𝐵𝑆𝑄d_{B}(S,Q)=+\\infty.\nAssuming that dB​(S,Q)subscript𝑑𝐵𝑆𝑄d_{B}(S,Q) is finite, consider an interval [−N,N]⊂ℝ𝑁𝑁ℝ[-N,N]\\subset\\mathbb{R} containing 2​N+12𝑁12N+1 points of S𝑆S.\nIf there is a bijection g:S→Q:𝑔→𝑆𝑄g:S\\to Q such that |p−g​(p)|≤dB𝑝𝑔𝑝subscript𝑑𝐵|p-g(p)|\\leq d_{B} for all points p∈S𝑝𝑆p\\in S, the image of 2​N+12𝑁12N+1 points S∩[−N,N]𝑆𝑁𝑁S\\cap[-N,N] under this bijection g𝑔g should be within the interval [−N−dB,N+dB]𝑁subscript𝑑𝐵𝑁subscript𝑑𝐵[-N-d_{B},N+d_{B}].\nThe last interval contains only 1+2​(N+dB)1+δ12𝑁subscript𝑑𝐵1𝛿1+\\frac{2(N+d_{B})}{1+\\delta} points, which is smaller than 1+2​N12𝑁1+2N when N+dB1+δ<N𝑁subscript𝑑𝐵1𝛿𝑁\\frac{N+d_{B}}{1+\\delta}<N or dB<δ​Nsubscript𝑑𝐵𝛿𝑁d_{B}<\\delta N.\nWe get a contradiction by choosing a large N>dBδ𝑁subscript𝑑𝐵𝛿N>\\frac{d_{B}}{\\delta}.\n ■■\\blacksquare If we consider only periodic point sets S,Q⊂ℝn𝑆𝑄superscriptℝ𝑛S,Q\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n} with the same density (or unit cells of the same size), the bottleneck distance dB​(S,Q)subscript𝑑𝐵𝑆𝑄d_{B}(S,Q) takes only finite values and becomes a well-defined wobbling distance , but remains discontinuous as shown below. Slightly perturb the basis (1,0),(0,1)1001(1,0),(0,1) of the integer lattice ℤ2superscriptℤ2\\mathbb{Z}^{2} to the basis vectors (1,0),(ε,1)10𝜀1(1,0),(\\varepsilon,1) of the new lattice ΛΛ\\Lambda.\nWe prove that dB​(Λ,ℤ2)≥13subscript𝑑𝐵Λsuperscriptℤ213d_{B}(\\Lambda,\\mathbb{Z}^{2})\\geq\\frac{1}{3} for any ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0.\nMap ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2} by ℤ2superscriptℤ2\\mathbb{Z}^{2}-translations to the unit square  [ref]12superscript012 [ref]1^{2} with identified opposite sides (a torus).\nThen the whole square lattice ℤ2superscriptℤ2\\mathbb{Z}^{2} is mapped to the single point represented by the corners of the square  [ref]12superscript012 [ref]1^{2}.\nThe perturbed lattice ΛΛ\\Lambda maps to the sequence of points {k​ε(mod1)}k=0+∞×{0,1}superscriptsubscriptannotated𝑘𝜀𝑝𝑚𝑜𝑑1𝑘001\\{k\\varepsilon\\pmod{1}\\}_{k=0}^{+\\infty}\\times\\{0,1\\} in the horizontal edges.\nIf dB​(Λ,ℤ2)=r<13subscript𝑑𝐵Λsuperscriptℤ2𝑟13d_{B}(\\Lambda,\\mathbb{Z}^{2})=r<\\frac{1}{3}, then all above points should be covered by the closed disks of the radius r𝑟r centered at the corners of  [ref]12superscript012 [ref]1^{2}.\nFor 0<ε<13−r0𝜀13𝑟0<\\varepsilon<\\frac{1}{3}-r, we can find k∈ℤ𝑘ℤk\\in\\mathbb{Z} so that k​ε𝑘𝜀k\\varepsilon is strictly between r,1−r𝑟1𝑟r,1-r, hence not covered by these disks, so dB​(Λ,ℤ2)≥13subscript𝑑𝐵Λsubscriptℤ213d_{B}(\\Lambda,\\mathbb{Z}_{2})\\geq\\frac{1}{3}.\n ■■\\blacksquare The discontinuity under perturbations is the major weakness of many past invariants including Voronoi diagrams, which should be matched via infinitely many rotations , space groups and other group-theoretic invariants .\nThe key example in Fig. 2 (right) shows that a continuous distance between nearly identical sets should be close to 0, not identically 0.\nThese sets have different symmetries and can be related only by pseudo-symmetries depending on manual thresholds 0. Recent methods of Periodic Geometry.\nFor any k≥1𝑘1k\\geq 1,\nthe k𝑘k-th density function ψk​(t)subscript𝜓𝑘𝑡\\psi_{k}(t) of a periodic point set S=Λ+M⊂ℝ3𝑆Λ𝑀superscriptℝ3S=\\Lambda+M\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{3} is the total volume of the regions within the unit cell U𝑈U of ΛΛ\\Lambda covered by exactly k𝑘k balls B​(p;t)𝐵𝑝𝑡B(p;t) with a radius t≥0𝑡0t\\geq 0 and centres at motif points p∈M𝑝𝑀p\\in M, divided by the unit cell volume Vol​[U]Voldelimited-[]𝑈\\mathrm{Vol}[U].\nThe density function ψk​(t)subscript𝜓𝑘𝑡\\psi_{k}(t) was proved in  to be invariant under isometry, continuous under perturbations, complete for periodic sets satisfying certain conditions of general position in ℝ3superscriptℝ3\\mathbb{R}^{3}, and computable in time O​(m​k3)𝑂𝑚superscript𝑘3O(mk^{3}), where m𝑚m is the motif size of S𝑆S.\nSection 5 in  gave the counter-example to completeness: the 1-dimensional periodic sets S15=X+Y+15​ℤsubscript𝑆15𝑋𝑌15ℤS_{15}=X+Y+15\\mathbb{Z} and Q15=X−Y+15​ℤsubscript𝑄15𝑋𝑌15ℤQ_{15}=X-Y+15\\mathbb{Z} for X={0,4,9}𝑋049X=\\{0,4,9\\} and Y={0,1,3}𝑌013Y=\\{0,1,3\\} [44, section 4] have the same density functions for all k≥1𝑘1k\\geq 1 [5, Example 10] but were distinguished in [33, Example 5b]. The latest advance  reduces the isometry classification of all periodic point sets to an isoset of isometry classes of α𝛼\\alpha-clusters around points in a motif at a certain radius α𝛼\\alpha, which was motivated by the seminal work of Dolbilin with co-authors about Delone sets   .\nThe continuous metrics on isosets [3, section 5] have only an approximate algorithm.\nDespite the progress in dimension 1  and lattices in dimension 2 9  and 3 8 , Problem 1.1 remains open in general.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: finite sets of points.\nThe fastest algorithm to test an isometry between m𝑚m-point sets in ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n} runs in time O​(m⌈n/3⌉​log⁡m)𝑂superscript𝑚𝑛3𝑚O(m^{\\lceil n/3\\rceil}\\log m) by\n[ref]12, which can be improved to O​(m​log⁡m)𝑂𝑚𝑚O(m\\log m) in ℝ4superscriptℝ4\\mathbb{R}^{4} .\nSignificant results on matching bounded rigid shapes and registration of finite point sets were obtained\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
