      "content": "Paper Title: End-to-End Hierarchical Relation Extraction for Generic Form Understanding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe visualize the final output by images in table II. The first and second row are input and the char-grid of images after pre-processing respectively. The result of model can be visualized in the O‚Äãu‚Äãt‚Äãp‚Äãu‚ÄãtùëÇùë¢ùë°ùëùùë¢ùë°Output row. As we can see, the H‚Äãe‚Äãa‚Äãt‚Äãm‚Äãa‚Äãpùêªùëíùëéùë°ùëöùëéùëùHeatmap row shows the entity locations through bottom-left points, while the output row shows the full results of our model. The header, question, and answer are drawn by yellow, green, and blue segmentation masks respectively. The linking between entities (if have) are visualized through orange lines.\nThese lines start from the bottom-left points of entities labeled as the answer to the bottom-left points of entities called the question. Our model has this ability because from keypoint detection of each entity, PAFs are likely to link these text-regions by using a directed vector. In order to benchmark the performance of our model, we evaluate it with other methods on FUNSD dataset [ref]5. All results are measured by F1-score. Entity Labeling Task\nTable¬†III shows the comparison between MSAU-PAF and the baselines.\nMSAU-PAF model achieves the highest F1-score 0.83, which significantly improves the accuracy compared to MLP [ref]5 the baseline model - MSAU [ref]9 by 0.26 and 0.1 respectively. On top of that, our model outperforms the state of the art LayoutLM [ref]17 by a large margin.\nThe improvement in accuracy hints that the supervision from Entity Linking can be one of the factors improving the accuracy of the model in comparison with segmentation-only supervision of MSAU [ref]9.\nIt is noted that the MLP baseline [ref]5 utilized a much more sophisticated pre-trained model than MSAU and MSAU-PAF (BERT  is proven to be state-of-the-arts in many tasks from the aforementioned paper in comparison with one-hot character encoding).\nThe improvement in MSAU and MSAU-PAF accuracy is potential because of the model making better use of spatial information and char-gird embeddings, as mentioned in [ref]9. Meanwhile, the LayoutLM mainly relies on the image embeddings via utilizing bounding box regions in the prior step, which appears to fail to capture well the spatial and relational information among entities. Entity Linking Task\nWith this task, MSAU-PAF continues outperforming other methods (see in Table¬†IV).\nIt is observable that the F1-score of GraphCNN and MLP baselines are low, this can be due to the effect of highly dense and imbalanced class distribution in conjunction with Deep-learning based matching. The low F1 scores come mainly from low precision (model predicts most of non-link for most of the pairs).\nThe same hypothesis has been made in the original paper [ref]5.\nIn contrast, the PIF-PAF heads could particularly handle well in densely and occluded documents via effectively encoding fine-grained information and confidently predicting confidence association between two entities with composite field structure.\nThis leads to 0.71 and 0.62 improvement in F1-score from MLP and GraphCNN with Link prediction respectively. It is noted that other baselines are assumed to already know the ground-truth of the class of entities, while our model only uses the text-line regions and optical character. Compared to the Heuristic method with Ground-truth entities class, the MSAU-PAF seems to have a little lower F1-score. This can be because of the use of the ground-truth label for each entity, while in the MSAU-PAF experiment, we combine both two tasks and the result is the joint probability of Entity Labeling and Entity Linking. The hypothesis is verified when we applied MSAU-PAF middle output as input to the heuristic rules.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: of each entity, PAFs are likely to link these text-regions by using a directed vector. In order to benchmark the performance of our model, we evaluate it with other methods on FUNSD dataset [ref]5. All results are measured by F1-score.
