      "content": "Paper Title: Fast Sequence Generation with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSequence generation tasks aim at generating a target sequence conditioning on a source input.\nStandard sequence generation tasks include neural machine translation [ref]1 [ref]2, image captioning ,\nand automatic speech recognition [ref]4 etc., where the targets are often sequences of words/tokens and the source inputs can be sentences, images, and speeches etc.\nRecent sequence generation models typically follow the encoder-decoder paradigm where an encoder encodes the input into vectorial representations,\nand a sequence decoder, e.g. recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or Transformer [ref]2, generates a sentence given the outputs of the encoder.\nMost of these models use autoregressive decoders that require sequential execution: they generate each word conditioned on the sequence of previously generated words.\nHowever, this process is not parallelizable and thus results in high inference latency,\nwhich is sometimes unaffordable for real-time industrial applications. Recently, non-autoregressive decoding was proposed in neural machine translation  to significantly improve\nthe inference speed by predicting all target words in parallel.\nA non-autoregressive model takes basically the same structure as the autoregressive Transformer network [ref]2.\nBut instead of conditioning the decoder on the previously generated words as in autoregressive models,\nthey generate all words independently, as illustrated in Figure 1.\nSuch models are typically optimized with the cross-entropy (XE) losses of individual words. However, existing non-autoregressive models still have a large gap in generation quality compared to their autoregressive counterparts, mainly due to their severe decoding inconsistency problem.\nFor example, in Figure 1, the caption generated by the non-autoregressive model has repeated words and incomplete content.\nA major reason for such performance degradation is\nthat the word-level XE based training objective cannot guarantee sentence-level consistency.\nThat is, the XE loss encourages the model to generate the golden word in each position\nbut does not consider the global consistency of the whole sentence.\nAlso, though the models are trained with XE loss, however, at test time, they are typically evaluated using non-differentiable test metrics such as\nCIDEr  or BLEU . This inconsistency in training time and test time objectives is undesirable and can cause suboptimal performance. To simultaneously reduce the inference time and improve the decoding consistency of sequence generation models,\nin this paper, we propose a Non-Autoregressive sequence Generation (NAG) method with a novel training paradigm:\nCounterfactuals-critical Multi-Agent Learning (CMAL).\nWe formulate NAG as a multi-agent reinforcement learning system,\nwhere element positions in the target sequence are viewed as agents and they act cooperatively to maximize a team reward about the quality of the whole sentence.\nCMAL optimizes the model with policy gradient algorithm and introduces a counterfactual baseline\nto address the multi-agent credit assignment  problem.\nAlso, we further boost the generation quality by augmenting the training data with massive unlabeled inputs.\nIn the following, We introduce each component. Specifically, our NAG model’s architecture is based on Transformer [ref]2 with the minimum necessary modifications.\nWe consider NAG decoder as a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)  system.\nIn this system, each agent observes the environment (the encoded visual context),\nand communicates with other agents through the self-attention layers in Transformer.\nAfter several rounds of environment observation and agent communication,\nthe agents reach an agreement about content planning of the target sentence and separately take actions to predict the words in their corresponding positions, which forms a joint action.\nThe agents then receive a common sentence-level team reward that is, for instance, the BLEU  score of the generated sentence.\nThe goal of the agents is to maximize the team reward and policy gradient is used to update their parameters.\nThis training paradigm has two benefits.\nFirst, the non-differentiable test metrics, e.g. BLEU  or CIDEr , could be directly optimized.\nSecond, by optimizing the agents towards a common sentence-level objective, the decoding consistency can be substantially improved. A crucial challenge in the above MARL training paradigm is multi-agent credit assignment :\nthe shared team reward makes it difficult for each agent to deduce its own contribution to the team’s success.\nThis could impede multi-agent learning and lead to decoding inconsistency.\nTo address this challenge, we compute an agent-specific advantage function that compares the team reward\nfor the joint action against an agent-wise counterfactual baseline  .\nThe individual counterfactual baseline of an agent is the expected reward when marginalizing out a single agent’s action, while keeping the other agents’ actions fixed.\nAs a result, only actions from an agent that outperform the counterfactual baseline are given positive weight,\nand inferior actions are suppressed.\nTo more precise credit assignment among agents, we further introduce a compositional counterfactual baseline as a supplement to the individual counterfactual baseline.\nIn the compositional counterfactual baseline, we treat two neighbouring agents as a compositional agent to take into account the joint influence of their actions on the team reward.\nThe counterfactual baseline fully exploits the distinctive features of the multi-agent NAG system, i.e. extremely short episode and large action space, and thereby is simple and easy to implement. To further boost generation quality, we propose to augment the training data with massive unlabeled inputs.\nThese unlabeled data could be easily acquired without costly human annotations.\nSpecifically, we use an autoregressive teacher model to produce target sequences for these unlabeled inputs,\nwhich are then used as pseudo paired data for training the non-autoregressive models. Compared to previous non-autoregressive models that often rely on specially designed submodules  ,\nour NAG method adds almost no extra components to the Transformer architecture.\nOwing to this structure simplicity, our model can maximize the decoding speedup.\nWe evaluate the proposed non-autoregressive sequence generation method on two distinctive sequence generation tasks, i.e. image captioning and neural machine translation.\nOn MSCOCO image captioning benchmark, our method brings 13.9×13.9\\times decoding speedup relative to the autoregressive counterpart,\nwhile achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art autoregressive models.\nOn the more challenging WMT14 EN-DE machine translation dataset, our method significantly outperforms the cross-entropy trained baseline by 6.06.06.0 BLEU points while achieves a greatest decoding speedup of 17.46×17.46\\times. To summarize, the main contributions of this paper are four-fold: We propose a non-autoregressive sequence generation method with a novel training paradigm:\ncounterfactuals-critical multi-Agent learning.\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formulate non-autoregressive sequence generation\nas a cooperative multi-agent learning problem. We design individual and compositional counterfactual baselines to disentangle the contribution of each agent from the team reward. We propose to utilize massive unlabeled data to boost the performance of non-autoregressive models. Extensive experiments on image captioning and machine translation tasks show that\nour method significantly outperforms previous cross-entropy trained non-autoregressive models while brings the greatest decoding speedup.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Sequence generation tasks aim at generating a target sequence conditioning on a source input.\nStandard sequence generation tasks include neural machine translation [ref]1 [ref]2, image captioning ,\nand automatic speech recognition [ref]4 etc., where the targets are often sequences of words/tokens and the source inputs can be sentences, images, and speeches\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
