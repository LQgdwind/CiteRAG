      "content": "Paper Title: Curvature-based Feature Selection with Application in Classifying Electronic Health Records\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDisruptive technologies (DTs), including Industry 4.0, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Big Data, the Internet of Things (IoT), Virtual Reality (VR), etc., are innovations that significantly alters the way that consumers, industries or businesses operate . Among those disruptive technologies, AI and ML are powerful tools to make computers learn and mimic human’s thinking, and thus to help analyse the huge amount of medical data to identify potential health issues, such as  [ref]3. Due to the era of big data, large amounts of high-dimensional data have become available in a variety of domains, especially within the realm of digital healthcare . The dramatically increased data volume has become a challenge for effective and efficient data analysis, as it significantly increases the memory storage requirement and computational costs . To improve the quality of patient care more efficiently, Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are widely employed in the healthcare facilities for analysis. Currently, maintenance of such EHRs has become a crucial task in the medical sector. Patients’ digital healthcare data is usually highly unstructured and consists of various features and diagnostics-related information. In addition, EHR data may include missing values and a certain degree of redundancy. Due to the incompleteness, imbalance, inherent heterogeneity, and high-dimensional features of EHRs, it is essential to apply disruptive technologies to provide effective and low-cost data analysis methods, and thus to explore such healthcare data for data mining and data analytics purposes. Dimensionality reduction is an efficient data preprocessing technique for the analysis of high-dimensional data that aims to reduce the number of features while improving the classification performance (e.g. treatment planning [ref]6, survival analysis [ref]7, and risk prediction ) and reducing the related computational cost . It is important to identify the most significant factors that related to disease, which helps in removing unnecessary and redundant data from the given data sets, thus increasing the data analysis performance. The selection is usually achieved by either projecting the original data into a lower feature space, a.k.a. feature extraction 0, or selecting a subset of features from the original data, i.e. feature selection 1. For the latter, the least relevant features that are required to be removed can be identified by two criteria: a) features that are not correlated with any other features (i.e. redundancy); b) features that do not contribute to the classification decision (i.e. noise). It is well-known that the dimensionality reduction-based feature extraction approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), reduces the number of features by mapping the original data set into a new feature space with lower dimensions, which changes or removes the physical meanings of original features. For instance, a low-complexity algorithm, which is developed based on Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), for electrocardiogram (ECG) data feature extraction, is proposed in 2. In addition, to deal with the text classification problems, the Latent Semantic Index (LSI) 3 and PCA algorithms have been employed to extract the text feature and have achieved good results 4. In contrast, methods of selecting a subset of features keep the physical meanings of the original features and enable models with better interpretability, but the underlying complexity of the subset evaluation metric may lead to unnecessary computational cost 5. For example, a time series feature selection method is proposed to filter the available features with respect to their significance for the regression task 6. This motivates us to design an efficient selection-based feature selection method that could meet the requirement of the real-time system in the era of big data. Recently, pervasive healthcare has become a central topic which has attracted intensive attention from academia, industry, as well as healthcare sectors 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4. In this problem domain, highly class-imbalanced data sets with a large number of missing values are common problems 5. It has been proved that the selected features might have a higher degree of usefulness in comparison with the projected features, due to preservation of the original semantics of the dimensions  1. Thus, we focus on selecting a sub-set of features, even using the anonymised data set (e.g. one possible reason for having the missing attribute values could be that the participants or patients are reluctant to share personally identifiable information with the public 5), for efficient medical data classification. Based on the aforementioned two motivations, we address the issues of time complexity and efficiency in an intuitive, explainable fashion in this work. Our contribution is two-fold: A filter-based feature selection method, called Curvature-based Feature Selection (CFS), is proposed to select discriminative attributes in line with the ranked and averaged curvature values for each dimension in the given EHR data set. The presented CFS approach is also embedded into a previously proposed fuzzy inference system, TSK+ 6 7, to constitute CFS-TSK+, for supporting better decision-making of clinical diagnosis, i.e. improving the performance of classifying digital healthcare data. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 expresses the related works. Section 3 proposes our CFS approach and CFS-TSK+ classifier. Section 4 discusses the experimental results, and the paper is concluded in Section 5.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: technologies, AI and ML are powerful tools to make computers learn and mimic human’s thinking, and thus to help analyse the huge amount of medical data to identify potential health issues, such as  [ref]3.
