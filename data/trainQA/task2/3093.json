      "content": "Paper Title: Handling Inter-class and Intra-class Imbalance in Class-imbalanced Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs mentioned earlier, the vast majority of existing IL solutions fall into this category.\nThey can be divided into two regimes: resampling and reweighting.\nResampling methods focus on directly modifying the training set to balance the class distribution (e.g., over-sampling    and under-sampling    ).\nBeyond the naïve solutions, previous efforts have adopted different heuristics to guide their resampling process.\nFor example,   aim to generate or keep instances that are close to the borderline/overlap area.\nBut on the contrary,    consider examples located in the overlap zone to be detrimental to learning, and therefore discard them from the trainig set.\nSuch methods often rely on exploring distance-based neighborhood information, e.g., Smote over-sampling  and its variants   0, many denoising under-sampling techniques   , as well as their hybrid usages   .\nOn the other hand, Reweighting approaches assign different misclassification costs to different classes (e.g., cost-sensitive learning  [ref]15), thus forcing the model to focus on the pattern of minority classes. However, these methods do not explicitly account for inter-class and intra-class imbalances in their design, and suffer from unsatisfactory performance, high computational cost, and poor applicability.\nDistance-based resampling requires a well-defined distance metric, which may not be available in practice since the data may contain categorical features and missing values [ref]19.\nMoreover, some of these algorithms run extremely slow on large-scale datasets as the cost of calculating the distance between each instances grows quadratically with the size of the dataset.\nReweighting, i.e., cost-sensitive learning, often requires targeted modifications to the learning algorithms .\nMore importantly, in most cases, it is difficult to obtain an appropriate cost matrix given by domain experts 1.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: techniques   , as well as their hybrid usages   .\nOn the other hand, Reweighting approaches assign different misclassification costs to different classes (e.g., cost-sensitive learning  [ref]15), thus forcing the model to focus on the pattern of minority classes. However, these methods do not explicitly account for inter-class and intra-class imbalances in their design, and suffer\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
