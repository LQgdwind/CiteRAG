      "content": "Paper Title: Co-Design of Approximate Multilayer Perceptron for Ultra-Resource Constrained Printed Circuits\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA trillion-dollar market of fast moving consumer goods (FMCG), disposables such as beverages, packaged foods, and toiletries, low-end healthcare products (e.g., smart bandages), etc., have seen limited impact from embedded computing .\nAlthough for several of these domains, a typically required computational task is classification , such applications pose requirements for sub-cent costs, non-toxicity, porosity, stretchability, and conformity that silicon-based computing systems cannot satisfy.\nPrinted Electronics establish as a key solution to enable such applications. Printed electronics indicates a set of printing techniques that can realize ultra low-cost , large scale  and flexible hardware .\nPrinted electronics cannot compete with silicon-based electronics in integration density, area, or speed, mainly due to large feature sizes arising from low-cost and low-resolution printing.\n\nThe typical operating frequency of printed circuits is from a few Hz to a few kHz .\nSimilarly, the feature size tends to be several microns [ref]7.\n\nNevertheless, due to its form-factor, conformity, and most importantly ultra-low fabrication costs of the additive manufacturing processes, that enable hardware on-demand even at very low quantities, printed electronics can target application domains untouchable by silicon VLSI.\nHowever, their large feature sizes and high intrinsic transistor gate capacitances result in elevated power and area compared to nanometer technologies.\n\nAdditionally, the integration density of printed circuits is orders of magnitude lower compared to silicon systems, prohibiting thus the realization of complex circuits.\nFor example, a printed\nMAC (multiply–accumulate) unit –core of most machine learning (ML) circuits– is six orders of magnitude larger than the CMOS one, while its power consumption is 8x higher . Since low-cost embedded ML systems are usually task-specific and in order to address the aforementioned limitations, there is the opportunity of generating model-specific ML circuits that are more efficient compared to general-purpose ones.\nLeveraging the potential for high customization, offered by the low-fabrication costs of printed circuits, \ndesigned bespoke ML circuits.\nThe term bespoke refers to fully-customized, even per ML model and dataset, circuit implementations.\n\nStill,  examined only simple ML models (e.g., Decision Tree) rather than complex Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) that they pose infeasible hardware overheads for the ultra-resource constrained printed circuits.\nThereby, works on printed ML designs are limited. Fortunately, approximate computing (AC) can be employed to reduce the associated hardware overheads at the cost of some accuracy loss.\nExploiting the inherent error resilience of a large number of application domains, e.g., ML, AC relaxes the accuracy of some computations and achieves improvements in hardware metrics such as area and power.\n\nThe authors in , designed for the first time approximate printed ML classifiers.\nThrough post-training algorithmic weight-approximation and hardware-level gate-pruning,  generates printed ML circuits with high area and power gains.\nHowever, as in , authors in  deduced that the hardware overheads of MLPs are prohibitive for printed circuits and additional optimizations are still required.\n In this work, we embrace the bespoke design paradigm, enhance it with AC, and propose an automated co-design framework for approximate printed MLP circuits.\nLeveraging the observation that the area of bespoke MLP circuits is intrinsically correlated to the MLP’s coefficients, we propose a printing-friendly MLP retraining that selects area-efficient coefficients and achieves 3.33.33.3x lower area, on average, over 101010 MLPs.\nBy printing-friendly retraining we refer to a bespoke hardware-aware retrain technique, suitable for ultra-resource constrained ML circuits such as our targeted printed ones.\n\nOur approach can be seamlessly extended to any printed ML circuit with trainable coefficients.\nThough, we focus on MLPs since they constitute the most complex ML classifier for printed applications .\nFinally,\nin order to further optimize the resource efficiency of our circuits,\nwe also approximate the summation of the neuron’s products by systematically keeping the most relevant bits and discarding the rest.\nOverall, compared to the exact bespoke baseline, we achieve, on average, 666x (5.75.75.7x) area (power) reduction with less than 1% accuracy loss. Our novel contributions within this work are as follows: This is the first work that proposes, implements, and evaluates a software/hardware co-design for printed MLPs while approximating both multiplication and addition operations. We propose a printing-friendly ML retraining technique. Our evaluation shows that our framework paves the way, for the first time, towards highly accurate battery powered MLPs, suitable for ultra-resource constrained printed applications111Our implementations are available at https://github.com/garmeniakos/Ax-Printed-ML-Classifiers.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: sizes arising from low-cost and low-resolution printing.\n\nThe typical operating frequency of printed circuits is from a few Hz to a few kHz .\nSimilarly, the feature size tends to be several microns [ref]7.\n\nNevertheless, due to its form-factor, conformity, and most importantly ultra-low fabrication costs of the additive manufacturing processes, that enable hardware on-demand even at very low\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
