      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Attention-guided Graph Clustering with Dual Self-supervision\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe conducted experiments on one image dataset (USPS ), one text dataset (Reuters ), one record dataset (HHAR ), and six graph datasets (ACM222http://dl.acm.org, CiteSeer333http://CiteSeerx.ist.psu.edu/, DBLP444https://dblp.uni-trier.de, Amazon Photo, PubMed, and AIDS), which are briefly summarized in Table II. We compared the proposed method with the classic clustering method K-means , three DAE-based embedding clustering methods   [ref]15, and seven GCN-based embedding clustering methods [ref]20 [ref]21     , the details of which are listed as follows. DAE  uses deep auto-encoder to learn latent feature representations and then performs K-means on that feature to obtain clustering results. DEC  jointly conducts embedding learning and cluster assignment with an iterative procedure. IDEC [ref]15 introduces a reconstruction loss into DEC to improve the clustering performance. GAE [ref]20 and VGAE [ref]20 incorporate DAE and variational DAE into GCN frameworks, respectively. DAEGC  achieves a neighbor-wise embedding learning with an attention-driven strategy and supervises the network training with a clustering loss. ARGA [ref]21 guides embedding learning with a designed adversarial regularization. SDCN  fuses DEC and GCN to merge the topological structure information into deep embedding clustering. AGCN  focuses on enhancing the embedding learning. DFCN  merges the node attribute and topological structure information based on the DAE and GAE. AGCC  replaces the graph layer by layer to mine the latent connected relationship between data.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: Amazon Photo, PubMed, and AIDS), which are briefly summarized in Table II.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
