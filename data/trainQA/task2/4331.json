Among these, the CNN accelerators employ PIC-based TPCs to perform CNN tensor products. Some accelerators implement digital TPCs (e.g.,  ), whereas some others employ analog TPCs (e.g.,    [ref]17). Different TPC implementations employ MRRs (e.g.,     [ref]34) or MZIs (e.g.,  [ref]14 ) or both (e.g., ). The analog TPCs can be further classified as incoherent (e.g.,   ) or coherent (e.g.,       ). To set and update the values of the individual input and kernel tensors used for tensor products, the incoherent TPCs utilize the analog optical signal power, whereas the coherent TPCs utilize the electrical field amplitude and phase. The coherent TPCs achieve low inference latency, but they suffer from control complexity, high area overhead, low scalability, low flexibility, high encoding noise, and phase error accumulation issues . In contrast, the incoherent TPCs based accelerators achieve better scalability and lower footprint, because they use MRR-based compact PICs , unlike the coherent TPCs that use MZI-based bulky PICs. Various state-of-the-art photonic CNN accelerators are well discussed in a survey paper . Because of the inherent advantages of MRR-enabled incoherent TPCs, there is impetus to design more energy-efficient and scalable CNN accelerators employing MRR-enabled incoherent TPCs. However, the CNN accelerators from prior works have mainly focused on designing their constituent TPCs only for the standard convolutional layers of CNNs. Prior works have paid very little attention to accelerate the processing of the depthwise separable convolutional layers of CNNs. In this paper, we contribute towards making the MRR-enabled incoherent TPCs more efficient by enabling them to dynamically adapt to process the standard convolutional and depthwise separable convolutional layers of CNNs.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: To accelerate machine learning tasks with low latency and low energy consumption, prior works have proposed various accelerators based on Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) (e.g.,      [ref]14  ).
