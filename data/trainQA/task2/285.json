      "content": "Paper Title: Beyond the Nav-Graph: Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLanguage-guided Visual Navigation Tasks. Language-guided visual navigation tasks require agents to follow navigation directions in simulated environments. There have been a number of recent tasks proposed in this space [ref]4 [ref]6 [ref]20 . Chen et al. [ref]6 introduce the Touchdown task which studies outdoor language-guided navigation in Google Street View panoramas. Hermann et al.  investigates the same setting; however, the instructions are automatically generated from Google Map directions rather than being crowdsourced from human annotators. Both adopt a nav-graph setting due to the source data being panoramic images – constraining agent navigation to fixed points. Misra et al. [ref]20 introduce a simulated environment with unconstrained navigation and a dataset of crowdsourced instructions; however, the environments are unrealistic, synthetic scenes. Most related to our work is the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task of Anderson et al. [ref]4. VLN provides nav-graph trajectories and crowdsourced instructions in Matterport3D  environments as the Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset. We build VLN-CE directly on these annotations – converting R2R panorama-based trajectories to fine-grained paths in continuous Matterport3D environments (Fig. 1(a) to Fig. 1(b)). As outlined in the introduction, this shift to continuous environments with unconstrained agent navigation lifts a number of unrealistic assumptions. The variation in these tasks is primarily in the source of navigation instructions (crowdsourced from human annotators vs. generated via template), environment realism (hand-designed synthetic worlds vs. captures from real locations), and constraints on agent navigation (nav-graph based navigation vs. unconstrained agent motion). Tab. 1 provides a comparison between tasks along these axes. Our proposed VLN-CE task provides the first setting with crowdsourced instructions in realistic environments with unconstrained agent navigation. Approaches to Vision-and-Language Navigation. VLN has seen considerable progress from a wide variety of techniques. Multimodal attention mechanisms have become popular to provide better grounding between instructions and the visual scene observation . Orthogonal to new modeling architectures, improvements have also come from new training approaches and data augmentation methods. One prevalent technique is to utilize inverse “speaker” models to re-rank candidate trajectories or augment the available training data by generating instructions for novel trajectories . Tan et al.  further improve upon this idea by masking a subset of visual features during the speaker’s instruction generation process, thereby improving the diversity of the generated instructions. Ma et al.  show that an additional training signal can be gained by explicitly estimating progress toward the goal (referred to as self-monitoring). We adapt these methods to VLN-CE and examine their impact – finding mixed results. Multimodal attention remains a useful structure; however, speaker-based data augmentation and self-monitoring losses provide mixed results. Other Language-based Embodied AI. A number of other embodied tasks have considered language-conditioned navigation. For instance, referring to specific rooms or objects that agents must then navigate to   . However, these settings use language to specify end-goals or query agent knowledge rather than to provide navigational directions. For example, specifying “lamp” or “What color is the lamp in the living room?” rather than “Go down the hall and into the bedroom on the right. Stop by the lamp to the left of the bed.” This loose coupling of intermediate agent action with the language instruction differentiates these tasks from language-guided navigation settings.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Navigation Tasks.
