      "content": "Paper Title: Client-side Gradient Inversion Against Federated Learning from Poisoning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFederated Learning (FL)    is an emerging distributed learning framework. It allows multiple clients or participants (e.g., private mobile devices or IoT devices) to join the federated training collaboratively and improve model generalization without sharing their private data. Specifically, the clients can train the distributed model on their private datasets locally and submit the local model or gradient to the server, then the server will aggregate these updates using an aggregation algorithm (AGR). Recent studies have highlighted the vulnerability of federated learning (FL) to gradient inversion adversaries, who aim to reconstruct private local training data by exploiting the gradients shared during the FL process.\nOne common strategy employed by gradient inversion attacks is to optimize random noise in order to approximate the true gradient and subsequently reconstruct the original input data     [ref]36  [ref]32   [ref]15. However, existing gradient inversion attacks (GIAs) against FL exhibit the following limitations:\n Many existing GIAs necessitate control over the server to launch the attack  [ref]36 [ref]32  . However, in real-world scenarios, gaining control over the server is often challenging as it is typically heavily secured to prevent unauthorized access.\nMoreover, if the AGR operates in the encrypted domain , all server-side existing GIAs would fail.\nTherefore, client-side GIAs gain greater significance. However, the efficacy of such attacks   [ref]36 remains limited to unrealistically small batch sizes.  Existing GIAs also rely on strong prior knowledge or specific information to achieve their objectives. For instance, GradInversion [ref]36 requires access to batch normalization information, while generative-based methods [ref]15   utilize the distribution of the training data as prior knowledge for the adversary. These requirements for strong prior knowledge or specific information in GIAs restrict their applicability and effectiveness in real-world settings, where adversaries often have limited access to such privileged information. Some GIAs necessitate altering the model structure or parameters, potentially leading to unintended consequences. For instance, some methods require the adversary to manipulate the training process in a way that traps clients into a predetermined status preferred by the adversary  [ref]32. However, this alteration can negatively impact the main task performance or even disrupt the entire training framework . In this work, we propose the first  Client-side poisoning Gradient Inversion attack (CGI). In our CGI, the adversary first creates a malicious model that amplifies the loss of a specific targeted class of interest on a local level. The adversary can then utilize this malicious model to poison the global model from the client side. When honest clients employ the poisoned global model, the gradients of samples belonging to the targeted class are magnified. As a result, the targeted gradient becomes the dominant factor in the aggregated update, allowing the adversary to effectively reconstruct the targeted private input belonging to other clients using the aggregated update.\nAs such, our CGI is capable of successfully inverting gradients with larger batch sizes. Additionally, CGI is designed to function without any prior knowledge. Even if the adversary lacks information about the data distribution, they can still recover private data. Furthermore, our CGI aligns with the general training framework of FL and maintains the performance of the main task while carrying out the attack. Another highlight of CGI is its ability to remain stealthy even when confronted with server-side defense measures, specifically Byzantine-robust AGRs which aim to identify and filter out malicious updates by analyzing the distribution of updates   and/or their performance on the validation dataset  . We develop an effective method for optimizing malicious updates by disguising them as benign updates. This involves blending the benign update with a malicious replacement vector. The attacker can fine-tune the mixing hyper-parameters to accelerate the poisoning process or enhance the update’s stealthiness against Byzantine-robust AGRs. We also consider our CGI in a range of diverse FL settings where the adversary’s knowledge about data can vary significantly. We consider three distinct levels of knowledge based on the data distribution information: i) Full Knowledge: In this setting, the adversary possesses the knowledge of the data distribution across all classes. ii) Semi Knowledge: The adversary only has access to the data distribution information specifically for the targeted class. iii) No Knowledge: In this scenario, the adversary lacks any prior knowledge regarding the data distribution of any class. Our results demonstrate that CGI poses a high risk against FL.\nWe conducted a comprehensive evaluation of CGI using three benchmark datasets and tested it against four representative Byzantine-robust AGRs across various levels of knowledge. Our results show that CGI consistently and successfully extracts training input in all scenarios, surpassing the performance of existing GIAs. Notably, even in a scenario where the adversary possesses no prior knowledge, CGI can successfully restore the training samples from batch sizes of 32 while the baselines only yield noise without any meaningful semantic features.\nOnce given extra knowledge, a boost in performance is observed. The contributions of our work are summarized as follows: We propose a new GIA, which is the first client-side gradient inversion attack capable of reconstructing another client’s training sample from a large batch. It eliminates the strong assumption on the prior knowledge. Furthermore, CGI follows the general training framework without necessitating any modifications to the model structure or parameters and maintains normal performance on the main task at hand while executing the attack. Our CGI demonstrates the ability to evade detection by the Byzantine-robust AGRs. We reduce the attack into an optimization problem that maximizes the adversarial impact on the victim training samples while ensuring that the malicious updates remain disguised. CGI can effectively generate malicious local updates while remaining camouflaged within the normal training data.\n We evaluate our CGI under a comprehensive threat model including real-world attack scenarios considering different knowledge that adversary can obtain through FL. The results demonstrate the strength of the proposed CGI, showcasing its ability to succeed under different knowledge scenarios and reinforcing its effectiveness in practical settings.\n We release the source code and the artifact at https://github.com/clientSideGIA/CGI, which creates a new tool for the GIA arsenal to facilitate future studies in this area.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: FL process.\nOne common strategy employed by gradient inversion attacks is to optimize random noise in order to approximate the true gradient and subsequently reconstruct the original input data     [ref]36  [ref]32   [ref]15.
