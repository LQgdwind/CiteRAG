We also compare our method against a meta-learning-based upsampling approach, namely Meta-PU . We apply our framework with several different backbone networks, including PU-GCN [ref]11, Dis-PU , and PU-Dense [ref]13. The comparison is shown in Table I. All methods are trained on the ShapeNet dataset  using the same experimental setup for a fair comparison. As shown in Table I, our method achieves a significant performance improvement on three backbones [ref]11  [ref]13 across all the evaluation metrics with a good margin. More importantly, our method with PU-Dense [ref]13 as the backbone outperforms all other state-of-the-art methods. Notably, we observe that the performance improvement on the 8iVFB dataset  and Semantic3D.net dataset  is more significant than the ShapeNet dataset . This demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in boosting the generalization capability of models to unseen test data by enabling the networks to utilize the internal features of point clouds at test time. Besides quantitative results, we present upsampling qualitative comparisons in Figure 2 and Figure 3. In most cases, the upsampled point clouds of our method are more uniform, less noisy, and preserve edge sharpness.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: We compare the proposed method with five state-of-the-art upsampling methods: MPU [ref]9, PU-GAN , PU-GCN [ref]11, Dis-PU , and PU-Dense [ref]13.
