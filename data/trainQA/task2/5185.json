      "content": "Paper Title: Equivalence Between SE(3) Equivariant Networks via Steerable Kernels and Group Convolution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe recent development of 3D deep learning has raised new challenges in manipulating and analyzing 3D data. The pose of 3D objects or the choice coordinate frame used to describe them is critical to the performance of many algorithms. Initially, algorithms were tested on datasets of aligned objects with consistent pose  . The observation of a generalization gap to arbitrary poses motivated the development of algorithms which are robust to change of position and orientation. Another motivation comes from physics. Physical laws are invariant to the choice of coordinates used to represent the physical phenomena; therefore, algorithms for learning physics should share the same behavior across different coordinate systems. This is formalized by the notion of equivariance. Intuitively a map is equivariant if its output changes in a predictable manner given a transformation of its input. In practice, this allows to obtain the same behavior under a transformation of the input, greatly improving the efficiency of learning. Given a group G𝐺G acting on two sets A,B𝐴𝐵A,B, we say that a map F:A→B:𝐹→𝐴𝐵F:A\\rightarrow B is equivariant to the action of G𝐺G (G𝐺G-equivariant) if for all g∈G𝑔𝐺g\\in G acting on the input x∈A𝑥𝐴x\\in A of F𝐹F there is a corresponding action of g𝑔g on the output F​(x)∈B𝐹𝑥𝐵F(x)\\in B which is independent from x𝑥x, i.e. for all g∈G,x∈Aformulae-sequence𝑔𝐺𝑥𝐴g\\in G,x\\in A we have F(g.x)=g.F(x)F(g.x)=g.F(x). We are typically interested in the case where F𝐹F is a neural network with learnable parameters. A practical way to achieve equivariance is through convolution. For instance convolutional layers for image processing are equivariant to translation, this is also known as the weight sharing property. Image CNNs processes all regions of the image in the same way, and this property is often attributed as fundamental to their success. In addition to translation equivariance, as mentioned above, for 3D data, one is often interested in developing methods that would be equivariant under changes of orientation in 3D space. To address this challenge, in recent years many approaches have been developed for rotation equivariance of signals in 3D\n[ref]3 [ref]4   [ref]7   0 1 2 3. Broadly, there exist two main classes of methods for designing rotationally equivariant neural networks for 3D data. The first option, 3D Steerable Convolution, which we review in Section 4.3, is to operate directly over 3D signals in a convolution fashion relying on the concept of steerable kernel bases 4. The idea is to achieve SE​(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3)-equivariance (translation and rotation) by inheriting translation equivariance from convolution and rotation equivariance from the steerable basis. This has been investigated in [ref]7 for voxel grids and in [ref]3 [ref]4 for point-clouds. Alternatively rather than manipulating signals over the 3D data it is also possible to consider functions defined over the group G𝐺G to which we want to be equivariant. In this context, a natural way to achieve G𝐺G-equivariance, used in several recent works\n  3 is through group convolution which we review in Section 3. This operation generalizes convolution to arbitrary groups and is deeply related to equivariance. Remarkably, these two approaches are known to be equivalent by specialists of equivariant deep learning. Namely, steerable convolution can be seen as a Fourier transform of group convolution. For example, the equivalence in the SE​(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3) case is stated without proof in the slides by E. Bekkers 5 (Slide 94) and discussed briefly in the associated courses notes by 6 (Section 5.2).\nNevertheless, despite the existence of such results, to the best of our knowledge there is a lack of dedicated treatment with explicit proofs regarding the exact relation between SE​(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3)-equivariant architectures. Furthermore, these equivalence results do not seem to be currently known to the broader audience, and especially practitioners that have designed a wide range of alternative equivariant deep learning architectures for 3D point clouds. In particular recent works proposing SE​(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3)-group convolution architecture do not mention this equivalence  3. Our main goal, therefore, is to make these results both more explicit and more accessible to a broader audience interested in equivariant deep learning. In this work we provide a detailed proof and analysis of the equivalence between steerable convolution and group convolution in the case of SE​(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3), as well as explicit formulas to translate expressions and filters between the two representations in 4.4. We have not seen this translation formulas explicitly stated in equivariant networks literature. These results may not be surprising to specialists. Nevertheless we aim to establish and convey these theoretical observations to a broader audience, interested designing equivariant networks, as they show the relations and equivalence of different approaches. Our discussion is general and applies to both the continuous setting of signals defined over ℝ3superscriptℝ3\\mathbb{R}^{3} or SE​(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3) but also to the discrete setting when dealing with data represented as point clouds. Furthermore, our analysis allows to express different alternative approaches using a single coherent formalism and provide explicit formulas relating different methods. Finally, this theoretical equivalence allows us to define and interpret practical choices of non-linearities (Section 4.5) within existing frameworks that we evaluate on real benchmark datasets in Section 5.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: methods that would be equivariant under changes of orientation in 3D space.
