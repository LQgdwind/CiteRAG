      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Dynamic Movement Primitives - a survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe first formulations of dynamic movement primitives were thought of as second-order differential equations to encode motion properties. Nevertheless, greater flexibility was introduced through the use of some learning components. [ref]30 developed a model that combined Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Mixture Regression in order to learn a single Dynamic Movement Primitive from multiple demonstrations. A Neural Network controller to account for the influence of payloads on the movement dynamics and keep track of the reference trajectory modeled in joint space.\nFurthermore,  described the use of composite Dynamic Movement Primitives to learn manipulation skills while taking into account position and orientation constraints and the use of Neural Networks to approximate the forcing term describing the time-dependent process. While such representations have been helpful to represent movements, it has been also noted that the relationship between the Dynamic Movement Primitives’ parameters and the configuration or task space is not evident, resulting in a lack of generalization on such spaces [ref]27. Bitzer et al.  found that Dynamic Movement Primitives’ parameters can directly relate to task variables when learned in latent spaces obtained when reducing the dimensionality of trajectories. This enables Dynamic Movement Primitives to better adapt to new task requirements, regardless of the task parameters. While in the aforementioned research, the dimensionality reduction was performed through a Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model, a similar approach was later attempted using autoencoders. Among the advantages of autoencoders, we find the ability to extract non-linear relationships between features and robustness to data, which does not follow a Gaussian distribution. Chen et al. [ref]27, fitted the Dynamic Movement Primitives into an autoencoder (AE-DMP) and forced the model to learn movements in the feature space, avoiding hand-engineered features. They explored using two types of autoencoders: a basic autoencoder and a denoising autoencoder. While the basic autoencoder consists of an encoder and decoder networks, the denoising autoencoder corrupts the input during the training process and learns to successfully reconstruct the corrupted input into the expected output. They found that using data corresponding to multiple motions, the AE-DMP could switch motions and even generate motions not present among the training examples, based on existing ones. Using a sparse AE-DMP provides an additional advantage: hidden units are only rarely active, so their activation can be considered a source of explainability. A similar approach was followed by Chen et al. [ref]33, who used Deep Variational Bayes Filtering to embed DMPs into the latent space. Deep Variational Bayes Filtering learns a model with a fixed prior and simultaneously approximates an intractable posterior distribution with an approximate variational distribution, minimizing the Kullback–Leibler divergence. Furthermore, they simultaneously learn transitions to shape the latent space, backpropagating errors through time. Transitions over time and the approximate intractable posterior distribution are learned with a neural network, leveraging the fact that neural networks can work as universal function approximators . The results show that the framework enables the representation of movements in a low-dimensional latent space, with excellent generalization properties and achieving optimal movements when reproducing the movements. While the authors mentioned above focused on learning movement transitions,  developed an approach to predict future intended movements. Such prediction is of utmost importance in use cases such as robot collaboration and the detection of unhealthy movements in assistive technologies. The number of observations can vary for each case for the task at hand. Given the prediction, computation time increases quadratically with the size of data used to represent the Probabilistic Movement Primitives (ProMP), dimensionality reduction techniques can reduce the ProMPs vector size and thus achieve better computation times. The authors demonstrated that such an approach strongly reduced the computational time required to issue a prediction, making such a method suitable for real-time applications.\nWhile most of the aforementioned authors focused on representing Dynamic Movement Primitives in a latent space, Noseworthy et al.  focused on how such representations can be achieved by differentiating task and manner parameters. This direction of research was previously explored for classical Dynamic Movement Primitives by Matsubara et al. . Noseworthy et al., on the other side, developed a Task-Conditioned Variational Autoencoder (TC-VAE), which conditions task parameters when learning from demonstrations, while an adversarial loss and an auxiliary network are used to train the encoder and ensure no information regarding the task parameters is encoded. By doing so, they achieved an interpretable, latent Dynamic Movement Primitive representation, which can generalize to task instances unseen during the training time. The conditioning of Neural Movement Primitives was also explored by Seker et al.  who developed a framework for movement learning and generation (Conditional Neural Movement Primitives) built on top of Conditional Neural Processes. The framework sampled observations from the training set to learn conditional distributions regarding the target points. Then it learned temporal sensorimotor relations related to external parameters (e.g., sensor readings at each time step) and goals to generate trajectories and execute them gathering input from a feedback loop. The fact that sensor readings at each time step are considered, it enables the Conditional Neural Movement Primitives to detect unexpected events and change the movement trajectory as required. The applicability of Conditional Neural Movement Primitives was improved by , who coupled the Conditional Neural Movement Primitives with Reinforcement Learning to exploit formed latent representations and generate synthetic demonstrations that enable further learning. The Reinforcement Learning agent was triggered when a task was not properly executed so that a new trajectory could be learned from the most recent demonstration, leveraging shared characteristics with the original demonstrations. This way, the system learned to cope with new situations not contemplated in the original training set. The Conditional Neural Movement Primitives were also successfully applied to whole human body motion learning, where from a few motions, they were able to generate close to perfect trajectories of different body parts . Akbulut et al.  further developed the aforementioned work, who developed a framework named Adaptive Conditional Neural Movement Primitives to learn the distribution of input movement trajectories conditioned on the user set task parameters. The authors used an encoder-decoder network to represent the movement trajectories in a latent space. Such movements were learned from demonstrations and adapted to new trajectories or robots given new demonstrations, or Reinforcement Learning guided actions. A refined version of the framework was described in , where a novel reward conditioned neural movement primitive was proposed to generate trajectories by sampling from the latent space conditioned on rewards. An encoder-decoder architecture was used to learn the distribution of trajectory points over time and the corresponding rewards to output a trajectory as a function of time. While the authors mentioned above focused on finding means to learn Dynamic Movement Primitives from demonstrated trajectories, Pervez et al.  designed task parameterized Dynamic Movement Primitives (TP-DMPs) which can adapt learned skills to different situations leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to gather input from camera images. This architecture enables them to gather task parameters directly from such images and eventually generalize skills to arbitrary objects through data augmentation. The architecture has an input layer for the image and several layers to transform the image to feature task parameters. These are concatenated to a clock signal and passed to fully connected layers, which output the forcing terms. Following this same line of study, Gams et al.  proposed an image-to-motion encoder-decoder network to map raw images to Dynamic Movement Primitives. The architecture consisted of fully-connected layers only and was tested on the MNIST dataset111The MNIST dataset is available at the following URL: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. The results showed that handwriting movements for digits could be reconstructed from raw images of digits. Ridge et al.  extended this work with two different architectures (IMED-Net (fully-connected), and CIMED-Net (convolutional)). Among the central problems faced by researchers working on Deep Learning is data availability. Droniou et al.  addressed this issue by using as little prior knowledge as possible to learn a set of actions. They do so through a deep learning architecture, which has an autoencoder to create a latent representation of a given point in time and use such a representation to learn a trace and the desired velocity. A memory layer then enables to execute movements at different velocities without explicitly modeling features. Another approach was explored by , who developed the autoencoder trajectory primitives, encoding trajectory primitives, which can be used to generate synthetic trajectories to learn motion planning. To that end, first train a variational autoencoder with discrete and continuous latent variables, to then sample perturbations at the goal configuration following a Gauss distribution, and let the decoder generate a trajectory from a given goal position. To ensure constraints, such as joint limits, trajectory optimization methods are used to project the generated trajectory to the constrained solution space. Among the advantages of the solution, the authors describe the ability to use the decoder as a motion planner, whose input is the goal position and trajectory types, and the interpretability of the latent representation. Finally, Lončarević et al.  explored the use of a fully-connected autoencoder network to reduce the dimensionality of a cartesian DMP space. To overcome the data scarcity and issues associated with data gathering (e.g., task executions on real robots can be error-prone), the authors gathered a small number of samples with a real robot, and they created synthetic samples with Gaussian process regression. Their results have shown that dimensionality reduction can be effectively learned from such data. Furthermore, this, in turn, was shown to be beneficial when applying Reinforcement Learning to learn a task, given that the lower dimensionality enabled a faster convergence.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: movement primitives were thought of as second-order differential equations to encode motion properties.
