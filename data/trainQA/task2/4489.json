      "content": "Paper Title: On Good 2-Query Locally Testable Codes from Sheaves on High Dimensional Expanders\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOf the various flavors of high dimensional expansion\nwhich have emerged in the past two decades — all of which generalize expansion in graphs —\nthe two most relevant\nfor our purpose are coboundary expansion and cosystolic expansion. Coboundary expansion originated in\nthe works of\nLinial–Meshulam \nand Meshulam–Wallach \non the cohomology of random simplicial complexes, and the work\nof Gromov  on the minimum amount of overlapping\nforced by mapping\na simplicial complex to ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}. Cosystolic expansion is\na more relaxed version of coboundary expansion\ndeveloped in [ref]13,\n, \nin order to extend the reach of Gromov’s methods. The first connections between high dimensional expansion and property\ntesting were observed and studied in . Let X𝑋X be a simplicial complex.222\nAll simplicial complexes are assumed to be finite, unless indicated otherwise.\n We write X​(i)𝑋𝑖X(i) to denote the set of i𝑖i-dimensional faces\nof X𝑋X, e.g., X​(0)𝑋0X(0), X​(1)𝑋1X(1) and X​(2)𝑋2X(2) stand for the vertices, edges and triangles of X𝑋X, respectively.\nThe simplicial complex X𝑋X also has a single empty face, of dimension −11-1. Let i∈ℕ∪{−1,0}𝑖ℕ10i\\in\\mathbb{N}\\cup\\{-1,0\\}.\nRecall that an i𝑖i-cochain on X𝑋X with coefficients in 𝔽2subscript𝔽2\\mathbb{F}_{2}\nis an assignment of an element in 𝔽2subscript𝔽2\\mathbb{F}_{2} to each i𝑖i-face of X𝑋X, i.e., a vector f∈𝔽2X​(i)𝑓superscriptsubscript𝔽2𝑋𝑖f\\in\\mathbb{F}_{2}^{X(i)}.\nWe set Ci=Ci​(X,𝔽2)=𝔽2X​(i)superscript𝐶𝑖superscript𝐶𝑖𝑋subscript𝔽2superscriptsubscript𝔽2𝑋𝑖C^{i}=C^{i}(X,\\mathbb{F}_{2})=\\mathbb{F}_{2}^{X(i)} and\nwrite the x𝑥x-coordinate of f∈Ci𝑓superscript𝐶𝑖f\\in C^{i} as f​(x)𝑓𝑥f(x).\nAs usual, the i𝑖i-th coboundary map di:Ci→Ci+1:subscript𝑑𝑖→superscript𝐶𝑖superscript𝐶𝑖1d_{i}:C^{i}\\to C^{i+1} is defined by for all f∈Ci𝑓superscript𝐶𝑖f\\in C^{i}, y∈X​(i+1)𝑦𝑋𝑖1y\\in X(i+1).\nA standard computation shows that di+1∘di=0subscript𝑑𝑖1subscript𝑑𝑖0d_{i+1}\\circ d_{i}=0.\nThe spaces of i𝑖i-coboundaries and i𝑖i-cocycles are now defined as respectively,\nwhere d−2=0subscript𝑑20d_{-2}=0 by convention.\nWe have Bi⊆Zi⊆Cisuperscript𝐵𝑖superscript𝑍𝑖superscript𝐶𝑖B^{i}\\subseteq Z^{i}\\subseteq C^{i} because di∘di−1=0subscript𝑑𝑖subscript𝑑𝑖10d_{i}\\circ d_{i-1}=0,\nand the quotient space Zi/Bisuperscript𝑍𝑖superscript𝐵𝑖Z^{i}/B^{i} is the i𝑖i-th cohomology\nspace Hi​(X,𝔽2)superscriptH𝑖𝑋subscript𝔽2{\\mathrm{H}}^{i}(X,\\mathbb{F}_{2}).333\nWhat we have defined here is the reduced cohomology of X𝑋X with 𝔽2subscript𝔽2\\mathbb{F}_{2}-coeffients,\ndenoted H~i​(X,𝔽2)superscript~H𝑖𝑋subscript𝔽2\\tilde{{\\mathrm{H}}}^{i}(X,\\mathbb{F}_{2}) later in the paper and elsewhere. The ordinary, non-reduced,\ncohomology is defined in the same manner with the difference\nthat the empty face of X𝑋X is ignored, i.e., one sets C−1=0superscript𝐶10C^{-1}=0 and d−1=0subscript𝑑10d_{-1}=0.\n Given a simplicial complex X𝑋X,\nwe may regard the i𝑖i-cocycles Zi=Zi​(X,𝔽2)superscript𝑍𝑖superscript𝑍𝑖𝑋subscript𝔽2Z^{i}=Z^{i}(X,\\mathbb{F}_{2}) as a linear code inside Ci=Ci​(X,𝔽2)=𝔽2X​(i)superscript𝐶𝑖superscript𝐶𝑖𝑋subscript𝔽2superscriptsubscript𝔽2𝑋𝑖C^{i}=C^{i}(X,\\mathbb{F}_{2})=\\mathbb{F}_{2}^{X(i)}.\nThis code is called the i𝑖i-cocycle code, and it admits a natural (i+2)𝑖2(i+2)-query tester: given f∈Ci𝑓superscript𝐶𝑖f\\in C^{i}, choose a face y∈X​(i+1)𝑦𝑋𝑖1y\\in X(i+1) uniformly at random and\naccept f𝑓f if\n(di​f)​(y)=0subscript𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑦0(d_{i}f)(y)=0 (cf. (2.1)).\nBy definition,444\nDefinitions concerning codes are recalled in Section 7.\n this tester makes Zisuperscript𝑍𝑖Z^{i} into an\nan ε𝜀\\varepsilon-testable code inside Cisuperscript𝐶𝑖C^{i} if and only if where ∥⋅∥Ham\\|\\cdot\\|_{{\\mathrm{Ham}}} and dHamsubscript𝑑Hamd_{{\\mathrm{Ham}}} denote the normalized Hamming norm and distance\n(in 𝔽2X​(i)superscriptsubscript𝔽2𝑋𝑖\\mathbb{F}_{2}^{X(i)} or 𝔽2X​(i+1)superscriptsubscript𝔽2𝑋𝑖1\\mathbb{F}_{2}^{X(i+1)}), respectively.\nAs for the distance of Zisuperscript𝑍𝑖Z^{i}, since Bisuperscript𝐵𝑖B^{i} typically\ncontains vectors with small support (unless i=0𝑖0i=0), the best we could for\nis the existence of δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0 such that Conditions (2.3) and (2.4) can also\nbe viewed as statements concerning the expansion of i𝑖i-cochains under disubscript𝑑𝑖d_{i}.\nWhen both of these conditions hold, X𝑋X is said to be\nan (ε,δ)𝜀𝛿(\\varepsilon,\\delta)-cosystolic expander in dimension i𝑖i.555\nWarning: The cosystolic expansion considered\nlater in this work and also in other sources involves weights on the faces of X𝑋X,\nwhich we have suppressed here for simplicity. See §5.3 for details.\n\nIf moreover Zi=Bisuperscript𝑍𝑖superscript𝐵𝑖Z^{i}=B^{i} (equivalently Hi​(X,𝔽2)=0superscriptH𝑖𝑋subscript𝔽20{\\mathrm{H}}^{i}(X,\\mathbb{F}_{2})=0),\nthen X𝑋X is said to be an ε𝜀\\varepsilon-coboundary expander in dimension i𝑖i\n(the parameter δ𝛿\\delta plays no role as Zi−Bi=∅superscript𝑍𝑖superscript𝐵𝑖Z^{i}-B^{i}=\\emptyset).\nThus, X𝑋X is an ε𝜀\\varepsilon-coboundary expander if and only if the code Bi⊆Cisuperscript𝐵𝑖superscript𝐶𝑖B^{i}\\subseteq C^{i}\nis ε𝜀\\varepsilon-testable with respect to the natural tester. Since the 00-cocycle code Z0superscript𝑍0Z^{0} of a simplicial complex X𝑋X\nis determined by its underlying graph, we might as well assume that X𝑋X is a graph.\nIn this case, if f∈C0​(X,𝔽2)𝑓superscript𝐶0𝑋subscript𝔽2f\\in C^{0}(X,\\mathbb{F}_{2}) has\nsupport A⊆X​(0)𝐴𝑋0A\\subseteq X(0), then the support of d0​fsubscript𝑑0𝑓d_{0}f is precisely\nthe set of edges leaving A𝐴A. Note further\nthat B0⊆𝔽2X​(0)superscript𝐵0superscriptsubscript𝔽2𝑋0B^{0}\\subseteq\\mathbb{F}_{2}^{X(0)} consists of exactly two vectors, namely (0,…,0)0…0(0,\\dots,0) and (1,…,1)1…1(1,\\dots,1).\nConsequently, X𝑋X is an ε𝜀\\varepsilon-coboundary expander\nin dimension 00 if and only if X𝑋X is an ε𝜀\\varepsilon-expander in usual sense, i.e., Similarly, a graph X𝑋X is an (ε,δ)𝜀𝛿(\\varepsilon,\\delta)-cosystolic expander in dimension 00 if and only\nif each connected component of X𝑋X is an ε𝜀\\varepsilon-expander\nconsisting of at least δ𝛿\\delta-fraction of the vertices in X𝑋X. Shifting back our point of view to codes,\nwe also note\nthat X𝑋X is\nan (ε,δ)𝜀𝛿(\\varepsilon,\\delta)-cosystolic expander if and only if the code Z0⊆𝔽2X​(0)superscript𝑍0superscriptsubscript𝔽2𝑋0Z^{0}\\subseteq\\mathbb{F}_{2}^{X(0)} is ε𝜀\\varepsilon-testable\nwith respect to its natural 222-query tester\nand has relative distance ≥δabsent𝛿\\geq\\delta.\nOn the other hand, the message length of Z0superscript𝑍0Z^{0} is meager — it is the number of connected components of X𝑋X,\nthus bounded from above by 1δ1𝛿\\frac{1}{\\delta}. In contrast to the case of 00-cocycle codes, if i>0𝑖0i>0, then the code Zi=Zi​(X,𝔽2)superscript𝑍𝑖superscript𝑍𝑖𝑋subscript𝔽2Z^{i}=Z^{i}(X,\\mathbb{F}_{2})\nmay have constant rate, but its distance\nis typically small, becuase Bisuperscript𝐵𝑖B^{i} usually contains vectors of small support. However, in this case, the\ncode Zisuperscript𝑍𝑖Z^{i} can be enriched into a quantum CSS code.\nMoreover, if X𝑋X is an (ε,δ)𝜀𝛿(\\varepsilon,\\delta)-cosystolic expander in dimension i𝑖i,\nthen the X𝑋X-side of this quantum CSS code\nis ε𝜀\\varepsilon-testable and has relative\ndistane ≥δabsent𝛿\\geq\\delta; see , or §7.4 for a generalization. The last two paragraphs demonstrate an intrinsic difficulty in trying\nto construct good LTCs from high dimensional expanders: either the rate or the distance are small. We will see below that sheaves allow us to bypass this natural limitation. Before we move to present sheaves, we recall an important method for obtaining “global” local testability from “local” local testability in the context\nof cocycle codes coming from high dimensional expanders. A generalization\nof this method to sheaves will play a major role in our new framework for constructing good 2-LTCs from high dimensional expanders. We have seen that the\ntestability of the 00-cocycle code of X𝑋X, i.e., the\ncosystolic expansion of X𝑋X in dimension\n00, is determined directly by the expansion of its underlying graph. For higher dimensions, the most prominent method for proving that a simplicial complex\nX𝑋X is a good cosystolic expander in a desired dimension i∈{1,…,dimX−2}𝑖1…dimension𝑋2i\\in\\{1,\\dots,\\dim X-2\\}\nis a local-to-global\nprinciple established in  for\ni=1𝑖1i=1 and  in general. Recall that the link of a simplicial complex X𝑋X at a face z∈X𝑧𝑋z\\in X\nis Xz={x−z|z⊆x∈X}subscript𝑋𝑧conditional-set𝑥𝑧𝑧𝑥𝑋X_{z}=\\{x-z\\,|\\,z\\subseteq x\\in X\\}. If z≠∅𝑧z\\neq\\emptyset, the link Xzsubscript𝑋𝑧X_{z} is\ncalled a proper link of X𝑋X.\nThe main result of  states\nthat if each of the proper links Xzsubscript𝑋𝑧X_{z} is a\ngood coboundary expander in a range of dimensions, and if the underlying\ngraph of X𝑋X is a sufficiently good expander, then X𝑋X is an (ε,δ)𝜀𝛿(\\varepsilon,\\delta)-coboundary\nexpander in dimension i𝑖i with ε𝜀\\varepsilon, δ𝛿\\delta depending\non the implicit expansion constants.\nIn fact, by Oppenheim’s Trickling Down Theorem [46, Theorem 1.4],\nwe can replace the expansion condition on the underlying graph of X𝑋X\nwith requiring that X𝑋X is connected and all its proper links are sufficiently good coboundary expanders\nin dimension 00.\nThe main theorem of  can therefore\nbe summarized as: good coboundary expansion at the links (informally called “local” local-testablity) implies cosystolic expansion (informally called “global” local-testability).\nAmong our main results is a generalization of this principle to sheaves.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: on the minimum amount of overlapping\nforced by mapping\na simplicial complex to ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}.
