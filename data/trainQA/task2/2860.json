      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Better Plasticity-Stability Trade-off in Incremental Learning: A Simple Linear Connector\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this set of experiments, we compare our method with several state-of-the-art baselines.\nWe compare our method with EWC , MAS [ref]2 , MUC-MAS [ref]26, SI , LwF , InstAParam , GD-WILD [ref]23, GEM , A-GEM , MEGA , OWM 3 and Adam-NSCL . All methods use ResNet-18 as backbone network for a fair comparison. Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 show the comparison results. The results show that our method achieves significant improvement w.r.t. ACC on three datasets. The results of BWT and ACC indicate that our method can achieve better plasticity-stability trade-off. Detailed analysis is as follows. 10-split-CIFAR-100\nThe results are shown in Table 1. We can see that our model achieves the best ACC 79.79%, which is 6.02% superior to the second best model Adam-NSCL. The BWT value of our model is -0.92%, which is the second best one compared to baselines. It indicates that our model can obtain a meaningful balance between previous tasks and new task. 20-split-CIFAR-100 As shown in Table 2, our model still achieves the best ACC 80.80%, which is 3.64% better than the second best model GD-WILD. Note that GD-WILD stores previous data and its BWT value is 9.85% worse than ours. Again, our model achieves a relative balanced BWT value -5.00%. 25-split-TinyImageNet\nThe results of Table 3 show that our method achieves the best ACC 64.61%, and the ACC of second best model Adam-NSCL is 58.28%. The BWT and ACC indicate that the our method not only can achieve better performance, but also obtain a more balanced model. Note that Adam-NSCL achieves an excellent performance, even so, our method performs better than Adam-NSCL. In summary, two observations can be made from the results: 1) our method yields the best performance on all datasets. 2) Our method achieves a better trade-off between stability and plasticity. Please note that the performance (ACC) of a IL model can be divided into two parts: stability (BWT) and plasticity. Hence, knowing ACC and BWT, we can probably know the performance of plasticity. We will further discuss it in the next subsection.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: In this set of experiments, we compare our method with several state-of-the-art baselines.\nWe compare our method with EWC , MAS [ref]2 , MUC-MAS [ref]26, SI , LwF , InstAParam , GD-WILD [ref]23, GEM , A-GEM , MEGA , OWM 3 and Adam-NSCL .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
