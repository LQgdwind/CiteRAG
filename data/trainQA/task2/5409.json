      "content": "Paper Title: Risk-Averse Model Uncertainty for Distributionally Robust Safe Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConsider the probability space (ℳ,ℱ,μs,a)ℳℱsubscript𝜇𝑠𝑎(\\mathcal{M},\\mathcal{F},\\mu_{s,a}), where ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} is a σ𝜎\\sigma-algebra on ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} and μs,a∈P​(ℳ)subscript𝜇𝑠𝑎𝑃ℳ\\mu_{s,a}\\in P(\\mathcal{M}) defines a probability measure over ℳℳ\\mathcal{M}. Let 𝒵𝒵\\mathcal{Z} be a space of random variables defined on this probability space, and let 𝒵∗superscript𝒵\\mathcal{Z}^{*} be its corresponding dual space. A real-valued risk measure ρ:𝒵→ℝ:𝜌→𝒵ℝ\\rho:\\mathcal{Z}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} summarizes a random variable as a value on the real line. In this section, we consider cost random variables Z∈𝒵𝑍𝒵Z\\in\\mathcal{Z} where a lower value of ρ​(Z)𝜌𝑍\\rho(Z) is better. We can define a corresponding risk measure ρ+superscript𝜌\\rho^{+} for reward random variables through an appropriate change in sign, where ρ+​(Z)=−ρ​(−Z)superscript𝜌𝑍𝜌𝑍\\rho^{+}(Z)=-\\rho(-Z). Risk-sensitive methods typically focus on classes of risk measures with desirable properties [ref]30, such as coherent risk measures  and distortion risk measures  . A risk measure ρ𝜌\\rho is a coherent risk measure if it satisfies monotonicity, translation invariance, positive homogeneity, and convexity. Let g:[ref]0 [ref]1→[ref]0 [ref]1:𝑔→0101g:[ref]0 [ref]1\\rightarrow[ref]0 [ref]1 be a non-decreasing, left-continuous function with g​(0)=0𝑔00g(0)=0 and g​(1)=1𝑔11g(1)=1. A distortion risk measure with respect to g𝑔g is defined as where FZ−1superscriptsubscript𝐹𝑍1F_{Z}^{-1} is the inverse cumulative distribution function of Z𝑍Z and g~​(u)=1−g​(1−u)~𝑔𝑢1𝑔1𝑢\\tilde{g}(u)=1-g(1-u). A distortion risk measure is coherent if and only if g𝑔g is concave . In this work, we focus on the class of coherent distortion risk measures. We will leverage properties of coherent risk measures to provide robustness guarantees for our framework, and we will leverage properties of distortion risk measures to propose an efficient, model-free implementation that does not involve minimax optimization. See the Appendix for additional details on the properties of coherent distortion risk measures. Many commonly used risk measures belong to this class, including expectation, conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), and the Wang transform  for η≥0𝜂0\\eta\\geq 0 which is defined by the distortion function gη​(u)=Φ​(Φ−1​(u)+η)subscript𝑔𝜂𝑢ΦsuperscriptΦ1𝑢𝜂g_{\\eta}(u)=\\Phi(\\Phi^{-1}(u)+\\eta), where ΦΦ\\Phi is the standard Normal cumulative distribution function.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: through an appropriate change in sign, where ρ+​(Z)=−ρ​(−Z)superscript𝜌𝑍𝜌𝑍\\rho^{+}(Z)=-\\rho(-Z).

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
