      "content": "Paper Title: ViTALiTy: Unifying Low-rank and Sparse Approximation for Vision Transformer Acceleration with a Linear Taylor Attention\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHere, we discuss the ablation study of ViTALiTy training scheme on the DeiT-Tiny model, the effect of sparsity threshold on the model accuracy, and dataflow in accelerator design. Training Scheme.\nFig.¬†13 demonstrates the accuracy obtained by various training schemes as part of our ablation study on the proposed ViTaLiTy method. We recall that the ViTaLiTy method involves training ViT by unifying linear Taylor Attention as LowRank component, and the Sanger¬† induced sparsity mask with threshold, T=0.5ùëá0.5T=0.5 as the Sparse component. We also incorporate token-based knowledge distillation (KD). For inference, ViTaLiTy simply uses the linear Taylor Attention without any additional sparse component. Compared to Baseline accuracy 72.2% with softmax attention, we observe that Sparse (Sanger¬†, T=0.02ùëá0.02T=0.02) achieves 71.2% accuracy. ‚òû Sparse boosts the accuracy of LowRank LowRank method uses linear Taylor Attention as drop-in replacement of softmax attention in pre-trained ViT models for inference and suffers from poor model accuracy of 27%. This supports our claim in Section¬†III-B that it is unlikely all (query,key) pairs have similarity within [-1,1). On unifying the above linear Taylor Attention (low-rank) and Sanger¬† sparsity with T=0.5ùëá0.5T=0.5 as LowRank+Sparse for fine-tuning the model and in inference, we observe improved accuracy of 70.7% (with boost of 43.7%percent43.743.7\\% over LowRank method). This demonstrates that the model now successfully captures the strong connections using the Sparse component which was missing using just the linear Taylor Attention from the LowRank method. Applying KD during fine-tuning of model additionally improves the accuracy by 1.2%percent1.21.2\\% to 71.9%. ‚òû Sparse is not required during inference Fig.¬†14 shows that the sparse component in ViTALiTy-KD vanishes after boosting the accuracy in initial training epochs of DeiT-Tiny. Hence, it can be dropped during inference with negligible effect on model accuracy after fine-tuning the model with unified LowRank+Sparse. This critical observation implies that the Sparse acts as a regularizer for generalizing the linear Taylor Attention such that during inference, the corresponding dense LowRank component is self-sufficient. This empowers the proposed ViTALiTy method to deploy ViT models on edge devices by avoiding the overhead of runtime sparsity computation during inference for various inputs. Applying KD further boosts the accuracy of ViTALiTy by 1.3%percent1.31.3\\% to 71.9% which matches the LowRank+Sparse+KD accuracy attained by additionally computing the sparse component during inference. Sparsity Threshold.\nFig.¬†15 illustrates the effect of sparsity thresholds [0.002,0.02,0.2,0.5,0.90.0020.020.20.50.90.002,0.02,0.2,0.5,0.9] on DeiT-Tiny model accuracy. The Sparse method achieves accuracy of 71.2%percent71.271.2\\% (Fig.¬†13) using the default threshold, T=0.02ùëá0.02T=0.02 defined in Sanger¬†. By incorporating LowRank+Sparse+KD, the model achieves slightly improved accuracy of 71.3%percent71.371.3\\% at same threshold value, whereas, by using ViTALiTy which drops the sparse component during inference, the model retains the same accuracy of 71.2%percent71.271.2\\% as the Sparse method. ‚òû LowRank renders Sparse to exhibit high sparsity As the sparsity threshold increases, more zeros are introduced in the sparse attention matrix generated by applying Sanger sparsity masks on quantized softmax attention. This reduces the contribution of sparse component relative to the low-rank component (linear Taylor Attention) in LowRank+Sparse+KD, and ViTALiTy methods. When T=1ùëá1T=1, the sparse component vanishes completely during training and inference which leaves only the low-rank component, thereby, signalling accuracy drop when T=0.9ùëá0.9T=0.9 as demonstrated in Fig.¬†15. For low threshold values, there is low sparsity which implies large contribution of softmax attention which overpowers the low-rank properties of linear Taylor Attention. As sparsity threshold increases, LowRank component becomes more prominent as the approximation of softmax attention leads to highly sparse matrix. This helps improve the model accuracy for both methods (Fig.¬†15). We observe the optimal threshold value is empirically achieved at T=0.5ùëá0.5T=0.5, where, the low-rank properties of linear Taylor Attention in ViTALiTy renders the sparse attention matrix to exhibit high sparsity during training which yields the best accuracy of 71.9%percent71.971.9\\%. At this threshold, ViTALiTy with no sparse component during inference matches the accuracy of LowRank+Sparse+KD. Dataflow in Systolic Array. In Table V, we observe that the\n(1) overall energy consumption of our proposed down-forward accumulation dataflow is consistently lower than the G-Stationary (GS) dataflow when benchmarking Taylor Attention on various ViT models, validating the effectiveness of the former for boosting energy efficiency, (2) G-Stationary dataflow has lower data access cost by keeping the generated ùêÜ=ùêä^T‚ÄãùêïùêÜsuperscript^ùêäùëáùêï\\mathbf{G}=\\hat{\\mathbf{K}}^{T}\\mathbf{V} stationary inner PEs which sequentially compute ùêêùêÜùêêùêÜ\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{G} for enhancing data locality, and\n(3) Proposed down-forward accumulation dataflow instead reduces the more dominant systolic array cost by simplifying the PE design by advocating for input stationary when computing the matrix multiplications in the linear Taylor Attention.
