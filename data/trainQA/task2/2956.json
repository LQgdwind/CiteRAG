      "content": "Paper Title: Deep convolutional forest: a dynamic deep ensemble approach for spam detection in text\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOver recent years, computer scientists have published a considerable volume of literature on spam detection    ; these works were limited to using machine learning and deep learning based models. Bassiouni et al.  experimented multiple classifiers to filter emails gathered from the Spambase UCI dataset, which contained 4601 instances. They performed data preprocessing, then they selected features using Infinite Latent Feature Selection (ILFS). Finally, they classified emails with an accuracy of 95.45% using Random Forest (RF), while the remaining classifiers: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Table (DT), Bayes Net, Naive Bayes (NB) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) scored 92.4%, 92.4%, 91.8%, 91.5%, 90.7%, 90.3%, 89.8%, 89.8% * and 82.6%, respectively. Merugu et al.  classified text messages into Spam and Ham category with an accuracy rate of 97.6% using Naive Bayes, which proved to outperform other machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbors according to the experimental results. The messages were collected from the UCI repository, which contained 5574 variable-length messages. To feed data into a classification model, the authors converted messages into fixed-length numerical vectors by creating term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF)  vectors using the bag of words (BoW) model. In 2020, Gaurav et al.  proposed spam mail detection (SPMD) method based on the document labeling concept, which sorts the new messages into two categories: Ham and Spam. Experimental results illustrated that Random Forest produced the highest accuracy of 92.97% among the three classification models: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest. Lately, researchers have proposed deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  and Short-Term Memory (LSTM)   for categorizing Spam and Ham messages. Popovac et al.  applied a CNN-based architecture after performing data preprocessing steps including tokenization, stemming, preservation of sentiment of text and removal of stop words. The feature extraction process involved transforming a text into a matrix of TF-IDF  features. According to their experiment, CNN proved to be effective more than machine learning algorithms with an accuracy score of 98.4%. Another spam filtering model was proposed by ; they combined an N-gram TF-IDF feature selection, modified distribution-based balancing algorithm and a regularized deep multi-layer perceptron neural network model with rectified linear units (DBB-RDNN-ReL). Although their model was computationally intensive, the model provided an accuracy of 98.51%. Jain et al.  used sequential stacked CNN-LSTM model (SSCL) to classify SMS spam with an accuracy of 99.01%. They converted each text into semantic word vectors with the help of Word2vec, WordNet and ConceptNet. However, searching for the word vectors in these embeddings caused system overload. Ghourabi et al.  presented a hybrid model for classifying text messages written in Arabic or English that is based on the combination of two deep neural network models: CNN and LSTM. The results indicated that the CNN-LSTM model scored an accuracy of 98.37%, which is higher than other techniques like Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Bagging classifier and Extra Trees. In 2020, Roy et al. [ref]7 focused on how to effectively filter Spam and Not-Spam text message downloaded from the UCI Repository , which contains 5574 instances. They tested deep learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as well as machine learning classifiers such as Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), Logistic Regression (LR) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The experimental results confirmed that applying CNN with three convolutional layers and a regularization parameter (dropout) on randomly sampled 10-fold cross validation data resulted in an accuracy of 99.44%. However, the authors spent much effort in tuning hyper-parameters. As mentioned in ”Introduction”, this study aims to handle feature relationships in textual data by using convolutional layers together with pooling layers as alternatives to the multi-grained scanning procedure proposed by . Zhou and Feng  proposed an ensemble of ensembles mechanism, meaning that each level learns from its previous level and each level has an ensemble of decision-tree forests. Descriptions of existing text-based spam detection techniques with respect to datasets, feature extraction and selection methods, types of algorithms, and performance measure are covered in Appendix A.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: like Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Bagging classifier and Extra Trees.
