Features. Features used for response surface generation and prediction are the 4 initial continuous and 5 random projections which are then one-hot encoded leading to a total dimensionality of 32. Target. In order to test CRITEO-ITE, we performed a benchmark of ITE prediction baselines evaluated on 3 generation protocols presented in Section 4 : cases A and B from , our multi-peaked with 5 randomly selected anchor points, σc=1subscript𝜎𝑐1\\sigma_{c}=1 for all c∈𝒞𝑐𝒞c\\in\\mathcal{C} and {w0,c,w1,c}c∈𝒞subscriptsubscript𝑤0𝑐subscript𝑤1𝑐𝑐𝒞\\{w_{0,c},w_{1,c}\\}_{c\\in\\mathcal{C}} drawn from 𝒰​(0,1)𝒰01\\mathcal{U}(0,1) then fitted to ensure A​T​E≈4𝐴𝑇𝐸4ATE\\approx 4 as for the other surfaces. For the 3 types of surfaces, we defined the same treatment bias consisting in a sigmoid on the highest importance feature with δ=0.01𝛿0.01\\delta=0.01 (see Section 4.2). Metric. For each baseline, mean ϵP​E​H​Esubscriptitalic-ϵ𝑃𝐸𝐻𝐸\\sqrt{\\epsilon_{PEHE}} is reported with its standard deviation over 10 experiments. Protocol. Following the concept of , for each of the 3 generation protocols, 10 different realizations are generated. Then, for each realization, using a subsample of 100,000 points, baseline models are tuned thanks to a 5-fold cross-validation and then tested (with 50/50 train/test split). Models. For this experiment, the baseline models include deep models (TARNet, CFRNet ) and meta-learners (T- and X-learner , R-learner , and DR-learner ) with Random Forest [ref]12 as prediction models. Results. As illustrated by Table 5, performances differ from one type of surface to the other underlining the importance of developing a variety of responses in which our multi-peaked version can anchor. For example, although X-Learner outperforms R-Learner on surfaces from , our multi-peaked generation highlights the contrary.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: 50/50 train/test split).
