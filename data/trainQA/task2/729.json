      "content": "Paper Title: Revisiting Modified Greedy Algorithm for Monotone Submodular Maximization with a Knapsack Constraint\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNemhauser\net al.  studied monotone submodular maximization with a cardinality constraint, and proposed a greedy heuristic that achieves an approximation factor of (1−1/e)11e(1-1/{\\mathrm{e}}). For this problem, Nemhauser and\nWolsey  showed that no polynomial algorithm can achieve an approximation factor exceeding (1−1/e)11e(1-1/{\\mathrm{e}}). Feige  further showed that even maximum coverage (which is a special submodular function) cannot be approximated in polynomial time within a ratio of (1−1/e+ε)11e𝜀(1-1/{\\mathrm{e}}+\\varepsilon) for any given ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, unless P=NPPNP\\mathrm{P}\\!=\\!\\mathrm{NP}. Leveraging the notion of curvature, Conforti and\nCornuéjols  obtained an improved upper bound (1−e−κf)/κf1superscriptesubscript𝜅𝑓subscript𝜅𝑓(1-{\\mathrm{e}}^{-\\kappa_{f}})/\\kappa_{f}, where κf:=1−minv∈V⁡f​(v∣V∖{v})f​({v})∈ assignsubscript𝜅𝑓1subscript𝑣𝑉𝑓conditional𝑣𝑉𝑣𝑓𝑣01\\kappa_{f}:=1-\\min_{v\\in V}\\frac{f(v\\mid V\\setminus\\{v\\})}{f(\\{v\\})}\\in  measures how much f𝑓f deviates from modularity. By utilizing multilinear extension , Sviridenko\net al.  proposed a continuous greedy algorithm that can further improve the approximation ratio to (1−κf/e−ε)1subscript𝜅𝑓e𝜀(1-\\kappa_{f}/{\\mathrm{e}}-\\varepsilon) at the cost of increasing time complexity from O​(k​n)𝑂𝑘𝑛O(kn) to O~​(n4)~𝑂superscript𝑛4\\tilde{O}(n^{4}), where k𝑘k is the maximum cardinality of elements in the optimization domain. Different from these studies, we focus on the more general problem of monotone submodular maximization with a knapsack constraint, for which the greedy heuristic does not have any bounded approximation guarantee. Wolsey  proposed a modified greedy algorithm of O​(n2)𝑂superscript𝑛2O(n^{2}), referred to as MGreedy, that gives a constant approximation factor of 0.3570.3570.357 for the problem of monotone submodular maximization with a knapsack constraint. Khuller\net al. 9 showed that MGreedy can achieve an approximation guarantee of (1−1/e)11e(1-1/\\sqrt{{\\mathrm{e}}}) for the budgeted maximum coverage problem. This factor, after being extensively mentioned in the literature, was recently pointed out by Zhang\net al.  to be problematic due to the flawed proof. Such a long-term misunderstanding on the factor of (1−1/e)11e(1-1/\\sqrt{{\\mathrm{e}}}) becomes a critical issue needed to be solved urgently. In this paper, we show that the MGreedy algorithm can achieve an improved constant approximation ratio of 0.4050.4050.405 through a careful analysis, which answers the open question of whether the worst-case approximation guarantee of MGreedy is better than (1−1/e)11e(1-1/\\sqrt{{\\mathrm{e}}}). In addition, we also enhance the MGreedy algorithm to derive a data-dependent upper bound on the optimum, which slightly increases the time complexity of MGreedy by a multiplicative factor of log⁡n𝑛\\log n. We theoretically show that the ratio of the solution value obtained by MGreedy to our upper bound is always larger than 0.3570.3570.357, which is again tighter than the approximation factor given by Khuller\net al. 9 and matches that given by Wolsey . We note that Leskovec et al.  developed an upper bound of f​(Sg)+Δ​(b∣Sg)𝑓subscript𝑆gΔconditional𝑏subscript𝑆gf(S_{\\mathrm{g}})+\\Delta(b\\mid S_{\\mathrm{g}}) in our notations, which is always looser than ours. Unlike our upper bound with worst-case guarantees, the relationship between f​(Sg)+Δ​(b∣Sg)𝑓subscript𝑆gΔconditional𝑏subscript𝑆gf(S_{\\mathrm{g}})+\\Delta(b\\mid S_{\\mathrm{g}}) and f​(Sm)𝑓subscript𝑆mf(S_{\\mathrm{m}}) is unclear. As has been demonstrated in the experiments, our upper bound is significantly tighter than that developed by Leskovec et al. . In addition to the modified greedy algorithm, Khuller\net al. 9 also gave a partial enumeration greedy heuristic that can achieve (1−1/e)11e(1-1/{\\mathrm{e}})-approximation, which was later shown to be also applicable to the general submodular functions by Sviridenko 4. Recently, Yoshida [ref]45 proposed a continuous greedy algorithm achieving a curvature-based approximation guarantee of (1−κf/e−ε)1subscript𝜅𝑓e𝜀(1-\\kappa_{f}/{\\mathrm{e}}-\\varepsilon). However, the time complexities of the partial enumeration greedy algorithm and the continuous greedy algorithm are as high as O​(n5)𝑂superscript𝑛5O(n^{5}) and O~​(n5)~𝑂superscript𝑛5\\tilde{O}(n^{5}), respectively. These algorithms 4 [ref]45 are hard to apply in practice. Some recent work  0 proposed algorithms with (1−1/e−ε)11e𝜀(1-1/{\\mathrm{e}}-\\varepsilon)-approximation. These algorithms are again impractical due to the high dependency on ε𝜀\\varepsilon, i.e., (log⁡n/ε)O​(1/ε8)​n2superscript𝑛𝜀𝑂1superscript𝜀8superscript𝑛2(\\nicefrac{{\\log n}}{{\\varepsilon}})^{O(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{\\varepsilon^{8}}})}n^{2}  and (1/ε)O​(1/ε4)​n​log2⁡nsuperscript1𝜀𝑂1superscript𝜀4𝑛superscript2𝑛(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{\\varepsilon}})^{O(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{\\varepsilon^{4}}})}n\\log^{2}n 0, which are of theoretical interests only. Table 2 summarizes the results for monotone submodular maximization with a knapsack constraint. Through comparison, we find that there is still a gap between our newly derived approximation factor of 0.4050.4050.405 and the best known factor of (1−1/e)11e(1-1/{\\mathrm{e}}). However, there does not exist practical algorithms that can achieve the optimal approximation ratio of (1−1/e)11e(1-1/{\\mathrm{e}}). In fact, devising efficient algorithms with approximation better than MGreedy, e.g., approaching (1−1/e)11e(1-1/{\\mathrm{e}}) or beating 1/2121/2, is a challenging problem.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: greedy heuristic that can achieve (1−1/e)11e(1-1/{\\mathrm{e}})-approximation, which was later shown to be also applicable to the general submodular functions by Sviridenko 4.
