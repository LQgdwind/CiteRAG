HOOI is a common used TF algorithm which comprises of a series of TTMc matrices and SVD for the TTMc.\n[ref]44 focused on dividing the computational task of TTMc into a list of independent parts and\na distributed HOOI for HOHDST is presented in [ref]45.\nHowever, the intermediate cache memory for TTMc of HOOI increased explosively.\nShaden et al.,  presented a parallel HOOI algorithm and\nthis work used a Compressed Sparse Tensors (CSF) structure which can improve the access efficiency and save the memory for HOHDST.\nOh and Park [ref]46  presented a parallelization strategy of ALS and CD for STD on OpenMP.\nA heterogeneous OpenCL parallel version of ALS for STD is proposed on .\nHowever, the above works are still focused on the naive algorithm parallelization which\ncannot solve the problem of fine-grained parallelization.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: TTMc into multiple independent blocks and then those tasks are allocated to distributed nodes.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
