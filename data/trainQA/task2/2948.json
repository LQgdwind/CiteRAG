      "content": "Paper Title: Towards artificial general intelligence via a multimodal foundation model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe notion of pre-training a large-scale machine learning model and then using it for downstream tasks first appeared in natural language processing (NLP). As shown in Supplementary Note Fig. S1c, large-scale NLP models like GPT , BERT [ref]51, and their variants, take Transformers  as text encoders to encode input texts into text embeddings, and then design pre-training objectives on top of these embeddings (e.g., generative loss and masked language modeling loss). In computer vision (CV), large-scale pre-training also becomes popular. Models like BiT  and ViT  use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Transformers as image encoders to obtain embeddings of input images. Similarly, pre-training losses are computed using the image embeddings (e.g., image classification loss and masked image patch prediction loss). However, these models are single-modal and thus only benefit downstream tasks in one modality. For multimodal (e.g., image, text, and audio) pre-training [ref]12 [ref]13      , existing works can be divided into two groups according to their network architectures: single-tower models (e.g., UNITER , OSCAR [ref]12, and M6 ) and two-tower ones (e.g., CLIP [ref]13 and ALIGN ). Our BriVL can also be categorized into the two-tower models since we use separate image and text encoders. But note that we actually adopt two additional momentum encoders to help with the pre-training process (i.e., to dynamically maintain negative sample queues across training batches), resulting in a four-tower pre-training architecture. The pre-training goal of our BriVL is to learn two encoders that can embed image and text inputs into the same semantic space for effective image-text retrieval. To enforce the image and text encoders to learn better representations in the same embedding space, we introduce cross-modal contrastive learning with the InfoNCE loss  into our BriVL. Specifically, our learning objective is to find the corresponding image embedding from a batch of them for a given text embedding and vice versa. By maximizing the cosine similarity of the image and text embeddings for each ground-truth pair while minimizing the cosine similarities of the embeddings from negative pairs, we jointly train the image and text encoders to learn an aligned cross-modal embedding space. Formally, for the image-text retrieval task, we denote the training set as 𝒟={(xi(i),xi(t))|i=1,⋯,N}𝒟conditional-setsubscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑖𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑡𝑖𝑖1⋯𝑁\\mathcal{D}=\\{(x^{(i)}_{i},x^{(t)}_{i})|i=1,\\cdots,N\\}, where (xi(i),xi(t))subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑖𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑡𝑖(x^{(i)}_{i},x^{(t)}_{i}) is a matched image-text pair, and N𝑁N is the size of 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}. Our BriVL leverages contrastive learning by applying MoCo  into the cross-modal scenario, as illustrated in Supplementary Note Fig. S1a. Each image xi(i)subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑖𝑖x^{(i)}_{i} (or each text xi(t)subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑡𝑖x^{(t)}_{i}) is encoded by the image encoder f(i)superscript𝑓𝑖f^{(i)} (or the text encoder f(t)superscript𝑓𝑡f^{(t)}) to obtain its d𝑑d-dimensional embedding 𝐳i(i)subscriptsuperscript𝐳𝑖𝑖\\mathbf{z}^{(i)}_{i} (or 𝐳i(t)subscriptsuperscript𝐳𝑡𝑖\\mathbf{z}^{(t)}_{i}). The image encoder (see Supplementary Note Fig. S1b) contains a CNN backbone, a successive self-attention (SA) block, and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). A sequence of patch embeddings are first obtained by applying multi-scale patch pooling (MSPP) to the feature map from CNN. They are then fused/encoded by the SA block. The text encoder, on the other hand, is stacked by several SA blocks such as BERT [ref]51 and RoBERTa . A two-layer MLP block with a ReLU  activation layer is used for mapping each encoder’s representation into the joint cross-modal embedding space. The parameters of f(i)superscript𝑓𝑖f^{(i)} and f(t)superscript𝑓𝑡f^{(t)} are denoted as θ(i)superscript𝜃𝑖\\theta^{(i)} and θ(t)superscript𝜃𝑡\\theta^{(t)}, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [51]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]51: machine learning model and then using it for downstream tasks first appeared in natural language processing (NLP).
