      "content": "Paper Title: Multiagent Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Routing and Pickup Problem with Adaptation to Variable Demand\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur approach can be characterized as a form of approximation in value space, built on top of a self-learning policy iteration scheme. It has: a) An online play algorithm that leverages the results of the offline policy iteration. b) An offline training algorithm that is based on approximate policy iteration, with the policy cost functions approximated using neural networks. c) Agent-by-agent rollout policies for faster generation of training samples for policy evaluation. Through online play as an approximate policy improvement step, we obtain a competitive suboptimal policy that improves over the performance of the offline policy (see Sec. III-A).\nWe choose an offline policy that approximates a variant of the rollout algorithm known as one-agent-at-a-time (one-at-a-time) rollout  , as it scales linearly with the number of agents, instead of exponentially like the standard rollout algorithm . We implement the offline approximation using GNNs to leverage the topological structure of the street network (see Sec. III-B).\nSince our policy approximation captures the behavior of a rollout policy derived for a specific historical demand model, a deviation in the current demand model from the original historical demand model might affect the quality of the approximation. This change in the approximation performance will in turn affect the performance of the online play.\nTo address this, we quantify regions of validity using Wasserstein Ambiguity Sets , and propose a method for switching to a different offline approximation based on the Wasserstein Distance  [ref]35 between the current and the historical demand model used for training the offline approximation (see Sec. III-C).\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: play.\nTo address this, we quantify regions of validity using Wasserstein Ambiguity Sets , and propose a method for switching to a different offline approximation based on the Wasserstein Distance  [ref]35 between the current and the historical demand model used for training the offline approximation (see Sec. III-C).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
