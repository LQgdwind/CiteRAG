      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Mitigating Architecture Overfitting in Dataset Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning has achieved tremendous success in various applications  , but training a powerful deep neural network requires massive training data  .\nTo accelerate training, one possible way is to construct a new but smaller training set that preserves most of the information of the original large set.\nIn this regard, we can use coreset   to sample a subset of the original training set or dataset distillation  [ref]8 to synthesize a small training set. Compared to coreset, dataset distillation achieves much better performance when the amount of data is extremely small  [ref]9. Furthermore, dataset distillation is shown to benefit various applications, such as continual learning [ref]8 0 1 [ref]9, neural architecture search [ref]8 1, and privacy preservation 2 3. Therefore, in this work, we focus on dataset distillation to compress the training set. In the dataset distillation framework, the small training set, which is also called the distilled dataset, is learned by using a neural network (i.e., training network) to extract the most important information from the original training set. Existing data distillation methods are based on various techniques, including meta-learning  4 5 6 7 and data matching [ref]8 8 9 0 [ref]9.\nThese methods are then evaluated by the test accuracy of another neural network (i.e., test network) trained on the distilled dataset.\nDespite efficiency, dataset distillation methods generally suffer from architecture overfitting 1 [ref]9 6 7 8.\nThat is, the performance of the test network on the distilled dataset degrades significantly when it has a different network architecture from the training network.\nMoreover, the performance deteriorates further when there is a larger difference between the training and test networks in terms of depth and topological structure.\nDue to high computational complexity and optimization challenges in dataset distillation, the training networks are usually shallow networks, such as 3-layer convolutional neural networks (CNN) 8 7.\nHowever, such shallow networks lack representation power in practical applications. In addition, deep networks have shown stronger representation power in many tasks 1 . Therefore, we believe a deeper network has the potential for better performance when trained on distilled datasets. Note that, our analysis indicates that the performance gap between different network architectures is larger in the case of training on the distilled dataset than in the case of training on the subset of the original training set.\nIn addition,compared with methods compressing the training set by subset selection, dataset distillation achieves better performance when using the same amount of training instances and is thus more popular in downstream applications 1 [ref]9 3.\nTherefore, we focus on dataset distillation, in which the effectiveness of the proposed method can be better revealed. In this work, we demonstrate that the architecture overfitting issue in dataset distillation can be mitigated by a better architecture design and training scheme of test networks on the distilled dataset.\nWe propose a series of approaches to mitigate architecture overfitting in dataset distillation.\nSpecifically, these approaches can be categorized into four types: a) architecture: DropPath with three-phase keep rate and improved shortcut connection; b) objective function: knowledge distillation from a smaller teacher network; c) optimization: periodical learning rates and a better optimizer; d) data: a stronger augmentation scheme.\nOur proposed methods are generic: we conduct comprehensive experiments on different network architectures, different numbers of instances per class (IPC), different dataset distillation methods and different datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.\nFigure 1 below demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods in various scenarios. It is clear that our methods can greatly mitigate architecture overfitting and make large networks achieve better performance in most cases.\nIn addition to dataset distillation, our methods can also improve the performance of training on a small real dataset, including those constructed by corsets.\nWhat’s more, compared with the existing methods, our proposed methods introduce negligible overhead and are thus computationally efficient. We summarize the contributions of this paper as follows: We propose a series of approaches to mitigate architecture overfitting in dataset distillation. They are generic and applicable to different model architectures and training schemes. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our method significantly mitigates architecture overfitting for different network architectures, different dataset distillation approaches, different IPCs, and different datasets. Moreover, our method generally improves the performance of deep networks trained on limited real data. As a result, deep networks outperform shallow networks on different fractions of training data, even when there are only 100100100 training samples.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: smaller training set that preserves most of the information of the original large set.\nIn this regard, we can use coreset   to sample a subset of the original training set or dataset distillation  [ref]8 to synthesize a small training set.
