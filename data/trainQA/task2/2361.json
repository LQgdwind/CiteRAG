      "content": "Paper Title: On the Evaluation of Commit Message Generation Models: An Experimental Study\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCommitGen, proposed by Jiang et al. , is an early attempt to adopt Neural Machine Translation (NMT) techniques in commit message generation. It treats code diffs and commit messages as inputs and outputs, respectively. CommitGen adapts one NMT model Nematus [ref]16 with the attentional RNN encoder-decoder [ref]17. The attention mechanism is introduced to capture long-distance features as CommitGen uses 100 as the maximum input length, which is much longer than that (50) used in Nematus [ref]16. NMT, proposed by Loyola et al. , is an encoder-decoder NMT model.\nDifferent from CommitGen which uses Bahdanau attention, it introduces the attention mechanism proposed by Luong et al . It is compared as a baseline model in ATOM . CoDiSum, proposed by Xu et al. [ref]15, is another encoder-decoder based model. The major difference between CoDiSum and other models is the design of the encoder part. CoDiSum jointly models the structure and the semantics of the code diffs with a multi-layer bidirectional GRU to better learn the representations of the code changes. Moreover, the copying mechanism  is used in the decoder to mitigate the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issue. PtrGNCMsg, proposed by Liu et al. , is an improved attentional RNN encoder-decoder model that incorporates the pointer-generator network  to translate code diffs to commit messages. It learns to either copy an OOV word from the code or generate a word from the fixed vocabulary.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: adopt Neural Machine Translation (NMT) techniques in commit message generation.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
