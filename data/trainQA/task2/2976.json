      "content": "Paper Title: Predicting the location of bicycle-sharing stations using OpenStreetMap data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWithin the topic of this thesis, 4 main concepts are worth discussing because they are important for understanding the content of the thesis. Those four concepts are: spatial data, spatial indexes, bicycle-sharing systems and data embedding. carries geographic information related to the Earth and its features. They consist of two main types of data: raster and vector. Examples of raster data are satellite images or scanned photographs, while vector data consists of points, lines, and polygons whose vertices are geographic coordinates [ref]16. These data may be associated with numerical or textual attributes that carry additional information beyond the position and shape of the stored geographic object itself. Spatial data analysis refers to a set of methods that aim to find patterns, detect anomalies, and confirm or refute hypotheses and theories. An analysis can be considered spatial if the location information is meaningful, meaning that the results change when the analysed objects are relocated . Today’s spatial data analysis is mostly carried out in GIS (Geographic Information System) software. They allow easy collection, management, analysis, and visualisation of spatial data. They are often used as part of a decision-making system that is based on mathematical models that allow predictions to be made about the future so that administrative planners can test their decisions before implementing them . are structures that allow you to quickly find an object. They are used to efficiently search large data sets that may be included in spatial databases. They allow finding a specific object without the need for sequential database searches, thus reducing processing time . The most popular spatial indexes currently used in GIS databases are Geohash and R-Tree, both of which allow for quick retrieval of a specific object in space. To divide the study area into smaller regions, Discrete Global Grids (DGG) are used. They divide the Earth’s surface into so-called cells. Each cell has a unique identifier so that it can be used as a spatial index . DGGs can be hierarchical or nonhierarchical and they can divide the Earth into different regular or irregular shapes and can have different granulations. Some of the most popular grids include the ISEA DGG 2, S2 [ref]11, HEALPix  and H3 7. This thesis will use one spatial indexing system during the experiments, the H3 library provided by Uber 7. This system uses a grid of hexagons that roughly divides the entire globe of the earth at different resolutions, allowing for a hierarchical subdivision of the region under study. This system was chosen because it is the latest (2018), is easy to use thanks to a library written in Python, among other things, and is well documented. As the system uses hexagons to subdivide the Earth’s surface, it has the least distortion, the minimum overlap ratio within a single resolution, and each of its neighbour is the same distance away. Compared to the Google’s S2 system (2015) [ref]11 which uses quadrilaterals, the distortion of the surveyed shapes is variable depending on the position on Earth due to the Mercator projection (Figure 4). The surveyed hexagons do not perfectly overlap between resolution changes (Figure 5), but this problem is not relevant in the context of the task solved by this thesis. Unfortunately, this grid contains 12 pentagons which result from the construction of a grid on the basis of the truncated icosahedron, but are mainly distributed over the oceans and are therefore also not important in the context of this thesis. is a shared transport service in which bikes are made available for use by individuals for short periods of time for a fee or for free 8. They are used for inner-city transport, increasing the flexibility and comfort of movement around the city, reducing the need for cars in city centres. The most frequent systems are based on an extensive infrastructure of docking stations from which bikes are rented and returned. The strategic positioning of these stations is crucial for the efficient operation of the system and its maintenance. The methods used so far to position those stations are based on the manual development of features for analysis in GIS by planners. This thesis aims to develop a simple model to roughly distribute the stations on the city grid, which can help planners in the final detailed positioning of individual stations without the need for manual preparation of features for analysis. is a representation learning method focused on reducing the dimensionality of the processed data. The goal of this method is to obtain a low-dimensional representation of the data by building its own feature vector in a given space in an unsupervised manner. The embedding space must be significantly smaller than the original data space , because the smaller dimension of the vectors translates into lower computational complexity associated with their processing and thus reduced learning and evaluation costs for the machine learning model. Embedding methods can be applied to different types of data, such as words, images, or graphs, but in this thesis, only spatial data will be considered. The idea of spatial data embedding is presented in Figure 8.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: of data: raster and vector.
