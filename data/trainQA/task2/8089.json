The first focuses on cryptography based techniques, including encryption transmission   and blockchain-enabled methods  . While these techniques are potent, they impose significant computational demands on edge devices and cannot entirely prevent CPs from potential misuse of user data.\nThe second category encompasses trusted distributed computing (TDC) techniques, exemplified by federated learning   . Although these methods bolster user privacy by obviating the need for direct data transfer, their suitability for online video platforms is debatable, given their limited capability to prohibit content providers from tracking user viewing habits.\nThe third category is grounded in noise-based techniques. These methods accentuate request privacy within edge networks by obfuscating actual user preferences  . A prevalent approach within this category is the pre-fetching of redundant and unrelated videos to foster ambiguity. Such pre-fetched content can also be cached at the network edge to serve future requests, thereby curtailing direct interactions with CPs  0, which in turn mitigates the data exposure risk. Nevertheless, balancing the quality of edge services with the imperative of user data protection remains an intricate endeavor. one viable solution to ensure request privacy in online video systems involves incorporating DP noises, which delivers robust information protection assurances [ref]13  . L’ecuyer et al.  pioneered the use of block composition to tackle privacy concerns arising from expanding private datasets. This innovative method provides theoretical assurances for the efficient utilization of individual dataset segments. Moreover, to shield non-iid datasets, correlated differential privacy was introduced in 1 , taking into account the interdependence among records. Yet, the challenge confronted by allocating limited privacy budgets for online video requests on edge devices persists. Certain allocation frameworks, like Sage  and DP-FLames 2, may be overly simplistic or rely on improbable assumptions, thereby restricting their flexibility in diverse scenarios.\nIn light of these methodological limitations, we present a novel privacy protection strategy. This method enhances request privacy by generating redundant requests, all while preserving the operational efficacy of edge caching.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: remains an intricate endeavor. one viable solution to ensure request privacy in online video systems involves incorporating DP noises, which delivers robust information protection assurances [ref]13  .
