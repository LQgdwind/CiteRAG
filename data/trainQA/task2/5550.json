      "content": "Paper Title: Lasserre Hierarchy for Graph Isomorphism and Homomorphism Indistinguishability1footnote 11footnote 1This work was presented at the 50th International Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and Programming (ICALP 2023) [31].\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe aim of this paper is to relate two rich sets of tools used to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs: the Lasserre semidefinite programming hierarchy and homomorphism indistinguishability. Distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs is a ubiquitous problem in the theoretical and practical study of graphs. The ability of certain graph invariants to distinguish graphs has long been a rich area of study, leading to fundamental questions such as the longstanding open problem of whether almost all graphs are determined by their spectrum .\nIn practice, deploying e.g. machine learning architectures powerful enough to distinguish graphs with different features is of great importance .\nThis motivates an in-depth study of the power of various graph invariants and tools used to distinguish graphs. Among such techniques is the Lasserre semidefinite programming hierarchy  which can be used to relax the integer program for graph isomorphism ISO⁡(G,H)ISO𝐺𝐻\\operatorname{ISO}(G,H), cf. Section 2.4.\nThis yields a sequence of semidefinite programs, i.e. the level-t𝑡t Lasserre relaxation of ISO⁡(G,H)ISO𝐺𝐻\\operatorname{ISO}(G,H) for t≥1𝑡1t\\geq 1, which are infeasible for more and more non-isomorphic graphs as t𝑡t grows.\nIn   , it was shown that in general only the level-Ω​(n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(n) Lasserre system of equations can distinguish all non-isomorphic n𝑛n-vertex graphs.\nIn [ref]4, the Lasserre hierarchy was compared with the Sherali–Adams222Following [ref]4, when referring to the Sherali–Adams relaxation of ISO⁡(G,H)ISO𝐺𝐻\\operatorname{ISO}(G,H) in this article, we do not refer to the original relaxation  but to its variant introduced by  , which corresponds more directly to other graph properties, cf. Theorem 2.9 and . linear programming hierarchy , which is closely related to the Weisfeiler–Leman algorithm 9  , the arguably most relevant combinatorial method for distinguishing graphs. It was shown in [ref]4 that there exists a constant c𝑐c such that, for all graphs G𝐺G and H𝐻H, if the level-c​t𝑐𝑡ct Sherali–Adams relaxation of ISO⁡(G,H)ISO𝐺𝐻\\operatorname{ISO}(G,H) is feasible then so is the level-t𝑡t Lasserre relaxation, which in turn implies that the level-t𝑡t Sherali–Adams relaxation is feasible, cf. . Another set of expressive equivalence relations comparing graphs is given by homomorphism indistinguishability, a notion originating from the study of graph substructure counts.\nTwo graphs G𝐺G and H𝐻H are homomorphism indistinguishable over a family of graphs ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}, in symbols G≡ℱHsubscriptℱ𝐺𝐻G\\equiv_{\\mathcal{F}}H, if the number of homomorphisms from F𝐹F to G𝐺G is equal to the number of homomorphisms from F𝐹F to H𝐻H for every graph F∈ℱ𝐹ℱF\\in\\mathcal{F}. The study of this notion began in 1967, when Lovász  showed that two graphs G𝐺G and H𝐻H are isomorphic if and only if they are homomorphism indistinguishable over all graphs.\nIn recent years, many prominent equivalence relations comparing graphs were characterised as homomorphism indistinguishability relations over restricted graph classes  3 4     6  0 9. For example, a folklore result asserts that two graphs have cospectral adjacency matrices iff they are homomorphism indistinguishable over all cycle graphs, cf. . Two graphs are quantum isomorphic iff they are homomorphism indistinguishable over all planar graphs . Furthermore, feasibility of the level-t𝑡t Sherali–Adams relaxation of ISO⁡(G,H)ISO𝐺𝐻\\operatorname{ISO}(G,H) has been characterised as homomorphism indistinguishability over all graphs of treewidth at most t−1𝑡1t-1   3.\nIn this way, notions from logic 3 4 9, category theory  6 , algebraic graph theory  , and quantum groups  have been related to homomorphism indistinguishability.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: and more non-isomorphic graphs as t𝑡t grows.\nIn   , it was shown that in general only the level-Ω​(n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(n) Lasserre system of equations can distinguish all non-isomorphic n𝑛n-vertex graphs.\nIn [ref]4, the Lasserre hierarchy was compared with the Sherali–Adams222Following [ref]4, when referring to the Sherali–Adams relaxation of ISO⁡(G,H)ISO𝐺𝐻\\operatorname{ISO}(G,H) in this article, we do\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
