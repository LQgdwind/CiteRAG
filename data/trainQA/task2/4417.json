Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

For example, if (h,r,t1)ℎ𝑟subscript𝑡1(h,r,t_{1}) and (h,r,t2)ℎ𝑟subscript𝑡2(h,r,t_{2}) hold for a one-to-many relation r𝑟r, we have 𝐡+𝐫≈𝐭1𝐡𝐫subscript𝐭1\\mathbf{h}+\\mathbf{r}\\approx\\mathbf{t}_{1} and 𝐡+𝐫≈𝐭2𝐡𝐫subscript𝐭2\\mathbf{h}+\\mathbf{r}\\approx\\mathbf{t}_{2}, then 𝐭1≈𝐭2subscript𝐭1subscript𝐭2\\mathbf{t}_{1}\\approx\\mathbf{t}_{2}. If (h,r1,t)ℎsubscript𝑟1𝑡(h,r_{1},t) and (h,r2,t)ℎsubscript𝑟2𝑡(h,r_{2},t) hold for hℎh and t𝑡t, we have 𝐫1≈𝐫2subscript𝐫1subscript𝐫2\\mathbf{r}_{1}\\approx\\mathbf{r}_{2}.\nTo resolve these problems, several improved translational models, such as TransH , TransR [ref]22, and TransD [ref]18, have been proposed.\nThey enable entities to have relation-specific embeddings.\nFor example, TransH interprets a relation as a translation vector on a hyperplane, while TransR and TransD embed entities and relations in distinct vector spaces.\nRotatE  is an improved variant in the complex vector space.\nBesides, semantic matching-based models exploit similarity-based functions to score relational triples.\nThe scores are computed using bilinear functions in RESCAL , DistMult , ComplEx  and SimplE , while HolE  replaces dot product with circular correlation.\nEmbeddings are given analogical qualities in Analogy .\nRecently, neural network-based models, including ProjE , ConvE , R-GCN , ConvKB , KBGAN  and LinkNBed , achieve superior link prediction performance.\nμ​KG𝜇KG\\mu\\text{KG} currently supports TransE, TransR, TransH, TransD, TuckER, DisMult, ComplEx, HolE, Analogy, RESCAL, RotatE, SimplE and ConvE.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: TransE [ref]5 introduces translational KG embeddings.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
