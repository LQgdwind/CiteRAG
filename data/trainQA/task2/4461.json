      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Radiance Transfer Fields for Relightable Novel-view Synthesis with Global Illumination\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare our approach against several alternatives on the task of novel-view synthesis with relighting:\nOn the one hand, we analyze the capabilities of stand-alone differentiable path-tracing using Mitsuba2 , which can be used to perform inverse rendering in the presence of global illumination.\nOn the other hand, we consider three recent neural field-based inverse-rendering approaches PhySG 1, Neural-PIL [ref]4, and NeRFactor , all employing only a direct illumination model.\nWe omit a comparison to NeRD [ref]3 as Neural-PIL can be considered as the follow-up.\nWe also compare with RNR , providing it with the same geometry as ours.\nFurther, we provide more results on NeRFactor  dataset in the supplemental document. A qualitative comparison is shown in Fig. 6.\nDespite the fact that our method provides the sharpest and most realistic results, it is worth noting that our method is the only one that can recover accurate indirect lighting effects, e.g. the self-reflection on the wing of the airplane and the color spill of the squares onto the statue.\nThis is further confirmed by the quantitative analysis in Table 1.\nWe compute image errors for four scenes, each with five views and three lighting conditions according to three metrics on the tasks of novel-view synthesis and novel-view synthesis with relighting.\nIn particular, we evaluate the Peak Signal-to-noise Ratio (PSNR), the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) , and the learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) 2.\nPSNR and SSIM are purely image-based metrics and, thus, sometimes do not reflect the perceived image quality.\nFor this reason, we also provide the perceptual LPIPS metric.\nWe observe that our approach again delivers the highest-quality results for both tasks across all metrics.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: which can be used to perform inverse rendering in the presence of global illumination.\nOn the other hand, we consider three recent neural field-based inverse-rendering approaches PhySG 1, Neural-PIL [ref]4, and NeRFactor , all employing only a direct illumination model.\nWe omit a comparison to NeRD [ref]3 as Neural-PIL can be considered as the follow-up.\nWe also compare with RNR , providing it\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
