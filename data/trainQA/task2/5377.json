      "content": "Paper Title: BayBFed: Bayesian Backdoor Defense for Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe employ the machine learning framework PyTorch to conduct our experiments and use the existing defenses     8   as baseline models to comparatively analyze the performance of BayBFed. Aligned with previous work on backdoor attacks   , we use the attacks provided by Bagdasaryan et al.  and Wang et al. 2 to implement the Constrain-and-Scale and Edge-Case backdoor attacks. Below, we provide the configurations of the different datasets and the accuracy and precision metrics we use to evaluate the performance of BayBFed. Datasets. To show the generality of our results and the representative nature of BayBFed across models/data from different domains, we evaluate the proposed defense mechanism by designing two attacks (see Tab. I) on three popular FL applications: (i) image classification, (ii) word prediction, and (iii) IoT network intrusion detection. To facilitate an equitable comparison of BayBFed with state-of-the-art backdoor attack approaches  , we align the datasets, setups, and NN architectures employed in our comparative evaluation with the ones used by these research efforts.\nImage Classification (IC): We use the popular benchmark datasets MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 in our experiments. As these datasets are frequently used for evaluating FL and backdoor attacks and defenses  [ref]8  5 6     5 2 3 4 3 4, it enables us to perform an equitable comparative analysis of our approach with other state-of-the-art approaches in the literature. All three consist of samples belonging to one out of ten classes, handwritten digits in the case of MNIST, articles of clothing in the case of FMNIST, and objects (airplanes, cars, birds, etc.) in the case of CIFAR-10. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 50K training and 10K test images, while MNIST and FMNIST datasets each consist of 60K training and 10K test images. As the NN architecture, a light-weight version of Resnet-18 is used for CIFAR-10 , a simple CNN is used for MNIST [ref]8, and a three-layer fully connected NN with relu activations is used for FMNIST.\nWord Prediction (WP): To evaluate BayBFed for a complex Natural Language Processing (NLP) application such as word prediction, we use the Reddit dataset consisting of all posts from November 2017. Aligned with the work of Bagdasaryan et al., we considered each author’s posts as a local dataset and only the 50K most frequent words. A Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) model is used to predict the next word .\nNetwork Intrusion Detection (NIDS): Further, we evaluate BayBFed for the FL-based NIDS DÏoT  system using four real-world network traffic datasets, kindly shared with us by Nguyen et al.   and Sivanathan et al. 8. The datasets consist of network traffic of multiple smart home and office settings. Aligned with previous work  5, we converted the network packets into symbols based on their features, such as source and destination ports, protocols, and flags. To simulate a distributed FL setting, we split the dataset into 100 local datasets, each consisting of symbols between 2K and 3K, which were extracted from the network packets. The NN is trained to predict the next probabilities for each possible symbol (network packet). The NN consists of 2 Gated-Recurrent-Unit layers followed by a fully connected linear layer, as defined by Nguyen et al. . Evaluation metrics. We compute four metrics to estimate the accuracy and precision of BayBFed.\nTrue Positive Rate (TPR): This metric specifies how accurately the defense is able to detect the poisoned model updates. The total number of correctly identified poisoned updates are called True Positives (T​P𝑇𝑃TP) and the number of poisoned model updates discerned as benign model updates are called False Negatives (F​N𝐹𝑁FN). Thus, T​P​R=T​PT​P+F​N𝑇𝑃𝑅𝑇𝑃𝑇𝑃𝐹𝑁TPR=\\frac{TP}{TP+FN}.\nTrue Negative Rate (TNR): This metric determines how accurately the defense is able to detect the benign model updates. The total number of correctly identified benign model updates are called True Negatives (T​N𝑇𝑁TN) and the number of benign updates discerned as poisoned updates are called False Positives (F​P𝐹𝑃FP). Thus, T​N​R=T​NT​N+F​P𝑇𝑁𝑅𝑇𝑁𝑇𝑁𝐹𝑃TNR=\\frac{TN}{TN+FP}.\nBackdoor Accuracy (BA): This metric is used to measure the accuracy of the model on the triggered inputs. Specifically, it measures the fraction of triggered samples where the model predicts the adversary’s chosen label.\nMain Task Accuracy (MA): This metric is used to measure the accuracy of the model on its benign main task. It represents the fraction of benign inputs for which the model provides correct predictions.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Classification (IC): We use the popular benchmark datasets MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 in our experiments. As these datasets are frequently used for evaluating FL and backdoor attacks and defenses  [ref]8  5 6     5 2 3 4 3 4, it enables us to perform an equitable comparative analysis of our approach with other state-of-the-art approaches in the literature.
