      "content": "Paper Title: Travel Demand Forecasting: A Fair AI Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been increasingly used in travel demand forecasting, due to its powerful prediction capability  . However, a growing number of studies reported that AI has evident fairness issues [ref]9    [ref]42  —making worse predictions for disadvantaged population groups (e.g., racial and ethnic minorities, low-income individuals, and women) than the advantaged groups. For example, facial recognition systems have higher error rates on classifying darker-skinned individuals and females . Studies in the transportation domain also have similar findings. For example, recent research has shown that AI algorithms could underestimate the actual travel demand for the disadvantaged groups 1 and deliver much lower prediction accuracy for the disadvantaged groups than the advantaged groups 0. The unfair predictions may negatively impact transportation policies and decision-making (e.g., vehicle rebalancing and traffic control), leading to unintended consequences for transportation equity. Therefore, AI-based travel demand forecasting models should account for both prediction accuracy and fairness 0. Recently, some researchers have started to develop fairness-aware AI methods in travel behavior modeling, e.g., travel mode choice modeling 0 and travel demand forecasting 1. However, research on this important topic, especially for travel demand forecasting, is still lacking. For instance, although various methods have been developed to mitigate the unfairness issues, very few can be flexibly adopted by different types of models (e.g., linear models, deep learning models with different architectures, etc.). In other words, there still lacks a systematic framework to address the model’s fairness issue in a model-agnostic (i.e., the method should be independent of models) manner. Also, it remains largely unsolved how to prioritize model fairness while preserving its prediction accuracy, both of which are critical to ensure the trustworthiness of AI 1 7. Additionally, previous studies have primarily focused on correcting the unfairness of a single protected attribute. In real-world dataset, however, the debiased model and results could vary across different protected attributes, potentially causing confusion and hindering adoption by end-users. For example, one study has found that mitigating unfairness of one protected attribute (i.e., race) could increase the prediction disparities of another protected attribute (i.e., income) 0. This suggests that a model that is fair for one protected attribute could still be unfair for other attributes [ref]46. However, few prior studies have been devoted to simultaneously tackling fairness issues from multiple protected attributes  [ref]46. To address these research gaps, we aim to develop a new methodology to enhance fairness in AI-based travel demand forecasting models. More specifically, first, we define Fairness as the Equality of Prediction Accuracy, i.e., the prediction accuracy is equal for advantaged and disadvantaged population groups. Next, we examine the potential unfairness (i.e., prediction accuracy disparity) existing among several state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical models for travel demand forecasting, using real-world ridesourcing-trip data in Chicago, IL and Austin, TX. We propose a novel absolute correlation regularization method to simultaneously correct the detected unfairness across multiple protected attributes (e.g., race, education, etc). We further compare the proposed methodology with other existing state-of-the-art regularization terms to show its effectiveness in both preserving accuracy and correcting unfairness. The unique contributions of this study are presented as follows: This study is one of the first studies to examine the fairness issues of travel demand forecasting models from the algorithmic view. We extend the literature on this topic by detecting the unfairness issues of several commonly-used deep learning and statistical models and proposing a methodology to correct the unfairness. We introduce a novel absolute correlation regularization term to address the model’s unfairness arising from multiple protected attributes. This regularization term is explicitly designed to penalize models that produce unfair predictions, which holds notable transparency. Moreover, the proposed regularization term is model-agnostic and can be flexibly incorporated into the loss function of any type of model architecture. We propose to use an interactive weight coefficient for both the accuracy loss and fairness regularization terms. This weight coefficient is tuned simultaneously with other key hyperparameters of an AI model (e.g., number of hidden layers, number of hidden neurons, and learning rate of a multiple-layer perception model). Therefore, the fairness-aware travel demand forecasting models can optimally improve fairness while preserving prediction accuracy. The remaining paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews the related studies. Section 3 introduces the fairness definitions, metrics and unfairness correction method. We introduce the empirical case studies in Section 4. The modeling results are presented in Section 5. Section 6 discusses the merits of the proposed methodology, echoes the critical findings, proposes some policy implications and lists several future research directions. Finally, Section 7 concludes our study.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: (AI) has been increasingly used in travel demand forecasting, due to its powerful prediction capability  .
