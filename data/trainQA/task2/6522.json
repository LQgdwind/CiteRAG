For graph classification, we follow the evaluation pipeline in  by training an SVM as the classifier. The whole dataset is used to learn graph-level representations, which are evaluated under the SVM classifier with cross-validation. Eight benchmark datasets are all selected from the TUDataset. We modify SimCLR and Simsiam to adapt to graph representation learning and select GIN  as the encoder network. Besides using contrastive learning models with random perturbation as baselines, we compare our proposed model with graph kernel methods like WL  and DGK [ref]49. We also choose state-of-the-art graph self-supervised learning methods including GraphCL , JOAO [ref]51, JOAO(v2) [ref]51, SimGRACE  and MVGRL [ref]10. For node classification, we follow  where the whole dataset is used to learn node representations, which are evaluated under a logistic regression classifier with cross-validation. Popular datasets like Cora and CiteSeer are selected, and other real-world datasets, including Wiki-CS, Amazon-Computers, and Amazon-Photo are also used. Similar to graph-level tasks, we modify SimCLR and Simsiam frameworks to adapt to node representation learning. Both GCN  and GAT  models are used as encoders.\nWe also compare with other self-supervised learning models including GCA , MVGRL [ref]10, DGI . We evaluate model performance using the accuracy metric. For each model, we report mean accuracy and standard deviation of five runs. The ‘—’ in Table 1 and Table 2 means that these results are not available in currently published papers. The implementation details of our experiments can be found in Appendix G.\n\nReference markers found: [49]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]49: and select GIN  as the encoder network.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
