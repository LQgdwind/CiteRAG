      "content": "Paper Title: A Novel Center-based Deep Contrastive Metric Learning Method for the Detection of Polymicrogyria in Pediatric Brain MRI\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPolymicrogyria (PMG) is a cortical malformation characterized by irregular thickened grey matter in the cerebral cortex, with numerous small gyri, shallow sulci and loss of grey white matter differentiation\n(see Figure 1).\nPolymicrogyria is one of the most common malformations of cortical development and is most often related to genetic disorders although it can be caused by congenital viral infection . PMG is a heterogeneous condition which can have variable distribution, extent, and severity .\nExperienced neuroradiologists can accurately diagnose PMG using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but focal or more subtle PMG can be missed. Less experienced readers may not detect PMG with the same accuracy as it can be subtle, and computer aided diagnosis would be useful here. Machine learning has been applied to cortical malformations in the pediatric brain, mainly in the context of fetal imaging  and epilepsy [ref]3 and may\ncontribute to computer-aided diagnosis.\nThere is however a lack of literature applying machine learning and in particular deep learning to the detection of polymicrogyria.\n The disease is rare in most clinical settings, while collecting normal pediatric brain MRI is relatively easy. We collected and annotated a small pediatric PMG MRI dataset (23 patients) from the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO), Ottawa, Canada.\nThis pediatric polymicrogyria MRI (PPMR) dataset is imbalanced because the majority of MRI are control\nand even for PMG samples the majority of MRI slices do not show evidence of PMG. We believe the composition of the PPMR dataset is a realistic reflection of the data likely to be encountered in clinical practice. In this paper, we introduce the PPMR dataset in detail. Because of the nature of PMG and the difficulty in collecting data, this dataset is unfortunately small and lacks the diversity of PMG. As it is difficult to evaluate testing results on such a dataset, we also introduce a modified CIFAR-10 dataset. This modified CIFAR-10 dataset mimics the challenges of our PPMR dataset, including the fact that the minority class samples in the training data are not representative and that the whole dataset is imbalanced.\n Deep learning models trained with cross-entropy-based loss functions on small imbalanced datasets,\nperform poorly when applied to real-word out-of-distribution samples.\nAnomaly detection has the potential to mitigate this issue. This motivates the design of our novel cDCM loss function that combines anomaly detection and binary classification.\nEach input MRI is mapped to a latent representation where our loss function can \"cluster\" normal samples together, because normal images share similar features, and push anomaly samples further away from the \"cluster\". During inference, according to the idea of supervised contrastive learning [ref]4, samples\nthat have similar features as normal samples in the training data can be classified as normal; on the other hand, samples\nthat have dissimilar features as normal samples in the training data can be classified as anomalies.  Our novel cDCM loss function can partly mitigate the problem of generalization in deep learning, and our custom deep learning model structure can learn and select key features of MRI images automatically. In this paper, we compare our novel cDCM loss function to the Deep SAD loss function  and cross-entropy-based loss functions to demonstrate the benefits of our novel cDCM loss function. Our novel cDCM loss function can directly provide a good decision threshold that cannot be determined from training and validation data. We also propose a custom deep learning model structure, combining dilated convolutions [ref]6, squeeze-and-excitation  blocks, and a multi-level feature fusion  mechanism to be used with our novel cDCM loss function.\nWe conduct an ablation study to confirm the significance of each component in the overall structure and show the utility and stability of our custom deep learning model structure, compared to some popular CNN backbones, such as EfficientNet and ResNet50. In summary, the main contributions of our research are listed below: We propose a novel center-based deep contrastive metric learning loss function (cDCM) to work with a small and imbalanced dataset for which some testing data features do not appear in the training data.\n Our method integrates the strengths of supervised binary classification and anomaly detection and to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply deep contrastive learning\nto PMG MRI classification.\n We design a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) structure which combines dilated convolutions [ref]6, squeeze-and-excitation  blocks, and a multi-level feature fusion  mechanism.\n We make our\npediatric PMG MRI dataset (a.k.a. PPMR dataset) from the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO), Ottawa, Canada The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:\nIn Section 2, we give a literature review, including machine learning in PMG images, classification of brain MRI, anomaly detection in medical imaging, and deep metric learning and deep contrastive learning. In Section 3, we give a detailed illustration of our proposed method, including the novel cDCM loss function and custom model structure. In Section 4, we introduce two datasets: a modified CIFAR-10 dataset and our PPMR dataset, and also describe training details. In Section 5, we show the results of substantial experiments on these two datasets and also analyze and discuss the results of these experiments. Finally, we give a conclusion of our research and also consider some future works.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: be subtle, and computer aided diagnosis would be useful here.
