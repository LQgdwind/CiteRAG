      "content": "Paper Title: Advancing Spatio-Temporal Processing in Spiking Neural Networks through Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSpiking neural network models are the basis of many neuromorphic systems. For a long time, these networks used leaky integrate-and-fire neurons as their fundamental computational units.\nMore recent work has shown that networks of adaptive spiking neurons outperform LIF networks in spatio-temporal processing tasks. However, a deep understanding of the mechanisms that underlie their superiority was lacking. In this article, we investigated the underpinnings of the computational capabilities of networks of adaptive spiking neurons. We first showed how stability issues of adLIF neurons discretized with the Euler-Forward method can be avoided with the Symplectic-Euler method 2, resulting in the SE-adLIF model. We analytically derived its favorable stability properties and demonstrated its practical superiority on several benchmark datasets.\nMany digital neuromorphic chips implement time-discretized SNNs    . Adaptive neurons are an attractive model for such systems as they only add a single additional state variable per neuron. As synaptic connections are typically dominating implementation costs, this approximate doubling of resources needed for neuron dynamics is well justified by the improved performance. For example, Fig. 4f shows that there exist tasks where adLIF networks can achieve superior performance to LIF networks with orders of magnitudes less parameters.\nCompared to the standard Euler-discretized adLIF model, the computational operations needed to implement the SE-adLIF model are identical. Hence, the improved stability properties of this model are practically for free. Our analysis in Section Computational properties of adLIF networks indicates that adLIF should be well-suited to learn relevant temporal features from input sequences. Interestingly, our investigations revealed that LIF networks are surprisingly weak in that respect. This is witnessed by its low performance at the burst sequence detection task (Fig. 6) as well as by our input-feature analysis of trained LIF networks (Fig. 6 panels d and f).\nThis is surprising, as theoretical arguments suggest that SNNs in general should be efficient in temporal computing tasks . Our analysis suggests that the gradients in LIF networks fail to detect such temporal features, while for adLIF networks, these gradients are actually biased towards those. Our empirical evaluation supports this claim as adLIF networks excel at the burst sequence detection task (Fig. 6), a task which we designed specifically to test temporal feature detection capabilities of SNNs (Fig. 6). The input-feature analysis for trained adLIF networks further supports this view (Fig. 6 panels b and d). The auto-regressive task on a complex spring-mass system (Fig. 4) can also be seen as a conceptual task designed to investigate the capabilities of SNNs to predict the behavior of complex oscillatory systems. Note that, although the trajectories of masses that have to be predicted are periodic, the period is very long due to the complex interactions of the four masses. This conceptual task is of high relevance as oscillations are ubiquitous in physical systems and biology, for example in limb movement patterns [ref]32 . The superiority of adLIF networks in this task can be explained by the principles of physics-informed neural networks . In this framework, underlying physical laws of some training data are molded into the architecture of neural networks, such that the functions learned by these networks naturally follow these laws. Obviously, the oscillatory sub-threshold behavior of adLIF neurons fits well to the oscillatory dynamics of the spring-mass system. Finally, we empirically demonstrated the robustness of adLIF networks towards perturbations in the input, showcasing their invariance to shifts in the mean input strength. Surprisingly, the accuracy of adLIF networks on the SHD dataset maintained a high level (>80%absentpercent80>80\\%) even after doubling the mean input strength, whereas LIF networks drop to an accuracy of 10%percent1010\\% already for a much lower increase. We argue that this inheritance alleviates the need for layer normalization techniques in other types of artificial and spiking neural networks. Indeed, all our results were achieved without explicit normalization techniques. This finding is in particular relevant for neuromorphic implementations of SNNs, as explicit normalization is hard to implement in neuromorphic hardware, in particular for recurrent SNNs. Oscillatory neural network dynamics have been studied not only in the context of SNNs. Several works    identified favorable properties adopted by models utilizing some form of oscillations. Rusch et al.  for example studied an RNN architecture in which recurrent dynamics were given by the equation of motion of a damped harmonic oscillator. The authors found, that these oscillations not only alleviate the vanishing and exploding gradient problem , but also perform well on a large variety of benchmarks. Effenberger et al.  proposed oscillating networks as a model for cortical columns.\nIn the field of artificial neural networks, the recent advent of state space models  [ref]19   and linear recurrent networks  introduces a paradigm shift in sequence processing, where information is transported through constrained linear state transitions instead of being recurrently propagated between nonlinear neurons, as was previously the case in traditional recurrent neural networks .\nSimilar to SNNs, state space models are obtained by discretizing continuous ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to form recurrent neural networks. Although spiking neuron models have always been derived from discretizing differential equations to obtain recurrent linear state transitions , earlier neuron models, such as the LIF neuron, lack the temporal dynamics necessary to effectively propagate time-sensitive information. The relation between SNNs and state space models has recently been discussed  . In summary, we have shown that networks of adaptive LIF neurons provide a powerful model of computation for neuromorphic systems. Stability issues during training can provably be avoided by the use of a suitable discretization method. Our results indicate that the properties of these neurons, in particular their sub-threshold oscillatory response, provide the basis for their spatio-temporal processing capabilities.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: due to the complex interactions of the four masses.
