      "content": "Paper Title: FusionANNS: An Efficient CPU/GPU Cooperative Processing Architecture for Billion-scale Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn-memory ANNS Solutions. ANNS has been extensively studied for decades, mainly focusing on in-memory indexing techniques   [ref]17  . Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) [ref]17 maintains a multi-layered navigable small-world graph in memory to achieve fast ANNS.\nSpace Partition Tree and Graph (SPTAG)  exploits a relative neighborhood graph and space partition trees to find several seeds for graph traversal acceleration.\nHowever, existing in-memory ANNS algorithms require a large amount of memory resource to maintain both raw vectors and their indices. The huge memory requirement significantly increases the\ntotal cost of ownership, impeding the ANNS scaling to\nlarge-scale datasets. FusionANNS leverages large-capacity SSDs to support large-scale datasets, and achieves both high performance and cost efficiency through multi-tiered indexing-enabled system optimizations.\n SSD-based ANNS Solutions. A number of recent studies have proposed hierarchical indices to reduce memory footprint for billion-scale datasets, such as DiskANN [ref]22, SPANN ,Starling , BBANN , and GRIP [ref]46. These proposals exploits the characteristics of modern SSDs to optimize vector indexing techniques. SmartANNS  explores hierarchical indexing technique for SmartSSD-based ANNS. It leverages the internal PCIe bandwidth of multiple SmartSSDs to alleviate I/O bottlenecks, achieving near-linear scalability for billion-scale ANNS. However, the throughput of SSD-based ANNS system is quite limited due to severe I/O contention among concurrent queries, making them hard to meet the high-throughput requirement.\nFusionANNS significantly reduces I/Os per query through a novel multi-tiered index structure and CPU/GPU collaborative searching, and thus achieves both high throughput and low latency. Accelerator-based ANNS Solutions.\nA few recent studies     exploit GPUs to accelerate the graph traversal involved in graph-based ANNS. Moreover, a number of works have exploited PQ techniques  , GPUs  , and FPGAs    to accelerate IVF-based ANNS. However, most these approaches can only support small-scale datasets due to the limited memory capacity in GPUs and FPGAs     , or can not guarantee high accuracy   . Although state-of-the-art RUMMY  expands GPU memory with host memory and proposes a reordered pipelining technique to support billion-scale datasets, its performance is still limited due to extensive data transmission between CPUs and the GPU. Through a careful collaboration of hierarchical indexing, PQ, and GPU acceleration techniques, FusionANNS can eliminate data swapping between GPUs and CPUs, and thus achieves high-throughput and low-latency ANNS for large-scale datasets while still guaranteeing high accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: In-memory ANNS Solutions.
