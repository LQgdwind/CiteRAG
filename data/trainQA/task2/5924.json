      "content": "Paper Title: On Efficient Training of Large-Scale Deep Learning Models: A Literature Review\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor researchers who want to apply parallel techniques to train large models simply, various existing open-source frameworks provide convenient implementations.\nTo scale from single-GPU to multi-GPU or even multi-machine, it is often a simple matter of importing libraries, defining a training strategy and environment, and wrapping the optimizer.\nBelow we introduce some other platforms, open source frameworks and libraries, and how they benefit (distributed) training of large-scale models.\n\nJAX [ref]16 is a library for machine learning which combines Autograd (an automatic differentiation library) and XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra, a compiler for linear algebra), and provides the same API as NumPy that is compatible with GPU and TPU.\nFor deep learning, especially in the case of using TPUs, JAX-based libraries such as Flax [ref]86, and Haiku  provide deep learning features, and the efficient computation of hessian by JAX is also worth considering. There is a library Mesh-Transformer-JAX  for parallel transformers in JAX and Haiku. In addition, Google recently released ViT-22B using JAX-based library Scenic .\nDeepSpeed  is an open-source PyTorch library for large model training, which provides Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO)   , 3D-parallelism, etc. and is used in BLOOM (176B)  and MT-NLG (530B)  training.\nDeepSpeed’s Data Efficiency library  combines curriculum learning and a random layerwise token dropping technique (random-LTD) .\nRecently, Microsoft launched the TorchScale open source toolkit  for scaling up transformers.\nMeta Research‘s FairScale  is a PyTorch extension library that provides distributed training techniques, such as model parallelism (including the FullyShardedDataParallel, FSDP), activation checkpointing, gradient accumulation, gradient cropping, etc., to improve memory usage and speed up the training process. FairScale also includes some optimizers and schedulers, such as Adascale (large batch optimizer), FusedAdam, FusedSGD, etc., to improve the stability and efficiency of training large models.\nAnother library Fairseq  provides a series of sequence-to-sequence and language model implementations, such as Transformer, RoBERTa , etc., and also provides some tools for data pre-processing and training.\nThere is also xFormers , a library of Transformer building blocks that supports the composable construction of Transformers.\nThe PaddlePaddle platform is a framework designed for parallel distributed deep learning, supporting various deep learning hardware. Related development Kits and the series of work followed by ERNIE  cover a lot of training techniques. Some provide comprehensive operations on the entire process.\nMegatron-LM is the large transformer lib developed by NVIDIA, with a efficient training framework. Also, NVIDIA maintains the Apex  library of tools for mixed precision and distributed training.\nMosaicML’s Composer , a PyTorch library for efficient training which creates an interface for each part of the training process, allowing composing various speedup methods both built-in or customized into the training pipeline to develop efficient training recipes.\nByteDance LightSeq  , an efficient inference and training engine for Transformers.\nBagua  developed by Kuaishou and ETH Zürich, a deep learning training acceleration framework for PyTorch.\nColossal-AI [ref]11, which provides a series of parallel components to build and train distributed AI models. In addition to the 1D tensor parallelism mentioned above, the Colossal-AI [ref]11 platform also integrates 2D, 2.5D, 3D tensor parallelism strategies    and sequence parallelism  that distribute computational and memory load and optimize communication costs further. EleutherAI GPT-NeoX , a library for training large-scale language models on which a 20 billion parameter model GPT-NeoX-20B  is built.\nRay 06, an open-source framework for scaling AI and Python applications like machine learning.\nThe fastai deep learning library built by Howard and Gugger , which provides researchers with components both at high and low levels to build state-of-the-art or configurable approaches.\nOpenBMB BMTrain , a large model training toolkit for efficient training of big models.\nOneFlow-LiBai , which is a large-scale open-source training toolbox that provides 3D-parallelism distributed training and other training techniques.\nHuawei MindSpore , an AI computing framework.\nHorovod 20 hosted by LF AI & Data Foundation, a distributed deep learning framework. In summary, we organize Table 5 to summarize the benefits that each framework library and clearly show their main contributions to efficient training. As we have mentioned, training large models requires a comprehensive use of general techniques. Several deep learning frameworks have been designed to provide efficient support for training accelerations. We focus on valid implementation which could help to achieve higher efficiency. More techniques are still emerging and being explored with prolonged developments.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: and environment, and wrapping the optimizer.\nBelow we introduce some other platforms, open source frameworks and libraries, and how they benefit (distributed) training of large-scale models.\n\nJAX [ref]16 is a library for machine learning which combines Autograd (an automatic differentiation library) and XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra, a compiler for linear algebra), and provides the same API\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
