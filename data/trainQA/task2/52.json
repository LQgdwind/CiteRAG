      "content": "Paper Title: Bayesian Neural Architecture Search using A Training-Free Performance Metric\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe existing literature teaches us on the importance of optimizing the architecture of a deep neural network on a particular problem, including, for example, the type of activation functions, the number of hidden layers, and the number of units for each layer   . For DNNs, the architecture optimization task is usually faced by either manual exploration of the search space (that is usually guided by expert knowledge) or by automatic methods based on optimization algorithms, e.g., grid search, evolutionary algorithms or Bayesian optimization 5. The challenges here are three-fold: firstly, the search space is typically huge due to the fact that the number of the parameters increases in proportion to the number of layers. Secondly, the search space is usually a mixture of real (e.g., the weights), integer (e.g., the number of units in each layer) and categorical (e.g., the type of activation functions) values, resulting in a demanding optimization task: different types of parameters naturally require different approaches for handling them in optimization. Last, the architecture optimization falls into the family of expensive optimization problems as function evaluations in this case are highly time consuming (which is affected both by the size of training data and the depth of the architecture). In this paper, we shall denote the search space of architecture optimization as ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}. The specification of ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} depends on the choice of encoding schemes of the architecture (see Section 3.1). To tackle the mentioned issues, many alternatives have been explored, ranging from reducing the evaluation time of a configuration (e.g., early stopping criteria based on the learning curve  or MRS [ref]7) to evolving the architecture of the network (neuroevolution). On the other hand, when it comes to RNN optimization, there are two particular issues: the exploding and the vanishing gradient . Many alternatives have been proposed to tackle with this problems 7. One of the most popular ones is the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cell . However, in spite of its ability to effectively deal with these issues, the problem still remains open, because the learning process is also affected by the weight initialization strategy 8 and the algorithm parameters .\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: To tackle the mentioned issues, many alternatives have been explored, ranging from reducing the evaluation time of a configuration (e.g., early stopping criteria based on the learning curve  or MRS [ref]7) to evolving the architecture of the network (neuroevolution).
