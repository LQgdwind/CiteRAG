      "content": "Paper Title: IllumiNet: Transferring Illumination from Planar Surfaces to Virtual Objects in Augmented Reality\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe provide qualitative results of all methods in these scenarios, which are shown in the Fig. 7,  8, and 9. As mentioned earlier, our framework relights the object from all directions in 3D space, instead of a single view. Therefore, we also show the back-view of the rendered model in all scenes. We’d like to point out that this step is proven to be quite important. As some methods may perform well on the front, their back-view is not realistic. This problem is particular obvious for Deeplight , which can be seen in both Fig. 7 and 8, as their back-view results look relatively dark compared to the Ground Truth(GT) or other methods. We believe that this may be caused by their training data, which were captured with the mobile phone camera from a very close distance to the light probe. In such a set-up, if there is a strong light source, e.g. the sun, locating just behind the light probe seeing from the camera view, the generated environment map would fail to record this light source. This may explain why the back-views of their results are relatively dark. It shows that capturing HDR environment maps with light probes may bring problems which have been overlooked by previous works. Meanwhile, observed from Fig 7, outdoor methods based on sun and sky-model  [ref]17 are difficult to generate satisfactory results if the sun is not seen from the input image. This is due to the nature of their methods. As a matter of fact, there are many outdoor images captured without the sun or sky. So this is one limitation of such methods. Especially in the third row, as discussed in Fig.7 & 8 of  [ref]5, we observed that the back-view of GT is bright, because there is a strong light source, sun, above the building. . Similar with [ref]13, our method also has the spatially-varying capability. For different locations on a same image, the rendered model appears differently according to its relative position to the light sources. Although our improvement may not look so significant compareed to the results of  [ref]13 in Fig. 9, their method is meant for indoor scenes only. This makes our method more robust as it works in outdoors as well. We further conduct a user study to evaluate the realism of results. Users were shown pairs of images with inserted objects and asked to pick the more realistic ones. Each pair was either rendered with GT lighting or the prediction from one of  [ref]13 [ref]17. A total number of 170 unique participants took part in the study, and 17 scenes with inserted virtual objects were given. Results are given as percentages, denoting the fraction that each method was preferred to the GT illumination (the higher the better). For spatially-varying data (e.g. Fig. 9), our method achieved 32.5% , compared to 28% for [ref]13. For the rest data, our method achieved 48.8%, compared to 39.6% for  and 41.4% for [ref]17. Overall, users had a higher preference for our predictions. Limitations: Since our framework is geometry-based, it requires retraining for each new type of virtual objects. For each 3D model shown in Fig. 10, the training takes around four hours on our server. However we’d like to mention that for most AR applications, the virtual objects are already installed or pre-defined. That is to say, the geometries are known in advance and offline training is practical.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: that capturing HDR environment maps with light probes may bring problems which have been overlooked by previous works.
