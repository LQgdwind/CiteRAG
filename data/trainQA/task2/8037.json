Hern√°ndez-Tello, M.A. Mart√≠nez-del-Amor, D. Orellana-Mart√≠n, F.G.C. Cabarle, Sparse Spiking Neural-Like Membrane Systems on Graphics Processing Unit. International Journal of Neural Systems 34, 07 (2024), 2450038. https://doi.org/10.1142/S0129065724500382\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper, GPU implementations of compressed matrix representations for SNP systems are introduced. The first version is tested with a family of SNP systems sorting natural numbers in parallel, and a solution to the NP-complete problem Subset Sum. It is reported up to 83√ó\\times of speedup of the Compressed method compared to sparse representation, and 34√ó\\times of ELL against Sparse (for Sort example on 500 numbers). The proposed formats not only enable speedups, but also to scale to larger instances, as tested with an A100 80GB. For the Subset Sum example, up to 3.5√ó\\times of speedup is reported. Although both examples have a maximum out degree in the neurons (zùëßz) equal to the instance size (nùëõn), the compression ratio is slightly higher for Subset sum problem according to the experiments. However, the achieved speedup is higher for the Sorting problem. This fact indicates that Subset sum example is less sparse than the Sorting one: the amount of work remaining in compressed matrices is less accelerated on GPUs, plus requiring to handle with delays. The results can be further improved. The future plan is to optimize the kernels, putting more efforts on improving the parallelism to better fit the GPU architecture, such as the new sparse capabilities in Tensor Cores. Other examples are being tested with our simulators to better characterize them, such as sorting networks. Moreover, the simulators are being extended to support SNP systems with dynamic structures (budding, division and plasticity) and supporting non-deterministic solutions. For instance, it was shown that the idea of synapse plasticity (adding or removing synapses alone) can be better suited for GPU implementation, compared to adding or removing both neurons and synapses. Furthermore, we aim to handle a more general type of regular expression, denoted as type four (4), of the form ai‚Äã(aj)‚àósuperscriptùëéùëñsuperscriptsuperscriptùëéùëóa^{i}(a^{j})^{*} where j‚â•0ùëó0j\\geq 0 and i‚â•1ùëñ1i\\geq 1, and ‚àó* can be replaced with ++. Later, perhaps type 4 expressions are enough for simulations, instead of supporting three types of expressions in Section 2. Recently it was shown that type 4 expressions are enough for SNP systems to maintain Turing completeness. The present work can also be used to improve the automatic design of SNP systems, especially on GPUs. More types of SNP systems can be also considered for this representation, starting by improving the representation for SN P systems with plasticity, other variants mentioned in recent surveys , including recent results on some variants.. The main target is also to provide a flexible framework to simulate SNP systems, by providing an API in common languages such as Python or C++, in order to programmatically define and simulate SNP systems. This is inspired from modern Deep Learning frameworks such as Keras and PyTorch. P-Lingua 5 will be also employed in order to define the SNP models from text files with a syntax close to the one used by model designers.\nIn this way, our target framework can be used as a main component for real world applications with SNP systems and variants, such as edge detection, data forecasting , classification with supervised learning, cryptosystems, robots, sentiment analysis.\nThe work presented in this paper offers a promising impact on both runtime and memory improvements on such real world problems.\nTogether with the development of our target framework we also aim to include an interactive and visual component  : in this way users can easily perform experiments without having deep knowledge of GPUs and matrix representations. The experiments here presented focus mainly on CUDA GPUs. Such GPUs currently provide the best experience to researchers in terms of programming and technical support for massively scalable and parallel computing. Despite the focus of the experiments in CUDA GPUs, this work should still be applicable to other SPMD or SIMD GPUs or processors. Therefore, in order to reach a larger amount of users, it is also proposed to consider open GPU standards like OpenCL and SYCL, as well as ROCm for AMD GPUs.\nFor instance, a preliminary work exists[ref]50 on an OpenCL simulator. As a general remark, it can be concluded that spiking neural P system model is convenient for parallelization, since deciding whether a neuron spikes (and by which rule) does not depend on other neurons, while updating a configuration can be realized by scatter operations (e.g. atomic operations on GPUs) . Nevertheless, synchronization is necessary between the transition steps, and between choosing the spiking vector and updating the configuration.\nDetailed comparisons in the theory and practice of SN P systems and SNNs is of great interest, such as training and learning algorithms.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: Therefore, in order to reach a larger amount of users, it is also proposed to consider open GPU standards like OpenCL and SYCL, as well as ROCm for AMD GPUs.\nFor instance, a preliminary work exists[ref]50 on an OpenCL simulator.
