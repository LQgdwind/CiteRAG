      "content": "Paper Title: BOME! Bilevel Optimization Made Easy: A Simple First-Order Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe consider the bilevel optimization (BO) problem: where the goal is to minimize an outer objective f𝑓f whose variables include the solution of another minimization problem w.r.t an inner objective g𝑔g.\nThe θ𝜃\\theta and v𝑣v are the inner and outer variables, respectively. We assume that v∈ℝm,θ∈ℝnformulae-sequence𝑣superscriptℝ𝑚𝜃superscriptℝ𝑛v\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m},\\theta\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n} and that\ng​(v,⋅)𝑔𝑣⋅g(v,\\cdot) attains a minimum for each v𝑣v. BO is useful in a variety of machine learning tasks.\nA canonical example is hyperparameter optimization,\nin which case f𝑓f (resp. g𝑔g) is the validation (resp. training) loss associated with a model parameter θ𝜃\\theta and\na hyperparameter v𝑣v, and we want to find the optimal hyperparameter v𝑣v to minimize the validation loss f𝑓f when θ𝜃\\theta is determined by minimizing the training loss; see e.g., Pedregosa , Franceschi et al. [ref]12.\nOther applications include meta learning [ref]12, continual learning , reinforcement learning , and adversarial learning [ref]23. See Liu et al.  for a recent survey. BO is notoriously challenging due to its nested nature.\nDespite the large literature, most existing methods for BO are slow and unsatisfactory in various ways.\nFor example, a major class of BO methods is based on direct gradient descent on the outer variable v𝑣v while viewing the optimal inner variable θ∗​(v)=arg⁡minθ⁡g​(v,θ)superscript𝜃𝑣subscript𝜃𝑔𝑣𝜃\\theta^{*}(v)=\\arg\\min_{\\theta}g(v,\\theta) as a (uniquely defined) function of v𝑣v.\nThe key difficulty is to calculate the derivative ∇vθ∗​(v)subscript∇𝑣superscript𝜃𝑣\\nabla_{v}\\theta^{*}(v) which may require expensive manipulation of the Hessian matrix of g𝑔g via the implicit differentiation theorem.\nAnother approach is to replace the low level optimization with the stationary condition ∇θg​(v,θ)=0subscript∇𝜃𝑔𝑣𝜃0\\nabla_{\\theta}g(v,\\theta)=0.\nThis still requires Hessian information,\nand more importantly, is unsuitable for nonconvex g𝑔g since it allows θ𝜃\\theta to be any stationary point of g​(v,⋅)𝑔𝑣⋅g(v,\\cdot), not necessarily a minimizer.\nTo the best of our knowledge,\nthe only existing fully first-order BO algorithms111By fully first-order, we mean methods that only require information of f,g,∇f,∇g𝑓𝑔∇𝑓∇𝑔f,g,\\nabla f,\\nabla g, so this excludes methods that apply auto-differentiation or conjugate gradient that need multiple steps of matrix-vector computation. are BSG-1  and\nBVFSM with its variants   ; but BSG-1 relies on a non-vanishing approximation that does not yield convergence to the correct solution in general, and BVFSM is sensitive to hyper-parameters on large-scale practical problems and lacks a complete non-asymptotic analysis for the practically implemented algorithm. In this work, we seek a simple and fast fully first-order BO method that can be used with non-convex functions including those appear in deep learning applications.\nThe idea is to reformulate (1) as a single-level constrained optimization problem\nusing the so-called value-function-based approach  . The constrained problem is then solved by stopping gradient on the single variable that contains the higher-order information and applying a simple first-order dynamic barrier gradient descent method based on a method of Gong et al. [ref]16. Our contributions are: 1) we introduce a novel and fast BO method by applying a modified dynamic barrier gradient descent on the value-function reformulation of BO; 2) Theoretically, we establish the non-asymptotic convergence of our method to local stationary points (as measured by a special KKT loss) for non-convex f𝑓f and g𝑔g. Importantly, to the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to establish non-asymptotic convergence rate for a fully first-order BO method.\nThis result is also much beyond that of Gong et al. [ref]16 and Ji et al. . 3) Empirically, the proposed method achieves better or comparable performance while being more efficient than state-of-the-art BO methods on a variety of benchmarks.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: v𝑣v, and we want to find the optimal hyperparameter v𝑣v to minimize the validation loss f𝑓f when θ𝜃\\theta is determined by minimizing the training loss; see e.g., Pedregosa , Franceschi et al.
