      "content": "Paper Title: Group-wise Inhibition based Feature Regularization for Robust Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have led to far-reaching improvements in computer vision tasks [ref]11 .\nHowever, vulnerability of CNNs to image variations, including image corruptions [ref]10 and adversarial samples , has not been well resolved yet. Researchers are thus exploring various ways to improve the network robustness against these variations. Adversarial training [ref]10  [ref]30 is a typical solution to improve the robustness of CNNs, which includes the attacked samples into the training data, as shown in Fig. 1 (b).\nSince adversarial training may impair the generalization performance,\nthere is often an inherent trade-off between classification accuracy and adversarial robustness [ref]30 .\nIn order to improve the robustness and generalization simultaneously, data augmentation and regularization methods (e.g. Random Erasing , Augmix , Cutout, Dropout  and DeepAugmentation) are proposed. As shown in Fig. 1 (c), these algorithms address data augmentation by randomly generating new samples obeying the same distribution as the training data. Generally, data regularization methods are state-agnostic, which can not be dynamically adjusted during CNN training.\nThus, these regularization techniques of CNNs\n    failed to learn features with sufficient diversity.\nAs shown in the first row of Fig. 2, CNNs can locate the most discriminative regions  for both single-instance and multi-instance samples with the regularization method, while neglecting other auxiliary features that are critical for the recognition.\nThe lack of auxiliary features may lead to insufficient feature diversity, which consequently results in a feature space\nwith low-dimension for classification and limits the robustness.\nMeanwhile, current adversarial training and regularization methods concentrate on the global image information by expanding the training set, while the independence of local features is not fully explored.\nThese limitations motivate us to improve the diversity of extracted features by CNNs and devise a non-image-wise regularization strategy to enhance network robustness. In this paper, we propose a group-wise inhibition based regularization method for improving feature diversity and network robustness, denoted as TENET Training.\nFig.1 (d1), (d2) and (d3) show the motivation of the proposed method, where the increase of feature dimension and diversity is beneficial for classification robustness against input variations and adversarial attacks.\nTo increase feature representation space, group-wise feature regularization is proposed to leverage the independence among group-wise features. To improve feature diversity, the proposed algorithm regularizes group-wise features dynamically in each training step.\nSpecifically, based on the grouping of feature maps and their importance evaluation, the group-wise reversed map is proposed to suppress the activation values corresponding to the most significant discriminative regions, and\nguide the network to learn more auxiliary information in less significant regions.\nAs shown in the second row of Fig. 2, the suppression of most significant discriminative regions is beneficial for exploring more diverse features in CNNs.\nExperimental results show that the proposed method can improve the top-1 error rate of adversarial training from 36.37% to 31.75%, and outperforms regularization methods significantly in terms of classification accuracy based on small sample. In summary, A group-wise inhibition based regularization method is proposed to explore auxiliary features and promote feature diversity. Feature maps with different activation distribution are processed separately to learn richer discriminative features hierarchically to better represent images. Our proposed method achieves competitive performances in terms of adversarial robustness and generalization compared with related variants and the state of the arts.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: Recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have led to far-reaching improvements in computer vision tasks [ref]11 .\nHowever, vulnerability of CNNs to image variations, including image corruptions [ref]10 and adversarial samples , has not been well resolved yet.
