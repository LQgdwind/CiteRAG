      "content": "Paper Title: One Timestep is all you need: Training Spiking Neural Networks with Ultra Low Latency\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nANN-SNN Conversion. A widely used approach of obtaining deep SNNs involves training an ANN\nand converting to SNN for finetuning  [ref]13 . To minimize conversion loss, the ANNs are usually trained without bias, batch-norm or maxpooling layers, though some works bypass these constraints using custom layers [ref]21. Proper layerwise threshold adjustment is critical to convert ANNs to SNNs successfully. One approach of threshold balancing is to choose the layerwise thresholds as the maximum pre-activation of the neurons . While this provides high accuracy, the associated drawback is high inference latency (about 1000 timesteps). Alternatively, [ref]21 suggest choosing a certain percentile of the pre-activation distribution as the threshold to reduce inference latency and improve robustness. However, these conversion based methods [ref]21  still require few hundred timesteps to perform satisfactorily. Backpropagation from Scratch and Hybrid Training. An alternate route of training SNNs with reduced latency is learning from scratch using backpropagation (bp). To circumvent the challenge posed by non-differentiability of the spike function, surrogate gradient based optimization\nhas been proposed  to implement bp in SNNs effectively  .  propose surrogate gradient based bp on the membrane potential, while\n perform bp based on the gradients calculated using the difference between the membrane potential and the threshold, but results seem limited to MNIST using shallow architectures.  also perform backpropagation through time (BPTT) on SNNs with a surrogate gradient defined on the continuous-valued membrane potential. Overall, surrogate-gradients based BPTT training has resulted in SNNs with high accuracy, but the training is very compute\nintensive compared to conversion techniques and the latency is still significant (∼similar-to\\sim100-125 timesteps).\n propose a hybrid approach where a pre-trained ANN is used as initialization for subsequent surrogate gradient SNN learning. This hybrid approach improves upon conversion by reducing latency and speeds up convergence of direct bp from scratch method. Temporal Encoding. A different approach to train SNNs is based on the timing of spike of neurons. Temporal coding schemes such as phase  or burst  coding attempt to capture temporal information into the spike trains, but incur high latency and large number of spikes. A related method is time-to-first-spike (TTFS) coding  , where each neuron is allowed to spike just once but the high latency persists.\n propose using relative timing of spikes to encode information, but only report results for simple tasks like MNIST and its scalability to deeper architectures and more complex datasets remains unclear. Notably, since our proposed scheme enables one step inference, the neurons are automatically limited to maximum one spike per neuron, however our latency is significantly lower. Direct Encoding. The analog pixels are directly applied to the 1st convolutional layer in direct encoding [ref]21  [ref]18 . Using this method, [ref]18 achieve competitive performance on ImageNet using just 5 timesteps. Again, threshold-dependent batch normalization is employed together with direct encoding by  to obtain high performing SNNs with 6 timesteps only. Inspired by such promising performance, we adopt the direct encoding method in this work.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: ANN-SNN Conversion.
