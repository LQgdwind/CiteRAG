      "content": "Paper Title: GGT: Graph-Guided Testing for Adversarial Sample Detection of Deep Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTesting for DNN models aims to find bugs (adversarial samples) or evaluate the quality of a test set, based on which we can fix the model and avoid vulnerabilities being exploited. Quite recently, DNN testing technologies are continuously developed for adversarial sample detection. Guo et al.  proposed a testing framework to detect logical bugs, crashes, and Not-a-Number (NaN) errors in deep learning models. However, their work only involves software-level bugs, but cannot detect bugs (adversarial samples) hidden in the model structure and weights. Ma et al.  found that adversarial samples have different activation patterns from normal ones, and thus introduced invariant checking for adversarial sample detection. Yin et al. [ref]38 thought that adversarial and normal samples can be distinguished in the input subspace, i.e., adversarial samples are closer to the decision boundary, based on which they trained a number of detectors using asymmetrical adversarial training. Wang et al. [ref]19 proposed that for a normal input, a deep learning model should process it with increasing confidence. They dissected the middle layers of DNN to generate a set of sub-models whose prediction profile for the input can be used to determine whether the corresponding input is within the processing capacity of the model, then a sample is considered as normal if it is within the handling capabilities of the sub-models, otherwise, it is adversarial. Zhang et al.  investigated the uncertainty patterns between normal samples and adversarial samples, raised an automated testing technique to generate testing samples with diverse uncertainty patterns. Their work mainly focuses on providing a high quality testing dataset and evaluating existing defense techniques. However, detecting DNN bugs is not easy, Carlini and Wagner [ref]40 evaluated ten detection methods proposed in the past years on different threat models and found that six of them are significantly less effective under generic attacks. Moreover, with a white-box attack that designed for penetrating a given defense mechanism, half of the methods fail to provide robustness, three increase robustness slightly, and two only works on simple datasets. All of the evaluated methods are based on a single model, and their criteria can be easily added to the penalty of adversarial sample generation to bypass the detection mechanism. We argue that the testing methods based on multiple models, such as MMT, can be more robust in adversarial sample detection. In fact, MMT indeed achieves SOTA performance in detecting various adversarial samples, when it integrates enough mutated models. However, each coin has two sides, and the huge resource cost may hinder its wide application. This is the reason why we propose GGT in this paper, which is based on multiple pruned models, and much simpler than MMT, making it more applicable in reality.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: and weights.
