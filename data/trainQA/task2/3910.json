      "content": "Paper Title: A Computational Framework of Cortical Microcircuits Approximates Sign-concordant Random Backpropagation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nArtificial intelligence has gained remarkable achievements in recent years    , and learning by backpropagation (BP)  is one of the most popular methods. However, BP is generally believed to be impossible in the brain for many reasons   [ref]8  0, among these, one key reason is that it requires symmetrical weights between forward and backward paths (also known as the weight transport problem) to propagate correct error information   1 2.\nMany works tried to mitigate this constraint, including feedback alignment (FA) [ref]8 and direct feedback alignment (DFA) . Both FA and DFA used random weights to backpropagate error information, where FA and its variants 3 4 5 backpropagate error layer-by-layer, and DFA broadcasts error to each layer directly. Both FA and DFA interestingly revealed and brought much attention to how brains might implement BP. However, there are still many unsolved issues towards fully bio-plausible algorithms. We conclude these issues as the followings: 1) BP uses different rules in forward- and backward-propagation. The forward signal goes through a non-linear function, while the backward signal is multiplied by the derivative of this non-linear function 6 7.\n2) BP requires activation and error signals to coexist in one neuron. New insights regarding how neuron achieves this remain as an important yet underdeveloped topic 6 8 9 0 1 2 3.\n3) BP asks for separate forward and backward phases. A bio-plausible approach should eliminate this constraint like previous works 6 4.\n4) BP usually violates Dale’s principle 5 6. Dale’s principle requires all synapses from the same cell to have the same sign - a strong biological constraint that can compromise network performance 4 and has been omitted in previous works [ref]8 4 6 7 7. Cornford et al.8 tackled this issue on artificial neural networks (ANNs).\n5) BP does not take into account the existence of various neuron types 9. Understanding how different types of biological neurons cooperate to enable learning is fundamentally important in neuroscience 6 7.\n6) BP lacks spike-timing level understanding 7 0 1. Instead of revising BP, we integrate biological observations and devise a hypothetical framework consisting of a new architecture and its supporting learning rules that can address all of these major issues above. We demonstrate that it is possible to realize bio-plausible random error backpropagation entirely based on neuroscience facts. we summarize our main contributions as follows: We hypothesize several microcircuit architectures including various types of spike-timing based neurons and their special connectivity abiding by Dale’s Principle. We enable error backpropagation with spikes and provide a new model of how neurons achieve this through their internal dynamics. We present a pointwise SOM model, and a supporting assembly competition mechanism to form pairs between SOM and Pyr cells automatically. We propose a general local learning rule, which applies Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning on synapses that connect to basal and apical dendrites respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: achievements in recent years    , and learning by backpropagation (BP)  is one of the most popular methods.
