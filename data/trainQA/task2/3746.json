      "content": "Paper Title: PDNPulse: Sensing PCB Anomaly with the Intrinsic Power Delivery Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nModern consumer electronics brands depend on a continually growing global supply chain. The number of suppliers for a large smartphone manufacturer such as Samsung reaches into the several thousand and stretches across roughly 70 countries at more than 200 different locations . And while it behooves each company to enlist trustworthy vendors, the sheer number of them and scope of global operations precludes thoroughly vetting everyone involved. Trustworthy vendors are paramount for the development of reliable and robust products. Nowhere is this more important than in critical infrastructures such as power grids or water treatment facilities, in privacy compliance relating to healthcare and financial institutions, or in national defense. Issues in the supply chain are inherently pervasive due to their scope and come with profound consequences. Direct losses and risk from counterfeiting in the global supply chain are estimated to cost billions of dollars annually . The United States alone, which outspends the next 11 richest countries combined on defense, allocates roughly 40% of its military budget on electronics . A fact that has prompted recent legislation requiring both the Pentagon and Department of Defense to take steps to guarantee the security of its supply chain . The issue extends beyond even reliability, with recent news of maliciously implanted microchips in Supermicro server motherboard that allowed the successful infiltration of nearly 30 companies . Despite their ubiquity, detecting both counterfeiting and PCB Trojans remains an open problem. This is, in part, due to the complexity of the global supply chain market itself. Accounting for every potential point-of-failure or susceptibility is impractical. Efforts have been made in academia to classify state-of-the-art threats and defenses . Still, the work is perennially ongoing and largely unsystematic because of different attack vectors that prevent generalization.\nAlthough prior research has been presented on detecting counterfeits, and several robust solutions exist that focus on anomaly detection  or authentication , unfortunately, these solutions are often inherently incapable of detecting PCB Trojans. For example, embedded signature-based authentication that uses the delay of the JTAG scan chain across the PCB  can only protect complex logic ICs with the JTAG feature, and is insensitive to PCB Trojans that avoid impacting the JTAG scan chain.\n Several previous works   propose using changes in radio wave propagation within an enclosed system to detect PCB in-field tampering events. However, these methods are not suitable for detecting supply chain attacks, such as Trojans or counterfeits, as they require a metal casing around the system for detection. To address threats in the PCB supply chain, this paper presents PDNPulse, a novel board-level anomaly detection\nframework that can identify PCB hardware Trojans, on-board counterfeit chips/components, and counterfeit PCBs. PDNPulse leverages the inherent sensitivity of the on-board power delivery network (PDN) to assure that a PCB is free from anomalies by comparing its PDN with the one of a genuine PCB. The framework relies fundamentally on the uniqueness of PDN characteristics and profiling PDN in the frequency domain.\nPDNPulse can monitor a range of subtle malicious changes in the PDN impedance profile, making it ideal for accurately identifying board-level anomalies at multiple stages in the supply chain and across different systems. This capability rests on the fact that the PDN is interconnected with all subsystems on the board to provide power throughout its lifetime. In our analysis, we have found that PCB anomalies tend to inevitably affect the PDN and are therefore detectable by PDNPulse. A PDN in a complex PCB design often consists of subnets from several different voltage domains, with voltage regulator modules (VRMs) in each domain to supply the stable voltages, power traces from the VRMs to connect the chip pins, on-chip power grids to distribute power locally on the die, and decoupling capacitors to mitigate the voltage fluctuations at various PDN stages .\nAll PDN components are connected across multiple levels (e.g., chip, package, board) of the system and form a tree structure to create multiple voltage domains, each with its own VRMs to drive the local supply voltages .\nIn modern electronic systems, the PDN requires low impedance to provide an adequate supply noise margin, a requirement that makes it sensitive to minute modifications.\nHence, even minuscule changes to the PCB can affect the PDN characteristics that are detectable by accurate PDN measurements.\nOn the other hand, the PDN is robust to variations in the PCB manufacturing process, which are distinguishable from malicious changes when profiled in the frequency domain. To the best of our knowledge, PDNPulse is the first general board-level anomaly detection method that can be used for monitoring full-system, cross-layer behavior. Several recent approaches  [ref]55 have proposed PDN impedance-based detection, but do not achieve general, full-system, or cross-layer anomaly detection. Nishizawa et al.,  models the PDN as a resistor and capacitor in parallel, and measure the PDN capacitance by injecting a single-frequency sine wave and measuring the corresponding amplitude of the current. They demonstrate detection of an anomalous capacitor as low as 0.1​μ​F0.1𝜇𝐹0.1\\mu F. Wang et al., [ref]55 indirectly measure the PDN impedance at resonant frequency to detect counterfeit PCBs by proposing a ring oscillator (RO) array embedded in integrated circuit (IC). They leverage the fact that when the IC is clocked at the resonant frequency of the PCB’s PDN (e.g., red dot in Fig. 1(c)), the observed supply voltage fluctuations are mainly affected by the PCB PDN impedance. This is measurable as changes in the oscillation frequency of the embedded RO and allows anomaly detection by comparison with a trusted database. This solution further allows authentication by clocking the IC at non-resonant frequencies so that the embedded RO acts as a physically unclonable function (PUF). PDNPulse, on the other hand, analyzes the PDN using a complex model that includes the parasitics of each on-board component (see Fig. 3(c)) using the complete PDN impedance profile in the frequency domain.\nAs a result, we demonstrate significantly improved detection sensitivity of anomalously inserted capacitance as low as 1.8​f​F1.8𝑓𝐹1.8fF.111The value is an order-of-magnitude smaller than the parasitic of the 3pin SOT-23 package, one of the smallest chip package footprints (2.6mm×\\times2.9mm).\nBoth  [ref]55 are currently only capable of detecting anomalies in one voltage domain using one (or two) frequency points.\nAnomalies in other voltage domains or placed far from the measured ports in those defenses can possibly evade detection due to isolation effects of the VRMs and decoupling capacitors, or motivated attackers that shift the affected frequency band of their malicious insertion to bypass detection.\nTo solve this challenge, we extend the traditional PDN analysis  by using multi-domain multi-port detection and measuring both self- and transfer PDN impedance.\nWhat is more, based on the designed probe, PDNPulse does not require any embedded, or otherwise, hardware modifications.\nThis feature allows flexibility of detection within varying phases of the supply chain, in the field, and on legacy systems without an existing defense.\nIn addition, detection in  [ref]55 fails to recognize that in frequency-domain\nPDN analysis, malicious modifications with minimal parasitics are still observable as shifted PDN profiles with discernible\nmagnitudes  at high frequencies. This property facilitates\nPDNPulse’s detection sensitivity and allows us to employ a pattern-based method using Frechet distance, decreasing the possibility of evasion and increasing the robustness to PCB process variations. In general, we demonstrate that PDNPulse provides\nbroad assurance for commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) electronics across all design layers in the supply chain. The contributions of this work are summarized as follows:\n We coalesce different board-level attack effects using PDN impedance profiling and multi-port, multi-domain PDN measurement methodologies for systematic detection. We propose PDNPulse, the first general board-level attack detection framework used for monitoring full-system, cross-layer behavior. We present the workflow of PDNPulse, providing comprehensive setup and procedural guidance. We also design a custom probe for PDNPulse that achieves good trade-offs among accuracy, error, and ease-of-use. We develop a modified Frechet distance to evaluate the minute differences between the PDNs on two PCBs, which also serves as the security metric. Based on our approach, we develop robust algorithms for both anomaly detection and board classification. We present extensive experimental results and analysis of PDNPulse on a wide-range of custom and COTS PCBs. In so doing, we cover different design scales and attack types that demonstrably validate the sensitivity and robustness of PDNPulse for the majority of board-level attacks.\n\nReference markers found: [55]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]55: domain.
