      "content": "Paper Title: Presheaf automata\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section we define languages of presheaf automata and show how\nthey can be computed from the paths accepted by these automata. The language of a 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}-automaton X𝑋X is the set of all track objects of accepting tracks: If f:Y→X:𝑓→𝑌𝑋f:Y\\to X is a map of 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}-automata,\nthen 𝖫𝖺𝗇𝗀​(Y)⊆𝖫𝖺𝗇𝗀​(X)𝖫𝖺𝗇𝗀𝑌𝖫𝖺𝗇𝗀𝑋\\mathsf{Lang}(Y)\\subseteq\\mathsf{Lang}(X). If Γ∈𝖫𝖺𝗇𝗀​(Y)Γ𝖫𝖺𝗇𝗀𝑌\\Gamma\\in\\mathsf{Lang}(Y), then there exists a map 𝜶:Γ→Y:𝜶→Γ𝑌\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}:\\Gamma\\to Y.\nThus f∘𝜶𝑓𝜶f\\circ\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} is a map Γ→X→Γ𝑋\\Gamma\\to X and hence Γ∈𝖫𝖺𝗇𝗀​(X)Γ𝖫𝖺𝗇𝗀𝑋\\Gamma\\in\\mathsf{Lang}(X).\n∎ In our formalism, the language of a standard\nautomaton is formed by “linear” automata rather than words. This\nis of course the same thing. The language of the standard\nautomaton of Example 4.2, for instance, is Languages of □□\\square-automata can be seen as sets of “shapes”.\nThe language of the □□\\square-automaton from Example\n5.2, for instance, is Track objects in □□\\square correspond to ipomsets over a one-letter\nalphabet [ref]8. Note that an ipomset is a tuple\n(P,<,⇢,S,T)𝑃⇢𝑆𝑇(P,{<},{\\dashrightarrow},S,T), where P𝑃P is a finite set, << and\n⇢⇢\\dashrightarrow are partial orders on P𝑃P and S,T⊆P𝑆𝑇𝑃S,T\\subseteq P are\nsubsets of the sets of <<-minimal and <<-maximal elements of P𝑃P,\nrespectively (compared to [ref]8 we disregard the\nlabelling function). In terms of ipomsets, the above language is ⊤ ⊤ Elements of T𝑇T are marked by ⊤top\\top and all the sets S𝑆S are empty. Alternatively, languages can be described using accepting paths. In\nthe definition below we use the adjunction between categories\n𝐏𝐒𝐡​(𝒞)𝐏𝐒𝐡𝒞\\mathbf{PSh}({\\mathcal{C}}) and 𝐝𝐂𝐚𝐭↓𝒞↓𝐝𝐂𝐚𝐭𝒞\\mathbf{dCat}{\\downarrow}\\mathcal{C} from Proposition 3.5. The canonical section of a path ω:ℐ→𝒞:𝜔→ℐ𝒞\\omega:\\mathcal{I}\\to\\mathcal{C} is the\npath κω:ℐ→𝖤​ω^:subscript𝜅𝜔→ℐ𝖤^𝜔\\kappa_{\\omega}:\\mathcal{I}\\to\\mathsf{E}{\\widehat{\\omega}} given by the unit\nof the adjunction. Let\nω=(→+d10[ref]1→+d20←-d11[ref]1→+d10←-d121)𝜔subscriptsuperscript𝑑01→delimited-[]0delimited-[]1subscriptsuperscript𝑑02→delimited-[]2subscriptsuperscript𝑑11←delimited-[]1subscriptsuperscript𝑑01→delimited-[]2subscriptsuperscript𝑑112←delimited-[]0\\omega=(\\xrightarrow[\\raisebox{2.0pt}[1.0pt][0.0pt]{\\scriptsize$+$}]{d^{0}_{1}}[ref]1\\xrightarrow[\\raisebox{2.0pt}[1.0pt][0.0pt]{\\scriptsize$+$}]{d^{0}_{2}}\\xleftarrow[\\raisebox{2.0pt}[1.0pt][0.0pt]{\\scriptsize$-$}]{d^{1}_{1}}[ref]1\\xrightarrow[\\raisebox{2.0pt}[1.0pt][0.0pt]{\\scriptsize$+$}]{d^{0}_{1}}\\xleftarrow[\\raisebox{2.0pt}[1.0pt][0.0pt]{\\scriptsize$-$}]{d^{1}_{12}}) be the path from Example\n7.4. The following picture shows the canonical\nsection κωsubscript𝜅𝜔\\kappa_{\\omega} on ω^^𝜔\\widehat{\\omega} on the\nleft and values of ω^^𝜔\\widehat{\\omega} on the right: For a 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}-presheaf X𝑋X let\n𝖯𝖺𝗍𝗁​(X):=𝖯𝖺𝗍𝗁​(𝖤​X)assign𝖯𝖺𝗍𝗁𝑋𝖯𝖺𝗍𝗁𝖤𝑋\\mathsf{Path}(X):=\\mathsf{Path}(\\mathsf{E}{X}) denote the category of paths in X𝑋X. For a path ω:ℐ→𝒞:𝜔→ℐ𝒞\\omega:\\mathcal{I}\\to\\mathcal{C}, the set of all paths with “shape” ω𝜔\\omega on X𝑋X is defined as The middle equation holds because the d-structure on 𝖤​X𝖤𝑋\\mathsf{E}X is induced by the projection on 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}. For a path ω∈𝐝𝐂𝐚𝐭​(ℐ,𝒞)𝜔𝐝𝐂𝐚𝐭ℐ𝒞\\omega\\in\\mathbf{dCat}(\\mathcal{I},\\mathcal{C}) and X∈𝐏𝐒𝐡​(𝒞)𝑋𝐏𝐒𝐡𝒞X\\in\\mathbf{PSh}({\\mathcal{C}}) the maps are inverses. This is an immediate consequence of the adjunction (2.6).\n∎ We can now show that languages of 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}-automata can be computed from\ntheir accepting paths. For every X∈𝐏𝐀𝐮𝐭​(𝒞)𝑋𝐏𝐀𝐮𝐭𝒞X\\in\\mathbf{PAut}({\\mathcal{C}}), Lemma 8.7 exhibits a bijection between\nω𝜔\\omega-shaped paths on X𝑋X and tracks ω^→X→^𝜔𝑋\\widehat{\\omega}\\to X. Yet\nthere is no equivalence between all paths and all tracks on X𝑋X: a\ntrack object Γ∈𝖳𝗋𝖮​(𝒞)Γ𝖳𝗋𝖮𝒞\\Gamma\\in\\mathsf{TrO}(\\mathcal{C}) can be generated by different\npaths in 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} (Γ≃ω^≃η^similar-to-or-equalsΓ^𝜔similar-to-or-equals^𝜂\\Gamma\\simeq\\widehat{\\omega}\\simeq\\widehat{\\eta} for\nω≄ηnot-similar-to-or-equals𝜔𝜂\\omega\\not\\simeq\\eta) and then a track\n𝜶:Γ→X:𝜶→Γ𝑋\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}:\\Gamma\\to X corresponds to different paths\n(namely,\n𝖤​(𝜶)∘κω≠𝖤​(𝜶)∘κη𝖤𝜶subscript𝜅𝜔𝖤𝜶subscript𝜅𝜂\\mathsf{E}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha})\\circ\\kappa_{\\omega}\\neq\\mathsf{E}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha})\\circ\\kappa_{\\eta}). Example\n7.3, for instance, provides three different paths\n(α𝛼\\alpha, β𝛽\\beta, γ𝛾\\gamma) with isomorphic tracks.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: can be seen as sets of “shapes”.\nThe language of the □□\\square-automaton from Example\n5.2, for instance, is Track objects in □□\\square correspond to ipomsets over a one-letter\nalphabet [ref]8. Note that an ipomset is a tuple\n(P,<,⇢,S,T)𝑃⇢𝑆𝑇(P,{<},{\\dashrightarrow},S,T), where P𝑃P is a finite set, << and\n⇢⇢\\dashrightarrow are partial orders on P𝑃P and S,T⊆P𝑆𝑇𝑃S,T\\subseteq P\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
