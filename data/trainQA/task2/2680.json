      "content": "Paper Title: Formalizing and Estimating Distribution Inference Risks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe report on experiments using five datasets, summarized in Table¬†1. We construct non-overlapping data splits between the simulated adversary, \\adv\\adv\\adv, and model trainer ùíØùíØ\\mathcal{T}.\nThese non-overlapping splits help better capture a realistic scenario where the adversary has access to training data from the distribution ùíüùíü\\mathcal{D} but is unlikely to have any of the model trainer‚Äôs training data (which is considered private). Both parties then modify their dataset to emulate a distribution property, and then sample training datasets from these adjusted distributions to train and evaluate their models. This sampling, along with the disjoint data splits between \\adv\\adv\\adv and ùíØùíØ\\mathcal{T}, helps ensure that any distinguishing power we observe is actually distribution inference, rather than inadvertent dataset inference. Our experimental datasets were selected to incorporate common benchmarks (Census, CelebA) to enable comparisons with previous work, new datasets to assess more realistic property inference threats (RSNA Bone Age), as well as applying our definitions beyond ratio-based properties on graphs (mean node-degree on ogbn-arxiv, clustering coefficient on Chord). As noted by Zhang et al.¬†[ref]9, the target properties for a distribution inference attack can be either related to or independent of the task and can be either explicit features of the input data or latent features. For instance, attributes varied for Census¬†are feature-based properties since these attributes are directly used as features for the models trained on them. On the other hand, an attribute like the age of a person is unrelated to detecting smiles and is a latent property that is not directly encoded as an input feature in the training data (but is available for our CelebA¬†experiments from provided metadata). Census¬† consists of several categorical and numerical attributes like age, race, education level to predict whether an individual‚Äôs annual income exceeds $50K. We focus on the ratios of whites (race) and females (sex) as properties and use a three-layer feed-forward network as the model architecture. RSNA Bone Age¬† contains X-Ray images of hands, with the task being predicting the patient‚Äôs age in months. We convert the task to binary classification based on an age threshold and use a pre-trained DenseNet¬† model for feature extraction, followed by a two-layer network for classification. We focus on the ratios of the females (available as metadata, but implicit in the examples) as properties. CelebA¬†[ref]18 contains face images of celebrities, with multiple images per person. Each image is annotated with forty attributes such as gender, sunglasses, and facial hair. We use two different tasks, smile detection and gender prediction, and train convolutional neural networks from scratch for this dataset. We focus on the ratios of the females (smile-detection task) and old people (gender-prediction task) as properties. These attributes are provided as meta-data in the dataset.\nWe create a network architecture with five convolutional layers and pooling layers followed by three linear layers, which is the smallest one we could find with reasonable task accuracy. The ogbn-arxiv¬†[ref]29 dataset is a directed graph, representing citations between computer science arXiv papers. The task is to predict the subject area categories for unlabeled papers. We infer the mean node-degree property of the graph. We use a four-layer Graph Convolutional Network¬†. Chord¬† contains botnets with the Chord¬† topology artificially overlaid on top of background network traffic from CAIDA¬†. The dataset contains multiple graphs, with the task of detecting bot nodes in the graphs. We focus on inferring whether the underlying graphs (onto which we overlay botnets) have average clustering coefficients within a specific range. Following the model architecture proposed in Zhou et al.¬†, we implement a Graph Convolutional architecture.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: threats (RSNA Bone Age), as well as applying our definitions beyond ratio-based properties on graphs (mean node-degree on ogbn-arxiv, clustering coefficient on Chord).

For\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
