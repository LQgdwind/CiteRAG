      "content": "Paper Title: An order out of nowhere: a new algorithm for infinite-domain CSPs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe prove that under the algebraic assumption in item (1) of Theorem 3, 𝔸𝒦,Ψsubscript𝔸𝒦Ψ\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathcal{K},\\Psi} admits non-trivial symmetries that can be seen as operations acting on the set of linearly ordered ℓℓ\\ell-hypergraphs with at most ℓℓ\\ell elements.\nWe moreover know from  that the introduction of a linear order “out of nowhere” is unavoidable, in the sense that the symmetries of 𝔸𝒦,Ψsubscript𝔸𝒦Ψ\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathcal{K},\\Psi} acting on unordered ℓℓ\\ell-hypergraphs can be trivial even if CSP⁡(𝔸𝒦,Ψ)CSPsubscript𝔸𝒦Ψ\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathcal{K},\\Psi}) is solvable in polynomial time.\nThis is rather surprising (in model-theoretic terms, hypergraphs form a class having the non-strict order property, and thus have no ability to encode linear orders) and is to date the only example of such a phenomenon.\nAs a consequence, the aforementioned “reduction to the finite” introduced in , which is enough to prove the tractability part of most of the complexity dichotomies mentioned in the previous section, cannot be used in the hypergraph satisfiability setting.\nIn order to prove the tractability part of Theorem 3, we thus introduce new algorithmic techniques inspired by results in the theory of constraint satisfaction problems with finite domains, in particular by absorption theory [ref]4 and Zhuk’s theory [ref]43 [ref]44.\nBy interweaving these methods with the methods coming from the study of infinite-domain CSPs, we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm solving the hypergraph satisfiability problem, thereby resolving the trouble with hitherto standard methods pointed out in . A positive resolution of the general 4 will likely have to proceed in a similar spirit, albeit at a yet higher level of sophistication. We use the recently developed theory of smooth approximations  to prove the dichotomy, i.e., that 𝔸𝒦,Ψsubscript𝔸𝒦Ψ\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathcal{K},\\Psi} satisfies one of the two items of Theorem 3, for all ΨΨ\\Psi.\nThe classification of the complexity of graph-satisfiability problems from  used a demanding case distinction over the possible automorphisms groups of the structures 𝔸𝒦,Ψsubscript𝔸𝒦Ψ\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathcal{K},\\Psi} (where ΨΨ\\Psi is a set of graph formulas, and 𝒦𝒦\\mathcal{K} is the class of all finite simple undirected graphs) – it was known previously that there are exactly 5 such groups .\nOur result relies neither on such a classification of the automorphism groups of the structures under consideration, nor on the classification of the hypergraphs of which they are first-order reducts;\nas mentioned above, no such classification is available.\nWhile Thomas  obtained a classification of the mentioned automorphism groups for every fixed ℓℓ\\ell and for 𝒦𝒦\\mathcal{K} consisting of all finite ℓℓ\\ell-hypergraphs, this number grows with ℓℓ\\ell and makes an exhaustive case distinction impossible.\nTo overcome the absence of such classifications, we rely on the scalability of the theory of smooth approximations, i.e., on the fact that the main results of the theory can be used without knowing the base structures under consideration.\nThis was claimed to be one of the main contributions of this theory; Theorem 3 and its generalization Theorem 24 are the first complexity classification using smooth approximations that truly exemplifies this promise.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: part of Theorem 3, we thus introduce new algorithmic techniques inspired by results in the theory of constraint satisfaction problems with finite domains, in particular by absorption theory [ref]4 and Zhuk’s theory [ref]43 [ref]44.\nBy interweaving these methods with the methods coming from the study of infinite-domain CSPs, we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm solving the hypergraph\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
