      "content": "Paper Title: Deep learning-based method for segmenting epithelial layer of tubules in histopathological images of testicular tissue\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCross-validation decouples possible correlation between training and test sets by training multiple models on different subsets of the data, and testing each with data not seen by it during training. K-fold cross validation method with five folds is used to split data into five parts by random splitting to provide maximum use. Four parts are used for training and one part is used for validation in each fold. To evaluate models, mean and confidence interval at 95% is calculated. Networks are trained for 60 epochs with the Adam optimizer [ref]41 and a learning rate of 10−4superscript10410^{-4}. The learning rate decayed by a factor of 0.5 at epoch 30. In U-Net and ResNet-34, the input size should be divisible by 24superscript242^{4} and 25superscript252^{5} respectively, enabling the decoder to make an output with the same size as the input. As a result, encoder inputs in networks with ResNet-34 are resized to 960×12809601280960\\times 1280. In other networks, images are passed with the original size 1200×1600120016001200\\times 1600. Also in ResNet-34 ImageNet pretrained weights are used. For training, we used a Quadro RTX 8000. The training time of the proposed network for 60 epochs is approximately 1 hour (noted that test time augmentation in validation is used and train batch size and validation batch size are respectively 4 and 2). 2-class outputs (epithelial layer and background) and 3-class outputs (epithelial layer, tubules boundary pixels and background) are predicted. The purpose of considering 3-class is to differentiate tubules with touching borders as suggested in Ref. 42. Although we applied cross validation, still the whole data set is similar. To evaluate the generality of methods we tested them on images from polar bear with different staining than training set. The evaluation metrics are Intersection over Union (IoU), F-score and Mean AJI (Aggregated Jaccard Index). AJI is a metric designed for considering object-level and pixel-level errors at once . It computes an aggregated intersection cardinality numerator, and an aggregated union cardinality denominator for all ground truth and segmented nuclei under consideration. Data Augmentation. We applied data augmentation and test time augmentation. To better understand the augmentation effect, we applied three different augmentation options on a U-Net with 2 classes. These options are no augmentation, low data augmentation plus test time augmentation, and high augmentation plus test time augmentation. Data augmentation transforms are described in the method section. Implementation of data augmentation is done with Albumentations . For low augmentation parameters of transformations are: Gauss noise mean=0, Gauss noise variance range=(0.4,0.6), RGB shift value=5, hue shift value range=(-2,2), saturation shift range=(-3,3), value shift range=(-2,2). In high augmentation, we increased the parameters of the transforms. Parameters for high augmentation are: Gauss noise mean=0, Gauss noise variance=1, RGB shift value=15, hue shift value range=(-20,20), saturation shift range=(-30,30), value shift range=(-20,20).Test time augmentation transforms consist of horizontal flip and vertical flip. Performance results of these three models shown in Table 1. Low augmentation model has the best results. Therefore, low augmentation used in all of models. \n\n\n\n\n\nClass type\nModel\nInput\nLoss\nIoU\nF-score\n\n2-class\nR2U-Net[ref]25\n1200×1600120016001200\\times 1600\nTversky\n0.80±0.01plus-or-minus0.800.010.80\\pm 0.01\n0.89±0.01plus-or-minus0.890.010.89\\pm 0.01\n\nDeepLabv3+\n960×12809601280960\\times 1280\nTversky\n0.81±0.02plus-or-minus0.810.020.81\\pm 0.02\n0.90±0.01plus-or-minus0.900.010.90\\pm 0.01\n\nPSPNet[ref]26\n960×12809601280960\\times 1280\nTversky\n0.82±0.02plus-or-minus0.820.020.82\\pm 0.02\n0.90±0.01plus-or-minus0.900.010.90\\pm 0.01\n\nU-Net\n1200×1600120016001200\\times 1600\nDice+WCE\n0.85±0.02plus-or-minus0.850.020.85\\pm 0.02\n0.92±0.01plus-or-minus0.920.010.92\\pm 0.01\n\nU-Net\n1200×1600120016001200\\times 1600\nTversky\n0.86±0.03plus-or-minus0.860.030.86\\pm 0.03\n0.92±0.01plus-or-minus0.920.010.92\\pm 0.01\n\nProposed model\n960×12809601280960\\times 1280\nDice+WCE\n0.85±0.02plus-or-minus0.850.020.85\\pm 0.02\n0.92±0.01plus-or-minus0.920.010.92\\pm 0.01\n\nProposed model w/o attention\n960×12809601280960\\times 1280\nTversky\n0.84±0.02plus-or-minus0.840.020.84\\pm 0.02\n0.91±0.01plus-or-minus0.910.010.91\\pm 0.01\n\nProposed model\n960×12809601280960\\times 1280\nTversky\n0.84±0.02plus-or-minus0.840.020.84\\pm 0.02\n0.91±0.01plus-or-minus0.910.010.91\\pm 0.01\n\n3-class\nU-Net\n1200×1600120016001200\\times 1600\nDice+WCE\n0.78±0.02plus-or-minus0.780.020.78\\pm 0.02\n0.87±0.01plus-or-minus0.870.010.87\\pm 0.01\n\nU-Net\n1200×1600120016001200\\times 1600\nTversky\n0.82±0.02plus-or-minus0.820.020.82\\pm 0.02\n0.90±0.01plus-or-minus0.900.010.90\\pm 0.01\n\nProposed model\n960×12809601280960\\times 1280\nDice+WCE\n0.76±0.03plus-or-minus0.760.030.76\\pm 0.03\n0.87±0.01plus-or-minus0.870.010.87\\pm 0.01\n\nProposed model\n960×12809601280960\\times 1280\nTversky\n0.78±0.02plus-or-minus0.780.020.78\\pm 0.02\n0.88±0.01plus-or-minus0.880.010.88\\pm 0.01\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nModel\nInput\nLoss\nIoU\nF-score\nMean AJI\n\n\n\nR2U-Net[ref]25\n1200×1600120016001200\\times 1600\nDice+WCE\n0.390.390.39\n0.560.560.56\n0.070.070.07\n\nU-Net\n1200×1600120016001200\\times 1600\nDice+WCE\n0.390.390.39\n0.560.560.56\n0.080.080.08\n\nU-Net\n1200×1600120016001200\\times 1600\nTversky\n0.390.390.39\n0.560.560.56\n0.080.080.08\n\nPSPNet[ref]26\n960×12809601280960\\times 1280\nTversky\n0.460.460.46\n0.630.630.63\n0.100.100.10\n\nDeepLabv3+\n960×12809601280960\\times 1280\nTversky\n0.480.480.48\n0.650.650.65\n0.220.220.22\n\nProposed model\n960×12809601280960\\times 1280\nDice+WCE\n0.650.650.65\n0.780.780.78\n0.450.450.45\n\nProposed model w/o attention\n960×12809601280960\\times 1280\nTversky\n0.630.630.63\n0.750.750.75\n0.460.460.46\n\nProposed model\n960×12809601280960\\times 1280\nTversky\n0.650.650.65\n0.790.790.79\n0.520.520.52\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: used for training and one part is used for validation in each fold.
