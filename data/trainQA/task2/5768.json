      "content": "Paper Title: GNN-Ensemble: Towards Random Decision Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph is widely used to model many real-world relationships,\nranging from social and rating networks [ref]1, financial transactions [ref]2, healthcare , to protein and molecule networks [ref]4 .\nGraph neural network (GNN)   has become the mainstream\nmethodology for deep learning on graphs. GNN\nhas shown\npromising performance on various applications on graph data, for example, identifying components in protein molecules by node classification, anomaly detection for financial transactions with link prediction, and interest group finding with community detection. Through GNNs,\neach node in the graph builds its representation based on its node feature as well as the features of its neighbors through message passing. The representation of the node is updated using an aggregation of these messages. While GNNs can obtain reasonably good accuracy on many graph learning tasks, their increased representational capacity comes from higher model complexity. This can lead to overfitting and therefore weakens the generalization ability. In both transductive and inductive settings, graph data are typically with a small amount of labeled training data and a large amount of unlabeled test data. A trained GNN may easily overfit the small training data. In the meantime, although the current GNN models utilize the neighborhood sampling of the target node and aggregate such neighborhood information as its representation, a single trial of model parameter initialization for deep learning could converge to local optima. DropOut  is a popular regularization technique for deep learning models to avoid overfitting. However, in GNNs, \nindicates that DropOut alone is ineffective in preventing overfitting. This is partially due to the fact that when GNN becomes very deep, the Laplacian smoothing will make all nodes’ representations converge to a stationary point such that they are no longer related to node features . Additionally, like other deep learning methods, GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks .\nIf the attacker maliciously adds or drops edges concerning a target victim node, the prediction related with that node may change. For example, a malicious merchant may link her products to specific items in order to fool the graph recommendation systems for higher exposure. In another example, a malicious user may manipulate her profile to build connections with\ntargeted users to mislead the friend recommendation system. Such kind of vulnerability poses serious threats to GNNs, especially under safety-critical scenarios. Ensemble learning has been widely used to boost the generalization and training stability\nwith the combined wisdom   .\nDeep neural network ensembles have gained increasing popularity in the deep learning community for improving the accuracy performance and robustness   . It is equally important to improve the accuracy performance of the GNN models as well as their robustness against adversarial attacks. In this paper, we aim to shed some insight into the following research questions: (1)\nCan we utilize an ensemble of GNN models, despite their different local optimal results, to achieve better classification performance? (2) Can we generate GNN ensembles with better generalization power and reduce overfitting? (3) Can we increase the robustness of GNN against adversarial attacks via GNN ensemble? In this paper, we present GNN-Ensemble, an ensemble learning approach that combines multiple GNN models trained with both randomly selected substructures in the topological space and randomly selected subfeatures in the feature space. The development of GNN-Ensemble consists of three main steps.\nFirst, we subsample the graph structure for subgraphs and the node features for subfeatures, assuming the graph is attributed.\nSecond, we train multiple base GNN models, e.g., GraphSage [ref]4 with different sets of subgraphs and subfeatures for independent decision making.\nThe third and final step is to aggregate multiple GNN decisions with ranking or voting. By the theory of stochastic modeling with a discriminant function for joint decision making , these GNNs in different substructure and subfeature spaces generalize their classification in complementary ways.\nConsequently, their combined classification can be monotonically improved and overfitting on the training data can be reduced. With experimental results on four benchmark graph datasets111https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/datasets.html (two for small graphs Cora and PubMed, and two for large graphs PPI and Reddit), we demonstrate that the proposed GNN-Ensemble method is general and can be used with many other backbone GNN models. GNN-Ensemble improves the accuracy performance, reduces overfitting, and improves the robustness against adversarial attack when compared to a single GNN model. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews the related work in GNNs, adversarial attacks and defense on the graph, and ensemble learning.\nIn Section III, we provide a preliminary of the problem formulation and graph neural networks. In Section IV, we present the systematic creation of the GNN-Ensemble method with graph structure and node feature sampling and a discussion on diverse model generation. We further define the discriminant function, followed by the rules on decision aggregation and complexity analysis. Experimental results are reported in Section V. We finally conclude in Section VI.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Graph is widely used to model many real-world relationships,\nranging from social and rating networks [ref]1, financial transactions [ref]2, healthcare , to protein and molecule networks [ref]4 .\nGraph neural network (GNN)   has become the mainstream\nmethodology for deep learning on graphs.
