      "content": "Paper Title: Sampling for Deep Learning Model Diagnosis TECHNICAL REPORT\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning (DL) models have enabled unprecedented breakthroughs in developing artificial intelligence systems for analyzing\nhigh-dimensional data, such as text, audio, and images. Building such models is a data intensive task.\nTo build an effective model, a machine learning (ML) practitioner needs to proceed in an iterative fashion, building and tuning dozens of models before selecting one.\nWhile naive selection of the best model could be based on statistical measures such as, accuracy, F1 score, etc.,\nexamining what the model is learning and why it is making mistakes requires access to artifacts, such as model activations and gradients.\nActivation values, or activations, are learned representations of input data. Gradients are partial derivatives of the target output\n(e.g., the true label of the input data) with respect to the input data. At a high level, activations and gradients are high\ndimensional vectors with sizes that depend on input data dimensionality and DL model architecture. While activations\ndepict what the deep learning model sees, gradients depict areas of high model sensitivity. The naive solution of pre-computing and storing all artifacts required for model diagnosis scales as the product of size\nof input data and number of parameters of the deep learning model. For instance, consider a VGG-16¬†[ref]56 model trained on CIFAR-10¬†[ref]9.\nCIFAR-10 is a moderate sized data set with 60k images, 32‚Äãx‚Äã32‚Äãx‚Äã332ùë•32ùë•332x32x3 pixels each; VGG-16¬†[ref]56 is a deep learning model\nwith 22 layers and 33,638,2183363821833,638,218 learned parameters. Storing activations for ten experiments of training CIFAR-10 data on a\nVGG-16 models results in 350GB of data. Although the total number of artifacts for small data sets and models is manageable,\nan overhead that is three orders of magnitude larger than the input data per model is not scalable. This makes it difficult to\nefficiently perform diagnosis tasks, often preventing interactive diagnosis. Thus, with hundreds of gigabytes of\nartifacts per model, building, diagnosing, and selecting a DL model becomes a large-scale data management challenge. Previous attempts at solving this problem either pre-generated all data required to provide interactive query\ntimes¬†    or utilized a variety of storage optimization techniques to manage the storage footprint¬†[ref]55 .\nBoth approaches require pre-generated artifacts. Several visualization\ntools pre-generate some of the aggregates and severely limit the type of queries that can be posed, while others simply do the latter.\nSystems with storage optimizations ¬†[ref]55 reduce the storage required for this data by utilizing techniques\nsuch as de-duplication and quantization, etc. Sampling is a fast and flexible database technique for approximate query processing,\nit works well in high dimensions¬†    and is a potential candidate for this workload.\nHowever, many queries posed for model diagnosis depend on retrieving the top-k maximally activated neuron(s) (see Section¬†III for workload characterization).\nProcessing these queries from samples is difficult. The natural estimator for a top-k query over the\nsample is the top-k on the sample; however, to un-bias this sample we need to access the full\ndistribution of frequencies in the un-sampled data set, which is the set of activations for the entire data set over the entire model,\na number far too vast ot generate or store. The key insight we discovered for creating a sample that can be utilized for DL model diagnosis is that\nthe DL model, along with its other objectives such as classification,\nlearns a lower dimensional representation of the data. DL training transforms the input data, creating a new representation with each\nlayer. Therefore, to diagnose the model,\nwe leverage this lower dimensional representation of data rather than store and analyze the distribution of activation values to\ncreate a sample (see Section¬†IV for details). The sampling technique that we develop specifically targets model diagnosis queries, which\ninclude top-k queries as well as average values and, provide more accurate answers than uniform sampling, stratified sampling, and other sampling techniques from the literature.\nOur technique selects a sample from the input (test and training) data set so that artifacts need to be generated\nonly for the sample. This approach not only reduces the storage footprint and speeds-up queries since we store less data, but it also\nspeeds-up the overall diagnosis process by saving the time it would otherwise take to generate all artifacts for the entire data set. In summary, our contributions include: Characterizing requirements of DL model diagnosis by\nstudying debugging queries in the literature. We further develop a simple benchmark for this\nnovel workload by generalizing individual queries used in model debugging papers into query sets that cover\nfamilies of queries (Section¬†III). Presenting a new technique for creating samples for DL model diagnosis (Section¬†IV). Evaluating our approach on two data sets and demonstrating its performance compared with a variety of state-of-the-art alternatives. Our sampling technique can be used to debug any deep learning\nmodel where a lower dimensional representation of the input data is learned in a supervised, semi-supervised or\nunsupervised manner.\n\nReference markers found: [56]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]56: pre-computing and storing all artifacts required for model diagnosis scales as the product of size\nof input data and number of parameters of the deep learning model.
