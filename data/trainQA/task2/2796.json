Many NLP systems like coreference resolution and syntactic parsing are becoming more sophisticated by utilizing output information of POS tagging or NER. Linear statistical models like HMMs, MEMMs and CRFs give high performance on such sequence labelling tasks by using hand-crafted features and task-specific resources like English POS taggers benefit from carefully designed word spelling features. However, such task-specific knowledge is costly\nto develop. Due to this, deep-learning based approaches which use word embeddings as features are being applied to these tasks and are giving great results. Several RNN together with its variants such as long-short term memory (LSTM)  and\ngated recurrent unit (GRU)  have been proposed to solve sequence labeling\ntasks like POS tagging  and NER , [ref]32. As these models depend a lot on neural embeddings, often its performance drops rapidly and so new approaches combining linear statistical models on top of RNN-based models. Approaches like [ref]33,[ref]34 combine character and word-level representations, feed them into a BiLSTM and then use a CRF on top of it to jointly decode labels for the whole sentence and they give great accuracies in sequence labelling tasks. Hierarchical RNN based encoders along with CRFs have also been used for sequence labelling\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: results.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
