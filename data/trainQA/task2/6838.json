      "content": "Paper Title: Sampling From Autoencoders‚Äô Latent Space via Quantization And Probability Mass Function Concepts\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent works like in  [ref]3 [ref]4   propose to use normalizing flows  6 to sample latent vectors from the latent space of autoencoders. These methods select vectors randomly as sample vectors, then move them to high probability regions. Normalizing flow methods can be divided into two families, notably discrete and continuous normalizing flows 6. The difference comes from the definition of the flow process T‚Äã(z)ùëáùëßT(z) as discrete steps via the composition of functions {Ti}i=1ksubscriptsuperscriptsubscriptùëáùëñùëòùëñ1\\{T_{i}\\}^{k}_{i=1} as in  : or continuous via an integral over an interval as in [ref]3: Recent works such as  [ref]3 [ref]4 focus mostly on continuous normalizing flows due to their better modeling of the flow dynamics. These works propose to see the Euclidean latent space of VAEs as a Riemannian manifold  with the sum of all covariance matrices weighted by the distance to the mean as the manifold‚Äôs metrics [ref]3. This metric was further improved in [ref]4 by learning a covariance matrix from the data. Then, using the determinant of this metric, the probability density at any point can be estimated. Finally, via a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo process, the drawn samples are moved to regions of high probability. These regions can be reconstructed into realistic data points [ref]4. Yet, these methods do not represent a general off-the-shelf method to sample from the latent space because they require a dedicated model architecture. Also, as noted in 6, using Riemannian metrics is only applicable to topologies homeomorphic to Euclidean space ‚Ñùdsuperscript‚Ñùùëë\\mathbb{R}^{d} which is not applicable, for example, to spherical latent spaces such as in Hyperspherical Variational Auto-Encoders . In this work, our proposed sampling method performs density estimation over the latent space via probability mass function and quantization processes. Consequently, it does not require a special regularization term (as in sampling from a prior distribution) nor a special autoencoder architecture (as in sampling using normalizing flows). Furthermore, in addition to not sampling outliers, training our sampling method improves the time complexity of Gaussian mixture model sampling.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Recent works like in  [ref]3 [ref]4   propose to use normalizing flows  6 to sample latent vectors from the latent space of autoencoders.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
