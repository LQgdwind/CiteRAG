      "content": "Paper Title: Fine-tuned CLIP Models are Efficient Video Learners\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPretrained vision-language (VL) models like CLIP  and ALIGN [ref]16 have shown impressive zero-shot performance for many downstream vision applications including classification  , detection   [ref]49 and segmentation [ref]34 . These models are trained using millions of image-text pairs sourced from the internet and offer unique representations with strong generalization and transfer capabilities. However, such massive pretraining is laborious for videos due to the following reasons: 1) Aligned video-text data has a limited availability and the cost of preparing such data is monumental in contrast to image-text pairs that are readily available via internet sources [ref]16. 2) Videos are inherently complex and have large compute cost while the diverse appearance cues could be learned through image-text pairs with a much lower compute budget. Therefore, it is critical to devise methods effectively adapting pretrained image-language models for video-based tasks without forgetting the generic multi-modal learned representations. Recent video-based approaches adopt CLIP representations using additional learnable components for spatio-temporal modeling. These components include self-attention layers for cross-frame communication , textual or visual prompts  or dedicated video decoder modules  that are learned while keeping the CLIP backbone frozen or adapting the CLIP encoders as well. However, these designs require modality-specific inductive biases to be modeled in the developed architectural modules and need careful design efforts to adapt CLIP suitably for videos. Additionally, while adapting CLIP for downstream video tasks, such approaches generally do not remain a winner across all settings. For example, zero-shot adapted approaches perform lower in supervised settings, and supervised models score lower on zero-shot generalization tasks. To address the above challenges, we frame the following two questions: 1) Does the adaptation of CLIP for videos using additional tunable parameters tamper its generalization capacity? 2) Is a simple video-specific fine-tuning sufficient to bridge the modality gap between images and videos? In our empirical analysis, we observe that fine-tuning pretrained CLIP encoders along with the newly introduced temporal modeling components can hinder the generalization capability of CLIP. Interestingly, a simple CLIP model when fine-tuned on a video dataset can instill suitable video-specific adaptations within the regular CLIP model and perform competitively to more complex approaches having video-specific components inbuilt. Although existing works explore fine-tuning of CLIP encoders as a baseline, they undermine the potential of full fine-tuning of CLIP. However we note that, full fine-tuning to achieve better visual-language alignment on videos improves synergy between temporal and language cues,\nand perform competitive to much sophisticated approaches developed for videos (see Fig. Fine-tuned CLIP Models are Efficient Video Learners).\nTowards understanding how this capacity is achieved by the regular CLIP model, we show that a simple frame-level late representation aggregation before loss calculation allows the exchange of temporal cues within the video fine-tuned CLIP. While simple CLIP fine-tuning performs competitively to more sophisticated approaches, it is not always feasible, especially on low-data regimes. Based on the finding that simple fine-tuning can efficiently adapt CLIP for videos, we propose a two-stage ‘bridge and prompt’ approach for adapting CLIP for low-data regimes that first fine-tunes vanilla CLIP on videos to bridge the modality gap, followed by a vision-language prompt learning approach keeping the tuned CLIP frozen.\nThe contributions of this work are, We\nformulate a simple but strong baseline, ViFi-CLIP (Video Finetuned CLIP), for adapting image-based CLIP to video-specific tasks. We show that simple fine-tuning of CLIP is sufficient to learn video-specific inductive biases, resulting in impressive performance on downstream tasks (Sec. 4). We conduct experiments on four different experimental settings including zero-shot, base-to-novel generalization, few-shot and fully-supervised tasks. We show better or competitive performance as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches (Secs. 3, 4). We show the effectiveness of our proposed ‘bridge and prompt’ approach to first bridge the modality gap through fine-tuning followed by prompt learning in both visual and language branches of the CLIP model for low-data regimes (Sec. 5).\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: Pretrained vision-language (VL) models like CLIP  and ALIGN [ref]16 have shown impressive zero-shot performance for many downstream vision applications including classification  , detection   [ref]49 and segmentation [ref]34 .
