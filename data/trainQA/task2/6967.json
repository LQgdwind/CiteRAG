      "content": "Paper Title: Effective Multi-Graph Neural Networks for Illicit Account Detection on Cryptocurrency Transaction Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn literature, there exist anomaly detection methods on various types of graph-based data, e.g., review graphs [ref]15   [ref]19.\nMost of the recent graph-based anomaly detection methods are under the regime of GNNs.\nClassic GNNs, such as GCN , Sage , and GAT , rely on the assumption of homophily . That is, similar nodes tend to connect to each other, which is not true in anomaly detection.\nGINE  and TransConv  attempt to incorporate edge features in GNNs, but still follows the homophily assumption.\nAbnormal nodes usually have discrepant features, compared with normal ones .\nFurther, abnormal nodes often intentionally create connections with normal nodes to hide in camouflage [ref]19. Therefore, classic GNNs may not be able to effectively handle these issues for anomaly detection.\nTo alleviate the issues, CARE-GNN [ref]19 trains a predictor to measure the similarity between target nodes and their neighborhoods, and further leverage reinforcement learning to find the most related neighbors for aggregation. In , a new framework is proposed to use attention mechanism and generative adversarial learning  to detect anomalies.\nZhou et al., enhance vanilla GNNs with subtractive aggregation to model camouflage behaviors .\nIn , a new loss function that leverages global structure patterns for generating anomaly-detectable representations is presented. Liu et al.,  propose PC-GNN to sample neighbors from the same class and relieve the imbalance between abnormal and normal nodes. Ding et al.,  leverage meta-learning, while Wang et al.,  use self-supervised learning in GNNs, for detection.\nFRAUDRE [ref]39 takes mean aggregation of neighborhood differences and representations, and develops a loss function to remedy class imbalance for anomaly detection.\nThese methods can be customized for the illicit account detection problem.\nWe have a detailed discussion in Section IV-C to elaborate the technical differences between our MGD technique and existing methods that also consider the discrepancy issue.\nIn experiments, we compare with existing graph-based anomaly detection methods to evaluate the effectiveness.\nIn summary, these methods are designed without considering the aforementioned unique characteristics of cryptocurrency transactions, such as lack of meaningful node features. Moreover, they are designed either for relation graphs (e.g., [ref]19  [ref]39) or node-attributed graphs (e.g.,  ). On the other hand, we consider all aspects of the multigraph data model into DIAM for illicit account detection.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: In literature, there exist anomaly detection methods on various types of graph-based data, e.g., review graphs [ref]15   [ref]19.\nMost of the recent graph-based anomaly detection methods are under the regime of GNNs.\nClassic GNNs, such as GCN , Sage , and GAT , rely on the assumption of homophily .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
