Towards Trustworthy Graph Neural Networks via Confidence Calibration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraphs are ubiquitous in the real world, including social networks, e-commerce networks, traffic networks, and so on. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are able to effectively learn the node representations based on the message-passing manner, have attracted considerable attention in dealing with graph data  [ref]33     . To date, GNNs have been applied to various applications and achieved remarkable accuracy, e.g., node classification  [ref]33, link prediction  and graph classification . However, it is well established that a model with good accuracy is not the only goal, but a trustworthy model is highly desired in many applications, especially in safety-critical fields . Usually, a trustworthy model implies that it should know when it is likely to be incorrect, in other words, the probability, i.e., the confidence, associated with the predicted class label should reflect its ground truth correctness likelihood 2. For example, in the scene of autonomous driving, the system will adopt the prediction given by the model only when the model has high confidence for its prediction. Otherwise, the decision-making power will be returned to the driver or the system adopts other safer strategies. Recently, the confidence calibration has attracted considerable attention in deep learning 2  9, which reveals that many modern neural network models are over-confident on the predictions, i.e., the prediction accuracy is lower than its confidence. However, it has not been studied in GNNs on the semi-supervised scenario, which gives rise to one fundamental question: will the current GNNs follow the same over-confident property as other neural networks? A well-informed answer can help us better understand GNNs and enable GNNs to be applied to various areas in a more reliable manner. As the first contribution of this study, we present experiments assessing the relationship between the confidence and the accuracy of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)  and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) [ref]33 in the node classification task (more details can be seen in Section 2), respectively. Surprisingly, we discover that existing GNNs are far distant from being well-calibrated, and more importantly, GNNs tend to be under-confident in their predictions, which is very different from other modern deep learning models that are often over-confident 2 9. GNNs being under-confident means that many predictions are distributed in the low-confidence range, and therefore, fewer predictions are available for safety-critical applications. Once the weakness is identified, another natural question is: how can we calibrate the confidence on predictions given by GNNs so as to make them more trustworthy? Essentially, the confidence calibration is to calibrate the outputs (also known logits) of original models (e.g., GNNs), therefore, a straightforward manner is to employ temperature scaling (TS) 2, OP-families 5 to learn calibration function using a held-out dataset in a post-hoc way.\nHowever, when being applied to graphs, they all ignore the effect of topology, which will inevitably make mistakes during calibration. For example, considering that the logits of two nodes a and b are the same, but node a is similar to its neighbors while node b is not. Apparently, the predictions of GCNs for a should be more confident than b, while the traditional calibration methods, e.g., TS, will learn the same confidence for a and b, because it does not consider the effect of topology. Moreover, most of them explore calibration functions only in the linear space 2 8 while it is well known that non-linear space contains more complex function transformation which is able to calibrate networks with complicated landscapes well. Even if some works have explored the non-linear space such as Matrix Scaling 2, they generally degrade the classification accuracy of the original classifier, while a good accuracy is still a basic requirement by many applications. In this paper, we introduce a topology-aware post-hoc calibration method for GNNs. Specifically, for the logits given by the original classification GNNs, we employ another calibration GCN (CaGCN) to propagate confidence, naturally enabling that the confidence of topologically adjacent nodes becomes similar. CaGCN learns a unique temperature t𝑡t for each node for temperature scaling, thus preserving the accuracy of the original classification GCN. In addition, based on our finding that large numbers of high-accuracy predictions are distributed in the low-confidence range, we design a calibrated self-training model CaGCN-st in which the confidence is firstly calibrated then used to generate pseudo labels with high confidence. The contributions of this paper are three-fold: We study the trustworthy problem of GNNs, and discover one unique characteristic of GNNs, i.e., the predictions made by GNNs are usually under-confident. We propose a novel trustworthy GNN model based on the confidence calibration. Our proposed calibration function has three features: topology-aware, non-linear, and accuracy-preserving. We further design a calibrated self-training GNN model, which can effectively utilize the predictions with high confidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed models in terms of both calibration and accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are able to effectively learn the node representations based on the message-passing manner, have attracted considerable attention in dealing with graph data  [ref]33     .
