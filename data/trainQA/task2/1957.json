      "content": "Paper Title: Pose Invariant Person Re-Identification using Robust Pose-transformation GAN\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInitial approaches of re-ID started with handcrafted features   , where a combination of manually extracted features are used as the image descriptor. Although these methods provide good accuracy in smaller datasets, there have not been any significant improvement of these methods over the years. Another direction of work focus on developing improved distance metric learning methods  to construct discriminative subspace for the extracted features for better matching accuracy. However, the scope of distance metric in improving re-ID performance is limited when the dataset is large, unless a powerful feature extractor is employed. A comprehensive overview of the history and development of re-ID methodologies is described by Zheng et al. [ref]15. With the release of larger datasets and higher computational capability, Deep Learning based methods have provided significant performance improvement in recent years  [ref]15 [ref]16. A\nlarge portion of the existing methods depend heavily on the CNN classification backbone such as ResNet [ref]17, DenseNet etc. In this transfer learning setting, the backbone CNN is finetuned using the re-ID data using the traditional classification loss , or using triplets in a Siamese learning setting  . Some of the methods experiment with a part-based feature extraction and matching in addition with full image features . Any of these methods, however, do not solve the problems of occlusion, background clutter, inaccurate detection, varying scale etc. Since deep learning methods give a holistic feature including the background, many methods use foreground segmentation or body-part based semantic segmentation to improve performance , which leads to computational overhead. Many attempts of combining the handcrafted features with the CNN based features have also been observed  0 since deep learning based method are not very successful in smaller datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: is limited when the dataset is large, unless a powerful feature extractor is employed.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
