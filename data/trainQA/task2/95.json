      "content": "Paper Title: A Set of Distinct Facial Traits Learned by Machines Is Not Predictive of Appearance Bias in the Wild\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nResearchers and the public have raised concerns about the use of face detection, face recognition, and other facial processing technology (FPT)111Following Raji et al. , we use the term facial processing technology (FPT) to refer to a broad class of applications that rely on representations of individual’s facial characteristics, including face detection, face analysis, and face recognition. in applications such as police surveillance and job candidate screening due to its potential for bias and social harm    .222In response to these results and major activist efforts, Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM recently placed temporary moratoriums on some FPT products for government surveillance . For example, HireVue’s automated recruiting technology uses candidate’s appearance and facial expression to judge their fitness for employment , and the company 8 and Above uses video interviews to construct candidate “blueprints,\" which include estimated personality traits such as openness, warmness, and enthusiasm 3. If a surveillance or hiring algorithm learns subjective human biases from training data, it may systematically discriminate against individuals with certain facial features. We investigate whether industry-standard face recognition algorithms can learn to make biased, stereotypical trait judgments about faces based on human participants’ perception of personality traits from faces. Quick trait inferences should not affect important, deliberate decisions 6, but humans do display first impression trait biases  and those inferences could affect human judgments of other subjective traits like “employability\" or “attractiveness\" that algorithms are actively designed to mimic . If off-the-shelf FPT can learn biased trait inferences from faces and their labels, then application domains using FPT to make decisions are at risk of propagating harmful prejudices. Because the predictions made by machine learning models depend on both the training data and the annotations used to label them, systematic biases in either source of data could result in biased predictions. For instance, a dataset on employment information designed to predict which job candidates will be successful in the future might contain data regarding mainly European American men. If such a dataset reflects historical injustices, it is likely to unfairly disadvantage African American job candidates. Moreover, annotators could introduce human bias to the dataset by labeling items according to their implicit biases. If annotators for a computer vision task are presented with a photo of two employees, they might label a woman as the employee and the man standing next to her as the employer or boss. Such embedded implicit or sociocultural bias leads to biased and potentially prejudiced outcomes in decision making systems. In computer vision, models used in face detection or self-driving cars have been proven biased against genders and races  . Some examples of racial and gender biases include gender classifications made by automated captioning systems and contextual cues used incorrectly by visual question answering systems [ref]17  . These algorithms are actively used in self-driving cars , surveillance , anomaly detection , military drones , and cancer detection . But while many biases are explicit and easily detected with error analysis, some “implicit\" biases are consciously disavowed and are much more difficult to measure and counteract. Often, these biases take effect a split second after perception in human judgment. These biases are often quantified by implicit association tests  . Computer vision models do embed historical racial or gender biases, but can they also embed these first-impression appearance biases documented in social psychology 3? In this study, we investigate whether biases formed during the first impression of a human face can be learned by industry-standard face recognition models. Like implicit biases, “first impression\" appearance biases are split-second trait inferences drawn from other people’s facial structure and expression 6 . Todorov et al. 1 characterize first impression bias as unreflective and sometimes unconscious. We consider six types of subjective personality trait inferences drawn from faces, each measured in controlled laboratory experiments 6 3: attractiveness, competence, extroversion, dominance, likeability, and trustworthiness.333These trait inferences are neither objective nor reified. We examine people’s subjective perception of personality traits in other face, which amount to biases and prejudices. Real-world outcomes associated with these subjective trait ratings are the result of social biases, not objective ability or personality. In a rational world, these physiognomic stereotypes , may seem unlikely to influence deliberate decisions, but appearance biases have been shown to predict numerous external outcomes, including election results  1, income , economic decisions 5 5, and military rank . Notably, appearance bias is not known to be predictive of any objective measure of ability, performance, or personality 1, and empirically they are often wrong about the people they stereotype 9  . Despite the fact that appearance biases are neither causally linked to nor predictive of actual personality traits, researchers have built machine learning models to predict appearance bias from faces 8 7. Likewise, HireVue and other companies still advertise predictive models for other subjective attributes such as “employability\" trained on historical data with historical biases . We seek to determine whether general, industry-standard face representations can be used to accurately predict subjective, human trait inferences. If so, then face processing technology is at risk of propagating trait inferences embedded in labeled training data. If not, the practice of predicting subject trait inferences and other related personality attributes is even more dubious. In this paper, we make several contributions towards understanding appearance bias in FPT. First, we design a transfer learning method for extracting general-purpose face representations suitable for state-of-the-art face processing applications. Second, we train our model on computer-generated faces manipulated to display certain personality traits, including not only Caucasian but also Asian and Black faces. Third, we find that while our model is quite good at predicting perceived trait scores for faces produced by Todorov et al. 3’s computational model of appearance bias, it fails to consistently predict perceived trait scores for randomly generated faces. Additionally, while it has been shown that the human perceptions of the competence of political candidates are correlated with election outcomes 1 , our model’s competence scores do not achieve the same predictive validity. Our experimental results and additional interpretability analysis suggest that generalized representations for face recognition are not suitable for learning subjective biases.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: and races  .
