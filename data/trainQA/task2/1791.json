      "content": "Paper Title: Temporal Memory Relation Network for Workflow Recognition from Surgical Video\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExtensive studies have been conducted for surgical workflow recognition, ranging from surgical phase recognition to fine-grained gesture, step and activity recognition. We aim at identifying the surgical phase in this work.\nVisual data (i.e., surgical video) is the only ubiquitous data source, which can be routinely collected without disrupting the workflow in the minimally invasive surgery.\nTherefore, the analysis based on pure visual information draws increasing attention to the community.\nIn this section, we also focus on reviewing this promising direction as it is highly related to our work. Literature adopts surgical videos to conduct recognition tasks from two main aspects.\nOne stream targets at modelling high-level spatial and temporal features.\nFrom the perspective of effective feature extraction, early studies utilize hand-crafted features to represent the spatial information, such as intensity value , gradient magnitude , as well as shape, color and texture-based combinative descriptors .\nThe performance is largely limited by the empirical design of these low-level features.\nMeanwhile, previous works use linear statistical models to capture the temporal structure of surgical videos.\nHMMs are primary choices with plentiful variations developed, such as left-right HMM , Hidden semi-Markov Model , hierarchical HMM .\nConditional Random Fields    and Dynamic Time Warping  [ref]22 are also widely used for surgical temporal information modelling.\nHowever, these methods rely on pre-defined dependence, which is insufficient to precisely represent some subtle yet essential motions with strong nonlinear dynamics. With gratitude to high-level representation capability of deep learning, recent advances leverage CNNs and RNNs to extract spatial and temporal features, respectively.\nTwinanda et al.  construct a 9-layer network based on AlexNet for visual feature extraction.\nJin et al. [ref]8 propose an end-to-end recurrent convolutional model called SV-RCNet. Deep residual network and LSTM module are seamlessly integrated into a unified framework to jointly capture spatio-temporal features of videos.\nLea et al. [ref]23 design a segmental spatio-temporal CNN, comprised of a variation of VGG as spatial component and the large 1D convolutional filters as temporal component.\nThey then propose a temporal convolutional network called TCN, which is an encoder-decoder framework hierarchically capturing temporal relationships .\nFunke et al.  learn 3D CNNs to capture spatio-temporal cues from consecutive video frames.\nYi et al.  incorporate a three-step strategy into the CNN-LSTM network to alleviate the negative effect of hard samples. Data cleansing is first used to select hard samples and an online hard frame mapper is proposed to recognize the detected ones separately.\nCurrent methods are either limited by short-term information capture, or are inferior due to the separate learning of spatio-temporal features. Another important stream of works is dedicated to taking advantage of auxiliary information to boost workflow recognition performance, such as forming multi-task learning or multi-modal learning frameworks.\nSeveral studies propose to simultaneously tackle the phase recognition and tool presence detection tasks, in order to exploit their close relatedness to complement the network training.\nFor example, Twinanda et al.  present a multi-task network, which consists of two branches sharing the early layers to extract the visual features.\nZisimopoulos et al.  propose first to train a ResNet to recognize tool presence and then combine binary predictions and features to train an RNN for phase recognition.\nJin et al.  develop a complicated multi-task recurrent convolutional network based on SV-RCNet, with a deliberate design in each branch, i.e., CNN for tool recognition and RNN for phase recognition. A new correlation loss is proposed to provide constraints by minimizing the divergence of probability predictions from two branches. 10-second temporal information is considered in this framework.\nIn addition, aforementioned multi-tasking methods require the annotations of tool presence.\nApart from leveraging tool cues, Nakawala et al.  present a Deep-Onto network which enhances deep models with knowledge management tools, ontology and production rules. By joint recognition of different workflow entities, semantic relations can be utilized to facilitate the recognition.\nIn addition, some works propose a multi-modal architecture to utilize other modalities such as optical flow  to enhance network training.\nRecently, Qi et al.  propose to leverage edge information extracted from raw frame as supplementary knowledge, and form a two-stream multi-modal network with raw data for inferring the surgical phase.\nThese methods require extra annotation workload for multi-tasking, or introduce additional computation cost to calculate other modalities, which also hampers the increasing of input length.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: videos.\nHMMs are primary choices with plentiful variations developed, such as left-right HMM , Hidden semi-Markov Model , hierarchical HMM .\nConditional Random Fields    and Dynamic Time Warping  [ref]22 are also widely used for surgical temporal information modelling.\nHowever, these methods rely on pre-defined dependence, which is insufficient to precisely represent some subtle yet essential\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
