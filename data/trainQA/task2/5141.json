      "content": "Paper Title: FeTrIL: Feature Translation for Exemplar-Free Class-Incremental Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe present an analysis of: (1) the selection strategies, (2) the memory footprint of the methods, (3) the complexity of model updates, and (4) the stability-plasticity balance. Pseudo-feature selection comparison.\nFeTrIL can use any past-new classes combination for translation.\nIn Table 3, we compare the selection strategies from Subsection 3.2.\nAccuracy varies in a relatively small range for all strategies, indicating that FeTrIL is robust to the way features of new classes are selected, and it can be successfully implemented with any of the strategies.\nFeTrIL1 is better than the other selection methods and this motivates its use in the main experiments.\nClass similarity matters, but results with FeTrIL10 remain interesting.\nFeTrILherd also has interesting accuracy, but is slightly behind that of FeTrIL1.\nThe results from Table 3 motivate the use of FeTrIL1 in the main experiments.\nOverall, the geometric translation toward the centroid of the past class is by far more important than the new classes features sampling policy.\nThis finding is also supported by the results obtained with a single new class per CIL state (Table 1). Memory footprint.\nA low memory footprint is a desirable property of incremental learning algorithms because they are most useful in memory-constrained applications  3 4, and recommended for embedded devices .\nAll EFCIL methods need to store a representation of past classes to counter catastrophic forgetting.\nNaturally, this representation should be as compact as possible.\nMainstream methods (such as LwF-MC , PASS [ref]49, IL2A [ref]49, and SSRE ) need to the previous and current deep models during CIL updates for distillation.\nResNet-18 , the most frequent CIL backbone, has approximately 11.4M parameters.\nConsequently, distillation-based methods require around 22.8M parameters.\nTransfer-based methods, such as DeeSIL  and FeTrIL, use only the deep model learned in the initial state and frozen afterwards, and only need 11.4M parameters for the model.\nDeeSIL does not need supplementary parameters during incremental updates.\nHowever, this comes at the cost of poor global discrimination of classes, which is reflected in the final performance.\nFeTrIL stores the class centroids of past classes in order to perform feature translation.\nEach class needs 512 parameters, which leads to a supplementary 51.2K and 102.4 memory need for 100 and 200 classes, respectively.\nThe class similarities needed for pseudo-feature selection (Subsection 3.2) can be computed sequentially and the added memory cost of this step is negligible.\nPASS [ref]49, IL2A  and SSRE  also require the storage of a prototype (mean representation) for each past class and their footprint is equivalent to that of FeTrIL.\nIL2A  additionally stores a covariance matrix per past class (512x512 for ResNet-18) for optimal functioning, which is prohibitive. Complexity of incremental updates.\nCIL is useful in resource-constrained environments, and the integration of new classes should be fast  3.\nDistillation-based methods retrain the full backbone model at each update.\nThis is costly because backpropagation complexity depends on the network architecture, the number of samples and the number of epochs .\nUpdates of transfer-based methods are simpler because they update only the final layer.\nDeeSIL trains linear classifiers using a one-vs-all procedure within each CIL state.\nThe complexity of one training epoch for all classifiers in a CIL state is O​((nT)2​s​d)𝑂superscript𝑛𝑇2𝑠𝑑O((\\frac{n}{T})^{2}sd) , with n𝑛n - total number of classes in the dataset, d𝑑d - dimensionality of features and s𝑠s - samples per class.\nFeTrIL retrains all linear classifiers, past and new, in each CIL state to improve global separability.\nIts complexity is O​(n2​s​d)𝑂superscript𝑛2𝑠𝑑O(n^{2}sd) in the last incremental state, which includes all classes.\nHowever, the one-versus-all training can be replaced with a one-versus-many training with negligible loss of accuracy.\nA sampling of negative features is performed to respect a predefined ratio r𝑟r between negatives and positives used to train each classifier.\nThis approximation has O​(r​n​s​d)𝑂𝑟𝑛𝑠𝑑O(rnsd) complexity.\nIt is interesting since r<n𝑟𝑛r<n, and is more and more useful as n𝑛n grows during the IL process since r𝑟r remains constant. In Figure 4, we present results with different r𝑟r values for ImageNet-Subset, T=10𝑇10T=10.\nAccuracy drops when negative sampling is performed, but it is close to that of one-vs-all training when r=25𝑟25r=25 and r=10𝑟10r=10.\nPerformance drops more significantly for r=1𝑟1r=1, when each linear classifier is learned with an aggressive sampling of negatives.\nSimilar results for CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet are provided in the suppl. material.\nGlobally, Figure 4 indicates that FeTrIL increments can be accelerated with little accuracy loss. We measure the time needed for incremental training of ImageNet-Subset, T=10𝑇10T=10.\nThe training of the initial model is similar for all models and is thus discarded.\nFeTrIL training is done on a single thread of an Intel E5-2620v4 CPU, and only takes 1 hour, 4 minutes and 16 seconds.\nIf FeTrIL is run with r=10𝑟10r=10 ratio between positives and negatives, training time is only 15 minutes and 3 seconds.\nIn comparison, PASS [ref]49 needs 11 hours, 8 minutes and 19 seconds on an NVIDIA V100 GPU, with 4 workers for data loading.\nWhile clearly favorable to FeTrIL, the comparison is biased in favor of PASS since this method uses an entire GPU, in comparison to a single CPU thread for FeTrIL.\nFurther speed gains are possible for our method by using a GPU implementation of the linear layer.\nOur method would run much faster with a GPU implementation of the linear layer.\nNote that the running time of the other methods, such as LUCIR 4 and SSRE , which perform backpropagation is similar to that of PASS [ref]49. Stability-plasticity balance.\nCIL should ideally ensure a similar accuracy level for past and new classes  .\nFigure 5 shows that the two methods have complementary behavior, which results from the way deep backbones are used.\nSSRE is biased toward new classes since the model is fine tuned in each incremental state.\nFeTrIL favors past classes because the deep model is learned with the initial classes (a subset of past classes) and then frozen.\nThe accuracy gap between past and new classes is smaller for FeTrIL compared to SSRE, except for state 4.\nThere, low performance on new classes is probably explained by a strong domain shift compared to the initial state.\nGlobally, the proposed method improves the stability-plasticity balance.\n\nReference markers found: [49]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]49: methods need to store a representation of past classes to counter catastrophic forgetting.\nNaturally, this representation should be as compact as possible.\nMainstream methods (such as LwF-MC , PASS [ref]49, IL2A [ref]49, and SSRE ) need to the previous and current deep models during CIL updates for distillation.\nResNet-18 , the most frequent CIL backbone, has approximately 11.4M\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
