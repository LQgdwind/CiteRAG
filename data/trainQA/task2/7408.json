      "content": "Paper Title: Formal Verification of the Sumcheck Protocol\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper, we formally verified the completeness and soundness properties of the sumcheck protocol. Our work took place in three stages: Producing a new pen-and-paper security analysis of the sumcheck protocol with enough detail for a machine-checkable analysis; Distilling the necessary properties of multivariate polynomials used in the sumcheck protocol, and proving the security of a generalized sumcheck protocol based on these properties in Isabelle; and Showing that existing Isabelle formalizations of multivariate polynomials satisfy the necessary properties, leading to a full security analysis of the classic sumcheck protocol. The sumcheck protocol is widely used, with applications ranging from computational complexity theory to cryptography. We hope that the contrast between the apparent straightforwardness of the well-known pen-and-paper proofs for the sumcheck protocol and the thoroughness of our formalization motivates the use of formal verification. Formalizing proofs will be crucial to prevent errors and ensure security as cryptographic systems become increasingly complex. We also hope that our formalization helps to produce machine-checkable security analyses of other recursive protocols in the future, whether they are based on the sumcheck protocol, or other probabilistic proof systems.\nFuture extensions of our work would be to create machine-checkable proofs of statements in complexity theory relying on the sumcheck protocol      , analyses of protocols such as the GKR protocol , which rely directly on sumcheck, generalisations of the sumcheck protocol to cryptographic groups  and tensor codes [ref]43, and producing verified implementations of these protocols using the Isabelle code generator. Setting up the code generator to extract an implementation of our verified sumcheck protocol should be feasible with limited additional effort given the extensive support for executable polynomials in .\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: on the sumcheck protocol      , analyses of protocols such as the GKR protocol , which rely directly on sumcheck, generalisations of the sumcheck protocol to cryptographic groups  and tensor codes [ref]43, and producing verified implementations of these protocols using the Isabelle code generator.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
