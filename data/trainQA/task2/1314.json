      "content": "Paper Title: Coded sparse matrix computation schemes that leverage partial stragglers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this experiment, we compare the dense coded approaches with our proposed SCS optimal coding scheme in terms of Q𝑄Q values and worker computation time. First we do the comparison for matrix-vector multiplication where we choose a square sparse matrix 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} of size 27,720×27,720277202772027,720\\times 27,720, and a vector 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} of length 27,7202772027,720. The job is to compute 𝐀T​𝐱superscript𝐀𝑇𝐱\\mathbf{A}^{T}\\mathbf{x} in a distributed system of n=18𝑛18n=18 workers, each of which can store γA=115subscript𝛾𝐴115\\gamma_{A}=\\frac{1}{15} fraction of matrix 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}. We consider two different choices of matrix 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}. In the first case, 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} is a band matrix  where the entries are non-zero along the principal diagonal and in 100010001000 other k𝑘k-diagonals just above and below the principal diagonal. In the second case, the entries are non-zero along the principal diagonal and in 200020002000 other randomly chosen k𝑘k-diagonals. The comparison is shown in Table VII where we can see that the proposed SCS optimal scheme requires less time from the worker nodes in comparison to the other dense coded approaches, which in fact, cannot leverage the sparsity of matrix 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}. Next to show an example for distributed matrix-matrix multiplication, we choose two random sparse matrices 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} and 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} of sizes 12000×15000120001500012000\\times 15000 and 12000×13500120001350012000\\times 13500, where randomly chosen any 2%percent22\\% and 5%percent55\\% entries are non-zero. We consider a distributed system having n=24𝑛24n=24 workers, each of which can store γA=14subscript𝛾𝐴14\\gamma_{A}=\\frac{1}{4} fraction of matrix 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} and γB=15subscript𝛾𝐵15\\gamma_{B}=\\frac{1}{5} fraction of matrix 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B}. The comparison is shown in Table VIII which further confirms the superiority of the proposed SCS optimal scheme in terms of workers’ computation speeds. The major reason behind the enhancement of the speed in the SCS optimal scheme lies in its ability to leverage the sparsity of the matrices up to certain level, whereas the approaches in  or  use the dense linear combinations of the submatrices which destroy the sparsity. The approaches in  and [ref]17 consider some parity worker nodes where all the assigned submatrices are dense, which leads to high worker computation time for those workers. On the other hand, in the proposed SCS optimal scheme the submatrices, obtained from dense linear combinations, are assigned uniformly within the workers. This removes the asymmetry between the worker node computation times. Now, similar to the most of the dense coded approaches , , [ref]17, our proposed SCS optimal scheme is also resilient to s=n−kA​kB𝑠𝑛subscript𝑘𝐴subscript𝑘𝐵s=n-k_{A}k_{B} stragglers, where γA=1kAsubscript𝛾𝐴1subscript𝑘𝐴\\gamma_{A}=\\frac{1}{k_{A}} and γB=1kBsubscript𝛾𝐵1subscript𝑘𝐵\\gamma_{B}=\\frac{1}{k_{B}}. We point out that we did not compare with the approach in [ref]7 since their approach does not respect the storage constraints for the matrices at each worker node and only has a high-probability guarantee on the recovery threshold. Similarly we did not compare with 2 which assumes heterogeneous workers, but we note that this approach provides with a value of Q/Δ𝑄ΔQ/\\Delta to be 11/10111011/10 for the example shown in Table VIII.\nNow, in the dense coded approaches, we can decode all Δ=kA​kBΔsubscript𝑘𝐴subscript𝑘𝐵\\Delta=k_{A}k_{B} unknowns from any kA​kBsubscript𝑘𝐴subscript𝑘𝐵k_{A}k_{B} submatrix block products, and in that sense we have QΔ=1𝑄Δ1\\frac{Q}{\\Delta}=1. But it does not necessarily mean that those scheme can utilize the partial computations done by the slower workers, since in those cases the master requires kA​kBsubscript𝑘𝐴subscript𝑘𝐵k_{A}k_{B} workers to finish their jobs, and discard the computations done by others. However, one can still use those approaches to utilize the partial computations, by partitioning the matrices into more submatrices. We can consider the an example of n=10𝑛10n=10 workers with γA=γB=1/3subscript𝛾𝐴subscript𝛾𝐵13\\gamma_{A}=\\gamma_{B}=1/3 and 98%percent9898\\% sparse matrices 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} and 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B}, both having size 12,000×12,000120001200012,000\\times 12,000. Now we can partition matrix 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} into ΔA=3subscriptΔ𝐴3\\Delta_{A}=3 or ΔA=9subscriptΔ𝐴9\\Delta_{A}=9 submatrices for the dense coded approaches. We can see the comparison of κw​o​r​s​tsubscript𝜅𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑠𝑡\\kappa_{worst} and worker computation time in Table IX for these two values of ΔAsubscriptΔ𝐴\\Delta_{A}. In case of ΔA=9subscriptΔ𝐴9\\Delta_{A}=9, we will require polynomials of higher degrees (for  or ) or more random coefficients (for [ref]17) than in the case of ΔA=3subscriptΔ𝐴3\\Delta_{A}=3. It leads to a very high condition number (≈1013absentsuperscript1013\\approx 10^{13}) which will make the whole system numerically unstable. Besides, a larger ΔAsubscriptΔ𝐴\\Delta_{A} would make the submatrices even denser, which will lead to higher worker computation time for the workers. The case is similar for the work in 2 which uses larger ΔAsubscriptΔ𝐴\\Delta_{A} and ΔBsubscriptΔ𝐵\\Delta_{B} to utilize the partial computations. On the other hand, in the proposed SCS optimal scheme, uncoded submatrices are placed at the top, and coded submatrices are placed at the bottom. Moreover the coded jobs are allocated uniformly among all the workers which does not let the worker computation time go high for any particular worker.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: to leverage the sparsity of the matrices up to certain level, whereas the approaches in  or  use the dense linear combinations of the submatrices which destroy the sparsity.
