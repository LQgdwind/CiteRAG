      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamic Unit-Disk Range ReportingA preliminary version of this paper will appear in Proceedings of the 42nd International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science (STACS 2025). This research was supported in part by NSF under Grant CCF-2300356.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRange searching is a fundamental problem and has been studied extensively in computational geometry   2. In this paper, we consider a dynamic range reporting problem regarding disks of fixed radius, called unit disks. Given a set PP of nn points in the plane, the unit-disk range reporting problem (or UDRR for short) is to construct a data structure to report all points of PP in any query unit disk.\nThe problem is also known as the fixed-radius neighbor problem in the literature    .\nChazelle and Edelsbrunner  constructed a data structure of O​(n)O(n) space that can answer each query in O​(log⁡n+k)O(\\log n+k) time, where kk is the output size; their data structure can be constructed in O​(n2)O(n^{2}) time.\nBy a standard lifting transformation , the problem can be reduced to the half-space range reporting queries in 3D; this reduction also works if the radius of the query disk is arbitrary.\nUsing Afshani and Chan’s 3D half-space range reporting data structure , one can construct a data structure of O​(n)O(n) space with O​(log⁡n+k)O(\\log n+k) query time, while the preprocessing takes O​(n​log⁡n)O(n\\log n) expected time since it invokes Ramos’ algorithm 3 to construct shallow cuttings for a set of planes in 3D.\nChan and Tsakalidis 4 later presented an O​(n​log⁡n)O(n\\log n)-time deterministic shallow cutting algorithm. Combining the framework in  with the shallow cutting algorithm 4, one can build a data structure of O​(n)O(n) space in O​(n​log⁡n)O(n\\log n) deterministic time that can answer each UDRR query in O​(log⁡n+k)O(\\log n+k) time. We consider the dynamic UDRR problem in which point insertions and deletions of PP are allowed. By the lifting transformation, the problem can be reduced to dynamic halfspace range reporting in 3D 2  1, which also works for query disks of arbitrary radii. Using the currently best result of dynamic halfspace range reporting [ref]7, one can obtain a data structure of O​(n​log⁡n)O(n\\log n) space that supports O​(log3+ϵ⁡n)O(\\log^{3+\\epsilon}n) amortized insertion time, O​(log5+ϵ⁡n)O(\\log^{5+\\epsilon}n) amortized deletion time, and O​(log2⁡n/log⁡log⁡n+k)O(\\log^{2}n/\\log\\log n+k) query time, where ϵ\\epsilon is an arbitrarily small positive constant and kk is the output size. In this paper, we achieve the optimal O​(log⁡n+k)O(\\log n+k) query time, while the space of the data structure and the update time complexities are the same as above. A byproduct of our techniques is a static data structure of O​(n)O(n) space that can be built in O​(n​log⁡n)O(n\\log n) time and support O​(log⁡n+k)O(\\log n+k) query time. This matches the above result of  4. But our method is much simpler. Indeed, the algorithm of  4 involves relatively advanced geometric techniques like computing shallow cuttings for the planes in 3D, planar graph separators, etc. Our algorithm, on the contrary, relies only on elementary techniques (the most complicated one might be a fractional cascading data structure 1 2). One may consider our algorithm a generalization of the classical 2D half-plane range reporting algorithm of Chazelle, Guibas, and Lee 3. Our techniques may also be useful for solving other problems related to unit disks. In particular, we can obtain an efficient algorithm for the dynamic unit-disk range emptiness queries. For a dynamic set PP of points in the plane, we wish to determine whether a query unit disk contains any point of PP (and if so, return such a point as an “evidence”). The previous best solution is to use a dynamic nearest neighbor search data structure 2. Specifically, we can have a data structure of O​(n)O(n) space that supports O​(log2⁡n)O(\\log^{2}n) amortized insertion time, O​(log4⁡n)O(\\log^{4}n) amortized deletion time, and O​(log2⁡n)O(\\log^{2}n) query time. Using our techniques, we obtain an improved data structure of O​(n)O(n) space that supports both insertions and deletions in O​(log1+ϵ⁡n)O(\\log^{1+\\epsilon}n) amortized time and supports queries in O​(log⁡n)O(\\log n) time. We first discuss our static data structure.\nWe use a set of O​(n)O(n) grid cells (each of which is an axis-parallel rectangle) to capture the proximity information for the points of PP, such that the distance between any two points in the same cell is at most 1. For a query unit disk DqD_{q}\nwhose center is qq, points of PP in the cell CC that contains\nqq can be reported immediately. The critical part is handling other cells that contain points of P∩DqP\\cap D_{q}. The number of such cells is\nconstant and each of them is separated from CC (and thus from qq) by an\naxis-parallel line. The problem thus boils down to the following subproblem: Given a set QQ of points\nin a grid cell C′C^{\\prime} above a horizontal line ℓ\\ell, report the points of QQ in any query unit disk whose\ncenter is below ℓ\\ell. A point p∈Qp\\in Q is in DqD_{q} if and only if qq lies in the unit disk DpD_{p}\ncentered at pp, or equivalently, qq is above the arc of the boundary of DpD_{p}\nbelow ℓ\\ell. Let Γ\\Gamma denote the set of all such arcs for all points p∈Qp\\in Q. To find\nthe points of QQ in DqD_{q}, it suffices to report the arcs of Γ\\Gamma below qq.\nTo tackle this problem, we follow the same framework as that for the 2D\nhalf-plane range reporting algorithm 3, by constructing lower envelope layers of Γ\\Gamma and building a fractional cascading data structure on them 1 2. To make the data structure dynamic, we first derive a data structure to maintain the grid cells dynamically so that each update (point insertions/deletions) can be handled in O​(log⁡n)O(\\log n) amortized time. This dynamic data structure could be of independent interest. Next, we develop a data structure to dynamically maintain arcs of Γ\\Gamma to support the arc-reporting queries (i.e., given a query point, report all arcs of Γ\\Gamma below it). To this end, we cannot use the fractional cascading data structure anymore because it is not amenable to dynamic changes. Instead, we adapt the techniques for dynamically maintaining a set of lines to answer line-reporting queries (i.e., given a query point, report all lines below the query point; its dual problem is the halfplane range reporting queries) [ref]7 0 1 2 8. To make these techniques work for the arcs of Γ\\Gamma in our problem, we need an efficient shallow cutting algorithm for Γ\\Gamma. For this, we adapt the algorithm in 4 for lines and derive an O​(|Γ|​log⁡|Γ|)O(|\\Gamma|\\log|\\Gamma|) time shallow cutting algorithm for Γ\\Gamma. As shallow cuttings have many applications, our algorithm may be interesting in its own right. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce notation and a conforming coverage set of grid cells to capture the proximity information for points of PP. In particular, in Section 2 we state a lemma on dynamically maintaining the grid cells. The proof of the lemma, which is quite lengthy and technical, is presented in\nSection 3. Section 4 discusses our dynamic data structure for the UDRR problem. A main subproblem of it is solved in Section 5. A key ingredient of our method is an efficient algorithm for computing shallow cuttings for arcs; this algorithm is presented in Section 6.\nOur static UDRR data structure is described in Section 7. The algorithm uses a subroutine that computes layers of lower envelopes of circular arcs; the subroutine is presented in Section 8.\nSection 9 concludes the paper and demonstrates that our techniques may be used to solve other related problems, such as dynamic unit-disk range emptiness queries.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: the problem can be reduced to dynamic halfspace range reporting in 3D 2  1, which also works for query disks of arbitrary radii.
