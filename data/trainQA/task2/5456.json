We summarized the comparison of IKEA-Manual and other representative 3D part datasets and IKEA datasets in Table 1. A number of 3D part datasets have been proposed in the last decade. Previous works mainly focus on 3D shape understanding  [ref]15 [ref]16 , where 3D models of daily objects are segmented into semantic classes. Recently, researchers have proposed a number of works that contain parametric 3D models of more diverse objects [ref]17 , where they are decomposed into geometric primitives that reflect the modeling processes of creators. These datasets are mainly used for low-level geometric shape analysis. AutoMate  was created for analyzing CAD assemblies, but focuses on modeling the individual mating relationship between mechanical parts without considering target shapes. Fusion 360 Gallery   is similar to AutoMate, but not constrained to pairwise assembly. Objects are decomposed to assembly parts that match the manufacturing scenario. It also presents a tree-structured annotation, but represents the semantic hierarchy of shapes rather than guiding the assembly process. Furthermore, most shapes in Fusion 360 are not designed for humans to assemble and thus do not have corresponding manuals. IKEA-Manual, in contrast, focuses on IKEA assembly objects paired with assembly manuals. On the other hand, IKEA objects have also been leveraged in other domains. IKEA  and Pix3D  pair 3D IKEA objects with 2D real photos to study single-view pose estimation and 3D reconstruction tasks on the object level. They do not provide any part-level annotation. IKEA Furniture  leverages IKEA objects to study shape assembly problems in a simulated environment. It also provides assembly parts for the 3D shapes, though the parts are often not aligned with the parts in manuals.\nThe IKEA Object State Dataset is the most similar to our dataset, as it contains decomposition of IKEA objects paired with manuals. But there are only 5 objects in the dataset and the manuals do not have any form of annotations, which prevents machines from leveraging their assembly information.\nIKEA-Manual contains 102 objects of greater diversity paired with manuals parsed in machine-interpretable form.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: and other representative 3D part datasets and IKEA datasets in Table 1.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
