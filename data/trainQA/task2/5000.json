      "content": "Paper Title: Scaling Multimodal Pre-Training via Cross-Modality Gradient Harmonization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe most organic self-supervision can arguably be found in the multimodal data that are abundantly available in the digital world: their temporal alignment naturally lead to cross-modality mutual supervision, hence meaningful features can be learned without requiring human annotation. Multimodal pre-training can thus leverage richer semantic cues than single-modality counterparts, and outperform in various downstream tasks such as image classification [ref]5 [ref]11, video action recognition [ref]5 [ref]11  [ref]10, audio event classification [ref]5 [ref]11 [ref]10, and video-text retrieval [ref]5 [ref]11 . Most of those methods formulate pre-text tasks, including cross-modality correspondence    [ref]10, cross-modality clustering , cross-modality longer context prediction , or a combination of multiple pre-text tasks . Contrastive learning   has recently emerged as one dominant approach in self-supervised learning. In multimodal pre-training, the temporal co-occurrence naturally supplies the positive sample to contrast with. [ref]5 adopts a multimodal versatile network to embed each modality into the same vector space, that is trained from end to end with multimodal pairwise contrastive losses (video-audio, and video text). CrossCLR  further takes the intra-modality similarities into account. [ref]10 generalizes the instance discrimination idea to design a cross-modal\ndiscrimination task, i.e., predicting which audio matches a video. Most recently, VATT [ref]11 combines the strength of convolution-free Transformer and multimodal contrastive learning. Specifically, it first validate the idea of using a modality-agnostic single-backbone transformer, to work on video, audio and text modalities, it follows the exact BERT  and ViT  architecture, except injecting modality-specific tokenization layers and linear projections. Despite their success, existing multimodal contrastive learning methods [ref]5  [ref]11 hinge on the â€œfree\" cross-modalities correspondence mined through the multimodal contrastive loss, i.e., the CMA assumption. As a result, they are often trained with well curated or narrated video datasets, such as AudioSet , YouCook2 , and HowTo100M . It remains questionable whether such CMA-guided contrastive learning can generalize well to larger-scale multimodal data in the wild. In fact, even in the HowTo100M dataset, the authors of  estimate that around 50% of clip-narration pairs are not well aligned. The validity of CMA has arisen concerns. Most related to us is  which explicitly models the misalignment noise using the MIL-NCE loss, that is inherited by VATT [ref]11.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: requiring human annotation. Multimodal pre-training can thus leverage richer semantic cues than single-modality counterparts, and outperform in various downstream tasks such as image classification [ref]5 [ref]11, video action recognition [ref]5 [ref]11  [ref]10, audio event classification [ref]5 [ref]11 [ref]10, and video-text retrieval [ref]5 [ref]11 .
