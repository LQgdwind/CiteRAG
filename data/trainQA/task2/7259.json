Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Tierless Programming for Enclaves To the best of our knowledge, HasTEE+ is one of the first practical programming frameworks to introduce the notion of tierless programming for confidential computing applications.\nWeisenburger et al.  provide a survey of general multi-tier programming approaches.\nAmong the surveyed approaches, the HasTEE+ DSL draws inspiration from the Haste framework  and functional choreographic programming . Remote Attestation Infrastructure. HasTEE+ is built on top of the Intel RA-TLS protocol  for binary attestation.\nIn contrast, GuaranTEE  proposes a control-flow attestation technique based on two enclaves, which can be adapted quite naturally to the HasTEE+ RA infrastructure. Information Flow Control for TEEs. Gollamudi et al. proposed the first use of IFC to protect against low-level attackers in TEEs with the IMPE calculus , followed by a more general security calculus, DFLATE , for distributed TEE applications.\nIn contrast to their work, HasTEE+ does not require language-level modifications or type-system extensions.\nInstead, it conveniently enforces IFC as a library in an existing programming language.\nAt the OS level, Deluminator  offers OS abstractions and userspace APIs for trace-based tracking of IFC violations in compartmentalized hardware, such as TEEs. Note that Deluminator is a reporting tool and not an enforcement mechanism, in contrast to HasTEE+.\nAnother application of IFC to TEEs is Moat , which formally verifies the confidentiality of enclave programs by proving the non-interference property . Confidential Data Analytics. Referring to our confidential analytics pattern in Section¬†4, another proposed design pattern is Privacy Preserving Federated Learning [ref]26, tailored to machine learning attacker models.\nWe believe such threat models can be naturally integrated with our proposed design pattern.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: We have already discussed projects closely related to HasTEE+, including HasTEE , GoTEE , JEsubscriptùêΩùê∏J_{E} [ref]31, etc., in Sections¬†1 and 2.\nHere, we highlight additional related work that is relevant to the broader contributions of HasTEE+.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
