      "content": "Paper Title: Approximate Model-Based Shielding for Safe Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDue to the inefficiencies of deep reinforcement learning (RL) and lack of guarantees, safe RL [ref]5 has emerged as an increasingly active area of research. Ensuring the safety of RL agents is crucial for their widespread adoption in safety-critical applications where the cost of failure is high. From formal verification, Shielding  has been developed as an approach for safe RL, that comes with strong safety guarantees on the agents performance. However, classical shielding approaches make quite restrictive assumptions which limit their capabilities in real-world and high-dimensional tasks. To this end, we propose approximate model-based shielding (AMBS) to address these limitations and obtain a more general and widely applicable algorithm. The constrained Markov decision process (CMDP)  is a popular way of framing the safe RL paradigm. In addition to maximising reward, the agent must satisfy a set of safety-constraints encoded as a cost function that penalises unsafe actions or states. In effect, this formulation constrains the set of feasible policies, which results in a tricky non-smooth optimisation problem. In high-dimensional settings, several model-free methods have been proposed based on trust-region methods  5 0 or Lagrangian relaxations of the constrained optimisation problem 7 1. Many of these methods rely on the assumption of convergence to obtain any guarantees. Furthermore, model-based approaches to safe RL have gained increasing traction, in part due to recent significant developments in model-based RL (MBRL) 8   and the superior sample complexity of model-based approaches 9 . In addition to learning a reward maximising policy, MBRL learns an approximate dynamics model of the system. Approximating the dynamics using Gaussian process (GP) regression 2 or ensembles of neural networks are both principled ways to quantify uncertainty, and develop risk- and safety-aware policy optimisation algorithms 1 2  and model predictive control (MPC) schemes 1. Shielding for RL was introduced in  as a correct by construction reactive system that forces hard constraints on the learned policy, preventing it from entering\nunsafe states determined by a given temporal logic formula. Classical approaches to shielding  require a priori access to a safety-relevant abstraction of the environment, where the dynamics are known or at least conservatively estimated. This can be quite a restrictive assumption in many real-world scenarios, where such an abstraction is not known or too complex to represent. However, these strong assumptions do come with the benefit of strong guarantees (i.e., correctness and minimal-interference). In this paper we operate in a less restrictive domain and only assume that there exists some expert labelling of the states; we claim that this is a more realistic paradigm which has been studied in previous work [ref]24 6. As a result, our approach is more broadly applicable to a variety of environments, including high-dimensional environments which have been rarely studied in the shielding literature 4. We do unfortunately loose the strict formal guarantees obtained by classical shielding, although we develop tight probabilistic bounds and a strong theoretical basis for our method. Our approach, AMBS, is inspired by latent shielding [ref]24 an approximate shielding algorithm that verifies policies in the latent space of a world model 9   and is closely related to previous work on approximate shielding of Atari agents 6. The core idea of our approach is that we remove the requirement for a suitable safety-relevant abstraction of the environment by learning an approximate dynamics model of the environment. With the learned dynamics model we can simulate possible future trajectories under the learned policy and estimate the probability of committing a safety-violation in the near future. In contrast to previous approaches, we provide a stronger theoretical justification for utilising world models as a suitable dynamics model. And while we leverage DreamerV3  as our stand-in dynamics model, we propose a more general purpose and model-agnostic framework for approximate shielding.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Due to the inefficiencies of deep reinforcement learning (RL) and lack of guarantees, safe RL [ref]5 has emerged as an increasingly active area of research.
