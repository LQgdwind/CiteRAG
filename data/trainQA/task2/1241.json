      "content": "Paper Title: Occlusion Guided Scene Flow Estimation on 3D Point Clouds\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep Learning on Point Clouds.\nDeep learning has been proved to be one of the most successful learning tools in image processing and swept the community towards new achievements over axiomatic modelling. Graph neural networks, focusing on a more generalized structure, where vertices and edges represent our data, followed the revolution, presenting exciting new tools to handle irregular data. In computer vision, point cloud is one very common way to represent geometry acquired by range sensors or generated in virtual worlds. We have seen papers coping with new challenges by sampling the data and projecting the points into volumetric lattices     5 and later on focusing on point convolutions or a combination of edge and points pulling layers, known as message passing    [ref]33        2 5.\nInteresting follow-up papers appeared rapidly, trying to solve the main challenge arising from the permutation challenge in graphs. We do see recently different sampling strategies or different pulling methods. MLP layers and MAX-pooling are two relevant and popular building blocks for that   .\nAnother interesting and popular approach was using the points as raw data input  , followed by a hierarchical architecture which can capture the local structure of the point clouds  [ref]33.\nTreating point cloud as graph and performing convolution over local neighbourhood make a lot of sense, and several successful approaches were introduced lately focusing on the convolution engine    9   [ref]52. In our work, we use the PointConv suggested by [ref]52  to perform the convolutions on the point clouds. Scene Flow Estimation on Point Clouds.\nThe increasing popularity of range data gave birth to the need for fast and accurate mapping of point clouds.\n   6 suggested estimating the scene flow directly from real LiDAR scans.   consider the scene flow as a rigid motion, while 9 3   4  remove those restrictions.\nBased on the [ref]33 architecture, FlowNet3D 3 introduced a novel flow embedding layer that aggregates the features from different frames. However, they only applied the flow embedding at a certain scale which limits the allowed feasible gap between the frames.  introduced a neural network based on 4 which can predict the scene flow in a coarse-to-fine manner, showing superior results both for large and small flows. However, they do not have any treatment for the occlusions, and their accuracy decrease significantly when there are occluded regions in the point clouds.\nRecently,  suggests estimating the scene flow using both RGB and LiDAR data to overcome ambiguity by providing an additional layer of information.   proposed an interesting approach focusing on all-to-all correlation using graph matching. Occlusion estimation in Scene Flow. Scene flow estimation and occlusion are treated as a chicken-and-egg problem as they are highly related to each other and one influence the other. Many papers  0 1 0 suggest to predict the occlusion mask jointly with the flow and to refine the flow estimation by using the predicted occlusion mask.    8 suggest to predict both the forward and backward flow and to find the occluded region based on the warped images. In  1, they proposed an unsupervised training framework which can predict the optical flow and occlusion from multiple frames. Based on  4, PWOC-3D 0 suggests a self-supervised strategy for the occlusion estimation by masking the warped feature inside the Cost Volume layer using the occlusion map. In this work, we suggest entangling the two aspects together all across the network, not just only in the cost function. We claim that the occlusion should guide the flow and vice-versa as part of the architecture itself to gain the most out of the two. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to estimate the occlusion in 3D scene flow estimation on point clouds and the first to present a guided linked unit in the pipeline to solve the flow-occlusion coupled task. We present state-of-the-art alignment results over all methods described above on known datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: sampling the data and projecting the points into volumetric lattices     5 and later on focusing on point convolutions or a combination of edge and points pulling layers, known as message passing    [ref]33        2 5.\nInteresting follow-up papers appeared rapidly, trying to solve the main challenge arising from the permutation challenge in graphs.
