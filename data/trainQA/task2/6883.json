Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

Specifically, the trade-off models include VisualSparta [ref]28, ISERI_inflate [ref]26, ISERI_fast [ref]26, LightDOT [ref]34. VisualSparta [ref]28, ISERI_inflate [ref]26 are late-interaction trade-off models, where there are no cross-modal token-wise interactions in the feature encoding stage but in the scoring stage. LightDOT [ref]34 is a pre-trained re-ranking based method, which utilizes a pre-trained independent-embedding model to coarsely rank in the first stage and then utilizes another pre-trained interactive-embedding model UNITER  to finely rank in the second stage. ISERI_fast [ref]26 is also an independent-embedding model but is obtained by performing knowledge distillation twice under the extra model supervision of ISERI_inflate [ref]26. This enables ISERI_fast to obtain more accurate fine-grained information under the supervision of the teacher model ISERI_inflate compared with our models. In Figure 3, the x-axis represents the retrieval complexity referring to the average number of cross-modal interactions per candidate when given a query to retrieve the ground-truth from 1000 candidates. The number of cross-modal interactions is the sum of the number of interactions in both of the feature encoding stage and the scoring stage. The y-axis denotes the results of R@1 in the image retrieval task. The red dots represent our models. As shown in Figure 3, SelfAlign enables both baseline models improving the accuracy without increasing retrieval complexity while other trade-off models sacrifice retrieval efficiency for cross-modal token-wise interactions. SelfAlign explores the cross-modal semantic correspondences and improves the retrieval efficiency by achieving fine-grained alignment matching fine-grained correspondences in the early feature encoding stage.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: efficiency for image-text retrieval of our module, we visualize the accuracy and efficiency jointly on Flickr30K and MS-COCO 5K in Figure 3.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
