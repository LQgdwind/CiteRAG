      "content": "Paper Title: SoftCLIP: Softer Cross-modal Alignment Makes CLIP Stronger\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVision-language pretraining (VLP) strives to achieve a unified representation of two modalities, namely vision and language, through the utilization of large-scale image-text pairs. Existing VLP models can be broadly categorized based on their architectures into three types, i.e., dual-stream models for alignment, single-stream models for fusion, or their combination. As a paradigmatic dual-stream model, CLIP [ref]28 has exhibited remarkable performance on zero-shot recognition and several downstream tasks by leveraging contrastive learning on large-scale image-text pairs. Following this paradigm, SLIP  and DeCLIP [ref]17 further combine self-supervision to improve data utilization efficiency. PyramidCLIP [ref]9 and FILIP  introduce finer-grained and more interactions between two modalities, seeking for more accurate cross-modal alignment. CyCLIP  points out the importance of geometric consistency in the learned representation space between two modalities, and proposes geometrically consistency constraints. Different from dual-stream ones, single-stream models, such as Visual-BERT  and OSCAR , fuse the image and text features with a unified model to achieve a deeper interaction. ALBEF  and CoCa  absorb the essence of the two kinds of structures, and find a more flexible way to learn visual and linguistic representations. In this paper, we adopt the dual-stream architecture and depart from the commonly used hard one-hot labels. Instead, we utilize fine-grained intra-modal self-similarities as softened targets to provide more informative guidance, which leads to improved cross-modal interactions.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: categorized based on their architectures into three types, i.e., dual-stream models for alignment, single-stream models for fusion, or their combination.
