The two indexes i𝑖i and j𝑗j indicate a particular site, defined by a combination of an orbit shell and an inclination bin. We also included Active Debris Removal through the factors ΔFiA​D​RsubscriptsuperscriptΔ𝐴𝐷𝑅subscript𝐹𝑖\\Delta^{ADR}_{F_{i}}, ΔNiA​D​RsubscriptsuperscriptΔ𝐴𝐷𝑅subscript𝑁𝑖\\Delta^{ADR}_{N_{i}} and ΔUiA​D​RsubscriptsuperscriptΔ𝐴𝐷𝑅subscript𝑈𝑖\\Delta^{ADR}_{U_{i}}. Each ΔA​D​RsuperscriptΔ𝐴𝐷𝑅\\Delta^{ADR} is the number of objects of a given species removed at each time step. As it will be explained later the nodes affected by ADR can be chosen so that one can remove the most critical objects. The factor γ𝛾\\gamma indicates the failure rate in performing PMD, resulting in objects in P𝑃P nodes transitioning to N𝑁N nodes. The small collision factor κ𝜅\\kappa, quantifies the impacts of small fragments between 1 cm and 10 cm on payloads, leading to a transition of objects from P𝑃P nodes to N𝑁N nodes. Following , we assumed that collisions with small fragments are κ𝜅\\kappa times more frequent than normal collisions with larger objects. The mean collision rate τSi​Sjsubscript𝜏subscript𝑆𝑖subscript𝑆𝑗\\tau_{S_{i}S_{j}} between node Sisubscript𝑆𝑖S_{i} and node Sjsubscript𝑆𝑗S_{j} indicates how many objects of a given class are involved in a collision in a given time interval. The function Λi​(t)subscriptΛ𝑖𝑡\\Lambda_{i}(t) is the number of new payloads, launched with a rate defined by a given launch traffic model that forecasts the frequency of new launches over a given period. The quantity ΔSiE​O​LsubscriptsuperscriptΔ𝐸𝑂𝐿subscript𝑆𝑖\\Delta^{EOL}_{S_{i}} is the number of payloads performing PMD over a given period. The quantity εSi−superscriptsubscript𝜀subscript𝑆𝑖\\varepsilon_{S_{i}}^{-} represents the outflow from node Sisubscript𝑆𝑖S_{i}, while εSi+superscriptsubscript𝜀subscript𝑆𝑖\\varepsilon_{S_{i}}^{+} denotes the inflow to node Sisubscript𝑆𝑖S_{i}, both resulting from changes in the distribution of objects due to orbital evolution. Function ΩjFisubscriptsuperscriptΩsubscript𝐹𝑖𝑗\\Omega^{F_{i}}_{j} computes the inflow to node Fisubscript𝐹𝑖F_{i} of the fragments generated from collisions with nodes Pj,Uj,Njsubscript𝑃𝑗subscript𝑈𝑗subscript𝑁𝑗P_{j},U_{j},N_{j} and Fjsubscript𝐹𝑗F_{j}, as shown in Figure 2, where ζSj​SlFisubscriptsuperscript𝜁subscript𝐹𝑖subscript𝑆𝑗subscript𝑆𝑙\\zeta^{F_{i}}_{S_{j}S_{l}} indicates the fragments generated by the catastrophic collisions between node Sjsubscript𝑆𝑗S_{j} and node Slsubscript𝑆𝑙S_{l} that flow to node Fisubscript𝐹𝑖F_{i}. Therefore, Δ​tk​τSj​Sl​ζSj​SlFiΔsubscript𝑡𝑘subscript𝜏subscript𝑆𝑗subscript𝑆𝑙subscriptsuperscript𝜁subscript𝐹𝑖subscript𝑆𝑗subscript𝑆𝑙\\Delta t_{k}\\tau_{S_{j}S_{l}}\\zeta^{F_{i}}_{S_{j}S_{l}} indicates the new fragments flowing to node Fisubscript𝐹𝑖F_{i} after the collision between node Sjsubscript𝑆𝑗S_{j} and node Sksubscript𝑆𝑘S_{k} in the given time interval Δ​tkΔsubscript𝑡𝑘\\Delta t_{k}. Considering satellite maneuverability, the fragments generated by the collisions with payloads, need to be scaled by 1−sC​A​M1subscript𝑠𝐶𝐴𝑀1-s_{CAM}.

The launch traffic model, the collision model, and the decay model, will be introduced in the following sections. The evolutionary model in (1) is a stochastic version of what is commonly known as source-sink model. The key difference with respect to previous works  is that we derived the evolutionary equations from the structure of the network. This also differentiates our approach from previous network representations of the space environment  that use network theory as a post processing analysis tool.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: of payloads subject to Post Mission Disposal (PMD).\nPayload are removed at a given time tP​M​Dsubscript𝑡𝑃𝑀𝐷t_{PMD} after launch, if PMD is successful.\nThe use of Poisson processes was studied by [ref]32 who demonstrated that it well capture the historical distribution of collisions.
