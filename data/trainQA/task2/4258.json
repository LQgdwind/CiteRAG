      "content": "Paper Title: Cohomology in Constraint Satisfaction and Structure Isomorphism\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThroughout this paper we use the word structure to mean a relational\nstructure over some finite relational signature σ𝜎\\sigma. A structure A𝐴A consists of\nan underlying set (which we also call A𝐴A) and for each relational symbol R𝑅R\nof arity r𝑟r in σ𝜎\\sigma a subset RA⊂Arsuperscript𝑅𝐴superscript𝐴𝑟R^{A}\\subset A^{r} or tuples related by R𝑅R.\nA homomorphism of structures A,B𝐴𝐵A,B over a common signature is a function between\nthe underlying sets f:A→B:𝑓→𝐴𝐵f\\colon A\\rightarrow B which preserves related tuples. An\nisomorphism of structures is a bijection between the underlying sets which\nboth preserves and reflects related tuples. A partial function s:A⇀B:𝑠⇀𝐴𝐵s\\colon A\\rightharpoonup B\n(seen as a set s⊂A×B𝑠𝐴𝐵s\\subset A\\times B) is a partial homomorphisms if it\npreserves the related tuples in 𝐝𝐨𝐦​(s)𝐝𝐨𝐦𝑠\\mathbf{dom}(s).\ns𝑠s is a partial isomorphism if it is a bijection onto its image and both\npreserves and reflects related tuples. A partial homomorphism or isomorphism is\nsaid to be k𝑘k-local if |𝐝𝐨𝐦​(s)|≤k𝐝𝐨𝐦𝑠𝑘|\\mathbf{dom}(s)|\\leq k. For two structures\nover the same signature we write 𝐇𝐨𝐦k​(A,B)subscript𝐇𝐨𝐦𝑘𝐴𝐵\\mathbf{Hom}_{k}(A,B) and 𝐈𝐬𝐨𝐦k​(A,B)subscript𝐈𝐬𝐨𝐦𝑘𝐴𝐵\\mathbf{Isom}_{k}(A,B)\nrespectively for the sets of k𝑘k-local homomorphisms and isomorphisms from\nA𝐴A to B𝐵B. In the paper, we make reference to several important logics from finite model theory\nand descriptive complexity theory. The logics we make reference to in this paper are as follows. Fixed-point logic with\ncounting (written FPC) is first-order logic extended with operators for inflationary fixed-points and\ncounting, for example see . For any natural number k𝑘k, Cksuperscript𝐶𝑘C^{k} is infinitary first-order logic extended with\ncounting quantifiers with at most k𝑘k variables. This logic bounds the expressive power of FPC in the sense that, for each k′superscript𝑘′k^{\\prime} there exists k𝑘k such that any FPC formula in k′superscript𝑘′k^{\\prime} variables is equivalent to one in Cksuperscript𝐶𝑘C^{k}. We write Cωsuperscript𝐶𝜔C^{\\omega} for the union of these logics. Rank logic is first-order logic extended with operators for inflationary fixed-points and\ncomputing ranks of matrices over finite fields, see [ref]35. Linear algebraic logic is first-order infinitary logic extended with quantifiers for computing all linear algebraic functions over finite fields, see . This logic bounds rank logic in the sense described above. At different points in the history of descriptive complexity theory,\nboth FPC and rank logic were considered as candidates for “capturing PTIME”\nand thus refuting a well-known conjecture of Gurevich . Each has since been proven not\nto capture PTIME, for FPC see Cai, Fürer and Immerman , for rank logic\nsee Lichter . Infinitary logics such as Cωsuperscript𝐶𝜔C^{\\omega} and linear algebraic logic are capable of expressing properties which are not decidable in PTIME but have been shown not to contain any logic which does not capture PTIME. For Cωsuperscript𝐶𝜔C^{\\omega}, see Cai, Fürer and Immerman  and for linear algebraic logic, see Dawar, Grädel, and Lichter .\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: Cωsuperscript𝐶𝜔C^{\\omega} for the union of these logics.
