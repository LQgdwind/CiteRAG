      "content": "Paper Title: POLICEd RL: Learning Closed-Loop Robot Control Policies with Provable Satisfaction of Hard Constraints\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile reinforcement learning (RL)  is widely successful   , its application to safety-critical tasks is challenging due to its lack of safety guarantees .\nA common approach towards capturing safety in RL is ensuring the satisfaction of safety constraints which prevent a robot from entering unsafe regions [ref]10. However, verifying that a learned closed-loop policy never leads to any constraint violation is in general a nontrivial problem.\nTo remedy this shortcoming, safe RL has mostly relied on reward shaping to penalize the policy for constraint violations [ref]10 2 . At a high level this approach corresponds to imposing soft safety constraints and does not provide any guarantees of constraint satisfaction by the closed-loop system 2. However, for many safety-critical tasks, like human-robot interaction, autonomous driving , or Airborn Collision Avoidance Systems , such safety guarantees are paramount and require maintaining inviolable hard constraints in closed loop with the learned policy, as illustrated with Figure 1. In this paper, we seek to learn a robot control policy guaranteed to satisfy an affine state constraint in a deterministic but black-box environment. The state space region where this constraint is not satisfied corresponds to an unsafe area that must be avoided by the robot. Our key insight is to transform the state space surrounding this unsafe area into a repulsive buffer region as shown on Figure 2. This buffer is made repulsive by learning a policy whose actions push the robot state away from the unsafe area. To enable analytical verification of the repulsive character of our learned policy, we constrain its outputs to be affine over the buffer region. This key property allows to easily guarantee whether an affine constraint is satisfied. Our proposed framework is agnostic to the choice of the RL training algorithm and is applicable to both systems with continuous and discrete state and action spaces. Additionally, our approach can accommodate black-box environments by using a local measure of their nonlinearity, which can be numerically estimated. To the best of our knowledge, no other work learns a policy in such a way that the closed-loop system is guaranteed to satisfy a hard constraint. To ensure our policy produces affine outputs over the whole buffer region, we draw from existing literature in constraining neural network outputs. While this topic has been widely investigated     7 , we build on the POLICE algorithm proposed in [ref]7 to constrain our learned policy. Indeed, POLICE is capable of ensuring that a deep neural network with continuous piecewise affine activation functions produces affine outputs over a user-specified region. We build on this work and develop a paradigm for enforcing hard constraints in RL which we call POLICEd RL. Following this approach, we establish analytical conditions under which our learned policy guarantees constraint satisfaction. A natural follow-up question arising from these conditions is whether they are so stringent that no constraint-satisfying policy exist. To answer this crucial problem, we transform the question of existence of such a constraint-satisfying policy into a tractable linear problem. We will then demonstrate through a number of numerical examples how our method can be implemented. Then, using a 7DOF robotic arm, we compare the performance of our method with a number of representative baselines and demonstrate that our method outperforms all the baselines both in terms of its constraint satisfaction as well as its expected accumulated reward. In this work, we focus on constraining only actuated states in an effort to lighten the complexity of our theory. Such a setting is commonly used in a wide range of safety research such as the literature using of control barrier functions   5 0 as well as safe RL  5  6. We will provide a detailed review of these works in Section 2.3. In summary, our contributions in this work are as follows. We introduce POLICEd RL, a novel RL framework that can guarantee satisfaction of hard constraints by the closed-loop system composed of a black-box robot model and a trained policy. We transform the question of existence of such a constraint-satisfying policy into a tractable linear problem. We demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed POLICEd RL at guaranteeing the safety of an inverted pendulum and a robotic manipulator in a number of simulations using high-fidelity MuJoCo simulators 2. The remainder of this work is organized as follows.\nIn Section 2 we provide a survey of related works.\nIn Section 3 we describe prior work [ref]7 upon which we build our approach.\nIn Section 4 we introduce our problem formulation along with our framework.\nIn Section 5 we establish our approach and provide its theoretical guarantees to enforce the satisfaction of affine constraints.\nIn Section 6 we demonstrate how to implement our proposed POLICEd RL algorithm.\nIn Section 7 we present several numerical simulations illustrating our approach.\nFinally, we conclude the paper in Section 8.
