      "content": "Paper Title: Noisy group testing via spatial coupling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe monograph of Aldridge, Johnson and Scarlett¬†[ref]3 provides an excellent overview of the group testing literature.\nThe group testing problem comes in various different flavours: non-adaptive (where all tests are conducted concurrently) or adaptive (where tests are conducted in subsequent stages such that the tests at later stages may depend on the outcomes of earlier stages), as well as noiseless or noisy.\nAn important result of Aldridge shows that noiseless non-adaptive group testing does not perform better than plain individual testing if k=Œ©‚Äã(n)ùëòŒ©ùëõk=\\Omega(n), i.e.¬†if the number of infected individuals is linear in the size of the population¬†.\nTherefore, research on non-adaptive group testing focuses on the case k‚àºnŒ∏similar-toùëòsuperscriptùëõùúÉk\\sim n^{\\theta} with 0<Œ∏<10ùúÉ10<\\theta<1.\nFor non-adaptive noiseless group testing with this scaling of kùëòk two different test designs (Bernoulli and constant column) and various elementary algorithms have been proposed¬†.\nAmong these elementary designs and algorithms the best performance to date is achieved by the DD greedy algorithm on the constant column design¬†.\nHowever, the DD algorithm does not match the information-theoretic bound on the constant column design for all Œ∏ùúÉ\\theta¬†. Coja-Oghlan, Gebhard, Hahn-Klimroth and Loick proposed a more sophisticated test design for noiseless group testing based on spatial coupling¬†0, along with an efficient inference algorithm called SPIV.\nAdditionally, they improved the information-theoretic lower bound for non-adaptive noiseless group testing.\nThe number of tests required by the SPIV algorithm matches this new lower bound.\nIn effect, the combination of SPIV with the spatially coupled test design solves the noiseless non-adaptive group testing problem optimally both for exact and approximate recovery. The present article deals with the noisy non-adaptive variant of group testing.\nA noisy version of the efficient DD algorithm was previously studied on both the Bernoulli and the constant column design¬† .\nThe best previous exact recovery results for general noise were obtained by Johnson, Gebhard, Loick and Rolvien¬† by means of DD on the constant column design (see Theorem¬†2.1 below).\nTheorem¬†1.4 shows in combination with Theorem¬†1.3 that the new SPEX algorithm performs at least as well as any algorithm on the constant column design, including and particularly DD. Apart from the articles¬†  that dealt with the same general noise model as we consider here,\nseveral contributions focused on special noise models, particularly symmetric noise (p00=p11subscriptùëù00subscriptùëù11p_{00}=p_{11}). In this scenario Chen and Scarlett¬† recently determined the information-theoretically optimal number of tests required for exact recovery on the Bernoulli and constant column designs.\nThe constant column design outperforms the Bernoulli design.\nThe information-theoretic threshold identified by Chen and Scarlett matches the threshold cex‚Äã(Œ∏)subscriptùëêexùúÉc_{\\mathrm{ex}}(\\theta) from (1.10) in the special case of symmetric noise (see Appendix¬†E).\nHowever, Chen and Scarlett do not investigate the issue of efficient inference algorithms.\nInstead, they pose the existence of an efficient inference algorithm that matches the information-theoretic threshold as an open problem.\nTheorem¬†1.3 applied to symmetric noise answers their question in the affirmative. A further contribution of Scarlett and Cevher¬† contains a result on approximate recovery under the assumption of symmetric noise.\nIn this case Scarlett and Cevher obtain matching information-theoretic upper and lower bounds, albeit without addressing the question of efficient inference algorithms.\nTheorem¬†1.1 applied to the special case of symmetric noise provides a polynomial time inference algorithm that matches their lower bound. From a practical viewpoint non-adaptive group testing (where all tests are conducted in parallel) is preferable because results are available more rapidly than in the adaptive setting, where several rounds of testing are required.\nThat said, adaptive schemes may require a smaller total number of tests.\nThe case of noiseless adaptive group testing has been studied since the seminal work of Dorfman¬† from the 1940s.\nFor the case k‚àºnŒ∏similar-toùëòsuperscriptùëõùúÉk\\sim n^{\\theta} a technique known as generalized binary splitting gets by with the optimal number of tests¬† .\nAldridge¬† extended this approach to the case k=Œò‚Äã(n)ùëòŒòùëõk=\\Theta(n), obtaining near-optimal rates.\nRecently there has been significant progress on upper and lower bounds for noisy and adaptive group testing, although general optimal results remain elusive¬† . Beyond group testing in recent years important progress has been made on several inference problems by means of a combination of spatial coupling and message passing ideas.\nPerhaps the most prominent case in point is the compressed sensing problem¬† .\nFurther applications include the pooled data problem¬†  7 and CDMA¬†[ref]32, a signal processing problem.\nThe basic idea of spatial coupling, which we are going to discuss in some detail in Section¬†2.3, goes back to work on capacity-achieving linear codes¬†3 4 5 [ref]32 .\nThe SPIV algorithm from¬†0 combines a test design inspired by spatial coupling with a combinatorial inference algorithm.\nA novelty of the present work is that we replace this elementary algorithm by a novel variant of the Belief Propagation message passing algorithm¬†7 8 that lends itself to a rigorous analysis.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: The monograph of Aldridge, Johnson and Scarlett¬†[ref]3 provides an excellent overview of the group testing literature.\nThe group testing problem comes in various different flavours: non-adaptive (where all tests are conducted concurrently) or\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
