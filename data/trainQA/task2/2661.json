      "content": "Paper Title: On the Compression of Neural Networks Using ‚Ñì‚ÇÄ-Norm Regularization and Weight Pruning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this experiment, we consider the MNIST dataset and compare other pruning-based network compression approaches from the literature with the network compression scheme proposed in the present paper. In this context, two network topologies are considered, namely, Lenet-300-100 and Lenet-5-Caffe. The chosen pruning strategy is the global pruning due to the superior results observed in the first experiment.\nFor setting the training hyperparameters, we consider two different strategies. The first, termed NORM, is based on using layer-size normalized values for Œ±‚Ñì2subscriptùõºsubscript‚Ñì2\\alpha_{\\ell_{2}} and Œ±‚Ñì0subscriptùõºsubscript‚Ñì0\\alpha_{\\ell_{0}} [ref]37. Thus, three global hyperparameter values (Œ±‚Ñì2subscriptùõºsubscript‚Ñì2\\alpha_{\\ell_{2}}, Œ±‚Ñì0subscriptùõºsubscript‚Ñì0\\alpha_{\\ell_{0}}, and Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta) are tuned experimentally, besides the learning rate Œ∑ùúÇ\\eta. In the second strategy, called SEP, individual values of Œ±‚Ñì2subscriptùõºsubscript‚Ñì2\\alpha_{\\ell_{2}}, Œ±‚Ñì0subscriptùõºsubscript‚Ñì0\\alpha_{\\ell_{0}}, and Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta are used for each network layer. In this case, we start with the hyperparameter values from the NORM strategy and fine tune individual hyperparameters for each layer experimentally. This procedure allows enhancing the penalization in layers possessing a higher number of weights with larger magnitudes without compromising the overall network accuracy. In general terms, NORM is simpler to use, whereas SEP tends to produce better results due to the increased degrees of freedom. The first aspect evaluated in this experiment is the trade-off between accuracy and compression ratio obtained by using the proposed approach. Figures 5 and 6 depict such a trade-off for the Lenet-300-100 and Lenet-5-Coeffee networks, respectively, considering both NORM and SEP strategies, as well as FT. From these figures, one can notice that very high compression ratios can be obtained by using the proposed approach with negligible performance loss for the cases considered here. As expected, the best results are obtained by using the combination of SEP strategy with FT (around 100√ó100\\times compression ratio for Lenet-300-100 and more than 300√ó300\\times for Lenet-5-Caffe). However, even the simpler NORM strategy was capable of leading to satisfactory values (around 90√ó90\\times for Lenet-300-100 and 200√ó200\\times for Lenet-5-Caffe). The results obtained by using the proposed approach are now confronted with those obtained by using the following pruning-based compression methods from the literature: threshold pruning (THP) , dynamic network surgery (DNS) , group horseshoe (BC-GHS) [ref]46, sparse variational dropout (SparseVD) , cutting plane algorithm (CPA) [ref]48, global sparse momentum (GSM) , and automatic network pruning (Autoprune) . Moreover, we also consider the following pruning methods based on the use of the ‚Ñì0subscript‚Ñì0\\ell_{0} norm:\n‚Ñì0subscript‚Ñì0\\ell_{0} with hard-concrete approximation (L0subscriptùêø0L_{0}-HC) , ‚Ñì0subscript‚Ñì0\\ell_{0} augment-reinforce-merge (L0subscriptùêø0L_{0}-ARM) [ref]37, ‚Ñì0subscript‚Ñì0\\ell_{0} based on ADMM (L0subscriptùêø0L_{0}-ADMM) , and learn compression using ‚Ñì2subscript‚Ñì2\\ell_{2} and ‚Ñì0subscript‚Ñì0\\ell_{0} norms (L0subscriptùêø0L_{0}-L2subscriptùêø2L_{2}-LC)  (results from  are not included since the approach in  is a direct evolution of that in  and presents superior results).\nThe comparisons among all approaches considered are presented in Tables 2 and 3 for LeNet-300-100 and LeNet-5-Caffe, respectively. From these tables, one can infer that the proposed approach is very competitive, generally resulting in superior trade-offs between accuracy and compression ratio as compared with the other approaches from the literature.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: consider two different strategies. The first, termed NORM, is based on using layer-size normalized values for Œ±‚Ñì2subscriptùõºsubscript‚Ñì2\\alpha_{\\ell_{2}} and Œ±‚Ñì0subscriptùõºsubscript‚Ñì0\\alpha_{\\ell_{0}} [ref]37. Thus, three global hyperparameter values (Œ±‚Ñì2subscriptùõºsubscript‚Ñì2\\alpha_{\\ell_{2}}, Œ±‚Ñì0subscriptùõºsubscript‚Ñì0\\alpha_{\\ell_{0}}, and Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta) are tuned experimentally, besides the learning\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
