      "content": "Paper Title: Cut-and-Paste Object Insertion by Enabling Deep Image Prior for Reshading\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nObject insertion originated with Lalonde et al. . They insert objects into target images and control illumination problems by checking objects for compatibility with targets; Bansal et al. [ref]1 and Lee et al.  do so by matching contexts. Poisson blending   can resolve nasty boundary artifacts, but significant illumination and color mismatches will cause cross-talk between target and fragment, producing ugly results. Karsch et al.   how convincing insertions of computer graphics (CG) objects into inverse rendering models.\nInverse rendering trained with rendered images can produce excellent reshading of CG objects .\nHowever, recovering a renderable model from an image fragment is extremely difficult,\nparticularly if the fragment has an odd surface texture. Liao et al.  showed that a weak geometric model of the object can be\nsufficient for correcting shading if one has strong the geometric information about the target scene. However, we do not know about geometry of the target scene, except for their normals. We use image harmonization (IH) methods as a strong baseline.\nIH train models to correct corrupted images where a fragment is adjusted by some noise process (made brighter; recolored; etc.) to the original image     , and so could clearly be applied here. But we find those IH methods very often change the albedo of an inserted object, rather than its shading. This is because they rely on ensuring consistency of color representations across the image. In contrast, we wish to correct shading alone. Image Relighting: With appropriate training data, for indoor-scenes, one can predict\nmultiple spherical harmonic components of illumination ,\nor parametric lighting model  or even full radiance maps\nat scene points from images  .\nFor outdoor scenes, the sun’s position is predicted in panoramas using a learning-based approach . However, we do not have access to either training data with lighting parameters/environment maps to construct such a radiance field. Recent single-image relighting methods relight portrait faces under directional lighting   .\nOur method can relight matte, gloss and specular objects with complex material properties like cars (Fig. 14) for both indoor and outdoor spatially varying lighting only from a single image and without requiring physics-based BRDF . Land’s Retinex (image decomposition) model\nassumes effective albedo displays sharp, localized changes (which result in large image gradients), and that shading has small\ngradients    . These models require no ground truth.\nAn alternative is to use CG rendered images for training   [ref]12.\nCurrent image decomposition evaluation uses the weighted human disagreement rate (WHDR) ; current champions are [ref]12 [ref]13. We use an image decomposition built around approximate statistical models of albedo and shading [ref]13 to train our network without requiring real image decompositions. Our method has reasonable, but not SOTA, WHDR; but we show that improvements in WHDR do not result in improvements in reshading (Fig. 3).\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Object insertion originated with Lalonde et al. .
