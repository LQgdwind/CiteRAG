      "content": "Paper Title: Structure-Aware Image Segmentation with Homotopy Warping\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe baseline methods used in this paper are listed as follows: RoadTracer : RoadTracer is an iterative graph construction based method where node locations are selected by a CNN. VecRoad : VecRoad is a point-based iterative graph exploration scheme with segmentation-cues guidance and flexible steps. iCurb : iCurb is an imitation learning-based solution for off-line road-curb detection method. UNet 1 [ref]10: The standard UNet trained with dice loss. Though lots of other segmentation methods/backbones have been proposed for image segmentation, UNet is still one of the most powerful methods for image segmentation with fine-structures. DIVE : DIVE is a popular EM neuron segmentation method. VGG-UNet : VGG-UNet uses the response of selected filters from a pretrained CNN to construct a new loss function. This is one of the earliest works trying to deal with correct delineation. TopoNet [ref]25: TopoNet is a recent work which tries to learn to segment with correct topology based on a novel persistent homology based loss function. clDice 4: Another topology aware method for tubular structure segmentation. The basic idea is to use thinning techniques to extract the skeletons (centerlines) of the likelihood maps and ground truth mask. A new cldice loss is proposed based on the extracted skeletons besides traditional pixel-wise loss. DMT : DMT is a topology-aware deep image segmentation method via discrete morse theory. Instead of identifying topological critical pixels/locations, the DMT loss tries to identify the whole morse structures, and the new loss is defined on the identified morse structures. Note that RoadTracer, VecRoad and iCurb are graph-based methods for road tracing. Graph-based approaches learn to explicitly detect keypoints and connect them. Since the graph is built iteratively, some detection errors in the early stage can propagate and lead to even more errors. Segmentation-based methods avoid this issue as they make predictions in a global manner. The challenge with segmentation methods in road network reconstruction is they may fail in thin structures especially when the signal is weak. This is exactly what we are addressing in this paper – using critical pixels to improve segmentation-based methods. VGG-UNet, TopoNet, clDice and DMT are topology-aware segmentation methods.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: iterative graph exploration scheme with segmentation-cues guidance and flexible steps. iCurb : iCurb is an imitation learning-based solution for off-line road-curb detection method.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
