      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Generalization in Reinforcement Learning with Mixture Regularization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRainbow [ref]6 combines the following six extensions for the DQN algorithm: double DQN , prioritized replay , dueling networks , multi-step learning , distributional RL [ref]1 and Noisy Nets [ref]5. As in distributional RL [ref]1, Rainbow learns to approximate the distribution of returns instead of the expected return. At each update, the algorithm samples a batch of transitions from the replay buffer and minimizes the following Kullbeck-Leibler divergence between the predicted distribution and the target distribution of returns: Here dtsubscript𝑑𝑡d_{t} denotes the predicted distribution with discrete support 𝒛𝒛\\boldsymbol{z} and probability masses 𝒑θ​(st,at)subscript𝒑𝜃subscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝑎𝑡\\boldsymbol{p}_{\\theta}(s_{t},a_{t}) and\ndt(n)superscriptsubscript𝑑𝑡𝑛d_{t}^{(n)} denotes the target distribution with discrete support Rt(n)+γt(n)​𝒛superscriptsubscript𝑅𝑡𝑛superscriptsubscript𝛾𝑡𝑛𝒛R_{t}^{(n)}+\\gamma_{t}^{(n)}\\boldsymbol{z} and probability masses 𝒑θ¯​(st+n,at+n∗)subscript𝒑¯𝜃subscript𝑠𝑡𝑛subscriptsuperscript𝑎𝑡𝑛\\boldsymbol{p}_{\\bar{\\theta}}(s_{t+n},a^{*}_{t+n}), where at+n∗subscriptsuperscript𝑎𝑡𝑛a^{*}_{t+n} denotes the bootstrap action.\nThe target distribution is constructed by contracting the value distribution in st+nsubscript𝑠𝑡𝑛s_{t+n} according to the cumulative discount γt(n)superscriptsubscript𝛾𝑡𝑛\\gamma_{t}^{(n)} and shifting it by the truncated n𝑛n-step discounted return Rt(n)≡∑k=0n−1γt(k)​Rt+k+1superscriptsubscript𝑅𝑡𝑛superscriptsubscript𝑘0𝑛1superscriptsubscript𝛾𝑡𝑘subscript𝑅𝑡𝑘1R_{t}^{(n)}\\equiv\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\\gamma_{t}^{(k)}R_{t+k+1}, where\nγtk=∏i=1kγt+isuperscriptsubscript𝛾𝑡𝑘superscriptsubscriptproduct𝑖1𝑘subscript𝛾𝑡𝑖\\gamma_{t}^{k}=\\prod_{i=1}^{k}\\gamma_{t+i} with γt=γsubscript𝛾𝑡𝛾\\gamma_{t}=\\gamma except on episode termination where γt=0subscript𝛾𝑡0\\gamma_{t}=0. ΦΦ\\Phi is a L2-projection of the target distribution onto the support 𝒛𝒛\\boldsymbol{z}. The bootstrap action at+n∗subscriptsuperscript𝑎𝑡𝑛a^{*}_{t+n} is greedily selected by the online network and evaluated by the target network. Following prioritized replay , Rainbow prioritizes transitions by\nthe KL loss. Rainbow uses a dueling network architecture adapted for use with return distributions. Following Noisy Nets [ref]5, all linear layers are replaced with their noisy equivalent.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: Rainbow [ref]6 combines the following six extensions for the DQN algorithm: double DQN , prioritized replay , dueling networks , multi-step learning , distributional RL [ref]1 and Noisy Nets [ref]5.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
