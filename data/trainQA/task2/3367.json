      "content": "Paper Title: Almost Optimal Variance-Constrained Best Arm Identification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are three main families of algorithms for the standard fixed-confidence BAI problem‚Äîconfidence bound-based (CBB) algorithms    [ref]9, tracking-based (TB) algorithms 0, and Bayesian-style (BS) algorithms . Jamieson and Nowak¬† provide a comprehensive survey for CBB algorithms, which includes the Action Elimination algorithm , the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm  and the LUCB algorithm [ref]9. While LUCB [ref]9 is originally designed for top-kùëòk arm identification, Jamieson and Nowak¬† claimed that LUCB-based methods perform well both theoretically and empirically for BAI task (thus we build our algorithm upon LUCB). LUCB samples the arm with the largest sample mean itsubscriptùëñùë°i_{t} and another arm with the largest upper confidence bound jtsubscriptùëóùë°j_{t} within the remaining arms. It terminates when the lower confidence bound of itsubscriptùëñùë°i_{t} is greater than the upper confidence bound of jtsubscriptùëóùë°j_{t}. The family of LIL techniques   which provide uniform (in time) bounds on the deviation of an empirical statistic from the true quantity can boost the performance of these CBB methods. TB algorithms such as Track and Stop 0 track the proportion of arm pulls and achieves asymptotic optimality. BS algorithms such as Top-Two Thompson sampling  are easy to implement, asymptotically optimal, and yield good theoretical and empirical results. For the risk-aware BAI problem,\nthere is a large body of literature that measures the quality of an arm by general functions of its distribution instead of the expectation.\nThe mean-variance paradigm is studied by 4,  and  under the regret minimization framework.\nSani et al.¬†4 regarded the variance as the measure of risk and proposed the MV-LCB algorithm.\nThe regret analysis of MV-LCB 4 was improved by .\nZhu and Tan¬† and Chang et al.¬† proposed Thompson sampling-based algorithms that are optimal under different regimes for the mean-variance and CVaR criteria respectively.\nThe mean-variance paradigm was generalized by¬† where the quality of an arm is measured by some functions of the mean and the variance.\nAnother class of risk measures that is widely studied consists of the VaR and CVaR.\nUnder the BAI framework, Prashanth et al.¬† adapted the successive rejects algorithm of  for optimizing the CVaR.\nKagrecha et al.¬† utilized a linear combination of the reward and the CVaR as the measure of quality of the arms and relaxed the prior knowledge of the reward distribution; this was generalized recently to general risk measures¬†.\nDavid and Shimkin¬† aimed at finding the arm with the maximum Œ±ùõº\\alpha-quantile.\nUnder the regret minimization framework, Kagrecha et al.¬† and Baudry et al.¬† regarded the CVaR as a risk measure and proposed the RC-LCB algorithm and Thompson sampling-based algorithms respectively.\nOther risk measures have also been considered.\nFor example, the Sharpe ratio, together with the mean-variance, was adopted by  to balance the tradeoff between return and risk.\nMaillard¬† proposed RA-UCB which considers the measure of entropic risk with a parameter ŒªùúÜ\\lambda. Cassel et al.¬† presented a general and systematic approach to analyzing risk-aware MABs. They adopted the Empirical Distribution Performance Measure and proposed the U-UCB algorithm to perform ‚Äúproxy regret minimization‚Äù. Another approach casts the risk-aware MAB problem as a constrained MAB problem, i.e., the allowable risk that the agent can tolerate is formulated as a constraint in the online optimization problem. This is of practical interest in high-risk settings (such as clinical trials) in which the agent demands that the arm (treatment) to be eventually selected has a risk that is strictly below a permissible threshold.\nDavid et al.¬† focused on identifying an arm with almost the largest mean among those almost satisfying an Œ±ùõº\\alpha-quantile constraint under the fixed confidence setting. The authors presented a UCB-based algorithm named RiskAverse-UCB-m-best.\nChang¬† considered an average cost constraint where each arm is associated with a cost variable that is independent of the reward and analyzed the probability of pulling optimal arms.\nThis approach is also related to safe bandits  , where the arms are conservatively pulled to meet the safety constraint. However, safe bandits are often considered in a cumulative regret setting and the pulled arms should be safe with high probability (w.h.p.). A brief and current survey of taking risk into account in the study of multi-armed bandits is presented in¬†0. The variance-constrained BAI problem consists of two distinct tasks‚Äîwe seek optimality in the mean and feasibility in the variance. This is different from the Pareto-front identification with bandit feedback problem¬†1 2 3, which seeks optimality in both objectives, i.e., it seeks a solution/arm that has high mean and low variance simultaneously. While the best feasible arm, if it exists, belongs to the Pareto-Front, we still need to identify the best feasible arm among all arms on the Pareto-Front. These two problems are relevant but are essentially different. The problem is also related to identifying the best arm among the feasible arms. In¬†4, the arms follow multi-dimensional distributions and the feasible arms are defined to be arms whose mean vectors lie in a polyhedron. It only involves a single mean vector and its projection onto either a subspace (for the objective) and a polyhedron (for the feasibility constraint), while here we have to consider two different statistics‚Äîthe mean and the variance. There are works associated with the variance estimation¬†5 6 in the BAI problem. However, the variance estimation is done to improve the algorithms for the standard BAI objective in both works. Our feasibility constraint in terms of the variance, in conjunction with the standard BAI objective, is a novel problem setting.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: There are three main families of algorithms for the standard fixed-confidence BAI problem‚Äîconfidence bound-based (CBB) algorithms    [ref]9, tracking-based (TB) algorithms 0, and Bayesian-style (BS) algorithms .
