      "content": "Paper Title: HyperTree Proof Search for Neural Theorem Proving\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur transformer architecture uses a 12-layer encoder and a 6-layer decoder in all experiments. We use an embedding dimension of 1600 in the encoder and 1024 in the decoder for both Metamath and Lean. For Equations, where we expect the model to require less decoding capacity, the decoding dimension is lowered to 512.\nWe found that reducing the decoder capacity increases the decoding speed without impacting the performance, as previously observed by Kasai et al.  in the context of machine translation.\nOur models are composed of 440M parameters for Equations and 600M parameters for Metamath and Lean (for comparison, GPT-f uses a 770M parameter, 36-layer model). During fine-tuning, we train our models with the Adam optimizer  and an inverse square-root learning rate scheduler [ref]36.\nWe use a dropout of 0.2 [ref]44 to reduce the overfitting of our models.\nWe also apply layer-dropout  with a dropout rate of 0.1 to further reduce overfitting and stabilize training.\nWe implement our models in PyTorch  and use float16 operations to speed up training and to reduce the memory usage of our models. During online training, we alternate between the goal-tactic objective, used during fine-tuning on the supervised dataset, and the goal-tactic and goal-critic objectives on data generated by the provers.\nAs the model and the data generated by the provers are constantly evolving, we do not want the learning rate to decrease to 0, and we fix it to 3×10−53superscript1053\\times 10^{-5} after the warm-up phase.\nUnless mentioned otherwise (e.g. for large experiments), we run all Metamath and Equations experiments with 16 trainers and 32 provers for a total of 48 V100 GPUs.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: Metamath and Lean (for comparison, GPT-f uses a 770M parameter, 36-layer model).

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
