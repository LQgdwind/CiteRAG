      "content": "Paper Title: An Ensemble Teacher-Student Learning Approach with Poisson Sub-sampling to Differential Privacy Preserving Speech Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent research studies to ensure data privacy in an ASR system can be classified into two groups: (i) systemic, such as federated computing [ref]14, features isolation [ref]15, and (ii) algorithmic, mainly machine learning with differential privacy, such differentially private stochastic gradient descent¬† (DPSGD) and PATE¬† . Federated architectures¬†[ref]15 have been studied in the speech processing community to increase privacy protection. For example, the average gradient method¬† was used to update the learning model for decentralized training.\nHowever, those approaches at a system-level usually make some assumptions about the limited accessibility of malicious attackers and provide less universal measures about privacy guarantees. Meanwhile, algorithmic efforts focus on ‚Äúsystem-agnostic‚Äù studies with more flexibility. The DP-preserving ML algorithm can be explained as a measure of the probabilistic difference of a specific outcome by a multiplicative factor, or exp‚Å°(Œµ)ùúÄ\\exp(\\varepsilon), and an additive amount, Œ¥ùõø\\delta. The DP mechanism with post-processing¬† (e.g., training in different mini-batches) is under a Renyi-divergence¬†[ref]6 calculation with order Œ±‚àà(1,‚àû)ùõº1\\alpha\\in(1,\\infty), denoted as RDPŒ±subscriptRDPùõº\\text{RDP}_{\\alpha}.\nA Renyi differential privacy (RDP)-based divergence measurement¬†[ref]6 is a generalization form of ŒµùúÄ\\varepsilon-DP that has the advantage of composing individual privacy budgets, and capturing the privacy guarantee of Gaussian noise in a batch-wise analysis. From recent studies¬† , sub-sampled based RDP further uses less amount of noise to achieve a target privacy budget¬† in database analysis, but how to connect sub-sampled based to ML systems RDP is still a new research direction. Meanwhile, recent cyber-security-related literature¬†  have suggested that speech privacy is one of the most important criteria in selecting voice-based servers for Mandarin Chinese. Although tackling system-based data protection has been investigated in¬†, there are relatively limited studies taking into account the formal DP-protection mechanism in speech processing applications for Mandarin languages. Therefore, how the additive DP-preserving noise affects the model performance of Mandarin speech applications is still an open issue, which deserves more investigation. In the next section, we review the basic components of PATE and discuss some potential improvements that lead the proposed framework.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: Recent research studies to ensure data privacy in an ASR system can be classified into two groups: (i) systemic, such as federated computing [ref]14, features isolation [ref]15, and (ii) algorithmic, mainly machine learning with differential privacy, such differentially private stochastic gradient descent¬† (DPSGD) and PATE¬† .
