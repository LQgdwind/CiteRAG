Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

In this qualitative study, we therefore aim to provide additional evidence for the applicability and effectiveness of AI engineering practices.\nWe accomplish this by applying 10 proposed practices during a case study, namely the development of a concrete AI-based system that predicts stock prices using ML models and autonomously performs trades based on the results.\nWe show how applying each of the 10 practices can improve the development and where it has its place in the ML development process.\nFurthermore, we synthesize generalizable insights on experienced challenges during the development and solutions to overcome them.\nWe hope that our results can support AI engineering teams during the adoption of these practices, and ultimately enable them to apply the practices more effectively.\nSimilarly, the experienced and solved challenges can be especially helpful for newcomers to the field of AI engineering.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: and more critical software systems are based on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), such as autonomous cars, power grid management software, or autonomous stock trading systems [ref]1.\nWhile this enables functionality that was previously impossible, AI-based systems also come with additional complexity and new engineering challenges .\nExamples are efficiently managing large\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
