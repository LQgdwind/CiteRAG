      "content": "Paper Title: Dataset Distillation by Matching Training Trajectories\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor low-resolution tasks, we begin with the 32×\\times32 CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets . For these datasets, we employ ZCA whitening as done in previous work [ref]25 [ref]26, using the Kornia  implementation with default parameters.\nStaying with precedent, we use a depth-3 ConvNet taken directly from the open-source code  [ref]45. As seen in Table 1, our method significantly outperforms all baselines in every setting. In fact, on the one image per class setting, we improve the next best method (DSA [ref]45) to almost twice test accuracy, on both datasets. For CIFAR-10, these distilled images can be seen in Figure 4. CIFAR-100 images are visualized in the supplementary material In Table 2, we also compare with a recent method KIP [ref]25 [ref]26, where the distilled data is learned with respect to the Neural Tangent Kernel. Because KIP training is agnostic to actual network width, we test their result on both a ConvNet of the same width as us and other methods (128) and a ConvNet of larger width (1024) (which is shown in KIP paper [ref]26). Based on the the infinite-width network limit, KIP may exhibit a gap with practical finite-width networks. Our method does not suffer from this limitation and generally achieves better performance. In all settings, our method, trained on the 128-width network, outperforms KIP results evaluated on both widths, except for just one setting where KIP is applied on the much wider 1024-width network. As noted in the previous methods , we also see significant diminishing returns when allowing more images in our synthetic datasets. For instance, on CIFAR-10, we see an increase from 46.3% to 65.3% classification accuracy when increasing from 1 to 10 images per class, but only an increase from 65.3% to 71.5% when increasing the number of distilled images per class from 10 to 50. If we look at the one image per class visualizations in Figure 4 (top), we see very abstract, yet still recognizable, representations of each class. When we limit the task to just one synthetic image per class, the optimization is forced to squeeze as much of the class’s distinguishing information as possible into just one sample. When we allow more images in which to disperse the class’s information, the optimization has the freedom to spread the class’s discriminative features among the multiple samples, resulting in a diverse set of structured images we see in Figure 4 (bottom) (e.g., different types of cars and horses with different poses). Cross-Architecture Generalization.  \nWe also evaluate how well our synthetic data performs on architectures different from the one used to distill it on the CIFAR-10, 1 image per class task. In Table 3, we show our baseline ConvNet performance and evaluate on ResNet , VGG , and AlexNet . For KIP, instead of the Kornia  ZCA implementation, we use the authors’ custom ZCA implementation for evaluation of their method. Our method is solidly the top performer on all the transfer models except for AlexNet where we lie within one standard deviation of DSA. This could be attributed to our higher baseline performance, but it still shows that our method is robust to changes in architecture. 1 image per class\n 10 images per class\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: For low-resolution tasks, we begin with the 32×\\times32 CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets .
