      "content": "Paper Title: Modular probabilistic programming with algebraic effects (2019)\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPlotkin and Pretnar‚Äôs  algebraic effects and handlers, are a language feature that generalize commonly occurring control flow constructs e.g. mutable state, non-determinism, exceptions, interactive input-output etc. Koka is a functional language that places algebraic effects at the core of its design. Koka also uses type signatures that not only describe the input and output value of a function, but also effect annotations that indicate the side-effects that come from behaviours that a function may perform. \n Listings 1 to 4 give simple examples of programming with effects. In Listing 1, add is well defined for all values of x and y, and does not cause any effects, so the Koka type system allows its effect annotation to be total. By adding in a print statement, Listing 3 may no longer be marked as total, and must be annotated with the console effect. Koka supports polymorphic effect types. In Listing 4, the presence of _e in the type signature means there is some effect that can be unified with _‚Äãe_ùëí\\_e, in addition to the already existing total effect type. In this case, _‚Äãe_ùëí\\_e will be unified with console. Specific effect operations can also be declared with the effect keyword. Listing 2 details three effects used by Koka Bayes. The sample effect takes the empty type and returns a double, the score effect takes an exp data type and returns the unit type and the yield effect takes and returns the unit type. Adding the sample operation to a computation, requires its computation to include sample. In Koka, an effect type indicates that the computation may incur the particular effect, though it does not have to incur this effect. However, if the effect type is not indicated in the signature then the computation will not incur the effect. Precise inference of the exact effect type is in general undecidable since Koka is Turing complete (consider a loop that may not terminate or cause an exception). \n User defined effect operations cause a runtime exception unless the program provides an appropriate effect handler. Handlers provide the semantics for computations built out of effect operations . In a computation, the presence of an effect acts as a signal, which propagates outwards until it reaches an effect handler of the computation with a matching clause . The typing judgments for deep and shallow handlers  In Figure 2.2 and Figure 2.3 provide further insight on the workings of effect handlers. Handlers are specified via sets of mappings, which consist of return clauses or effect operations clauses. For each effect operation, both types of handler specify a continuation. A continuation represents the remaining computation which is currently being handled. The only difference between the types of deep and shallow handlers is the type of the continuation kùëòk. The continuations are similar in that they take the effect parameter pùëùp with type BisubscriptùêµùëñB_{i}. However, the effects under which the continuation proceeds along with the return types of the continuations differ: In the deep case, the effect operations Eùê∏E are handled by the handler, leaving a new effect E‚Ä≤superscriptùê∏‚Ä≤E^{{}^{\\prime}}. Handlers in Koka, default to deep handlers. In the shallow case, because the continuation returns an un-handled computation, the continuation indicates that the effect Eùê∏E is not discharged. The weighted handler in Listing 5 handles score effects. The handler (colored in olive), is initially called with wp. Line 3 creates a reference to this weight, so its value can be updated as successive score effects are encountered. Line 4 handles the ‚Äòaction‚Äô using the handle keyword. The computation takes the unit type and returns an aùëéa with with effect annotation <score|e>, i.e. it contains score effects (effects are colored in magenta) and any other effects eùëíe. As score effects are encountered, this handler multiplies the parameter to each score effect with the previously stored score, which, at the point in the program when the first score statement is encountered, will be the initial weight wp. This iterative multiplication progressively calculates and then assigns, a real valued score to a computation. After each handled score effect, the result of each multiplication is stored as the new score. The program is then resumed with the unit type. Return values are returned in a pair along with the stored weight. The random_sampler handler in Listing 6 handles sample effects by resuming computations with random doubles, thus converting sample effects into Koka‚Äôs built in ndet effects. \n Algebraic effects have been used to perform probabilistic programming before in Pyro‚Äôs Poutine library . Moore and Gorinova et al.   realize that interceptors in Edward [ref]4 and other operations such as Tracing, Conditioning or accumulating the log joint density of a program, are accidental implementations of effect handlers. However, none of the works use effect types and their inference algorithms are not based off of a denotational semantics and thus not necessarily correct.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: built in ndet effects. \n Algebraic effects have been used to perform probabilistic programming before in Pyro‚Äôs Poutine library .
