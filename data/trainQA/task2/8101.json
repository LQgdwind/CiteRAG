      "content": "Paper Title: Record-biased permutations and their permuton limit\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAverage case analysis of algorithms on discrete structures is an important research topic, at the crossroad of computer science and mathematics. It consists in stepping outside the usual framework of the worst case analysis of an algorithm by setting a distribution on the set of possible inputs of size n𝑛n and computing or estimating the expected running time. See  for a detailed account on this topic.\nThis approach is particularly relevant when a discrepancy from the worst case results is observed in practice: the most famous example is QuickSort sorting algorithm  whose worst case and average case running times are 𝒪​(n2)𝒪superscript𝑛2\\mathcal{O}(n^{2}) and 𝒪​(n​log⁡n)𝒪𝑛𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n\\log n), respectively, and which is implemented as the basic sorting procedure in many programming languages. Most often in average case analysis, the uniform distribution on the set of inputs of a given size n𝑛n is chosen, then letting n𝑛n tend to infinite. While this assumption is the most natural one from a mathematical perspective, it does not always provide an accurate view of the typical behavior of some real-life algorithms used on real-life data. For instance, some popular programming languages switched from QuickSort to TimSort or PowerSort  when they observed that the input of sorting algorithms is often already partially sorted.\nTo reckon with this observation and provide a more realistic analysis of the algorithms that are actually used, it is quite natural to work under the assumption of a non-uniform distribution of the inputs, chosen to account for some specific features of the data set on which the algorithm is used, while being mathematically tractable. The starting point of this work is the analysis, realistic in the above sense, of algorithms working on arrays of numbers, and typically sorting algorithms. In this context, the inputs can be modelled as permutations, as only the comparisons between two entries matter, not their actual values. A priori unrelated to the computer science motivation, the study of non-uniform distributions on permutations has been an active research topic in discrete probability for several decades. Among the most studied models, one can cite the Ewens distribution  and the Mallows distribution , both introducing an exponential bias according to a statistic on permutations (specifically, the number of cycles for the Ewens model and the number of inversions for the Mallows model). In our earlier work , we defined another non-uniform distribution on permutations, which we call record-biased of parameter θ>0𝜃0\\theta>0. It also has an exponential bias: this time, the probability of a permutation σ𝜎\\sigma is proportional to θrec⁡(σ)superscript𝜃rec𝜎\\theta^{\\operatorname{rec}(\\sigma)} where rec⁡(σ)rec𝜎\\operatorname{rec}(\\sigma) is the number of records (a.k.a. left-to-right maxima) of σ𝜎\\sigma. We demonstrate in  that this model is meaningful in the context of presortedness, which naturally arises when studying algorithms that are designed to be efficient for almost sorted sequences [ref]23. In addition, as we will review later, the record-biased distribution is the image of the Ewens distribution by the Foata bijection (or fundamental bijection [21, §10.2]). This fact can be used to prove some results on record-biased permutations: this applies to some of the results of  and the present paper (although only a small proportion in both papers). The purpose of  was to provide a fine-grained analysis of several algorithms under the record-biased distribution, in an attempt to reconcile the theoretical complexity of these algorithms with their behavior observed in practice. For example, we compared two algorithms (one naive and one more clever) solving the problem of searching both the minimum and the maximum in an array, by expressing the number of mispredictions that a branch predictor makes in each of them; this participates in explaining why the naive algorithm outerperforms in practice the clever one, while making more comparisons between entries.\nThe model of record-biased permutations has also been studied by B. Corsini in , which describes the height of binary search trees built from record-biased permutations. Since then, it appeared to us that the model of record-biased permutations was likely to have nice properties, beyond those described in  .\nThe purpose of the present paper is to provide a mathematical analysis of record-biased permutations, exhibiting such properties to complement these earlier results.\nAn important part of our work focuses of a regime with a very strong bias towards sortedness (with θ𝜃\\theta that is linear w.r.t. the size, hence a number of records that is also linear w.r.t. the size); the interest for this regime is not only because of the nice mathematical results we can prove, but also because it is more realistic in terms of real-life applications, since using a constant θ𝜃\\theta does not change sufficiently the typical shape of the input. A new important aspect of the present study is the description of the typical limit shape of record-biased permutations. While our first results describe the typical behavior of numerical quantities on record-biased permutations, we go a step further by describing also the limit of the diagrams of record-biased permutations, by means of their permuton limit. Permutons have been introduced in    as a permutation analogue of graphons, which allow to describe limits of dense graphs. The description of permuton limits of non-uniform random permutations has attracted quite a lot of attention lately (see e.g. [1, 5, 4, 10, 11, 20, and references therein]), and is still a developing topic. Our work also contributes to this growing literature. The rest of the article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review some basics on permutations and some known results on the Ewens distribution . We define record-biased permutations and present the link between Ewens permutations and record-biased permutations through Foata’s bijection [21, §10.2]. In Section 3, we present several generative processes corresponding to the record-biased distribution of permutations of any given size, and how they can be used to achieve efficient random generation under this distribution. Section 4 studies the behavior of some classical statistics on record-biased permutations. We first obtain explicit formulas for the expectations of these statistics, and study how these behave in various regimes for the parameter θ𝜃\\theta, in particular when θ=λ​n𝜃𝜆𝑛\\theta=\\lambda n is linear w.r.t. the size n𝑛n.\nWe next focus on the regime where θ𝜃\\theta is constant, deriving the asymptotic distributions of the studied statistics as the size goes to infinity: three are Gaussian, and the last one follows a beta distribution, asymptotically. Finally, we describe the typical shape of the diagram of a record-biased permutation by establishing the permuton limit of random record-biased permutations of size n𝑛n as n𝑛n tends to infinity, in the linear regime where θ=λ​n𝜃𝜆𝑛\\theta=\\lambda n. It should be noted that the results of Section 4.1 already appear in , but with a different proof. While the proofs in  relied on careful case analysis, the proofs in the present paper follow easily from the generative processes of Section 3. We believe that this approach is more enlightening than the former one.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: We demonstrate in  that this model is meaningful in the context of presortedness, which naturally arises when studying algorithms that are designed to be efficient for almost sorted sequences [ref]23.
