      "content": "Paper Title: Modeling and Mining Multi-Aspect Graphs With Scalable Streaming Tensor Decomposition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTensors are the generalization of vectors and matrices. They are ubiquitous (e.g. images, videos, and social networks) and ever-increasing in popularity. With the opportunity to handle large volumes and velocity of data due to recent technical developments, such as mobile connectivity [ref]189, digital tools , biomedical technology , and modern medical testing techniques , we face multi-source and multi-view [ref]93 datasets. Suppose, for example, we are given health care record data, such as Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) , and we have information about patients who visited the hospital, or who got what kind of diagnosis in which visit, and when. Time modeling is difficult for the regular tensor factorization methods (e.g. CP  and Tucker ), due to either data irregularity or time-shifted latent factor appearance of such data. Hence, data is formulated as a 3-mode PARAFAC2 tensor  as shown in Figure 1. With a rich variety of applications, PARAFAC2 decomposition  is a very effective analytical method and if performed correctly, it can reveal underlying structures of data. However, there are research issues that need to be tackled in the field of data mining in order for PARAFAC2 decompositions to assert their role as an effective tool for practitioners. One challenge, which has received considerable attention, is finding the correct number of components aka rank of PARAFAC2 decomposition. The tensor rank calculation has been proven to be NP-Hard  and in various cases NP-Complete . Additionally, irregularity of data makes it a more complex and trivial task. This is the reason that various tensor mining papers [ref]6 , understandably, set the number of components manually. PARAFAC2 decomposition is able to handle various chromatographic data and choosing the correct number of components allows it to separate each variability source by using spectral information. Consider amino acid data  where three compounds tyrosine, tryptophan and phenylalanine dissolved in phosphate-buffered water. In Figure (1), PARAFAC2 decomposition with rank-333 resembles the pure spectra of tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanin. When PARAFAC2 decomposition with rank-444 is applied to this data, the fourth component does not resemble any of the compounds and in fact, it does not seem to reflect any chemical information. Therefore, it becomes very important to select the correct number of components to solve real-world problems. In literature, one popular approach to find the rank of CP tensor is core consistency diagnostic (CORCONDIA) . The CORCONDIA essentially assesses significant deviations from a super-diagonal core tensor. This would suggest that the CP decomposition is not optimal either because the selected rank is not correct, or the CP model cannot describe the data well enough. This approach is widely studied and explored among the tensor mining community. AutoTen  is a powerful method that uses CORCONDIA as a building block to provide unsupervised detection of multi-linear low-rank structure in tensors. Over the last few years, there has been various methods    proposed to find the number of components of fixed dimension tensor data. However, only one method namely Autochrome  estimates rank for irregular data. Unfortunately, this method uses various computation diagnostics that require the conversion of irregular data to regular data. This is expensive in terms of memory utilization. To fill the gap, we propose a effective and efficient method Aptera to estimate the rank of irregular ’PARAFAC2’ data that discover the number of components (interchangeably rank) through higher-order singular values. We observe that the nature of higher-order singular values is like ’L’ shape (See Figure (2)) i.e. singular values start with high values and slowly dies to the end of computations. Also, we observed that the correct number of components falls exactly on the maximum curvature of the L-curve. Hence, we exploit the well known numerical method approach called L-curve corner detection  in our work to estimate the number of components. Our contributions are summarized as follows: An efficient and simple rank estimation method: We introduce Aptera, a scalable and effective algorithm for estimating the number of components of PARAFAC2 decompositions of irregular tensors that admits an efficient parallel implementation. We make our Matlab implementation publicly available on the link111http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~egujr001/ucr/madlab/src/aptera.zip. Extensive Evaluation: We evaluate Aptera on synthetic and multiple real-world data, in order to study the behavior of our method in comparison to other baselines. Technology Transfer: This work provides an efficient way to apply the numeric method idea of L-curve corner to find the rank of PARAFAC2 tensor data, aiming to explore its capabilities and promote it within the data mining community.\n\nReference markers found: [189]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]189: videos, and social networks) and ever-increasing in popularity.
