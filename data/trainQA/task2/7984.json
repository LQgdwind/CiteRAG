      "content": "Paper Title: Static Analysis of Logic Programs via Boolean Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe start with revisiting one well-known result in ASP (see Proposition 4).\nWe provide a new proof for it, which relies on the relation between an LP and a BN. Let P𝑃P be an LP.\nIf dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}) has no cycle, then P𝑃P has exactly one stable model. Let f𝑓f be the encoded BN of P𝑃P.\nSince dg+​(P)⊆dg​(P)superscriptdg𝑃dg𝑃\\text{dg}^{+}({P})\\subseteq\\text{dg}({P}), dg+​(P)superscriptdg𝑃\\text{dg}^{+}({P}) has no cycle, then sm​(P)=supp​(P)sm𝑃supp𝑃\\text{sm}({P})=\\text{supp}({P}) by Theorem 1.\nSince ig​(f)⊆dg​(P)ig𝑓dg𝑃\\text{ig}({f})\\subseteq\\text{dg}({P}), ig​(f)ig𝑓\\text{ig}({f}) has no cycle.\nBy Theorem 1 of [ref]33, f𝑓f has a unique fixed point, thus P𝑃P has a unique stable model.\n∎ Proposition 4 is the consequence of Theorem 2.5(iv) of  and Fages’ theorem.\nTheorem 2.5(iv) of  shows that if dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}) has no cycle, then cf​(P)cf𝑃\\text{cf}({P}) has a unique model, which is also the unique stable model of P𝑃P by Fages’ theorem.\nIndeed, the BN-based proof that we provide here is quite simpler than the above proof.\nWe then present two newly small results considering LPs with very special structures (see Propositions 5 and 6).\nSee Example 2 for illustration. Let P𝑃P be an LP.\nSuppose that dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}) is a positive cycle.\nIf dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}) has a negative arc, then P𝑃P has exactly two stable models.\nOtherwise, P𝑃P has exactly one stable model. Let f𝑓f be the BN encoding of P𝑃P.\nSince dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}) is a positive cycle, the in-degree of each vertex is one, leading to every fvsubscript𝑓𝑣f_{v} is constant-free.\nHence, ig​(f)ig𝑓\\text{ig}({f}) is also a positive cycle.\nBy , f𝑓f has exactly two fixed points.\nIf dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}) has a negative arc, then dg+​(P)superscriptdg𝑃\\text{dg}^{+}({P}) has no cycle.\nIt follows that supp​(P)=sm​(P)supp𝑃sm𝑃\\text{supp}({P})=\\text{sm}({P}) by Theorem 1.\nHence, P𝑃P has exactly two stable models.\nIf dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}) has no negative arc, then P𝑃P is positive.\nHence, it has exactly one stable model.\n∎ In the proof of Proposition 5, if P𝑃P has exactly two stable models (say A𝐴A and B𝐵B), then A∩B=∅𝐴𝐵A\\cap B=\\emptyset and A∪B=atom​(P)𝐴𝐵atom𝑃A\\cup B=\\text{atom}({P}), since A𝐴A and B𝐵B are also the two fixed points of f𝑓f where Av≠Bv,∀v∈varfformulae-sequencesubscript𝐴𝑣subscript𝐵𝑣for-all𝑣subscriptvar𝑓A_{v}\\neq B_{v},\\forall v\\in\\text{var}_{{f}} by .\nOtherwise, the unique stable model of P𝑃P is ∅\\emptyset. Let P𝑃P be an LP.\nSuppose that dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}) is a negative cycle.\nThen P𝑃P has no stable model. Let f𝑓f be the BN encoding of P𝑃P.\nSince dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}) is a negative cycle, the in-degree of each vertex is one, leading to every fvsubscript𝑓𝑣f_{v} is constant-free.\nHence, ig​(f)ig𝑓\\text{ig}({f}) is also a negative cycle.\nBy , f𝑓f has no fixed point.\nIt follows that P𝑃P has no supported model.\nSince a stable model is also a supported model, P𝑃P has no stable model.\n∎ Let P1subscript𝑃1P_{1} be the LP: a←∼b;b←∼c;c←aa\\leftarrow{\\sim}{b};b\\leftarrow{\\sim}{c};c\\leftarrow a.\nLet P2subscript𝑃2P_{2} be the LP: a←b;b←∼c;c←aa\\leftarrow b;b\\leftarrow{\\sim}{c};c\\leftarrow a.\nFigures 2(a) and 2(b) show the DGs of P1subscript𝑃1P_{1} and P2subscript𝑃2P_{2}, respectively.\ndg​(P1)dgsubscript𝑃1\\text{dg}({P_{1}}) is a positive cycle and it has two negative arcs.\nP1subscript𝑃1P_{1} has two stable models (A1={a,c},A2={b}formulae-sequencesubscript𝐴1𝑎𝑐subscript𝐴2𝑏A_{1}=\\{a,c\\},A_{2}=\\{b\\}), which is consistent with Proposition 5.\nWe also see that A1∩A2=∅subscript𝐴1subscript𝐴2A_{1}\\cap A_{2}=\\emptyset and A1∪A2={a,b,c}=atom​(P1)subscript𝐴1subscript𝐴2𝑎𝑏𝑐atomsubscript𝑃1A_{1}\\cup A_{2}=\\{a,b,c\\}=\\text{atom}({P_{1}}).\ndg​(P2)dgsubscript𝑃2\\text{dg}({P_{2}}) is a negative cycle and P2subscript𝑃2P_{2} has no stable model, which is consistent with Proposition 6. Next, we investigate more deeply the effect of positive and negative cycles of the DG of P𝑃P on its stable models.\nRecall that a Positive Feedback Vertex Set (PFVS) of a signed directed graph G𝐺G is a set of vertices intersecting all positive cycles of G𝐺G [ref]33. Let P𝑃P be an LP.\nIf P𝑃P has two distinct stable models (say A1subscript𝐴1A_{1} and A2subscript𝐴2A_{2}), then dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}) has a positive cycle C+superscript𝐶C^{+} such that for every v∈C+𝑣superscript𝐶v\\in C^{+}, either v∈A1𝑣subscript𝐴1v\\in A_{1} or v∈A2𝑣subscript𝐴2v\\in A_{2}. Let f𝑓f be the BN encoding of P𝑃P.\nA1subscript𝐴1A_{1} and A2subscript𝐴2A_{2} are also distinct supported models of P𝑃P.\nBy Theorem 3, A1subscript𝐴1A_{1} and A2subscript𝐴2A_{2} are distinct fixed points of f𝑓f.\nBy Lemma 1111If f𝑓f has two fixed points x𝑥x and y𝑦y, then ig​(f)ig𝑓\\text{ig}({f}) has a positive cycle C+superscript𝐶C^{+} such that xv≠yv,∀v∈C+formulae-sequencesubscript𝑥𝑣subscript𝑦𝑣for-all𝑣superscript𝐶x_{v}\\neq y_{v},\\forall v\\in C^{+}. of [ref]33, ig​(f)ig𝑓\\text{ig}({f}) has a positive cycle C+superscript𝐶C^{+} such that for every v∈C+𝑣superscript𝐶v\\in C^{+}, A1​(v)≠A2​(v)subscript𝐴1𝑣subscript𝐴2𝑣A_{1}(v)\\neq A_{2}(v), i.e., either v∈A1𝑣subscript𝐴1v\\in A_{1} or v∈A2𝑣subscript𝐴2v\\in A_{2} because A1​(v),A2​(v)∈𝔹subscript𝐴1𝑣subscript𝐴2𝑣𝔹A_{1}(v),A_{2}(v)\\in\\mathbb{B}.\nC+superscript𝐶C^{+} is also a positive cycle of dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}) because ig​(f)ig𝑓\\text{ig}({f}) is a subgraph of dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}).\n∎ If a sign directed graph G𝐺G is strongly connected and has no negative cycle or has no positive cycle, then G𝐺G is sign-definite. We first prove that each arc of G𝐺G belongs to a cycle in G𝐺G (*).\nTaken an arbitrary arc (u​v,ϵ)𝑢𝑣italic-ϵ(uv,\\epsilon) in G𝐺G.\nSince G𝐺G is strongly connected, there is a directed path from v𝑣v to u𝑢u.\nBy adding (u​v,ϵ)𝑢𝑣italic-ϵ(uv,\\epsilon) to this path, we obtain a cycle. Assume that G𝐺G is not sign-definite.\nThen there are two arcs: (u​v,⊕)𝑢𝑣direct-sum(uv,\\oplus) and (u​v,⊖)𝑢𝑣symmetric-difference(uv,\\ominus).\nBy (*), (u​v,⊕)𝑢𝑣direct-sum(uv,\\oplus) (resp. (u​v,⊖)𝑢𝑣symmetric-difference(uv,\\ominus)) belongs to a cycle in G𝐺G (say C𝐶C).\nC𝐶C is a positive (resp. negative) cycle because G𝐺G has no negative (resp. positive) cycle.\nThen (C−(u​v,⊕))+(u​v,⊖)𝐶𝑢𝑣direct-sum𝑢𝑣symmetric-difference(C-(uv,\\oplus))+(uv,\\ominus) (resp. (C−(u​v,⊖))+(u​v,⊕)𝐶𝑢𝑣symmetric-difference𝑢𝑣direct-sum(C-(uv,\\ominus))+(uv,\\oplus)) is a negative (resp. positive) cycle in G𝐺G.\nThis implies a contradiction.\nHence, G𝐺G is sign-definite.\n∎ Let P𝑃P be an LP.\nIf dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}) has no positive cycle, then P𝑃P has at most one stable model.\nIn addition, if P𝑃P has no fact and every atom appears in the head of a rule in P𝑃P, then P𝑃P has no stable model. Assume that P𝑃P has at least two stable models.\nThen dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}) has a positive cycle by Lemma 7, which is a contradiction.\nHence, P𝑃P has at most one stable model. Since P𝑃P no fact and every atom appears in the head of a rule in P𝑃P, each vertex of dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}) has at least one input vertex.\nLet G∗superscript𝐺G^{*} be a strongly connected subgraph of dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}) such that there is no arc from a vertex outside G∗superscript𝐺G^{*} to a vertex in G∗superscript𝐺G^{*}.\nSince dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}) has no positive cycle, then G∗superscript𝐺G^{*} also has no positive cycle.\nBy Lemma 8, G∗superscript𝐺G^{*} is sign-definite.\nLet f𝑓f be the BN encoding of P𝑃P.\nSince there is no arc from a vertex outside G∗superscript𝐺G^{*} to a vertex in G∗superscript𝐺G^{*}, there is a BN f∗superscript𝑓f^{*} on the set of variables that are vertices of G∗superscript𝐺G^{*} and fv∗=fv,∀v∈varf∗formulae-sequencesubscriptsuperscript𝑓𝑣subscript𝑓𝑣for-all𝑣subscriptvarsuperscript𝑓f^{*}_{v}=f_{v},\\forall v\\in\\text{var}_{{f^{*}}}. Since each vertex of dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}) has at least one input vertex, each vertex of G∗superscript𝐺G^{*} also has at least one input vertex.\nLet v𝑣v be an arbitrary vertex in G∗superscript𝐺G^{*}.\nSince G∗superscript𝐺G^{*} is sign-definite, the sets of positive and negative input vertices of v𝑣v are disjoint.\nBy assigning 0 to all positive input vertices of v𝑣v in G∗superscript𝐺G^{*} and 1 to all negative input vertices of v𝑣v in G∗superscript𝐺G^{*}, we have fv∗=0subscriptsuperscript𝑓𝑣0f^{*}_{v}=0.\nSymmetrically, assigning 1 to all positive input vertices of v𝑣v in G∗superscript𝐺G^{*} and 0 to all negative input vertices of v𝑣v in G∗superscript𝐺G^{*}, we have fv∗=1subscriptsuperscript𝑓𝑣1f^{*}_{v}=1.\nHence, fv∗subscriptsuperscript𝑓𝑣f^{*}_{v} cannot be constant.\nIt implies that the minimum in-degree of i​g​(f∗)𝑖𝑔superscript𝑓ig(f^{*}) is at least one.\nClearly, i​g​(f∗)𝑖𝑔superscript𝑓ig(f^{*}) is a subgraph of G∗superscript𝐺G^{*}, leading to i​g​(f∗)𝑖𝑔superscript𝑓ig(f^{*}) has no positive cycle.\nThen f∗superscript𝑓f^{*} has no fixed point by Theorem 2222If ig​(f)ig𝑓\\text{ig}({f}) has no positive cycle and its minimum in-degree is at least one, then f𝑓f has no fixed point. of .\nLet γ​(f)𝛾𝑓\\gamma(f) and γ​(f∗)𝛾superscript𝑓\\gamma(f^{*}) be the SAT formulas characterizing fixed points of f𝑓f and f∗superscript𝑓f^{*}, respectively.\nSince f∗superscript𝑓f^{*} has no fixed point, γ​(f∗)𝛾superscript𝑓\\gamma(f^{*}) has no model.\nClearly, γ​(f∗)𝛾superscript𝑓\\gamma(f^{*}) is part of γ​(f)𝛾𝑓\\gamma(f), thus γ​(f)𝛾𝑓\\gamma(f) has no model.\nHence, f𝑓f has no fixed point.\nIt follows that P𝑃P has no supported model.\nSince a stable model is also a supported model, P𝑃P has no stable model.\n∎ Let P𝑃P be an LP.\nFor any PFVS U+superscript𝑈U^{+} of dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}), we have that |sm​(P)|≤2|U+|sm𝑃superscript2superscript𝑈|\\text{sm}({P})|\\leq 2^{|U^{+}|}. Let f𝑓f be the BN encoding of P𝑃P.\nSince U+superscript𝑈U^{+} is a PFVS of dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}), dg​(P)−U+dg𝑃superscript𝑈\\text{dg}({P})-U^{+} has no positive cycle.\nSince ig​(f)⊆dg​(P)ig𝑓dg𝑃\\text{ig}({f})\\subseteq\\text{dg}({P}), ig​(f)−U+ig𝑓superscript𝑈\\text{ig}({f})-U^{+} also has no positive cycle.\nTherefore, U+superscript𝑈U^{+} is a PFVS of ig​(f)ig𝑓\\text{ig}({f}).\nBy Theorem 9 of [ref]4, |fix​(f)|≤2|U+|fix𝑓superscript2superscript𝑈|\\text{fix}({f})|\\leq 2^{|U^{+}|}.\nSince |sm​(P)|≤|fix​(f)|sm𝑃fix𝑓|\\text{sm}({P})|\\leq|\\text{fix}({f})|, we can conclude that |sm​(P)|≤2|U+|sm𝑃superscript2superscript𝑈|\\text{sm}({P})|\\leq 2^{|U^{+}|}.\n∎ Note that Proposition 10 can be directly proved by using Theorem 9.\nThe main idea is that in any stable model of P𝑃P, each atom in U+superscript𝑈U^{+} can be either true or false.\nFor each assignment of atoms in U+superscript𝑈U^{+}, we get a new LP whose DG has no positive cycle, then it has at most one stable model by Theorem 9.\nThere are 2|U+|superscript2superscript𝑈2^{|U^{+}|} possible assignments of atoms in U+superscript𝑈U^{+}, hence we can deduce |sm​(P)|≤2|U+|sm𝑃superscript2superscript𝑈|\\text{sm}({P})|\\leq 2^{|U^{+}|}. It is well-known in the BN field that if ig​(f)ig𝑓\\text{ig}({f}) has no negative cycle, then f𝑓f has at least one fixed point (Theorem 6 of [ref]4).\nNaturally, it is interesting to question whether an LP whose DG has no negative cycle has at least one stable model or not.\nFages showed a counterexample for the case of infinite logic programs 4, but the case of finite logic programs is still open.\nWe answer this question by Theorem 12. To prove Theorem 12, we use the fixpoint semantics of logic programs .\nTo be self-contained, we briefly recall the definition of the least fixpoint of a logic program.\nA quasi-interpretation is a set possibly infinite of rules of the form p←∼p1,…,∼pkp\\leftarrow{\\sim}{p_{1}},\\dots,{\\sim}{p_{k}} where k≥0𝑘0k\\geq 0 and p,p1,…,pk∈atom​(P)𝑝subscript𝑝1…subscript𝑝𝑘atom𝑃p,p_{1},\\dots,p_{k}\\in\\text{atom}({P}).\nLet r𝑟r be the rule p←∼p1,…,∼pk,q1,…,qjp\\leftarrow{\\sim}{p_{1}},\\dots,{\\sim}{p_{k}},q_{1},\\dots,q_{j} and let risubscript𝑟𝑖r_{i} be rules qi←∼qi1,…,∼qiliq_{i}\\leftarrow{\\sim}{q^{1}_{i}},\\dots,{\\sim}{q^{l_{i}}_{i}} where 1≤i≤j1𝑖𝑗1\\leq i\\leq j and li≥0subscript𝑙𝑖0l_{i}\\geq 0.\nThen Tr​({r1,…,rj})subscript𝑇𝑟subscript𝑟1…subscript𝑟𝑗T_{r}(\\{r_{1},\\dots,r_{j}\\}) is the rule p←∼p1,…,∼pk,∼q11,…,∼q1l1,…,∼qj1,…,∼qjlj.p\\leftarrow{\\sim}{p_{1}},\\dots,{\\sim}{p_{k}},{\\sim}{q_{1}^{1}},\\dots,{\\sim}{q_{1}^{l_{1}}},\\dots,{\\sim}{q_{j}^{1}},\\dots,{\\sim}{q_{j}^{l_{j}}}. We now introduce the transformation TPsubscript𝑇𝑃T_{P} on quasi-interpretations: TP​(Q)={Tr​({r1,…,rj})|r∈P,ri∈Q,1≤i≤j}.subscript𝑇𝑃𝑄conditional-setsubscript𝑇𝑟subscript𝑟1…subscript𝑟𝑗formulae-sequence𝑟𝑃formulae-sequencesubscript𝑟𝑖𝑄1𝑖𝑗T_{P}(Q)=\\{T_{r}(\\{r_{1},\\dots,r_{j}\\})|r\\in P,r_{i}\\in Q,1\\leq i\\leq j\\}. Let lfpi=TPi​(∅)=TP​(TP​(…​TP​(∅)))subscriptlfp𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑇𝑃𝑖subscript𝑇𝑃subscript𝑇𝑃…subscript𝑇𝑃\\text{lfp}_{i}=T_{P}^{i}(\\emptyset)=T_{P}(T_{P}(\\dots T_{P}(\\emptyset))), then lfp=⋃i≥1lfpilfpsubscript𝑖1subscriptlfp𝑖\\text{lfp}=\\bigcup_{i\\geq 1}\\text{lfp}_{i} is the least fixpoint of P𝑃P. Let P𝑃P be an LP and P′superscript𝑃′P^{\\prime} be its least fixpoint.\nIf dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}) has no negative cycle, then dg​(P′)dgsuperscript𝑃′\\text{dg}({P^{\\prime}}) has no negative cycle. By Lemma 5.3 of 4, if vertex a𝑎a has a negative path to vertex b𝑏b in dg​(P′)dgsuperscript𝑃′\\text{dg}({P^{\\prime}}), then a𝑎a has also a negative path to b𝑏b in dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}).\nNote that the set of vertices of dg​(P′)dgsuperscript𝑃′\\text{dg}({P^{\\prime}}) is a subset of that of dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}).\nIt follows that if there is a negative cycle in dg​(P′)dgsuperscript𝑃′\\text{dg}({P^{\\prime}}), then there is also a negative cycle in dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}).\nHence, if dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}) has no negative cycle, then dg​(P′)dgsuperscript𝑃′\\text{dg}({P^{\\prime}}) has no negative cycle.\n∎ Let P𝑃P be an LP.\nIf dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}) has no negative cycle, then P𝑃P has at least one stable model. Let P′superscript𝑃′P^{\\prime} be the least fixpoint of P𝑃P.\nBy Lemma 11, dg​(P′)dgsuperscript𝑃′\\text{dg}({P^{\\prime}}) has no negative cycle.\nLet f′superscript𝑓′f^{\\prime} be the encoded BN of P′superscript𝑃′P^{\\prime}.\nSince ig​(f′)⊆dg​(P′)igsuperscript𝑓′dgsuperscript𝑃′\\text{ig}({f^{\\prime}})\\subseteq\\text{dg}({P^{\\prime}}), ig​(f′)igsuperscript𝑓′\\text{ig}({f^{\\prime}}) also has no negative cycle.\nTherefore, f′superscript𝑓′f^{\\prime} has at least one fixed point by Theorem 6 of [ref]4.\nBy Theorem 3, supp​(P′)=fix​(f′)suppsuperscript𝑃′fixsuperscript𝑓′\\text{supp}({P^{\\prime}})=\\text{fix}({f^{\\prime}}).\nIt is known that sm​(P)=supp​(P′)sm𝑃suppsuperscript𝑃′\\text{sm}({P})=\\text{supp}({P^{\\prime}}) (Theorem 4 of ).\nThis implies that sm​(P)=fix​(f′)sm𝑃fixsuperscript𝑓′\\text{sm}({P})=\\text{fix}({f^{\\prime}}).\nHence, P𝑃P has at least one stable model.\n∎ The technique used to prove Theorem 12 suggests a potential way to explore more theoretical results: picking up a structural property of dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}), seeing what it becomes in the DG of the least fixpoint of P𝑃P, and checking how fixed points of the encoded BN of the least fixpoint behave under the new property.\nFor illustration, consider the class of locally stratified LPs.\nP𝑃P is locally stratified if every cycle of dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}) contains no negative arc .\nConsidering this property, we can prove that the DG of the least fixpoint of P𝑃P has no cycle.\nIn this case, the least fixpoint has exactly one stable model, leading to P𝑃P has so.\nSee the detailed proof in Theorem 13.\nThis provides an alternative (maybe simpler) proof for the well-known result stating that a locally stratified LP has a unique stable model (Theorem 6.2.7 of ). Let P𝑃P be an LP.\nIf P𝑃P is locally stratified, then P𝑃P has exactly one stable model. Let P′superscript𝑃′P^{\\prime} be the least fixpoint of P𝑃P.\nRecall that P′=lfp=⋃i≥1lfpisuperscript𝑃′lfpsubscript𝑖1subscriptlfp𝑖P^{\\prime}=\\text{lfp}=\\bigcup_{i\\geq 1}\\text{lfp}_{i}.\nWe show that dg​(lfpi)dgsubscriptlfp𝑖\\text{dg}({\\text{lfp}_{i}}) has no cycle by induction on i𝑖i. The base case is trivial (i.e., i=0𝑖0i=0).\nConsider an arbitrary rule r∈lfpi+1∖lfpi𝑟subscriptlfp𝑖1subscriptlfp𝑖r\\in\\text{lfp}_{i+1}\\setminus\\text{lfp}_{i}.\nLet b=h​(r)𝑏h𝑟b=\\text{h}({r}) and a∈b−​(r)𝑎superscriptb𝑟a\\in\\text{b}^{-}({r}).\nBy definition, there exists a rule r′∈Psuperscript𝑟′𝑃r^{\\prime}\\in P such that h​(r′)=bhsuperscript𝑟′𝑏\\text{h}({r^{\\prime}})=b and a∈b−​(r′′)𝑎superscriptbsuperscript𝑟′′a\\in\\text{b}^{-}({r^{\\prime\\prime}}) with r′′∈lfpisuperscript𝑟′′subscriptlfp𝑖r^{\\prime\\prime}\\in\\text{lfp}_{i} and h​(r′′)∈b+​(r′)hsuperscript𝑟′′superscriptbsuperscript𝑟′\\text{h}({r^{\\prime\\prime}})\\in\\text{b}^{+}({r^{\\prime}}).\nLet c=h​(r′′)𝑐hsuperscript𝑟′′c=\\text{h}({r^{\\prime\\prime}}).\nWe use b≤⊕asubscriptdirect-sum𝑏𝑎b\\leq_{\\oplus}a (resp. b≤⊖asubscriptsymmetric-difference𝑏𝑎b\\leq_{\\ominus}a) to denote that there is a positive (resp. negative) path from b𝑏b to a𝑎a.\nWe have that a≤⊖bsubscriptsymmetric-difference𝑎𝑏a\\leq_{\\ominus}b in dg​(lfpi+1)dgsubscriptlfp𝑖1\\text{dg}({\\text{lfp}_{i+1}}).\nNote that lfpi⊆lfpi+1subscriptlfp𝑖subscriptlfp𝑖1\\text{lfp}_{i}\\subseteq\\text{lfp}_{i+1} by definition.\nIf b≤⊕asubscriptdirect-sum𝑏𝑎b\\leq_{\\oplus}a in dg​(lfpi)dgsubscriptlfp𝑖\\text{dg}({\\text{lfp}_{i}}), then b≤⊖asubscriptsymmetric-difference𝑏𝑎b\\leq_{\\ominus}a in dg​(lfpi+1)dgsubscriptlfp𝑖1\\text{dg}({\\text{lfp}_{i+1}}), leading to b≤⊖bsubscriptsymmetric-difference𝑏𝑏b\\leq_{\\ominus}b in dg​(lfpi+1)dgsubscriptlfp𝑖1\\text{dg}({\\text{lfp}_{i+1}}) (also in dg​(P′)dgsuperscript𝑃′\\text{dg}({P^{\\prime}})), which is a contradiction because dg​(P′)dgsuperscript𝑃′\\text{dg}({P^{\\prime}}) has no negative cycle by Lemma 5.3 of 4.\nIf b≤⊖asubscriptsymmetric-difference𝑏𝑎b\\leq_{\\ominus}a in dg​(lfpi)dgsubscriptlfp𝑖\\text{dg}({\\text{lfp}_{i}}), then b≤⊖asubscriptsymmetric-difference𝑏𝑎b\\leq_{\\ominus}a in dg​(P′)dgsuperscript𝑃′\\text{dg}({P^{\\prime}}), leading to b≤⊖asubscriptsymmetric-difference𝑏𝑎b\\leq_{\\ominus}a in dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}) by Lemma 5.3 of 4.\nSimilarly, a≤⊖csubscriptsymmetric-difference𝑎𝑐a\\leq_{\\ominus}c in dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}), since a≤⊖csubscriptsymmetric-difference𝑎𝑐a\\leq_{\\ominus}c in dg​(lfpi)dgsubscriptlfp𝑖\\text{dg}({\\text{lfp}_{i}}).\nWe use b≤0asubscript0𝑏𝑎b\\leq_{0}a to denote that there is a path of only positive arcs from b𝑏b to a𝑎a.\nWe have c≤0bsubscript0𝑐𝑏c\\leq_{0}b in dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}).\nThen there is a cycle containing b𝑏b and also negative arcs in dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}), which is a contradiction because P𝑃P is locally stratified.\nHence, there is no path from b𝑏b to a𝑎a in dg​(lfpi)dgsubscriptlfp𝑖\\text{dg}({\\text{lfp}_{i}}).\nSince dg​(lfpi)dgsubscriptlfp𝑖\\text{dg}({\\text{lfp}_{i}}) has no cycle by the induction hypothesis and adding the rule r𝑟r to lfpisubscriptlfp𝑖\\text{lfp}_{i} does not introduce new cycles, dg​(lfpi+1)dgsubscriptlfp𝑖1\\text{dg}({\\text{lfp}_{i+1}}) has no cycle. It follows that dg​(P′)dgsuperscript𝑃′\\text{dg}({P^{\\prime}}) has no cycle, then P′superscript𝑃′P^{\\prime} has exactly one stable model by Proposition 4.\nSince sm​(P)=sm​(P′)sm𝑃smsuperscript𝑃′\\text{sm}({P})=\\text{sm}({P^{\\prime}}) by Theorem 4 of , P𝑃P also has exactly one stable model.\n∎ Finally, inspired by Theorem 12, we explore an interesting result shown in Theorem 14, which is actually the generalization of Proposition 5. Let P𝑃P be an LP.\nSuppose that dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}) is strongly connected, has at least one arc, and has no negative cycle.\nIf dg+​(P)superscriptdg𝑃\\text{dg}^{+}({P}) has no cycle, then P𝑃P has two stable models A𝐴A and B𝐵B such that ∀v∈atom​(P)for-all𝑣atom𝑃\\forall v\\in\\text{atom}({P}), either v∈A𝑣𝐴v\\in A or v∈B𝑣𝐵v\\in B.\nIn addition, A𝐴A and B𝐵B can be computed in polynomial time. Let f𝑓f be the BN encoding of P𝑃P.\nSince dg+​(P)superscriptdg𝑃\\text{dg}^{+}({P}) has no cycle, sm​(P)=supp​(P)=fix​(f)sm𝑃supp𝑃fix𝑓\\text{sm}({P})=\\text{supp}({P})=\\text{fix}({f}) by Theorems 1 and 3.\nWe show that f𝑓f has two fixed points that are complementary. Since dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}) is strongly connected and has no negative cycle, it is sign-definite by Lemma 8.\nIt implies that ig​(f)ig𝑓\\text{ig}({f}) is also sign-definite because ig​(f)⊆dg​(P)ig𝑓dg𝑃\\text{ig}({f})\\subseteq\\text{dg}({P}).\ndg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}) has the minimum in-degree of at least one because it is strongly connected and has at least one arc.\nBy using the deduction similar to that in Theorem 9, we have that f𝑓f has no constant function.\nIt is known that when dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}) is strongly connected and has no negative cycle, its set of vertices can be divided into two equivalence classes (say S+superscript𝑆S^{+} and S−superscript𝑆S^{-}) such that any two vertices in S+superscript𝑆S^{+} (resp. S−superscript𝑆S^{-}) are connected by either no arc or a positive arc, and there is either no arc or a negative arc between two vertices in S+superscript𝑆S^{+} and S−superscript𝑆S^{-} (Theorem 1 of ).\nSince ig​(f)⊆dg​(P)ig𝑓dg𝑃\\text{ig}({f})\\subseteq\\text{dg}({P}) and ig​(f)ig𝑓\\text{ig}({f}) has the same set of vertices with dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}), S+superscript𝑆S^{+} and S−superscript𝑆S^{-} are still such two equivalence classes in ig​(f)ig𝑓\\text{ig}({f}). Let x𝑥x be a state defined as: xi=1subscript𝑥𝑖1x_{i}=1 if i∈S+𝑖superscript𝑆i\\in S^{+} and xi=0subscript𝑥𝑖0x_{i}=0 if i∈S−𝑖superscript𝑆i\\in S^{-}.\nConsider a given node j𝑗j.\nIf xj=0subscript𝑥𝑗0x_{j}=0, by the above result, for all i∈atom​(P)𝑖atom𝑃i\\in\\text{atom}({P}) such that ig​(f)ig𝑓\\text{ig}({f}) has a positive arc from i𝑖i to j𝑗j, xi=1subscript𝑥𝑖1x_{i}=1, and for all i∈atom​(P)𝑖atom𝑃i\\in\\text{atom}({P}) such that ig​(f)ig𝑓\\text{ig}({f}) has a negative arc from i𝑖i to j𝑗j, xi=0subscript𝑥𝑖0x_{i}=0.\nSince fjsubscript𝑓𝑗f_{j} cannot be constant, fj​(x)=1subscript𝑓𝑗𝑥1f_{j}(x)=1.\nAnalogously, if xj=1subscript𝑥𝑗1x_{j}=1, then fj​(x)=1subscript𝑓𝑗𝑥1f_{j}(x)=1, implying that x𝑥x is a fixed point of f𝑓f.\nBy using the similar deduction, we can conclude that x¯¯𝑥\\overline{x} is also a fixed point of f𝑓f where x¯i=1−xi,∀i∈varfformulae-sequencesubscript¯𝑥𝑖1subscript𝑥𝑖for-all𝑖subscriptvar𝑓\\overline{x}_{i}=1-x_{i},\\forall i\\in\\text{var}_{{f}}.\nLet A𝐴A and B𝐵B are two models of P𝑃P corresponding to x𝑥x and x¯¯𝑥\\overline{x}.\nClearly, A𝐴A and B𝐵B are stable models of P𝑃P.\nWe have that ∀v∈atom​(P)for-all𝑣atom𝑃\\forall v\\in\\text{atom}({P}), either v∈A𝑣𝐴v\\in A or v∈B𝑣𝐵v\\in B.\nIn addition, since S+superscript𝑆S^{+} and S−superscript𝑆S^{-} can be computed in polynomial time, A𝐴A and B𝐵B can be computed in polynomial time.\n∎ Consider an LP P𝑃P: a←∼b,b←∼a,b←∼c,c←∼ba\\leftarrow{\\sim}{b},b\\leftarrow{\\sim}{a},b\\leftarrow{\\sim}{c},c\\leftarrow{\\sim}{b}.\nThe encoded BN f𝑓f of P𝑃P is: fa=¬b,fb=¬a∨¬c,fc=¬bformulae-sequencesubscript𝑓𝑎𝑏formulae-sequencesubscript𝑓𝑏𝑎𝑐subscript𝑓𝑐𝑏f_{a}=\\neg b,f_{b}=\\neg a\\lor\\neg c,f_{c}=\\neg b.\ndg(P) is strongly connected, has at least one arc, and has no negative cycle.\nSince dg+​(P)superscriptdg𝑃\\text{dg}^{+}({P}) has no cycle, P𝑃P has two stable models.\nActually, P𝑃P has two stable models: A={b}𝐴𝑏A=\\{b\\} and B={a,c}𝐵𝑎𝑐B=\\{a,c\\}.\nWe easily see that A∩B=∅𝐴𝐵A\\cap B=\\emptyset and A∪B=atom​(P)𝐴𝐵atom𝑃A\\cup B=\\text{atom}({P}).\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: cycle, then sm​(P)=supp​(P)sm𝑃supp𝑃\\text{sm}({P})=\\text{supp}({P}) by Theorem 1.\nSince ig​(f)⊆dg​(P)ig𝑓dg𝑃\\text{ig}({f})\\subseteq\\text{dg}({P}), ig​(f)ig𝑓\\text{ig}({f}) has no cycle.\nBy Theorem 1 of [ref]33, f𝑓f has a unique fixed point, thus P𝑃P has a unique stable model.\n∎ Proposition 4 is the consequence of Theorem 2.5(iv) of  and Fages’ theorem.\nTheorem 2.5(iv) of  shows that if\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
