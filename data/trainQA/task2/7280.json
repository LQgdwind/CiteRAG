      "content": "Paper Title: Medical Image Debiasing by Learning Adaptive Agreement from a Biased Council\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere has been an increasing interest in developing debiased models in both the natural image domain and the medical image domain.\nWe here broadly categorize the related works in the following two. Methods using bias labels.\nA broad branch of work uses resampling or reweighting strategies to robustly learn representations for both the majority and the minority groups.\nLi et al.[ref]17 proposed a minimax algorithm to automatically learning resampling weights over the training samples.\nSagawa et al. proposed group distributional robust optimization (G-DRO) to prioritize the learning on worst-performing groups.\nAnother type of studies emphasizes learning invariant representations.\nArjovsky et al.[ref]19 proposed invariant risk minimization (IRM) to enforce learning invariant representations across different environment.\nZhou et al.[ref]21 further impose sparsity regularization into IRM to alleviate the overfitting problem caused by overparameterization.\nSimilarly, contrastive learning  and mutual information minimization  have also been utilized to learn more compact and invariant features across different environments.\nIn this paper, we study more practical situations where the biases are not explicitly labeled.\nWe will also show that our proposed method even achieved comparable results to the approach that used the bias labels. Methods without bias labels.\nLabeling biases could be tedious, and finding biases might rely on post-hoc interpretation of the model .\nEfforts have also been devoted to developing debiased models without explicit bias labels.\nTwo-stage methods often estimate the bias distribution first and then develop debiasing model with the estimated bias information.\nSohoni et al. estimated the bias information via clustering techniques and then debiasing with G-DRO.\nLiu et al. proposed a simple yet effective twice-training strategy that first learns an ERM model and then develops a debiasing model based on the sampling weights given by the ERM model.\nLuo et al. estimated the Bayesian distribution of the biases and target labels, and then adopted bias-balanced learning  for the second-stage debiasing training.\nNevertheless, these methods were highly sensitive to the convergence of the biased model, and wrong bias predictions could introduce much noise into the second stage. One-stage approaches typically develop the biased and debiasing models simultaneously.\nNam et al. proposed a heuristic loss weighting strategy, where a debiased model was learned by comparing its loss with another simultaneously trained biased model.\nBased on this scheme, Lee et al. further introduced feature augmentation by swapping the features between the two networks,\nKim et al. proposed to pre-train the model first, and then use an ensemble of biased models to stabilize the learning of bias information.\nThe debiasing objective is then a cross entropy loss inversely weighted by the number of correct predictions given by the biased models.\nHowever, the heuristic loss functions may over-weigh the samples without spurious correlations and insufficiently utilize the rich information contained in the majority groups.\nOn the contrary, our proposed Ada-ABC could assist in balancing the learning of different samples, thus outperforming other competitive algorithms.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: following two. Methods using bias labels.\nA broad branch of work uses resampling or reweighting strategies to robustly learn representations for both the majority and the minority groups.\nLi et al.[ref]17 proposed a minimax algorithm to automatically learning resampling weights over the training samples.\nSagawa et al. proposed group distributional robust optimization (G-DRO) to prioritize the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
