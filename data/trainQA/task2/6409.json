Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Transformer Training Strategies for Forecasting Multiple Load Time Series\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare our models with models from related work  [ref]20 [ref]21 [ref]22 , as well as with a persistence baseline, linear regression models, multi-layer perceptrons and long short-term memory networks. Models from related work: For Informer , Autoformer [ref]20, FEDformer [ref]21, PatchTST [ref]22 and LTSF-Linear , we take the results reported in the publications where applicable, and run the code published with the papers otherwise.\nAll parameters except for the forecast horizon are left unchanged. Persistence baseline: The persistence baseline takes the value from one week before the predicted hour as a forecast for the 24 hours and 96 hours horizons, and the value from one month before the predicted hour as the 720 hours forecast. Linear regression: For each load time series, we train a linear regression model with hℎh outputs.\nThe input consists of the last 336 load values and the nine time and calendar features for the current hour when the prediction is made (see Approach for a description of the features).\nThe main difference to LTSF-Linear  is that the linear regression models are local models, but LTSF-Linear is a global model.\nFurthermore, the two approaches use different training algorithms and LTSF-Linear does not use time and calendar features. Multi-layer perceptron (MLP): As for the linear regression, we train a local MLP for each load time series.\nThe MLPs get the last 168 load values and the nine time and calendar features of the current hour as input.\nUsing more than 168 load values as input did not improve the results.\nEach MLP has two hidden layers with ReLU activation  and 1024 neurons per layer. Long short-term memory (LSTM): We train multivariate, local and global LSTM  models. We use the same architecture as in , consisting of two LSTM layers with 20 units each and a linear prediction layer. Using larger models did not improve the results.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: We compare our models with models from related work  [ref]20 [ref]21 [ref]22 , as well as with a persistence baseline, linear regression models, multi-layer perceptrons and long short-term memory networks. Models from related work: For Informer ,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
