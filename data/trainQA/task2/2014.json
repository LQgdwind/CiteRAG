      "content": "Paper Title: Continual World: A Robotic Benchmark For Continual Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nChange is ubiquitous. Unsurprisingly, due to evolutionary pressure, humans can quickly adapt and creatively reuse their previous experiences. In contrast, although biologically inspired, deep learning (DL) models excel mostly in static domains that satisfy the i.i.d. assumption, as for example in image processing   [ref]10 [ref]40, language modelling   or biological applications [ref]47. As the systems are scaled up and deployed in open-ended settings, such assumptions are increasingly questionable; imagine, for example, a robot that needs to adapt to the changing environment and the wear-and-tear of its hardware. Continual learning (CL), an area that explicitly focuses on such problems, has been gaining more attention recently. The progress in this area could offer enormous advantages for deep neural networks  and move the community closer to the long-term goal of building intelligent machines . Evaluation of CL methods is challenging. Due to the sequential nature of the problem that disallows parallel computation, evaluation tends to be expensive, which has biased the community to focus on toy tasks. These are mostly in the domain of supervised learning, often relying on MNIST. In this work, we expand on previous discussions on the topic     and introduce a new benchmark, Continual World. The benchmark is built on realistic robotic manipulation tasks from Meta-World , benefiting from its diversity but also being computationally cheap. Moreover, we provide shorter auxiliary sequences, all of which enable a quick research cycle. On the conceptual level, a fundamental difficulty of evaluating CL algorithms comes from the different desiderata for a CL solution. These objectives are often opposing each other, forcing practitioners to explicitly or implicitly make trade-offs in their algorithmic design that are data-dependent. Continual World provides more meaningful relationships between tasks, answering recent calls  to increase attention on forward transfer. Additionally, we provide an extensive evaluation of a spectrum of commonly used CL methods. It highlights that many approaches can deal relatively well with catastrophic forgetting at the expense of other desiderata, in particular forward transfer. This emphasizes our call for focusing on forward transfer and the need for more benchmarks that allow for common structure among the tasks. The main contribution of this work is a CL benchmark that poses optimizing forward transfer as the central goal and shows that existing methods struggle to outperform simple baselines in terms of the forward transfer capability. We release the code111https://github.com/awarelab/continual_world both for the benchmark and 777 CL methods, which aims to provide the community helpful tools to better understand the performance of existing and future solutions. We encourage to visit the website222https://sites.google.com/view/continualworld/home of the project and participate in the Continual World Challenge.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: previous experiences.
