      "content": "Paper Title: Ethical Considerations for Responsible Data Curation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nContemporary human-centric computer vision (HCCV) data curation practices, which prioritize dataset size and utility, have pushed issues related to privacy and bias to the periphery, resulting in dataset retractions and modifications      8, as well as models that are unfair or rely on spurious correlations        . HCCV datasets primarily rely on nonconsensual web scraping 8 0  6   . These datasets not only regard image subjects as free raw material , but also lack the ground-truth metadata required for fairness and robustness evaluations    . This makes it challenging to obtain a comprehensive understanding of model blindspots and cascading harms   across dimensions, such as data subjects, instruments, and environments, which are known to influence performance 2. While, for example, image subject attributes can be inferred [ref]170        7 , this is controversial for social constructs, notably race and gender    . Inference introduces further biases 3     and can induce psychological harm when incorrect  . Recent efforts in machine learning (ML) to address these issues often rely on post hoc reflective processes. Dataset documentation focuses on interrogating and describing datasets after data collection    7 3     . Similarly, initiatives by NeurIPS and ICML ask authors to consider the ethical and societal implications of their research after completion . Further, dataset audits   and bias detection tools   expose dataset management issues and representational biases without offering guidance on responsible data collection. Although there are existing proposals for artificial intelligence (AI) and data design guidelines  9    [ref]35, as well as calls to adopt methodologies from more established fields   , general-purpose guidelines lack domain specificity and task-oriented guidance 7. For example, remedies may prioritize privacy and governance [ref]35 but overlook data composition and image content. Other recommended practices lack persuasive justification for adoption   or fail to provide proper contextualization for appropriate application   3. For instance, the People + AI Guidebook  suggests creating dataset specifications without explaining the rationale, and privacy methodologies are advocated without cognizant of privacy and data protection laws   3. These efforts, which hold significance in promoting responsible practices, would benefit from being supplemented by proactive, domain-specific recommendations aimed at tackling privacy and bias concerns starting from the inception of a dataset. Our research directly addresses these critical concerns by examining purpose (Section 3), consent and privacy (Section 4), and diversity (Section 5). Compared to recent scholarship, we adopt an ante hoc reflective perspective, offering considerations and recommendations for curating HCCV datasets for fairness and robustness evaluations. Our work, therefore, resonates with the call for domain-specific resources to operationalize fairness   5. We draw insights from current practices   [ref]170, guidelines 2  , dataset withdrawals   8, and audits  [ref]35 , to motivate each recommendation, focusing on HCCV evaluation datasets that present unique challenges (e.g., visual leakage of personally identifiable information) and opportunities (e.g., leveraging image metadata for analysis). To guide curators towards more ethical yet resource-intensive curation, we provide a checklist in Appendix A.111The checklist can also be found at: https://github.com/SonyResearch/responsible_data_curation. This translates our considerations and recommendations into pre-curation questions, functioning as a catalyst for discussion and reflection. While several of our recommendations can also be applied retroactively such measures cannot undo incurred harm, e.g., resulting from inappropriate uses, privacy violations, and unfair representation . It is important to make clear that our proposals are not intended for the evaluation of HCCV systems that detect, predict, or label sensitive or objectionable attributes such as race, gender, sexual orientation, or disability.\n\nReference markers found: [170]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]170: cascading harms   across dimensions, such as data subjects, instruments, and environments, which are known to influence performance 2.
