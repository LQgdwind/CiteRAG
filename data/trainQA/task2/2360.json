      "content": "Paper Title: On the Evaluation of Commit Message Generation Models: An Experimental Study\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSeveral metrics commonly used in NLP tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and captioning can be adopted for evaluating commit message generation. These metrics include BLEU , Meteor , Rouge-L [ref]24, Cider , etc. In this study, we focus on BLEU as it is the metric that the related works   [ref]20    use to evaluate the performance of commit message generation models. BLEU score is used to evaluate the correlation between the generated and the reference sentences in NLP tasks. For the commit message generation, the references are the commit messages written by developers and the generated sentences are the outputs from the models. Different BLEU variants are used in prior work and they could produce different scores for the same generated commit message.\nIn the following, we are going to illustrate three different variants of BLEU used before.\nThe names are not intended to be a standard in the literature, but just for easy reference in this study. B-Moses: The evaluation described in    use the same BLEU script from the open-sourced code in  which calculates B-Moses. B-Moses is designed for statistical translation, which does not use a smoothing function. It can be calculated as follows: where wnsubscript𝑤𝑛w_{n} is the weight of n𝑛n-gram precision pnsubscript𝑝𝑛p_{n}, which can be obtained as Equation 3. If not explicitly specified, N𝑁N = 4 and uniform weights wn=1/4subscript𝑤𝑛14w_{n}=1/4. B​P𝐵𝑃BP is brevity penalty which is computed as: where c𝑐c is the length of the candidate generation and r𝑟r is the length of the reference. The n-gram precision pnsubscript𝑝𝑛p_{n} can be obtained as, where mnsubscript𝑚𝑛m_{n} is the number of matched n-grams between the reference and the generation, and lnsubscript𝑙𝑛l_{n} is the total number of n-grams in the generation. B-Norm: B-Norm is a BLEU variant adapted from B-Moses. It is used by Loyola et al. . One difference between B-Norm and B-Moses is that B-Norm converts all characters both in the reference and the generation to lowercase before calculating scores. Therefore, B-Norm is case insensitive. The smoothing method proposed by Lin and Och  is used in B-Norm to smooth the calculation of n-gram precision scores.\nIt adds a constant number (one) to both the numerator and denominator of pnsubscript𝑝𝑛p_{n} for n>1𝑛1n>1. B-CC: Hoang et al. [ref]20 use BLEU measure provided by NLTK  with the smoothing method proposed by Chen and Cherry [ref]32 in their evaluation.\nThis smoothing method [ref]32 is inspired by the assumption that matched counts for similar values of n𝑛n should be similar. The average value of the n−1𝑛1n-1 , n𝑛n and n+1𝑛1n+1 –gram matched counts is used as n𝑛n-gram matched count. m0′superscriptsubscript𝑚0′m_{0}^{\\prime} is defined as m1+1subscript𝑚11m_{1}+1. Therefore, mn′superscriptsubscript𝑚𝑛′m_{n}^{\\prime} for n>0𝑛0n>0 is defined as: mn′=(mn−1′+mn+mn+1)/3superscriptsubscript𝑚𝑛′superscriptsubscript𝑚𝑛1′subscript𝑚𝑛subscript𝑚𝑛13m_{n}^{\\prime}=(m_{n-1}^{\\prime}+m_{n}+m_{n+1})/{3}.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: commonly used in NLP tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and captioning can be adopted for evaluating commit message generation. These metrics include BLEU , Meteor , Rouge-L [ref]24, Cider , etc. In this study, we focus on BLEU as it is the metric that the related works   [ref]20    use to evaluate the performance of commit message generation models. BLEU score is used\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
