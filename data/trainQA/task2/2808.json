Parameters xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} and yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i} denote the position of node i𝑖i on the x𝑥x and y𝑦y axes, respectively.\nThe aim is then to infer the pdf corresponding to the k𝑘k-th state, which can be written as where the superscript 1:k:1𝑘1\\mathrel{\\mathop{\\mathchar 58\\relax}}k indicates the collection of measurements from the first round until the k𝑘k-th. Applying Bayes rule, we can rewrite (10) as Figure 5 depicts the temporal evolution of 𝝃iksuperscriptsubscript𝝃𝑖𝑘\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{i}^{k} as well as its relation with the measurements at each time step. Such a structure is referred to as dynamic Bayesian Network (BN), in which a basic BN repeats itself in each time step . The states of a dynamic BN, i.e., all the variables with the same time index, satisfy the Markov property111It postulates that the state of the system at time t𝑡t depends only on its immediate past, i.e. its state at time t−1.𝑡1t-1. , enabling us to carry out the following mathematical simplifications. In particular,\nknowing that the measurements are independent and assuming the Markov property, we reformulate the integrands in (11) as where p​(𝝃i0)𝑝superscriptsubscript𝝃𝑖0p(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{i}^{0}) denotes the prior knowledge on 𝝃i.subscript𝝃𝑖\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{i}. Plugging (12) into (11) leads to Finally, we can write The term p​(𝝃ik|{𝐜i​j1:k−1,φi​j1:k−1,ζi​j1:k−1}∀j∈ℐi)𝑝conditionalsuperscriptsubscript𝝃𝑖𝑘subscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝐜𝑖𝑗:1𝑘1superscriptsubscript𝜑𝑖𝑗:1𝑘1superscriptsubscript𝜁𝑖𝑗:1𝑘1for-all𝑗subscriptℐ𝑖p(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{i}^{k}|\\{\\mathbf{c}_{ij}^{1\\mathrel{\\mathop{\\mathchar 58\\relax}}k-1},\\varphi_{ij}^{1\\mathrel{\\mathop{\\mathchar 58\\relax}}k-1},\\zeta_{ij}^{1\\mathrel{\\mathop{\\mathchar 58\\relax}}k-1}\\}_{\\forall j\\in\\mathcal{I}_{i}}) is referred to as prediction step while the term p​(𝐜i​jk,φi​jk,ζi​jk|𝝃ik)𝑝superscriptsubscript𝐜𝑖𝑗𝑘superscriptsubscript𝜑𝑖𝑗𝑘conditionalsuperscriptsubscript𝜁𝑖𝑗𝑘superscriptsubscript𝝃𝑖𝑘p(\\mathbf{c}_{ij}^{k},\\varphi_{ij}^{k},\\zeta_{ij}^{k}|\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{i}^{k}) is considered as correction step . If the Gaussian assumption about 𝝃i0superscriptsubscript𝝃𝑖0\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{i}^{0} held and the relation between all the states in Figure 5 were linear, we could conclude that the marginal in (14) would also be Gaussian distributed. Unfortunately, that is not the case in the joint sync&loc problem as the measurement equations (and consequently the correction steps) are partially non-linear. In concrete terms, the aforementioned problem stems from the nonlinear relation between the location parameters (xi,yi)subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖(x_{i},y_{i}) and the time-stamps in (7), (8), (9) on one hand, and the measured AoA in (3) on the other hand. There are several approaches to tackle the nonlinearity problem and, consequently, to estimate the non-Gaussian posterior distribution. In , it is proposed to undertake the Taylor expansion of the nonlinear terms around the prediction point, while [ref]8   have employed EKF to address the non-linearity. In addition to being prone to divergence, which is hard to mitigate analytically, all of these methods require initialization and even then are only able to deliver medium accuracy. In what follows, we discuss the details of a novel joint sync&loc approach based on PGM filters.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: problem and, consequently, to estimate the non-Gaussian posterior distribution.
