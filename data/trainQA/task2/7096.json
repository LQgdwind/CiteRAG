Three prior works have also been proposed for\nsystolic array architectures for exploiting FIP\n  . However, none of the prior works on FIP architectures are focused on application\nto\nmachine learning, which uses a certain range of matrix sizes and data\nrepresentations, making it deserving of a stand-alone study. For all prior works\nrelated to ML acceleration which cite FIP , upon closer inspection,\nit becomes evident that the work either does not evaluate FIP, or\nthe context of the citation is, in fact, referring to\nWinograd’s more-popular minimal filtering algorithms for convolutional neural\nnetworks  [ref]3 rather than Winograd’s inner-product algorithm\n, on which our work is based. Furthermore, the work from\nBravo et al.  reports no clear improvements from their FIP\nimplementation, and all three other prior works on FIP architectures\n   are purely design\nproposals and do not provide empirical insight into its trade-offs. The benefits of FIP in hardware rely on the premise that the hardware footprint\nof adders are cheaper than that of multipliers.\nSince the arithmetic complexity of\nfixed-point multipliers scales quadratically with the input bitwidth compared to\nlinearly for adders, this premise has been shown to hold true for fixed-point\ndata types   .\nHowever, the exact benefits in performance/resources/clock\nfrequency when applying FIP to ML acceleration are still not immediately clear,\nand\nfinding this out requires a comparison of architecture implementations that use\nmultipliers/accumulators of the specific data sizes/types commonly used in\nmachine learning accelerators.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: evident that the work either does not evaluate FIP, or\nthe context of the citation is, in fact, referring to\nWinograd’s more-popular minimal filtering algorithms for convolutional neural\nnetworks  [ref]3 rather than Winograd’s inner-product algorithm\n, on which our work is based.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
