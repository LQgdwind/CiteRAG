Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

The first five algorithms search convolution or pooling operations in CNNs instead of meta-structures in GNNs. We ignore these differences and focus on the algorithms.\nIn contrast to DARTS, P-DARTS, and PC-DARTS, our search algorithms do not jointly optimize all the architecture parameters, which reduces the inconsistency between the search phase and the evaluation phase. Compared to ProxylessNAS, SPOS, and DiffMG, our search algorithms update each message-passing step with a higher probability,\navoiding unfairness caused by insufficient training. Regarding the derivation strategy, our approaches are distinct from all the above methods. The most related NAS method to PCMM is P-DARTS [ref]35, which is employed in the computer vision field. It reduces the search space by splitting the search process into three stages and explicitly removing a part of less important connections at the end of the first two stages. The main drawback is that candidate connections discarded early may be powerful at the end of the search, which means useful connections may be dropped too early.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: [b]\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nSearch\nDerivation\n\nCoupling\nProbability\n\nDARTS \n✓\nhigh\nsingle path\n\nP-DARTS [ref]35\n✓\nhigh\nsingle path\n\nPC-DARTS [ref]36\n✓\nhigh\nsingle path\n\nProxylessNAS [ref]36\n✗\nlow\nsingle path\n\nSPOS \n✗\nlow\nsingle path\n\nDiffMG \n✗\nlow\nsingle path\n\nPMMM\n✗\nmiddle\nmultiple\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
