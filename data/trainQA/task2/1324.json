      "content": "Paper Title: A Comprehensive Study of Deep Video Action Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSelf-supervised learning has attracted more attention recently as it is able to leverage a large amount of unlabeled data by designing a pretext task to obtain free supervisory signals from data itself. It first emerged in image representation learning. On images, the first stream of papers aimed at designing pretext tasks for completing missing information, such as image coloring [ref]262 and image reordering  [ref]61 . The second stream of papers uses instance discrimination  as the pretext task and contrastive losses  [ref]151 for supervision. They learn visual representation by modeling visual similarity of object instances without class labels     . Self-supervised learning is also viable for videos. Compared with images, videos has another axis, temporal dimension, which we can use to craft pretext tasks. Information completion tasks for this purpose include predicting the correct order of shuffled frames   and video clips . Jing et al.  focus on the spatial dimension only by predicting the rotation angles of rotated video clips. Combining temporal and spatial information, several tasks have been introduced to solve a space-time cubic puzzle, anticipate future frames , forecast long-term motions  and predict motion and appearance statistics . RSPNet  and visual tempo  exploit the relative speed between video clips as a supervision signal. The added temporal axis can also provide flexibility in designing instance discrimination pretexts  7. Inspired by the decoupling of 3D convolution to spatial and temporal separable convolutions , Zhang et al.  proposed to decouple the video representation learning into two sub-tasks: spatial contrast and temporal contrast. Recently, Han et al.  proposed memory augmented dense predictive coding for self-supervised video representation learning. They split each video into several blocks and the embedding of future block is predicted by the combination of condensed representations in memory. The temporal continuity in videos inspires researchers to design other pretext tasks around correspondence. Wang et al.  proposed to learn representation by performing cycle-consistency tracking.\nSpecifically, they track the same object backward and then forward in the consecutive video frames, and use the inconsistency between the start and end points as the loss function. TCC  is a concurrent paper. Instead of tracking local objects,  used cycle-consistency to perform frame-wise temporal alignment as a supervision signal.\n was a follow-up work of , and utilized both object-level and pixel-level correspondence across video frames.\nRecently, long-range temporal correspondence is modelled as a random walk graph to help learning video representation in . We compare video self-supervised representation learning methods at the bottom section of Table 6.\nA clear trend can be observed that recent papers have achieved much better linear evaluation accuracy and fine-tuning accuracy comparable to supervised pre-training.\nThis shows that self-supervised learning could be a promising direction towards learning better video representations.\n\nReference markers found: [262]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]262: from data itself.
