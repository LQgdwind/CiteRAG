      "content": "Paper Title: Mastering Atari Games with Limited Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAtari 100k Atari 100k was first proposed by the SimPLe  method, and is now used by many sample-efficient RL works, such as Srinivas et al. , Laskin et al. , Kostrikov et al. , Schwarzer et al. . The benchmark contains 26 Atari games, and the diverse set of games can effectively measure the performance of different algorithms. The benchmark allows the agent to interact with 100 thousand environment steps, i.e. 400 thousand frames due to a frameskip of 4, with each environment. 100k steps roughly correspond to 2 hours of real-time gameplay, which is far less than the usual RL settings. For example, DQN  uses 200 million frames, which is around 925 hours of real-time gameplay. Note that the human player’s performance is tested after allowing the human to get familiar with the game after 2 hours as well.\nWe report the raw performance on each game, as well as the mean and median of the human normalized score. The human normalized score is defined as: (scoreagent−scorerandom)/(scorehuman−scorerandom)subscriptscoreagentsubscriptscorerandomsubscriptscorehumansubscriptscorerandom(\\text{score}_{\\text{agent}}-\\text{score}_{\\text{random}})/(\\text{score}_{\\text{human}}-\\text{score}_{\\text{random}}). We compare our method to the following baselines.\n(1) SimPLe , a model-based RL algorithm that learns an action conditional video prediction model and trains PPO within the learned environment. (2) OTRainbow , which tunes the hyper-parameters of the Rainbow [ref]18 method to achieve higher sample efficiency. (3) CURL , which uses contrastive learning as a side task to improve the image representation quality. (4) DrQ , which adds data augmentations to the input images while learning the original RL objective. (5) SPR , the previous SoTA in Atari 100k which proposes to augment the Rainbow [ref]18 agent with data augmentations as well as a multi-step consistency loss using BYOL-style self-supervision. (6) MuZero [ref]32\nwith our implementations and the same hyper-parameters as EfficientZero.\n(7) Random Agent (8) Human performance. DeepMind Control 100k Tassa et al.  propose the DMControl suite, which includes some challenging visual robotics tasks with continuous action space.\nAnd some works [ref]14  have benchmarked for the sample efficiency on the DMControl 100k which contains 100k environment steps data. Since the MCTS-based methods cannot deal with tasks with continuous action space, we discretize each dimension into 5 discrete slots in MuZero [ref]32 and EfficientZero. To avoid the dimension explosion, we evaluate EfficientZero in three low-dimensional tasks. We compare our method to the following baselines.\n(1) Pixel SAC, which applies SAC directly to pixels. (2) SAC-AE , which combines the SAC and an auto-encoder to handle image-based inputs. (3) State SAC, which applies SAC directly to ground truth low dimensional states rather than the pixels. (4) Dreamer [ref]14, which learns a world model and is trained in dreamed scenarios. (5) CURL , the previous SoTA in DMControl 100k. (6) MuZero [ref]32 with action discretizations.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: , a model-based RL algorithm that learns an action conditional video prediction model and trains PPO within the learned environment.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
