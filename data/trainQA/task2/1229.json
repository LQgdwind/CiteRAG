      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Attention Network: Accelerate Attention by Searching Where to Plug\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS). Designing a satisfactory neural architecture automatically, also known as neural architecture search, is of significant interest for academics and industrial AI research. Such a problem may always be formulated as searching for the optimal combination of different network granularities. The early NAS works require expensive computational cost for scratch-training a massive number of architecture candidates  . To alleviate the searching cost, the recent advances of one-shot approaches for NAS bring up the concept of supernet based on the weight-sharing heuristic. Supernet serves as the search space embodiment of the candidate architectures, and it is trained by optimizing different sub-networks from the sampling paths, e.g., SPOS , GreedyNAS  and FairNAS . The most conceptually related work [ref]19 aims to propose a lightweight non-local (LightNL) block [ref]30 and searches for the optimal configuration to incorporate the non-local block into mobile neural networks. Although the inserted location of the LightNL is also considered in their NAS objective, the construction of the LightNL blocks is also jointly optimized in their objective. As both the inserted location and the construction of LightNL are integrated completely after the searching, it is hard to differentiate the net contribution of their proposed inserted location of LightNL blocks. However, in our work, we tailor to identify the importance of where to plug in the attention module, and we do not concentrate on only one design of the existing attention modules, compared to Li et al. [ref]19 that only specializes on non-local block [ref]30. To sum up, the difference in the research target and more general consideration differentiate our work with Li et al. [ref]19. Self-Attention Mechanism. The self-attention mechanism is widely used in CNNs for computer vision  [ref]30   [ref]18 . The self-attention module is modularized as a network component and inserted into different layers of the network to emphasize informative features and their importance according to the internal information. Many works focus on the design of the attention module for specific functionality. Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) module  leverages global average pooling to extract the channel-wise statistics and learns the non-mutually-exclusive relationship between channels. Spatial Group-wise Enhance (SGE) module [ref]18 learns to recalibrate features by saliency factors learned from different groups of the feature maps. Dense-Implicit-Attention (DIA) module  captures the layer-wise feature interrelation with a recurrent neural network (RNN).\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: embodiment of the candidate architectures, and it is trained by optimizing different sub-networks from the sampling paths, e.g., SPOS , GreedyNAS  and FairNAS .
