      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Occupancy Function from Point Clouds for Surface Reconstruction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this experiment, we evaluate our occupancy learning approach with the task of reconstructing shapes from unoriented point clouds. We take a subset of ShapeNet [ref]1 (as the same of 3D-R2N2  and Occupancy-Network [ref]4) and preprocess each mesh to make it watertight with the code provided by . We refer to it as ShapeNet-13 hereafter, as it consists of 13 classes of shapes. Our training/validation/testing split is the same as [ref]4. All of the meshes are rescale and shifted into a unit cube centered at the origin of coordinate system. 2048 points are randomly sampled from each mesh surface for data augmentation. Each input point cloud P𝑃P contains 300 points randomly taken from these 2048 points, and Gaussian noise is applied to each point. For generating query points (cf. Sec. III-A), we add random offsets to on-surface points to make them off-surface. In practice, we draw 6144 points with δ=0.02𝛿0.02\\delta=0.02 normal distribution to capture details of shape and draw 2048 points with δ=0.1𝛿0.1\\delta=0.1 that reflecting the overall shape contour. The architecture of our network is inspired by the segmentation model in . As shown in Figure 4, the input point cloud is feed through a cascade of shrinking and enlarging streams. At each convolution block of the shrinking stream, we decrease the size of point cloud (with point max-pooling ) and double the depth of features. The opposite is done in the enlarging stream, with point deconvolution . The skipping feed-forward features from the shrinking stream are concatenated to the outputs of corresponding deconvolution layers. These size hyper-parameters are summarized as below: where in each block, excepting the first one, is interpreted as (#feature, #output points), and the first one as (#input points, #feature, #output points) After training, our network is used as a frontend, and we use Octree hierarchical sampling and Marching Cube to produce triangle meshes from each point cloud. We compare our approach against other reconstruction or shape generation methods, including Ball-Pivoting 0, Poisson method , 3D-R2N2 , DMC , and ONet [ref]4. The reconstruction quality is evaluated in Intersection-over-Union (IoU), average L1 Chamfer distance (Chamfer-L1), and Normal Consistency score, defined as below: Intersection-over-Union: Quotient of output mesh and ground truth mesh’s intersection’s volume and their union’s, i.e., vol​(A∩B)/vol​(A∪B)vol𝐴𝐵vol𝐴𝐵\\mathrm{vol}\\left(A\\cap B\\right)/\\mathrm{vol}\\left(A\\cup B\\right). L1 Chamfer distance: Sum of an accuracy measurement, mean distance from points on the output mesh to ground-truth, and a completeness measurement, the mean distance from ground-truth mesh to output.

Normal consistency score: Normal consistency score consists of two terms, normal accuracy and normal completeness. They are the mean absolute dot product of the surface normals on output mesh and the surface normals at the corresponding nearest points on the ground-truth mesh, and the opposite. Formally, ∑x∈A,y=argminy∈B​‖x−y‖N​(x)⋅N​(y)+∑y∈B,x=argminx∈A​‖x−y‖N​(x)⋅N​(y)subscriptformulae-sequence𝑥𝐴𝑦subscriptargmin𝑦𝐵norm𝑥𝑦⋅𝑁𝑥𝑁𝑦subscriptformulae-sequence𝑦𝐵𝑥subscriptargmin𝑥𝐴norm𝑥𝑦⋅𝑁𝑥𝑁𝑦\\sum_{x\\in A,y=\\mathrm{argmin}_{y\\in B}\\left\\|x-y\\right\\|}N(x)\\cdot N(y)+\\sum_{y\\in B,x=\\mathrm{argmin}_{x\\in A}\\left\\|x-y\\right\\|}N(x)\\cdot N(y). We report the reconstruction performance in Table I. We find that our method outperforms all other methods on IoU and Chamfer-L1 metrics by a large gap but only is marginally better than ONet/DMC on normal consistency score. For visual inspection and evaluation, we plot the output meshes of different methods and visualizing surface error in Figure 5. The error is color-coded, where the reconstructed surface out of ground-truth is colored in red, and underneath is colored in blue. The dataset contains 13 different classes of objects. Those class names and per-class statistics of the performance are shown in Table II.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: In this experiment, we evaluate our occupancy learning approach with the task of reconstructing shapes from unoriented point clouds.
