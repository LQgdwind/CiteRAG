      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Few-Shot Learning through Multi-task Representation Learning Theory\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMeta-learning algorithms considered below learn an optimal representation sequentially via the so-called episodic training strategy introduced by [ref]51, instead of jointly minimizing the training error on a set of source tasks as done in MTR. Episodic training mimics the training process at the task scale with each task data being decomposed into a training set (support set S𝑆S) and a testing set (query set Q𝑄Q). Recently,  showed that the episodic training setup used in meta-learning leads to a generalization bounds of O​(1T)𝑂1𝑇O(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T}}). This bound is independent of the task sample size n1subscript𝑛1n_{1}, which could explain the success of this training strategy for FSC in the asymptotic limit.\nHowever, unlike the results obtained by  studied in this paper, the lack of dependence on n1subscript𝑛1n_{1} makes such a result uninsightful in practice as we are in a finite-sample size setting. This bound does not give information on other parameters to leverage when the task number cannot increase.\nWe now present two major families of meta-learning approaches below. Metric-based methods. These methods learn an embedding space in which feature vectors can be compared using a similarity function (usually a L2subscript𝐿2L_{2} distance or cosine similarity)  [ref]51 [ref]47  [ref]1  . They typically use a form of contrastive loss as their objective function, similarly to Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA)  or Triplet Loss . In this paper, we focus our analysis on the popular Prototypical Networks [ref]47 (ProtoNet) that computes prototypes as the mean vector of support points belonging to the same class:\n𝐜i=1|Si|​∑𝐬∈Siϕ​(𝐬),subscript𝐜𝑖1subscript𝑆𝑖subscript𝐬subscript𝑆𝑖italic-ϕ𝐬{\\mathbf{c}}_{i}=\\frac{1}{|S_{i}|}\\sum_{{\\mathbf{s}}\\in S_{i}}\\phi({\\mathbf{s}}),\nwith Sisubscript𝑆𝑖S_{i} the subset of support points belonging to class i𝑖i.\nProtoNet minimizes the negative log-probability of the true class i𝑖i computed as the softmax over distances to prototypes 𝐜isubscript𝐜𝑖{\\mathbf{c}}_{i}: with d𝑑d being a distance function used to measure similarity between points in the embedding space. Gradient-based methods. These methods learn through end-to-end or two-step optimization          where given a new task, the goal is to learn a model from the task’s training data specifically adapted for this task.\nMaml  updates its parameters θ𝜃\\theta using an end-to-end optimization process to find the best initialization such that a new task can be learned quickly, i.e. with few examples. More formally, given the loss ℓtsubscriptℓ𝑡\\ell_{t} for each task t∈[[T]]𝑡delimited-[]delimited-[]𝑇t\\in[[T]], Maml minimizes the expected task loss after an inner loop or adaptation phase, computed by a few steps of gradient descent initialized at the model’s current parameters: with η𝜂\\eta the distribution of the meta-training tasks and α𝛼\\alpha the learning rate for the adaptation phase. For simplicity, we take a single step of gradient update in this equation. In what follows, we establish our theoretical analysis for the popular methods ProtoNet and Maml. We add their improved variations respectively called Infinite Mixture Prototypes [ref]1 (IMP) and Meta-Curvature  (MC) in the experiments to validate our findings.\n\nReference markers found: [51]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]51: Meta-learning algorithms considered below learn an optimal representation sequentially via the so-called episodic training strategy introduced by [ref]51, instead of jointly minimizing the training error on a set of source tasks as done in MTR.
