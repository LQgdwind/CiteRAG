We identify any 𝒮⊆{1,…,m}𝒮1…𝑚{\\mathcal{S}}\\subseteq\\{1,\\ldots,m\\} with its\ncorresponding bit-vector 𝐬=(s1,…,sm)𝐬subscript𝑠1…subscript𝑠𝑚\\mathbf{s}=(s_{1},\\ldots,s_{m}) where\nsi=1⇔i∈𝒮⇔subscript𝑠𝑖1𝑖𝒮s_{i}=1\\Leftrightarrow{i}\\in{\\mathcal{S}}. Given\nvectors 𝐱,𝐯,𝐬𝐱𝐯𝐬\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{v},\\mathbf{s}, we can construct the vector\n𝐱𝐬,𝐯superscript𝐱𝐬𝐯\\mathbf{x}^{\\mathbf{s},\\mathbf{v}} (in which 𝐬𝐬\\mathbf{s} is a selector between\nthe two vectors 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} and 𝐯𝐯\\mathbf{v}) such that To find an AXp, i.e. a subset-minimal weak AXp, 1\nis used. Input: Classifier κ𝜅\\kappa, instance 𝐯𝐯\\mathbf{v}\n     \nOutput: AXp 𝒮𝒮{\\mathcal{S}} (1 is a general greedy algorithm that is well-known\nand used in a wide range of settings, e.g. minimal unsatisfiable core\nextraction in CSPs  ; to the best of\nour knowledge, its use in finding AXps (and also CXps) of KC languages\nis novel. An alternative would be to use the QuickXplain\nalgorithm .) Considering 𝐬𝐬\\mathbf{s} and 𝐯𝐯\\mathbf{v} as constants, when c=1𝑐1c=1,\nκ​(𝐱𝐬,𝐯)𝜅superscript𝐱𝐬𝐯\\kappa(\\mathbf{x}^{\\mathbf{s},\\mathbf{v}}) is valid iff S𝑆S is a weak AXp of\nκ​(𝐯)=c𝜅𝐯𝑐\\kappa(\\mathbf{v})=c.\nFurthermore, when c=0𝑐0c=0, κ​(𝐱𝐬,𝐯)𝜅superscript𝐱𝐬𝐯\\kappa(\\mathbf{x}^{\\mathbf{s},\\mathbf{v}}) is\ninconsistent iff S𝑆S is a weak AXp of κ​(𝐯)=c𝜅𝐯𝑐\\kappa(\\mathbf{v})=c. We\ntherefore have the following proposition. For a classifier implemented with some KC language L, finding\none AXp is polynomial-time provided the following three operations\ncan be performed in polynomial time: construction of κ​(𝐱𝐬,𝐯)𝜅superscript𝐱𝐬𝐯\\kappa(\\mathbf{x}^{\\mathbf{s},\\mathbf{v}}) from\nκ𝜅\\kappa, 𝐬𝐬\\mathbf{s} and 𝐯𝐯\\mathbf{v}. testing validity of κ​(𝐱𝐬,𝐯)𝜅superscript𝐱𝐬𝐯\\kappa(\\mathbf{x}^{\\mathbf{s},\\mathbf{v}}). testing consistency of κ​(𝐱𝐬,𝐯)𝜅superscript𝐱𝐬𝐯\\kappa(\\mathbf{x}^{\\mathbf{s},\\mathbf{v}}). Finding one AXp of a decision taken by a d-DNNF is polynomial-time. It is sufficient to show that\nd-DNNF’s satisfy the conditions of Proposition 3.1.\nIt is well known that testing consistency and validity d-DNNF’s can be achieved in polynomial time .\nTo transform a d-DNNF calculating κ​(𝐯)𝜅𝐯\\kappa(\\mathbf{v}) into a d-DNNF calculating κ​(𝐱𝐬,𝐯)𝜅superscript𝐱𝐬𝐯\\kappa(\\mathbf{x}^{\\mathbf{s},\\mathbf{v}}),\nwe need to replace each leaf labelled xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} by a leaf labelled (xi∧si¯)∨(vi∧si)subscript𝑥𝑖¯subscript𝑠𝑖subscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝑠𝑖(x_{i}\\land\\overline{s_{i}})\\lor(v_{i}\\land s_{i})\nand each leaf labelled xi¯¯subscript𝑥𝑖\\overline{x_{i}} by a leaf labelled\n(xi¯∧si¯)∨(vi¯∧si)¯subscript𝑥𝑖¯subscript𝑠𝑖¯subscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝑠𝑖(\\overline{x_{i}}\\land\\overline{s_{i}})\\lor(\\overline{v_{i}}\\land s_{i}).\nNote that 𝐬𝐬\\mathbf{s} and 𝐯𝐯\\mathbf{v} are constants during this construction. Thus, we simplify\nthese formulas to obtain either a literal or a constant according to the different cases: si=0subscript𝑠𝑖0s_{i}=0:  label (xi∧si¯)∨(vi∧si)subscript𝑥𝑖¯subscript𝑠𝑖subscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝑠𝑖(x_{i}\\land\\overline{s_{i}})\\lor(v_{i}\\land s_{i}) is xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} and\nlabel (xi¯∧si¯)∨(vi¯∧si)¯subscript𝑥𝑖¯subscript𝑠𝑖¯subscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝑠𝑖(\\overline{x_{i}}\\land\\overline{s_{i}})\\lor(\\overline{v_{i}}\\land s_{i}) is xi¯¯subscript𝑥𝑖\\overline{x_{i}}.\nIn other words, the label of the leaf node is unchanged. si=1subscript𝑠𝑖1s_{i}=1:   label (xi∧si¯)∨(vi∧si)subscript𝑥𝑖¯subscript𝑠𝑖subscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝑠𝑖(x_{i}\\land\\overline{s_{i}})\\lor(v_{i}\\land s_{i}) is the (constant) value of visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} and\nlabel (xi¯∧si¯)∨(vi¯∧si)¯subscript𝑥𝑖¯subscript𝑠𝑖¯subscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝑠𝑖(\\overline{x_{i}}\\land\\overline{s_{i}})\\lor(\\overline{v_{i}}\\land s_{i}) is the (constant) value of vi¯¯subscript𝑣𝑖\\overline{v_{i}}. Indeed, this is just conditioning (CD, i.e. fixing a subset of\nthe variables xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i}, given by the set S𝑆S, to visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i}) and it is well\nknown that CD is a polytime operation on d-DNNFs . Finding one AXp of a decision taken by a classifier is\npolynomial-time if the classifier is given in one of the following\nlanguages:\ncd-PDAG 6,\nSDD ,\nOBDD ,\nPI , IP ,\nrenH-C [ref]20, AFF [ref]20,\ndFSD [ref]43, and EADT . It suffices to show that the languages listed above satisfy the conditions\nof Proposition 3.1. According to\n, the queries CO and VA together with the\ntransformation CD can all be performed in polynomial time for any of\nthe languages listed above. This is exactly what we need to satisfy\nthe three conditions of Proposition 3.1. The operation of the algorithm is illustrated for the d-DNNF\nfrom 2.4. By applying (3), the d-DNNF\nof Figure 2 is obtained.\nThe execution of the algorithm is summarized in\nTable 1.\nBy inspection, we can observe that the value computed by the d-DNNF\nwill be 0 as long as s4=1subscript𝑠41s_{4}=1, i.e. as long as 444 is part of the\nweak AXp. If removed from the weak AXp, one can find an assignment\nto 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x}, which sets κ​(𝐱𝐬,𝐯)=1𝜅superscript𝐱𝐬𝐯1\\kappa(\\mathbf{x}^{\\mathbf{s},\\mathbf{v}})=1.\nThe computed AXp is 𝒮={4}𝒮4{\\mathcal{S}}=\\{4\\}.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: operation on d-DNNFs .
