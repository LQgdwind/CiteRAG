      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Low-Resolution Face Recognition via Bridge Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlthough face recognition techniques become nearly mature for several real-world applications, they still have difficulties in handling low-resolution faces and being deployed on low-end devices [ref]1. These demands are very important for tasks like video surveillance and automatic driving. In general, most well-known face recognition models  [ref]3 [ref]4   are trained from massive high-resolution faces by using sophisticated architectures that contain huge parameters, making them uneconomical to deploy. Moreover, these models may be not suitable to directly apply on low-resolution scenarios due to the different distribution between high-resolution training faces (sometimes from private datasets) and low-resolution ones. An important reason is that the high-resolution facial details will be missing during the degeneration of the resolution, which the existing models largely depend on. An alternative way is to train a new model on massive low-resolution faces in target scenarios (e.g., surveillance faces in the wild). However, collecting and labeling such faces is very time and labor consuming. Moreover, directly training on low-resolution faces usually suffer from unsatisfactory accuracy , since the reduction of image resolutions may lose some valuable knowledge which can be provided from some pretrained models . Therefore, it is necessary to fully exploit the knowledge from massive high-resolution faces and pretrained models for facilitating low-resolution face recognition.\nTo recognize low-resolution faces, some feasible ideas based on hallucination or embedding are proposed to exploit high-resolution knowledge. The “hallucination” idea is based on the fact that a person who is familiar with a high-resolution face can recognize the low-resolution counterpart. Several existing approaches propose to hallucinate the high-resolution faces before recognition by explicitly reconstructing details, such as e.g., with super-resolution    . Among them, the mapping between high-resolution to low-resolution faces is modeled by some carefully designed parametric functions (e.g. nonlinear Lagrangian , SVD  and sparse representation ). During inference, parametric coefficients that best fit the given low-resolution faces are computed and adopted to recover the missing details to make recognition easier. These approaches generally can achieve good recognition accuracy, while the additional reconstruction often brings in computational burden and slows down the recognition speed. Different from the hallucination-based approaches, the “embedding” idea applies an implicit scheme to directly project low-resolution faces into an embedding space that mimics high-resolution behaviors. In this way, only the high-resolution features are encoded into the model without explicit reconstruction. For example, Biswas et al. embedded low-resolution facial images into an Euclidean space, in which image distances well approximate the dissimilarities among high-resolution images. Ren et al. projected face images of different resolutions into a unified space for coupled matching. A shared characteristic of such embedding models is to encode informative high-resolution details into low-resolution features via cross-resolution analysis. They are generally model-specific and not designed to mimic an existing high-resolution model whose pre-learned knowledge is not fully adopted. However, the pre-learned knowledge often contains rich high-resolution details and can guide low-resolution face recognition if being properly adapted and transferred. Knowledge distillation is an efficient way to transfer knowledge via the teacher-student framework     0 1. In the framework, the teacher is usually a strong yet complex model that performs well on its private dataset, while a much simpler student is learned to mimic the teacher’s behavior, leading to maximal performance preservation and speed improvement. The key of knowledge distillation is the trade-off between speed and performance, and such a technique provides an opportunity to convert many complex models into simple ones for practical deployment. However, most of existing distillation approaches assume that teacher and student training are restricted on the same dataset or the same resolution, which is not suitable in many real scenarios where a well-pretrained teacher on an existing dataset would like to be reused to supervise model training on a new dataset. In [ref]1, Ge et al.proposed a selective knowledge distillation approach to transfer the most informative knowledge from pre-trained high-resolution teacher to a lightweight low-resolution student by solving a sparse graph problem, which actually performed cross-resolution distillation so that the accuracy of low-resolution face recognition can be improved. However, the selected knowledge may not be optimal in adapting on the training faces. In summary, transferring the knowledge from high-resolution to low-resolution models is helpful and can avoid the computationally-intensive reconstruction. Thus, a learning framework to help recognize low-resolution faces should be able to effectively transfer informative high-resolution knowledge in a principle manner. That is to say, It need to actually solve two subproblems: what knowledge should be transferred from the high-resolution models and how to perform such transfer. In this way, the challenges in low-resolution face recognition and knowledge distillation are simultaneously addressed with a single framework. Inspired by that, as shown in Fig. 1, we propose a novel bridge distillation approach that can convert existing high-resolution models pretrained on their private datasets into a much simpler one for low-resolution face recognition on target dataset. In our approach, public high-resolution faces and their resolution-degraded versions are used as a bridge to compress a complex high-resolution teacher model to a much simpler low-resolution student model via two step distillation. The first cross-dataset distillation adapts the pretrained knowledge from private to public high-resolution faces. It learns a feature mapping that preserves both the discriminative capability on public high-resolution faces as well as the detailed face patterns encoded in the original private knowledge. Then, the second resolution-adapted distillation learns a student model in a multi-task fashion to jointly mimic the adapted high-resolution knowledge and recognize the public low-resolution faces, which are synthesized to simulate the probable distribution of the target low-resolution faces. In this way, the student model only needs to be aware of the high-resolution details that are still discriminative on low-resolution faces regardless of the others, resulting into compact knowledge transfer. The contributions are summarized as follows: 1) we propose a bridge distillation framework that is able to convert high-resolution face models to much simpler low-resolution ones with greatly reduced computational and memory cost as well as minimal performance drop; 2) we propose cross-dataset distillation, which adapts the pre-learned knowledge from private to public high-resolution faces that preserves the compact and discriminative high-resolution details; 3) comprehensive experiments are conducted and show that the student models achieve comparable accuracy with the state-of-the-art high-resolution face models, but with extremely low memory cost and fast inference speed.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Although face recognition techniques become nearly mature for several real-world applications, they still have difficulties in handling low-resolution faces and being deployed on low-end devices [ref]1.
