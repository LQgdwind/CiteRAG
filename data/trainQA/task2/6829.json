      "content": "Paper Title: A probabilistic analysis of selected notions of iterated conditioning under coherence\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe study of conditionals (typically expressed by “if–then” sentences), compound conditionals (which are obtained by combining conditionals\nwith the logical operators such as “and”, “or”, “not”), and iterated conditionals (where both antecedent and consequent are conditionals)\nis a relevant research topic in many fields, such as philosophy of science, psychology of uncertain reasoning, probability theory, and conditional logics. See for example,\n  [ref]9 5 7 8   2         . Compound and iterated conditionals are largely used in natural language to make decisions and inferences based on incomplete or uncertain information. Thus, how to interpret and combine conditionals so to represent\nhuman rational reasoning realistically\nis a key question in the AI community. Recently there has been a growing interest in using conditionals in the field of AI and of knowledge representation.\nSee 0    5   . Among the several tools for managing conditional uncertainty, subjective probability allows to evaluate uncertainty on a conditional by means of a conditional probability assessment, interpreted as a degree of belief.\nIn the subjective theory, the probability P​(E)𝑃𝐸P(E), that an individual in a given state of uncertain knowledge attributes to an event E𝐸E, is a measure of its degree of belief in the occurrence of E𝐸E.\nIn order to operationally assess consistent probabilities, de Finetti proposed a coherence principle based on a suitable betting scheme\n(9)\n.\nIn this framework, probability is assessed only to the involved events and coherence amounts to the avoidance of “Dutch Book”. All the classical properties of a finitely additive probability follow from the coherence principle.\nThis approach is therefore more flexible because it is not\nnecessary to give probability values to each event of a given Boolean algebra.\nThe subjective theory has been extended to conditionals by means of conditional probability assessments. In this framework, given two events A𝐴A and B𝐵B, the conditional if A𝐴A then B𝐵B is represented not by the material conditional event not-A𝐴A or B𝐵B, but rather by a conditional event designated as B|Aconditional𝐵𝐴B|A. This is a three-valued object which can be assessed as “true”, “false”, or “void” (). In this formulation, the probability of the conditional if A𝐴A then B𝐵B is interpreted by the\nconditional probability P​(B|A)𝑃conditional𝐵𝐴P(B|A). Subjective conditional probability is primitive, it does not require an unconditional probability assessment and hence it can be properly defined even if the conditioning event has probability zero (see Remark 1).\nIn particular an (unconditional) event B𝐵B coincides with the conditional event B|Ωconditional𝐵ΩB|\\Omega and hence P​(B)=P​(B|Ω)𝑃𝐵𝑃conditional𝐵ΩP(B)=P(B|\\Omega). Trivalent logics have usually been used to combine conditionals, as found in   6   .\nConjoined and disjoined conditionals are interpreted in these logics as three-valued objects. However, such interpretations lead to the invalidity of some basic logical properties. Then, some basic probabilistic properties are not preserved when logical operations among conditionals belong to a trivalent logic ( 9). In this paper we will study different definitions of iterated conditioning by showing that similar problems arise both when iterated conditionals are represented as three-valued objects and when they depend on conjoined conditionals defined in trivalent logics.\nAs a consequence, human-like reasoning about conditionals under uncertainty cannot properly be formalized in such terms. A different approach to compound and iterated conditionals has been followed in  and in 2, relevant to the definition of conjunction.\nA related study has been developed in the setting of coherence in the recent papers 4 5 7 9. In this approach, conjoined, disjoined, and iterated conditionals are defined not as three-valued objects, but rather\nas suitable conditional random quantities having possibly more than three values in the unit interval  01 .\nA betting interpretation governs these objects in a coherent-setting.\nAn attractive advantage of this approach is that all the basic algebraic and probabilistic properties are preserved. These include De Morgan’s Laws and Fréchet-Hoeffding bounds. For a synthesis see 9. A way to build a Boolean algebra of conditionals satisfying suitable properties has been introduced in .\nIn this context,\nthe atomic structure\ndefines the compound conditionals at a formal algebraic level.\nA general theory of compound conditionals in the framework of conditional random quantities can be framed in such a structure .\nThen based on a particular extension of a full conditional probability to this Boolean structure (),\nsome probabilistic properties of compound conditionals\ncoincide with results obtained under coherence in the framework of conditional random quantities (7). Conjunctions and disjunctions among conditionals have been introduced and studied quite commonly in three-valued logics (  6      2 3 ). In particular, de Finetti in 1935 () also proposed a three-valued logic for conditional events by introducing suitably defined notions of conjunction and disjunction. These coincide with features of Kleen-Lukasiewicz-Heyting logic 3 (see also ).\nFurther, Calabrese () and Cooper (6) introduced an algebra of conditionals by using the notions of quasi conjunction and quasi disjunction, similarly studied by Adams ().\nIn his trivalent logic de Finetti introduced an operation of iterated conditioning called “subordination” and denoted here by |d​F|_{dF}. This respects the requirement that, among other properties, the Import-Export principle (2) is satisfied 26).\nFarrell also\nintroduced an operation of iterated conditioning (denoted here by |F|_{F}) in his trivalent logic (), which uses the\nsame notions of conjunction and disjunction as de Finetti. This also satisfies the Import-Export principle.\nCooper and Calabrese also introduced an operation of iterated conditioning (denoted here by |C|_{C}) in their trivalent logic, which satisfies the Import-Export principle as well. We should recall that the validity of such a principle, jointly with the requirement of preserving classical probabilistic properties,\nleads\nto the well-known Lewis’ triviality results 1.\nHowever, the notion of iterated conditioning studied in the framework of conditional random quantities under coherence avoids the Lewis’ triviality results because the Import-Export Principle is not satisfied, even satisfying basic probabilistic properties (see 4  ).\nThis operation of iterated conditioning, denoted here by |g​s|_{gs}, is based on the notion of the conjunction of two conditionals defined as a conditional random quantity (∧g​ssubscript𝑔𝑠\\wedge_{gs}) by means of the following structure () □|○=□∧○+ℙ(□|○)○¯\\Box|\\bigcirc=\\Box\\wedge\\bigcirc+\\mathbb{P}(\\Box|\\bigcirc)\\widebar{\\bigcirc}, where ℙℙ\\mathbb{P} is the symbol of prevision, □□\\Box and ○○\\bigcirc are (indicators of) conditional events, and □∧○\\Box\\wedge\\bigcirc is a conditional random quantity with value in  01 .\nIn the framework of subjective probability, the prevision μ=ℙ​(□|○)𝜇ℙconditional□○\\mu=\\mathbb{P}(\\Box|\\bigcirc)\nrepresents the amount that you agree to pay, knowing that you will receive the random quantity □∧○+ℙ(□|○)○¯\\Box\\wedge\\bigcirc+\\mathbb{P}(\\Box|\\bigcirc)\\widebar{\\bigcirc}.\nMoreover,\nby the linearity property of a coherent prevision and by observing that ○¯=1−○\\widebar{\\bigcirc}=1-\\bigcirc, from the previous structure it follows that ℙ(□|○)=ℙ(□∧○)+ℙ(□|○)[1−ℙ(○)]\\mathbb{P}(\\Box|\\bigcirc)=\\mathbb{P}(\\Box\\wedge\\bigcirc)+\\mathbb{P}(\\Box|\\bigcirc)[1-\\mathbb{P}(\\bigcirc)], that is ℙ(□∧○)=ℙ(□|○)ℙ(○)\\mathbb{P}(\\Box\\wedge\\bigcirc)=\\mathbb{P}(\\Box|\\bigcirc)\\mathbb{P}(\\bigcirc). This last equation\nis a generalized version of the compound probability theorem, whose standard version is P​(A∧B)=P​(B|A)​P​(A)𝑃𝐴𝐵𝑃conditional𝐵𝐴𝑃𝐴P(A\\wedge B)=P(B|A)P(A). Indeed,\nwhen □□\\Box and ○○\\bigcirc are two events A𝐴A and B𝐵B,\nin a conditional bet on B|Aconditional𝐵𝐴B|A,\nthe structure above allows\nto numerically interpret the indicator of the conditional event B|Aconditional𝐵𝐴B|A as the random win A∧B+P​(B|A)​A¯𝐴𝐵𝑃conditional𝐵𝐴¯𝐴A\\wedge B+P(B|A)\\widebar{A}, which takes value 1, or 0, or P​(B|A)𝑃conditional𝐵𝐴P(B|A), according to whether A​B𝐴𝐵AB is true, or A​B¯𝐴¯𝐵A\\widebar{B} is true, or A¯¯𝐴\\widebar{A} is true (0  see also 4).\nThen, when □□\\Box denotes B|Kconditional𝐵𝐾B|K, ○○\\bigcirc denotes A|Hconditional𝐴𝐻A|H (and hence ○¯¯○\\widebar{\\bigcirc} denotes A|H¯=A¯|H¯conditional𝐴𝐻conditional¯𝐴𝐻\\widebar{A|H}=\\widebar{A}|H), and □∧○\\Box\\wedge\\bigcirc is the conjunction (B|K)∧g​s(A|H)subscript𝑔𝑠conditional𝐵𝐾conditional𝐴𝐻(B|K)\\wedge_{gs}(A|H), the iterated conditional (B|K)|g​s​(A|H)evaluated-atconditional𝐵𝐾𝑔𝑠conditional𝐴𝐻(B|K)|_{gs}(A|H) is defined as (B|K)∧g​s(A|H)+μ​(A¯|H)subscript𝑔𝑠conditional𝐵𝐾conditional𝐴𝐻𝜇conditional¯𝐴𝐻(B|K)\\wedge_{gs}(A|H)+\\mu\\,(\\widebar{A}|H), where μ=ℙ​[(B|K)|g​s​(A|H)]𝜇ℙdelimited-[]evaluated-atconditional𝐵𝐾𝑔𝑠conditional𝐴𝐻\\mu=\\mathbb{P}[(B|K)|_{gs}(A|H)]. In addition, □□\\Box and ○○\\bigcirc can be also replaced by conjoined conditionals and hence the previous structure allows to introduce a more general notion of iterated conditional □|○conditional□○\\Box|\\bigcirc as done in 8.\nThe purpose of this paper is to investigate some of the basic properties valid for events and conditional events with a view to different operations of iterated conditioning. Indeed,\nthings get more problematic when we replace events with conditional events and we move to the properties of iterated conditionals.\nWe recall four selected notions of conjunction in trivalent logics: Kleene-Lukasiewicz-Heyting-de Finetti (∧Ksubscript𝐾\\wedge_{K}), Lukasiewicz (∧Lsubscript𝐿\\wedge_{L}), Bochvar-Kleene (∧Bsubscript𝐵\\wedge_{B}), and Sobocinski or quasi conjunction (∧Ssubscript𝑆\\wedge_{S}). After recalling some logical and probabilistic results in the trivalent logics, we study basic properties for the notions of iterated conditioning introduced by Calabrese (|C|_{C}), by de Finetti (|d​F|_{dF}), and by Farrell (|F)(|_{F}), respectively. For each of them we also compute some sets of coherent assessments on families of conditional events involving iterated conditionals.\nThis study is based on a geometrical approach for coherence checking of conditional probability assessments, which allows zero probability for conditioning events (0).\nThen, we observe that none of this operations of iterated conditioning preserves the compound probability theorem. By exploiting the structure □|○=□∧○+ℙ(□|○)○¯\\Box|\\bigcirc=\\Box\\wedge\\bigcirc+\\mathbb{P}(\\Box|\\bigcirc)\\widebar{\\bigcirc}, for each\nconjunction among the four selected\ntrivalent logics we introduce, in the framework of conditional random quantity, a suitable notion of iterated conditioning (|K|_{K},|L|_{L}, |B|_{B} and |S|_{S}).\nWe observe that all of them satisfy the compound prevision theorem, we check the validity of some other basic properties, the Import-Export principle and two generalized versions of the Bayes’ Rule for iterated conditioning.\nFinally, we remark that, among the selected iterated conditionals, |g​s|_{gs} is the only one which\nsatisfies all the basic properties.\n This paper is a revised and expanded version of the conference paper\n1. We reorganized the structure of the conference paper and we added proofs and new results.\nIn particular, we expanded Section 2 by also adding two new examples.\nWe included the proofs\nin Section 3 and in Section 4.\nWe added several new results in Section 6 (theorems 12–18).\nWe also added Section 5 and\nSection 7. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2\nwe recall some basic notions and results which concern coherence, conditional random quantities, trivalent logics and logical operations among conditional events. We also give two examples on the geometrical interpretation of coherence. We end the section by recalling some\nlogical and probabilistic properties satisfied by events and conditional events and we generalize them to compound and iterated conditionals.\nThen, we check the validity of those selected properties\nfor the iterated conditioning defined by Cooper-Calabrese (|C|_{C}, Section 3), by de Finetti\n(|d​F|_{dF}, Section 4) and by Farrell (|F|_{F}, Section 5). In order to check some probabilistic properties, we also compute sets of coherent assessments on suitable families of conditional events.\nIn Section 6, we recall some results on |g​s|_{gs} and we introduce and study\nthe iterated conditioning |K,|L,|B|_{K},|_{L},|_{B}, and |S|_{S} in the framework of conditional random quantities under coherence. We also consider the validity of two generalized versions of Bayes’ Rule.\nIn Section 7, for selected operations of iterated conditioning we check the p-validity of two generalized inference rules: Modus Ponens and two-premise centering. We also consider two examples of natural language.\nFinally, in Section 8 we illustrate a brief summary on the validity of the basic properties, we give some conclusions and an outlook to future work.\nTo improve the readability of the paper we put some proofs in A.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: are conditionals)\nis a relevant research topic in many fields, such as philosophy of science, psychology of uncertain reasoning, probability theory, and conditional logics.
