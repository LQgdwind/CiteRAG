      "content": "Paper Title: On the Effectiveness of Hybrid Pooling in Mixup-Based Graph Learning for Language Processing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince texts, as well as source code, can be represented as graph-structured data [ref]1 , graph neural network (GNN)-based graph learning has been increasingly applied for both natural language processing (NLP) , and programming language (PL) understanding  . The application of GNNs has achieved remarkable results, e.g., Allamanis et al.  utilize GNNs to learn the syntax tree and data flow representations of source code, by which they manage to accomplish several software engineering tasks, such as code completion and defect detection. Typically, high-quality training data, including features and their corresponding labels, are necessary to train GNN models with competitive performance. However, preparing the labeled data is often not easy, especially in the context of source code labeling that requires advanced expertise . To alleviate the data labeling issue, data augmentation has been proposed to enhance training data by modifying original data.\nAs the state-of-the-art in data augmentation,\nMixup  achieves impressive results in different tasks. Take image classification for an example: Mixup\nsynthesizes new images and labels as additional training data by first selecting two raw images at random from the original training data and then linearly mixing their features and labels. Recent research  [ref]10 demonstrates that Manifold-Mixup, the specialized application of Mixup on graph-structured data [ref]10, can also achieve great performance for graph-structured data. With the success of Manifold-Mixup, utilizing Mixup-based data augmentation in graph learning has emerged as a mainstream paradigm. As indicated by existing studies [ref]10 , Mixup-based graph learning is mainly influenced by two factors, namely, 1) the hyperparameters in Mixup itself, such as the Mixup ratio that balances the proportion of the source data, and 2) the Mixup strategies that are associated with representation generation. Over these factors, the hyperparameter issue is a common one across several different Mixup-applied fields, and has been extensively studied in the fields such as image classification  . However, the second issue about Mixup strategies is highly correlated to the context in which Mixup is applied, and for graph-structured data, the influence of such an issue has not been well studied. In the context of Mixup-based graph learning,\nas shown in Figure 1,\nManifold-Mixup is fed with the inputs from the graph pooling layer,\nwhich use graph pooling operators (e.g., Max-pooling) to produce coarsened representations of the given graph while preserve its semantic information.\nNamely, this layer is the key to representation generation of Manifold-Mixup, in that Manifold-Mixup generate augmented training data by interpolating these representations. Therefore, the performance of Manifold-Mixup can be highly affected by the graph pooling operators.\nRecent works  [ref]15  have attempted to systematically analyze the importance of graph pooling in representation generation; however, the following question, namely, how different graph pooling operators affect the effectiveness of Mixup-based graph learning, still remains open. In this paper, we tackle this problem by empirically analyzing the difference when Mixup is applied in different graph representations generated by different graph pooling operators. Specifically, we focus on two types of graph pooling methods, namely, standard pooling methods and a unifying formulation of hybrid (mixture) pooling operators. For the standard pooling, the Max-pooling, which is the most widely used one [ref]15, and the state-of-the-art graph multiset transformer pooling (GMT)  are considered. For the hybrid pooling, we extend the prior work   and design 9 types of hybrid pooling strategies, and more details are introduced in Table 1. Here, GMT and hybrid pooling operators are considered more advanced strategies. We conduct empirical experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of graph learning using Manifold-Mixup , under different hybrid pooling operators. In total, our experiments cover diverse types of datasets, including two programming languages (JAVA and Python) and one natural language (English), and consider different tasks, two widely-studied graph-level classification tasks (program classification and Fake news detection), and six GNN model architectures. Based on that, we answer the following research questions: RQ1: How effective are hybrid pooling operators for enhancing the accuracy of Mixup-based graph learning?\nThe results on NLP datasets (Gossipcop and Politifact used for fake news detection) show that the hybrid pooling operator Type 1 (ℳs​u​m​(𝒫a​t​t,𝒫m​a​x)subscriptℳ𝑠𝑢𝑚subscript𝒫𝑎𝑡𝑡subscript𝒫𝑚𝑎𝑥\\mathcal{M}_{sum}(\\mathcal{P}_{att},\\mathcal{P}_{max})) outperforms GMT by up to 4.38% accuracy. On PL datasets (JAVA250 and Python800 used for problem classification), also the hybrid pooling operator Type 1 (ℳs​u​m​(𝒫a​t​t,𝒫m​a​x)subscriptℳ𝑠𝑢𝑚subscript𝒫𝑎𝑡𝑡subscript𝒫𝑚𝑎𝑥\\mathcal{M}_{sum}(\\mathcal{P}_{att},\\mathcal{P}_{max})) surpasses GMT by up to 2.36% accuracy. RQ2: How effective are hybrid pooling operators for enhancing the robustness of Mixup-based graph learning?\nThe results demonstrate that in terms of robustness, the hybrid pooling operator Type 6 (ℳc​o​n​c​a​t​(𝒫a​t​t,𝒫s​u​m)subscriptℳ𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑎𝑡subscript𝒫𝑎𝑡𝑡subscript𝒫𝑠𝑢𝑚\\mathcal{M}_{concat}(\\mathcal{P}_{att},\\mathcal{P}_{sum})) surpasses GMT by up to 23.23% in fake news detection, while the hybrid pooling operator Type 1 (ℳs​u​m​(𝒫a​t​t,𝒫m​a​x)subscriptℳ𝑠𝑢𝑚subscript𝒫𝑎𝑡𝑡subscript𝒫𝑚𝑎𝑥\\mathcal{M}_{sum}(\\mathcal{P}_{att},\\mathcal{P}_{max})) outperforms GMT by up to 10.23% in program classification. RQ3: How does the hyperparameter setting affect the effectiveness of Manifold-Mixup when hybrid pooling operators are applied? According to , the hyperparameter λ𝜆\\lambda denotes the interpolation ratio, and it is sampled from a Beta distribution with a shape parameter α​(λ∼Beta​(α,α))𝛼similar-to𝜆Beta𝛼𝛼\\alpha\\left(\\lambda\\sim\\textit{Beta}\\left(\\alpha,\\alpha\\right)\\right). Existing works [ref]10  show that the hyperparameter setting λ𝜆\\lambda affects the performance of Mixup. Therefore, we study the effectiveness of Manifold-Mixup when using hybrid pooling operators under different hyperparameters of Mixup. Experimental results indicate that a smaller value of the hyperparameter leads to better robustness and accuracy. In summary, the contributions of this paper are as follows: This is the first work that explores the potential influence of graph pooling operators on Mixup-based graph-structured data augmentation. To facilitate reproducibility, our code and data are available online. We discuss and further extend the hybrid pooling operators from existing works. The comprehensive empirical analysis demonstrates that hybrid pooling is a better way for Mixup-based graph-structured data augmentation.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Since texts, as well as source code, can be represented as graph-structured data [ref]1 , graph neural network (GNN)-based graph learning has been increasingly applied for both natural language processing (NLP) , and programming language (PL) understanding  .
