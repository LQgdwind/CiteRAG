      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey of Advances in Optimization Methods for Wireless Communication System Design\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSparse optimization and CS have found broad applications in wireless communication systems . In this subsection, we showcase the important role of sparse optimization and CS approaches in formulating and analyzing three optimization problems—sparse channel estimation , localized statistical channel modeling , and device activity detection in mMTC . Sparse channel estimation. Consider a wireless system where the channel in the time domain can be modeled as an n𝑛n-tapped channel impulse response 𝐡=[h1,h2,…,hn]𝖳𝐡superscriptsubscriptℎ1subscriptℎ2…subscriptℎ𝑛𝖳{\\bf h}=\\left[h_{1},h_{2},\\ldots,h_{n}\\right]^{\\mathsf{T}}. The number of nonzero taps in 𝐡𝐡{\\bf h} is small due to the limited number of scattering clusters, i.e., ‖𝐡‖0≪nmuch-less-thansubscriptnorm𝐡0𝑛\\|{\\bf h}\\|_{0}\\ll n. For orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with multiple carriers in 4G and 5G, the pilot symbol 𝐩=[p1,p2,…,pm]𝖳𝐩superscriptsubscript𝑝1subscript𝑝2…subscript𝑝𝑚𝖳{\\bf p}=\\left[p_{1},p_{2},\\ldots,p_{m}\\right]^{\\mathsf{T}} is allocated in the frequency domain for channel estimation. When the BS transmits pilot symbol 𝐩𝐩\\bf p, the user can measure the received signal 𝐲=[y1,y2,…,ym]𝖳𝐲superscriptsubscript𝑦1subscript𝑦2…subscript𝑦𝑚𝖳{\\bf y}=\\left[y_{1},y_{2},\\ldots,y_{m}\\right]^{\\mathsf{T}} as  Here, 𝚽𝚽\\bm{\\Phi} represents the n×n𝑛𝑛n\\times n discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix, which serves to convert the delay-domain channel 𝐡𝐡\\bf h to the frequency domain; 𝐁𝐁{\\bf B} is the m×n𝑚𝑛m\\times n row selection matrix that specifies the location of pilots in the frequency domain; and 𝐳𝐳\\bf z denotes the additive Gaussian noise.\nBy using the received signal 𝐲𝐲\\bf y in (31), one can formulate the channel estimation problem similar to (29) or (30) and apply the aforementioned algorithms for solving the corresponding formulations.\n\n A key advantage of employing sparse channel estimation lies in its ability to substantially reduce the training overhead. The size m𝑚m of the received signal 𝐲𝐲\\mathbf{y} indicates the amount of communication resources required for transmitting the pilot symbol. Traditional channel estimation schemes such as LS or LMMSE estimation require that m𝑚m is larger than the channel length n𝑛n to reliably estimate the channel. Since 𝐡𝐡\\bf h is sparse (i.e., ‖𝐡‖0≪nmuch-less-thansubscriptnorm𝐡0𝑛\\|{\\bf h}\\|_{0}\\ll n), it is sufficient to have a value of m𝑚m that is much smaller than n𝑛n for recovering 𝐡𝐡\\mathbf{h}. In addition to (31), it is noteworthy that a similar sparse channel estimation technique can be developed for the downlink MIMO channels. In particular, for massive MIMO or millimeter-wave systems, the wireless channels usually exhibit significant sparsity in the angular domain. As a result, the training signal length for downlink MIMO channel estimation can be effectively reduced by utilizing the sparsity in both the angular and delay domains\n  . Localized Statistical Channel Modeling.\nExisting channel models for general scenarios are not well-suited for wireless network optimization since, in network optimization, one requires a localized channel model that captures the specific multi-path topography and statistical properties of the targeted communication environment . One grand challenge of localized statistical channel modeling (LSCM) is to leverage the beam-wise reference signal received power (RSRP) measurements to estimate the angular power spectrum (APS) of the channel between the BS and the user. To develop such a method, let us assume that the BS is equipped with a uniform rectangular array (URA) possessing NT=N1×N2subscript𝑁𝑇subscript𝑁1subscript𝑁2N_{T}=N_{1}\\times N_{2} antennas, and the user has only a single antenna. The downlink channel between the (x,y)𝑥𝑦(x,y)-th antenna and the user is denoted as hx,y​(t),x=0,1,…,N1−1,y=0,1,…,N2−1formulae-sequencesubscriptℎ𝑥𝑦𝑡𝑥01…subscript𝑁11𝑦01…subscript𝑁21h_{x,y}(t),x=0,1,\\ldots,N_{1}-1,y=0,1,\\ldots,N_{2}-1.\nIn 5G networks, synchronization signals block (SSB) beams and channel state information-reference signal (CSI-RS) beams are regularly transmitted to the user. The measured RSRP of the m𝑚m-th beam at the t𝑡t-th time slot is given by  where Wx,y(m)=ej​ϕx,y(m)superscriptsubscript𝑊𝑥𝑦𝑚superscript𝑒𝑗superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑥𝑦𝑚W_{x,y}^{(m)}=e^{j\\phi_{x,y}^{(m)}} is the (x,y)𝑥𝑦(x,y)-th entry of the precoding matrix 𝑾(m)∈ℂNx×Nysuperscript𝑾𝑚superscriptℂsubscript𝑁𝑥subscript𝑁𝑦\\bm{W}^{(m)}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{N_{x}\\times N_{y}} for the m​-th𝑚-thm\\text{-th} beam, ϕx,y(m)superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑥𝑦𝑚\\phi_{x,y}^{(m)} is the weight of DFT matrix, and P𝑃P represents the transmit power. Suppose that there are M𝑀M directional beams in total. The expected beam-wise RSRP measurements 𝐫𝐬𝐫𝐩∈ℝM×1𝐫𝐬𝐫𝐩superscriptℝ𝑀1{\\bf rsrp}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{M\\times 1} is where RSRPm≜𝔼​[r​s​r​pm​(t)]≜subscriptRSRP𝑚𝔼delimited-[]𝑟𝑠𝑟subscript𝑝𝑚𝑡{\\rm{RSRP}}_{m}\\triangleq\\mathbb{E}\\left[{rsrp}_{m}(t)\\right].\nAs demonstrated in , the beam-wise average RSRP measurements and the channel APS have the linear relationship where 𝐀∈ℝM×N𝐀superscriptℝ𝑀𝑁{\\bf A}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{M\\times N} is a sensing matrix depending on the beam waveform and antenna gains, and 𝐱∈ℝN𝐱superscriptℝ𝑁{\\bf x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N} is the channel APS to be estimated. Here, the free space is discretized by N𝑁N equally spaced directions, and N𝑁N is usually a large number (N≫Mmuch-greater-than𝑁𝑀N\\gg M) for a high angular resolution. Due to the presence of a limited number of scatters around the BS, there is a small angular spread in the angular domain, resulting in a sparse channel APS 𝐱𝐱\\bf x. To construct the localized statistical channel model, we can formulate the sparse recovery problem as where K𝐾K is the maximum number of nonzero entries, representing the maximum number of channel paths; and the constraint 𝐱≥𝟎𝐱0{\\bf x}\\geq\\bm{0} is because the expectation of channel gain with respect to different angles is nonnegative. Problem (34) is exceptionally challenging due to the ill-conditioned sensing matrix 𝐀𝐀\\bf A, which has nonuniform and closely parallel columns. To address this issue, the weighted nonnegative OMP (WNOMP) and the second-order weighted OMP (SWOMP) algorithms are proposed in . The WNOMP algorithm can alleviate the effect of nonuniform columns, while the SWOMP algorithm can further identify the closely parallel columns correctly. In addition to WNOMP and SWOMP in the manner of the single grid, an enhanced approach for estimating the channel APS is the multi-grid method .\nThe localized statistical channel model exhibits statistical indistinguishability from the true propagation environment, generating channels that are similar to real-world scenarios. The construction of the localized statistical channel model enables precise evaluation of the network performance and effectively facilitates the simulation for offline network optimization  8 . Device activity detection in mMTC. Consider an uplink single-cell massive random access scenario  with K≫1much-greater-than𝐾1K\\gg 1 single-antenna devices communicating with a BS equipped with M≫1much-greater-than𝑀1M\\gg 1 antennas, which corresponds to the uplink counterpart of the wireless system in Fig. 3 (a). To reduce the communication latency, grant-free random access schemes have been proposed in  9, where the active devices directly transmit the data signals after transmitting their preassigned nonorthogonal signature sequences without permissions from the BS, and the BS then cooperatively identifies the active devices based on its received signals. We now introduce two formulations of the device activity detection problem and their related detection theory. We begin with the system model. For the purpose of\ndevice identification, each device k𝑘k is preassigned a unique signature\nsequence 𝐬k=[s1​k,s2​k,…,sL​k]𝖳∈ℂLsubscript𝐬𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑠1𝑘subscript𝑠2𝑘…subscript𝑠𝐿𝑘𝖳superscriptℂ𝐿\\mathbf{s}_{k}=[s_{1k},s_{2k},\\ldots,s_{Lk}]^{\\mathsf{T}}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{L},\nwhere L𝐿L is the sequence length.\nLet ak∈{0,1}subscript𝑎𝑘01a_{k}\\in\\{0,1\\} denote the activity of device k𝑘k, i.e., ak=1subscript𝑎𝑘1a_{k}=1 if the device is active and ak=0subscript𝑎𝑘0a_{k}=0 otherwise, and let 𝐡k∈ℂMsubscript𝐡𝑘superscriptℂ𝑀\\mathbf{h}_{k}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{M} denote the channel vector between device k𝑘k and the BS.\nThen, the received signals 𝐘∈ℂL×M𝐘superscriptℂ𝐿𝑀\\mathbf{Y}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{L\\times M} at the BS (in the pilot\nphase) can be expressed as where 𝐙∈ℂL×M𝐙superscriptℂ𝐿𝑀\\mathbf{Z}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{L\\times M} is the normalized effective i.i.d. Gaussian noise with variance σz2​𝐈superscriptsubscript𝜎𝑧2𝐈\\sigma_{z}^{2}\\mathbf{I}. Define 𝐒=[𝐬1,𝐬2,…,𝐬K]∈ℂL×K𝐒subscript𝐬1subscript𝐬2…subscript𝐬𝐾superscriptℂ𝐿𝐾\\mathbf{S}=[\\mathbf{s}_{1},\\mathbf{s}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{s}_{K}]\\in\\mathbb{C}^{L\\times K} and 𝐗=[a1​𝐡1,a2​𝐡2,…,aK​𝐡K]𝖳∈ℂK×M.𝐗superscriptsubscript𝑎1subscript𝐡1subscript𝑎2subscript𝐡2…subscript𝑎𝐾subscript𝐡𝐾𝖳superscriptℂ𝐾𝑀\\mathbf{X}=[a_{1}\\mathbf{h}_{1},a_{2}\\mathbf{h}_{2},\\ldots,a_{K}\\mathbf{h}_{K}]^{\\mathsf{T}}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{K\\times M}. The received signals in (35) can then be rewritten as 𝐘=𝐒𝐗+𝐙.𝐘𝐒𝐗𝐙\\mathbf{Y}=\\mathbf{S}\\mathbf{X}+\\mathbf{Z}. Since the user traffic is sporadic, i.e., only Ka≪Kmuch-less-thansubscript𝐾𝑎𝐾K_{a}\\ll K\ndevices are active during each coherence interval, most rows of 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} will be zero. Based on this observation, the device activity detection problem has been formulated and analyzed using sparse optimization and CS approaches 0 1. For instance, the device activity detection problem can be formulated as where ‖𝐗‖2,1=∑k=1K∑m=1MXk,m2subscriptnorm𝐗21superscriptsubscript𝑘1𝐾superscriptsubscript𝑚1𝑀superscriptsubscript𝑋𝑘𝑚2\\|\\mathbf{X}\\|_{2,1}=\\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\sqrt{\\sum_{m=1}^{M}X_{k,m}^{2}} is the ℓ2,1subscriptℓ21\\ell_{2,1}-norm, which is effective in promoting the group sparsity of 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} 2.\nThe works 0 1 propose to use the (vector) approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm to solve the device activity detection problem and analyze the detection performance by utilizing the state evolution analysis. It has been shown in 0 that as the number of antennas M𝑀M goes to infinity, the missed detection and false alarm probabilities can always be made to go to zero by the AMP approach that exploits the sparsity in the user activity pattern. Problem (36) can also be solved by the PG algorithm (see Section III-C), which comes with strong convergence guarantees 3 4. Recent progress on using sparse optimization and CS approaches to solve the device activity problem has been made in 5 6 7 8 9. An alternative way of formulating the device activity detection problem is the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach  . Instead of treating 𝐡ksubscript𝐡𝑘\\mathbf{h}_{k} as a deterministic unknown variable as in the above CS approach, the MLE approach exploits the distribution information in 𝐡k,subscript𝐡𝑘\\mathbf{h}_{k}, i.e., 𝐡k=gk​𝐡~k,subscript𝐡𝑘subscript𝑔𝑘subscript~𝐡𝑘\\mathbf{h}_{k}=\\sqrt{g_{k}}\\tilde{\\mathbf{h}}_{k}, where gk≥0subscript𝑔𝑘0g_{k}\\geq 0 is the large-scale fading component, and 𝐡~k∈ℂMsubscript~𝐡𝑘superscriptℂ𝑀\\tilde{\\mathbf{h}}_{k}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{M} is the Rayleigh fading component following 𝒞​𝒩​(𝟎,𝐈)𝒞𝒩0𝐈\\mathcal{CN}(\\mathbf{0},\\mathbf{I}). In this case, the received signals in (35) can be rewritten as\n𝐘=𝐒​𝚪1/2​𝐇~+𝐙,𝐘𝐒superscript𝚪12~𝐇𝐙\\mathbf{Y}=\\mathbf{S}\\bm{\\Gamma}^{1/2}\\tilde{\\mathbf{H}}+\\mathbf{Z}, where 𝚪=diag⁡(γ1,γ2,…,γK)∈ℝK×K𝚪diagsubscript𝛾1subscript𝛾2…subscript𝛾𝐾superscriptℝ𝐾𝐾\\bm{\\Gamma}=\\operatorname{diag}(\\gamma_{1},\\gamma_{2},\\ldots,\\gamma_{K})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{K\\times K} with γk=ak​gksubscript𝛾𝑘subscript𝑎𝑘subscript𝑔𝑘\\gamma_{k}=a_{k}g_{k} being a diagonal matrix indicating both the device activity aksubscript𝑎𝑘a_{k} and the large-scale fading component gksubscript𝑔𝑘g_{k}, and 𝐇~=[𝐡~1,𝐡~2,…,𝐡~K]𝖳∈ℂK×M~𝐇superscriptsubscript~𝐡1subscript~𝐡2…subscript~𝐡𝐾𝖳superscriptℂ𝐾𝑀\\tilde{\\mathbf{H}}=[\\tilde{\\mathbf{h}}_{1},\\tilde{\\mathbf{h}}_{2},\\ldots,\\tilde{\\mathbf{h}}_{K}]^{\\mathsf{T}}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{K\\times M} is the normalized channel matrix. Note that the columns of 𝐘𝐘\\mathbf{Y},\ndenoted by 𝐲m∈ℂLsubscript𝐲𝑚superscriptℂ𝐿\\mathbf{y}_{m}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{L}, 1≤m≤M1𝑚𝑀1\\leq m\\leq M, are independent and each column 𝐲msubscript𝐲𝑚\\mathbf{y}_{m}\nfollows the complex Gaussian distribution\n𝐲m∼𝒞​𝒩​(𝟎,𝚺)similar-tosubscript𝐲𝑚𝒞𝒩0𝚺\\mathbf{y}_{m}\\sim\\mathcal{CN}\\left(\\mathbf{0},\\bm{\\Sigma}\\right)\nwith covariance matrix Therefore, the problem of maximizing the likelihood p​(𝐘|𝚪)𝑝conditional𝐘𝚪p(\\mathbf{Y}\\,|\\,\\bm{\\Gamma}) can be equivalently formulated as  where 𝚺^=𝐘𝐘†/M^𝚺superscript𝐘𝐘†𝑀\\widehat{\\bm{\\Sigma}}=\\mathbf{Y}\\mathbf{Y}^{\\dagger}/M\nis the sample covariance matrix of the received signals averaged over different antennas. The formulation (37) leads to the so-called covariance-based approach in the literature because it depends on 𝐘𝐘\\mathbf{Y} only through its covariance 𝚺^^𝚺\\widehat{\\bm{\\Sigma}}. It has been shown in   that when {𝐬k}subscript𝐬𝑘\\left\\{\\mathbf{s}_{k}\\right\\} is uniformly drawn from the sphere of radius L𝐿\\sqrt{L} in an\ni.i.d. fashion and the number of active devices satisfies then the MLE formulation in (37) is able to successfully detect the active devices with probability at least 1−exp⁡(−c2​L),1subscript𝑐2𝐿1-\\exp(-c_{2}L), where c1subscript𝑐1c_{1} and c2subscript𝑐2c_{2} are two constants whose\nvalues do not depend on Ka,subscript𝐾𝑎K_{a}, K,𝐾K, and L.𝐿L. This result shows that if the number of antennas M𝑀M at the BS goes to infinity, then the number of active devices that can be detected by the covariance-based approach scales quadratically with the length of the devices’ signature sequence L𝐿L. Covariance-based approaches and analyses have also been extended to the joint activity and data detection case  , the multi-cell scenario  [ref]156, the more practical ways of generating signature sequences [ref]156, the asynchronous scenario  , the case where the BS is equipped with low-resolution ADCs , and the unsourced random access scenario .\n\nReference markers found: [156]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]156: with the length of the devices’ signature sequence L𝐿L.
