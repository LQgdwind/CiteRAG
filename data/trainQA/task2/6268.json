      "content": "Paper Title: Revisiting Class Imbalance for End-to-end Semi-Supervised Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExisting SSOD frameworks can be categorized as the pseudo-label-based methods   3    [ref]34  [ref]36         and consistency-based methods  . The pseudo-label-based works proved better performance against consistency-based SSOD approaches. In 3, Shon et al. introduce a pseudo-labeling-based method but it lacks consideration of serious data imbalance issues. Zhang et al. [ref]34 proposed an adaptive self-training model for class-rebalancing but it requires additional memory module.\nYang et al.  proposed interactive form of self-training to tackle the discrepancies in results. However, their model requires two ROI heads to mine complementary information.\nIn contrast, Xu et al.  present an end-to-end based soft teacher mechanism to generate better pseudo-labels. Similarly, Tang et al.  follow the teacher-student dual model framework to generate more consistent pseudo-labels.\nThese methods   perform better than multi-stage based approaches with less complexity, but they still suffers from class imbalance problem. Zheng et al. [ref]36 observed the effects of single threshold and introduced a two-stage threshold mechanism based dual decoupling framework. Recently, Liu et al.  proposed a cycle self-training network to overcome the coupling effect of teacher-student learning. In , Li et al. proposed a method that uses the dense guidance teacher directly to monitor student training. Recently, Mi et al.  examined teacher-student learning from the perspective of data initialization where the label set is partially initialized and gradually augmented by evaluating key factors of unlabeled examples. In , Wang et al. identified the inconsistency in object proposals and proposed a framework to overcome the harm caused by insufficient quality of pseudo-labels. Recent, authors in 6 showed the generalization of the SSOD method to anchor-free detectors and also introduced Listen2Student mechanism to prevent misleading pseudo-labels. Chen et al.  also studied anchor-free detectors and proposed a dense learning-based framework to generate stable and precise pseudo-labels. In , Zhou et al. proposed replacing sparse pseudo-boxes with dense predictions to obtain rich pseudo-label information. Li et al.  introduced noisy pseudo box learning and multi-view scale-invariant learning to provide better pseudo-labels. To take full advantage of labeled data, Li et al.  proposed a multi-instance alignment model that improves prediction consistency based on global class prototypes. Che et al.  proposed a framework from two perspectives, i.e., distribution-level and instance-level to handle the class imbalance issue. Recently, Zhang et al.  introduced a dual pseudo-label polishing framework to reduce the deviation of pseudo-labels from ground truth through dual-polishing learning. To address the crucial class imbalance issue and produce better pseudo-labels, we also employ pseudo-label-based teacher-student scheme\nand introduce two crucial modules, two new classification losses and a new learning mechanism.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: Existing SSOD frameworks can be categorized as the pseudo-label-based methods   3    [ref]34  [ref]36         and consistency-based methods  .
