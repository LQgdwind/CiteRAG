      "content": "Paper Title: Audio-Visual Event Localization via Recursive Fusion by Joint Co-Attention\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHumans explore the surroundings with their advanced sensory system in daily life, e.g., eyes, ears, and noses. Heterogeneous information from various sensors floods into the human perceptual system, among which sound and vision are two dominant components. In multimodal machine learning, it turns out that the joint learning of audio and visual modalities usually achieves better performance than using single modality for various tasks, e.g., sound localization  2 [ref]23  , sound source separation    [ref]23  6  0  and audio-visual event localization 9 6 . In this paper, we focus on the audio-visual event localization task.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, an Audio-Visual Event (AVE) is defined in a video sequence that is both audible and visible. The audio-visual event localization task consists of two sub-tasks, one of which is to predict the event label while the other is to predict which segment of the video sequence has an audio-visual event of interest. As in the AVE definition, localizing an AVE must deal with heterogeneous information from both audio and visual modalities.\nMoreover, recent works 9 6  show that the performance after fusion outperforms the one that only uses a single modality.\nAlthough these approaches present interesting explorations, how to smartly fuse representations from both modalities is still a challenging task. Multimodal fusion provides a global view of multiple representations for a specific phenomenon. To tackle the AVE localization problem, existing methods 9 6 either fuse cell states out of LSTMs 6, or fuse both hidden states and cell states from LSTMs 9. Both aforementioned approaches exploit a plain multimodal fusion strategy, where the fusion results might be unstable as it is hard to guarantee good quality of the information used for the fusion, e.g., some noisy information from the background segments may also be included.\nTherefore, a more robust fusion strategy is needed for better representations. Wu et al.  introduce a cross-modal matching mechanism that exploits global temporal co-occurrences between two modalities and excludes the noisy background segments from the sequence. Intuitively, having global features to interact with local features would help to localize the event, but it needs additional supervision to manually filter the background segments. To summarize, existing methods either follow a straightforward multimodal fusion strategy (fuse both features directly), or require extra supervision (exclude background segments).\nTaking advantage of recursive fusion interactions between multimodal representations, we propose a novel joint co-attention fusion approach that is able to learn more robust representations with less supervision on excluding background segments. Attention mechanism has been applied to many tasks        3. For example, recent works in generative adversarial networks   5 utilize a self-attention mechanism that relates different portions of a single image to compute a representation for itself. Besides self-attention, other works in Video Question Answering (VQA)   propose a co-attention mechanism, in which the image representation guides the text attention generation and in the meanwhile, the text representation also guides image attention generation. Moreover, both attention mechanisms allow attention-driven, long-range dependency modeling for their corresponding tasks. Motivated by these two attention techniques, we propose a new Joint Co-Attention (JCA) mechanism which develops on the basis of self-attention and co-attention. We utilize the joint representation to generate the attention masks for two uni-modalities while previous methods   independently generate attention mask for each other. In our approach, instead of using features from one single modality, each attention mask is generated using features from both modalities and thus it is more informative. As a result, each modality is attended not only by the features from itself (self-attended), but also by the features from the other modality (co-attended). While the attention mechanism allows multimodal fusion in depth, we further introduce a double fusion mechanism, that can be integrated with attention mechanisms, allowing fusion both in depth and breadth.\nExisting works 7  exploit the double fusion to integrate representations from different modalities in a hybrid fusion manner, i.e., they fuse features using both early fusion (before feature embedding) and late fusion (after feature embedding).\nDifferent from existing methods 9 6 7  that fuse representations from multiple modalities simply by averaging, weighting or concatenation.\nIn this paper, we propose to integrate the double fusion method with our JCA mechanism.\nFirst, the audio-guided attention 6 is performed as early fusion.\nThen, we exploit Bi-LSTM  with residual embedding to extract features where we combine features before Bi-LSTM and after Bi-LSTM, leading to global temporal cues. After the Bi-LSTMs, the representations of two modalities are fused using the JCA mechanism as late fusion.\nNote that the JCA unit is recursive so that the joint co-attention process can be repeated for multiple times. Overall, our contributions in this paper are summarized as follows: We revisit the audio-visual event localization task and tackle the task from a multimodal fusion perspective which targets for better representations. We propose a novel joint co-attention mechanism and deploy it in deep audio-visual learning. It learns more robust representations by recursively performing fusions of the representations from two modalities. The integration of attention mechanism and double fusion method enables the model to learn long-range dependencies.\nExtensive experiments show the superiority of our framework.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: machine learning, it turns out that the joint learning of audio and visual modalities usually achieves better performance than using single modality for various tasks, e.g., sound localization  2 [ref]23  , sound source separation    [ref]23  6  0  and audio-visual event localization 9 6 .
