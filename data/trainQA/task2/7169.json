      "content": "Paper Title: Towards a Simultaneous and Granular Identity-Expression Control in Personalized Face Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe research community has been striving to improve controllability in the generation of facial images tailored to user preferences. A common practice in controllable generation and manipulation is to use different modalities as conditioning in a face generator model, such as texts     , reference images    , segmentation masks    and audios  5 6. Although these methods have realized the ability to control the local features and global attributes in a face, the simultaneous control of identity and expression in a specific background has not been fully explored, which involves three important high-level attributes (i.e. identity, expression, and background) to determine a face image. Since identity and expression are highly entangled, it’s challenging to separately and precisely control them in a unified framework. Additionally, in existing generation or manipulation methods, the granularity of expression control remains at a coarse level, often limited to the commonly used seven or eight labels, e.g. “surprise”, “happiness”, “anger” etc. These labels struggle to cover the entire emotional space sufficiently in the open world. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a novel framework that can simultaneously control identity, expression, and background from multi-modal inputs. As shown in Fig. 1 and 2, the inputs contain three items: 1) a text that describes the scene, and 2) a selfie photo uploaded by the user to provide identity, 3) a text related to the expression labels. Human language can conceptually describe expressions and accurately describe scenes but can’t describe identity precisely, while images can be naturally used in identity recognition. On the output side, the generated face will have the same identity as the input selfie photo, show the expression specified by the text, and be placed in the background described in the text  , as shown in Fig. 1. To support fine-grained expression description, we employ an expression dictionary of 135 English words [ref]4, e.g. “amazement”, “exhilaration”, “hysteria” etc., which can more comprehensively describe the emotion domain. The technical core inside the proposed framework is a novel diffusion model that can conduct Simultaneous Face Swapping and Reenactment (SFSR). Swapping and reenactment, which transfer the identity or expression of the source face to the target face, are two classical face manipulation tasks and have been studied extensively. Meanwhile, SFSR is a relatively new and unexplored task, which aims at separately transferring the identity from the source face, and the expression from another source to one target face, while keeping the background attributes (e.g. face pose, hair, glasses, and surroundings) in the target unchanged. To prepare the two sources and one target for SFSR, the text that describes the scene will be input to a pre-trained text-to-image model (Stable Diffusion) [ref]35 to get the background image, while the text that describes the expression will be used as the search key in the 135-class emotion dataset [ref]4 7 to retrieve the expression image. Together with the input identity image, the three images will be used as conditioning in a latent diffusion model [ref]35 to generate the result, which has already exhibited high customizability of various conditions on image generation 2. Based on the foundations of the diffusion model 0 [ref]35, we also propose several elaborate designs in SFSR diffusion model.\n1) Balancing identity and expression encoder. We develop the identity and expression encoder, which are competitive with each other, to reduce the transfer of residual identity attribute in the expression encoder to the final result.\n2) Improved midpoint sampling. To achieve both efficiency and accuracy in imposing the identity and expression constraints during training, we propose the improved midpoint sampling, which can generate the face of higher quality with only two times of prediction than the original midpoint sampling 4.\n3) Explicitly background conditioning.\nWe provide background condition in the training phase so that the diffusion model can focus on the generation of face but not background, and get more hints from inputs to recover face pose and lighting. This design is different from previous methods  4 that use background image only in inference, and proves to be more effective. We name the newly designed diffusion model for SFSR task as DiffSFSR.\nFinally, the contributions of this paper are summarized as: A novel face generation framework that achieves simultaneous control of identity and expression, and more fine-grained expression synthesis than state-of-the-art text-to-image methods. A novel face manipulation task, simultaneously face swapping and reenactment, which has never been explored by previous methods. This task is also compatible with the traditional separate swapping and reenactment tasks by re-combination of inputs. Three innovative designs in the conditional diffusion model, including balancing identity and expression encoder, improved midpoint sampling, and explicitly background conditioning, which increase the controllability and image quality.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: by the text, and be placed in the background described in the text  , as shown in Fig. 1.
