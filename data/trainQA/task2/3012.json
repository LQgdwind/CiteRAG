      "content": "Paper Title: Graph Robustness Benchmark: Benchmarking the Adversarial Robustness of Graph Machine Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n††\\dagger The table represents the original settings, while methods can be adapted to other settings by using GRB’s modualr coding framework. In the work of Szegedy et al. , the existence of adversarial examples was revealed for ML models in image classification—imperceptible perturbations on inputs have ineligible impact on outputs of models.\nRecent works (in Table 1) show that GML models are no exception.\nGraph adversarial attacks can mainly be categorized into two types according to the attack approach: graph modification attack and graph injection attack.\nGraph modification attacks directly modify the existing graph, by adding or removing edges (e.g., DICE , FGA [ref]11, FLIP [ref]29, NEA [ref]29, STACK ), or further modifying node features (e.g., Nettack [ref]12, FGSM [ref]12, RL-S2V , Metattack ).\nDifferently, graph injection attacks add new malicious nodes without modifying the original graph (e.g., AFGSM , SPEIT , TDGIA ).\nFacing the problem of scalability, some attacks are not applicable to large graphs due to their high time complexity [ref]12   or expensive memory consumption [ref]11 [ref]29. Defenses can mainly be categorized into two types: preprocess-based defense and model-based defense.\nThe first type regards the attacked graphs as noisy ones and defenders can preprocess the adjacency matrix (e.g., GNN-SVD , GNN-Jaccard ) or the features of nodes (e.g., feature transformation ), to alleviate the effect of perturbations.\nThe second type achieves robustness through model enhancement, either by robust training schemes (e.g., adversarial training  ) or new model architectures (e.g., RobustGCN , GNNGuard ).\nSome defenses also suffer from the problem of scalability, due to the need of calculation on large dense matrices   . Notwithstanding the significant progress, existing works share some common limitations:\n(1) Lack of scalability: Most works only consider very small graphs and cannot be scaled up to larger ones due to time/memory complexity.\n(2) Lack of generalization: Most attacks/defenses are evaluated on very basic GML models, but not on other variants. Meanwhile, some methods are only effective for specific models with ad-hoc designs, which makes the results less generalized and practical.\n(3) Ill-defined scenarios: The scenarios and assumptions proposed in some previous works are not realistic, e.g., the unnoticeability under poisoning setting ignores the real capability of the defenders (Cf. Appendix A.3 for details).\nBesides, there are no unified standards on evaluating the adversarial robustness. Different settings (e.g., the choice of datasets, random splitting, different constraints) introduce biases, which makes it hard to compare the effectiveness of different methods.\nIn light of these challenges, there is an urgent need for benchmarking the adversarial robustness of GML.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: according to the attack approach: graph modification attack and graph injection attack.\nGraph modification attacks directly modify the existing graph, by adding or removing edges (e.g., DICE , FGA [ref]11, FLIP [ref]29, NEA [ref]29, STACK ), or further modifying node features (e.g., Nettack [ref]12, FGSM [ref]12, RL-S2V , Metattack ).\nDifferently, graph injection attacks add new malicious\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
