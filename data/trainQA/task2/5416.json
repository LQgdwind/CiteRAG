      "content": "Paper Title: Part\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn distillation [ref]6  one trains a small “student” model to match the predicted soft label distribution of a large\n“teacher” model, rather than match one-hot labels the teacher was trained on.\nThis has emerged as a highly effective model compression technique, and has inspired an actively developing literature that has sought to\nexplore applications of distillation to various settings   ,\ndesign more effective variants    8 ,\nand better understand theoretically when and why distillation is effective 2  5   4   5  9. On paper, distillation is intended to help by transferring the soft probabilities of a (one-hot loss trained) teacher over to the student. Intuitively, we would desire this transfer to be perfect; the more a student fails to match the teacher’s probabilities, the more we expect its performance to suffer. After all, in the extreme case of a student that simply outputs uniformly random labels, its performance would be as poor as it can get. However, recent work by Stanton et al. [ref]47 has challenged these presumptions underlying what distillation supposedly does, and how it supposedly helps. First [ref]47 show in practice that the student does not adequately match the teacher probabilities, despite being trained to fit them. Secondly, students that do successfully match the teacher probabilities, may generalize worse than students that show some level of deviations from the teacher [47, Fig. 1].\nSurprisingly, this occurs even in self-distillation settings  4 where the student and the teacher have identical architecture and thus the student can exactly fit the teacher’s probabilities. Even more remarkable is the fact the self-distilled student not only deviates in probabilities, but also supercedes the teacher in performance. How is it possible for the student to deviate from the teacher’s probabilities, and yet counter-intuitively improve its generalization, even beyond the teacher?\nOur work aims to reconcile this paradoxical behavior. Our answer, at a high level, is that while arbitrary deviations in probabilities may indeed hurt the student, in reality there are certain systematic deviations in the student’s probabilities. Next, we argue, these systematic deviations and improved generalization co-occur because they arise from the same effect: a helpful form of regularization that is induced by distillation. We describe these effects in more detail in our list of key contributions below: Exaggerated confidence: Across a wide range of\narchitectures\nand image & language classification data (spanning more than 202020 settings in total)\nwe demonstrate (§3)\nthat the student “exaggerates” the teacher’s confidence. Most typically, on low-confidence points of the teacher, the student achieves even lower confidence than the teacher; in other settings, on high-confidence points, even higher confidence than the teacher (Fig 1a). Surprisingly, we find such deviations even with self-distillation, implying that this cannot be explained by a mere student-teacher capacity mismatch.\nThis reveals a novel systematic and unexpected behavior of distillation. Exaggerated implicit regularization:\nNext, we demonstrate another form of exaggeration: in some simple settings, self-distillation exaggerates the implicit bias of gradient descent (GD) in converging faster along the top data eigendirections. We demonstrate this theoretically\n(Thm 4.1) for linear regression, as a gradient-descent counterpart to the seminal non-gradient-descent result of Mobahi et al. 5 (see  §1.1 for key differences). Empirically, we provide the first demonstration of this effect for cross entropy loss on neural networks (Fig 1b and  §4.1). Reconciling the paradox: Finally, we tie the above observations together to resolve our initial paradox. We empirically argue how the exaggerated bias towards top eigenvectors causes the student to both (a) exaggerate confidence levels and (b) outperform the teacher (see  §5). This offers a resolution for how deviations in probabilities can co-occur with improved performance.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: In distillation [ref]6  one trains a small “student” model to match the predicted soft label distribution of a large\n“teacher” model, rather than match one-hot labels the teacher was trained on.\nThis has emerged as\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
