      "content": "Paper Title: Class Incremental Online Streaming Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe proposed approach (CIOSL) follows ‘online streaming setting’, to the best of our knowledge, recent works ExStream 4, and REMIND 5 are the only method that trains a deep neural network following our setting. We compared our approach (CIOSL) against these strong baselines. In addition, we have compared various ‘batch’ and ‘online’ learning methods, which we describe below. For a fair comparison, we follow a similar network structure throughout all the methods. We separate a convolutional neural network (CNN) into two networks: (i)𝑖(i) non-plastic feature extractor G​(⋅)𝐺⋅G(\\cdot), and (i​i)𝑖𝑖(ii) plastic neural network F​(⋅)𝐹⋅F(\\cdot). For a given input image 𝒙𝒙\\boldsymbol{x}, the predicted class label is computed as: y=F​(G​(𝒙))𝑦𝐹𝐺𝒙y=F(G(\\boldsymbol{x})). Across all the methods, we use the same initialization step for the feature extractor G​(⋅)𝐺⋅G(\\cdot) (discussed in Section 3.5 in the main paper) and keep it frozen throughout the streaming learning. For all the methods, only the plastic network F​(⋅)𝐹⋅F(\\cdot) is trained with one sample at a time in streaming manner. For details on the structure of the plastic network F​(⋅)𝐹⋅F(\\cdot) across baselines along with CIOSL, please refer to Section 5.3 in the main paper. In the below, we describe the baselines which we have evaluated along with our proposed method (CIOSL) in online streaming setting: EWC : It is a regularization-based incremental learning method, which penalizes any changes to the network parameters by the important weight measure, the diagonal of the Fisher information matrix. MAS : It is another regularization-based lifelong learning method, where the importance weight of the network parameters are estimated by measuring the magnitude of the gradient of the learned function. VCL [ref]31: It uses variational inference (VI) with a Bayesian neural network to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, where it uses the previously learned posterior as the prior while learning incrementally with the sequentially coming data. For more details, please refer to Section A.2. VCL with Coreset [ref]31: This method is the same as pure VCL as mentioned above, except, at the end of training on each task, the network is finetuned with the coreset samples. We adapted the coreset selection in online streaming setting and stored data points in coreset in an online manner. Coreset Only 0: This method is exactly similar to VCL with Coreset [ref]31, except the prior which is used for variational inference is the initial prior each time, i.e., it is not updated with the previous posterior before training on a new task. GDumb : It is an online learning method. It stores data points with a greedy sampler and retrains the network from scratch each time with stored samples before inference. A-Gem : It is another online learning approach. It uses past task data stored in memory to build an optimization constraint to be satisfied by each new update. If the gradient violates the constraint, then it is projected such that the constraint is satisfied. TinyER : It stores past task data points in a tiny episodic memory and replays them with the current training data to enable continual learning. ExStream 4: It is an online streaming learning method, which uses memory replay to enable continual learning. It maintains buffers of prototypes to store the input vectors. Once the buffer is full, it combines the two nearest prototypes in the buffer and stores the new input vector. REMIND 5: Similar to ExStream, it is another streaming learning method, which enables lifelong learning with memory replay. For more details on REMIND, please refer to Section A.3. Fine-tuning: It is a streaming learning baseline and serves as the lower bound on the network’s performance. In this scenario, the network parameters are fine-tuned with one instance through the whole dataset for a single epoch. Offline: It serves as the upper bound on the network’s performance, where the network is trained in the traditional way; the complete dataset is divided into multiple batches, and the network loops over them multiple times. Note: In online streaming setting, finetuning the network with the stored samples is prohibited, as it violates the single-pass learning constraint. ‘VCL with Coreset’, ‘Coreset Only’, and ‘GDumb’ finetune the network parameters before inference; therefore, these methods have an extra advantage compared to true streaming learning approaches, and they violate the single-pass learning constraint. Therefore these methods cannot be considered as the best-performing methods even when they achieve better final accuracy as these methods are not true streaming learning method. Table 8 categorizes the baselines according to the underlying assumptions that they impose. For baselines which finetunes the network before inference and violates the constraint of streaming learning, such as single pass learning constraint, have been marked in red in the corresponding column.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: is another regularization-based lifelong learning method, where the importance weight of the network parameters are estimated by measuring the magnitude of the gradient of the learned function.
