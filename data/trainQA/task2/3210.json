Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5.

Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

synthetic and real dataset sizes and combinations for person bounding box (bbox) and keypoint detection. We report our results on the COCO person validation and test-dev2017 using Average Precision (AP) as the primary metric for model performance.\n We started our benchmarks by training models from random initialization on various sizes of real data alone. Unsurprisingly, we saw model performance improved with the amount of real data used (Tab. 1 and A.1).\nWe continued our benchmarks by training the model from random initialization on synthetic data generated by PeopleSansPeople using naïvely-chosen parameters. As before, we report the model performance on COCO-person validation and test-dev2017 sets (Tab. 1 and A.1). The benchmarks indicate that a model trained solely on synthetic data generated with naïve domain randomization struggles to generalize on the real domain. To complete our benchmarks, we took the models trained from scratch on synthetic data and fine-tune them on various amounts of real COCO data, which has shown excellent results in other sim2real problems . For comparison, we also use ImageNet pre-trained weights and fine-tune them on various amounts of real COCO data. We find that the pre-training on the synthetic data improves model performance after fine-tuning the model on real data for all dataset sizes used. Our best models achieve a keypoint AP of 63.47±0.19plus-or-minus63.470.1963.47\\pm 0.19 on the COCO test-dev2017 dataset, outperforming the same model pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on the entire COCO (keypoint AP of 62.4062.4062.40).\nThe effects of synthetic pre-training for few-shot transfer to real domain are more significant; whilst training on 641641641 real images alone yields a keypoint AP of 6.406.406.40, ImageNet pre-training increases this to 21.9021.9021.90; with synthetic pre-training, we observe more than double the performance boost with keypoint AP of 44.43±0.17plus-or-minus44.430.1744.43\\pm 0.17. The bounding box metrics are reported in Tab. A.3 and A.4. In Tab. 3 we show the gains of synthetic pre-training over training from scratch and ImageNet pre-training for the best models. These results show that synthetic pre-training helps more with localization of keypoints than bounding box detection which is the classification of a region of the image.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: 1.23\n67.43 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.66\n39.90 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 1.70\n45.37 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.97\n36.43 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 1.38\n\n245×103245superscript103\\text{245}\\times\\text{10}^{\\text{3}} synth\n 0 \n[ref]26  \n44.43 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.17\n71.43 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.12\n46.27 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.12\n50.47 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.12\n41.13 ±plus-or-minus\\pm\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
