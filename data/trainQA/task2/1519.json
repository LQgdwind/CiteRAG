      "content": "Paper Title: GLocalX - From Local to Global Explanations of Black Box AI Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the last decade, Artificial Intelligence (AI) decision systems have been widely used in a plethora of applications such as credit score, insurance risk, and health monitoring, in which accuracy is of the utmost importance [ref]1.\nComplex nonlinear machine learning models such as ensemble models, deep neural networks (DNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) have shown remarkable performance in these tasks, and have made their way into a large number of systems .\nUnfortunately, their state-of-the-art performance comes at the cost of a clear interpretation of their inner workings [ref]3.\nThese “black box” models have an opaque, hidden internal structure that humans do not understand .\nRelying on black box systems is becoming increasingly risky both for their lack of transparency and the systematic bias they have shown in real-world scenarios .\nThe lack of proper explanations also has ethical implications, legally reported in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), approved by the European Parliament in May 2018.\nThe GDPR provides restrictions and guidelines for automated black box decision-making processes which, for the first time, introduces a “right to explanation” on the decisions of the system.\nMore specifically, the GDPR introduces a right to meaningful explanations when one is subject to automated AI systems   . Given the great interest on the topic    , several works in the literature try to explain opaque models with one of two goals: either providing instance explanations for a given decision by using a local approach    , or providing global explanations able to describe the overall logic of the black box [ref]15 .\nThese approaches differ both on their task and their use case, with local approaches having the upper hand in several scenarios.\nAs stated, local approaches   provide explanations of single instances and are beneficial to a plethora of users with different needs and resources at their disposal.\nModel developers, who have access both to data and black box, can directly inspect the model; analysts can audit the model on a small sample of instances; users can retrieve an explanation on a decision that involves them directly, gain trust in the model and, possibly, an actionable recourse to follow up the decision.\nOn the other hand, global approaches have stricter requirements.\nUsers may require access both to the model and the data used to train and validate the model  [ref]15 .\nOn the other hand, most local approaches are model agnostic  , i.e., they do not assume knowledge of the black box or its internals, while global approaches may depend on the black box model .\nIn spite of this additional layer of abstraction, local approaches have repeatedly shown competitive performances similar to global approaches, mainly due to the smaller set of decisions to explain.\nFinally, local approaches inherently enjoy a high degree of explanation independence, as they provide different views on data and are able to grasp qualitatively different patterns, providing different explanations for similar instances when confounding factors are at play 0 1.\nThis behavior is reminiscent of bagging estimators, as local approaches are a peculiar bagging in which each model is fit on one sample.\nFeature transformations are also typical of local approaches   as they are for bagging approaches. Following these premises, we posit that leveraging local approaches for tackling global tasks can yield the benefits of the former and overcome the constraints of the latter.\nIn this paper, we decline the local-global dichotomy in favor of a Local to Global interpretation and propose a formal definition of this problem and an algorithm to solve it.\nThree assumptions 2 underpin our approach: Logical Explanability. We believe that the cognitive vehicle for offering explanations should be close to the language of reasoning, that is logic.\nFor this reason we adopt rule-based local explanations  3. Local Explainability. While a black box can be arbitrarily complex, we assume that in the neighborhood of each specific instance there is a high chance that the decision boundary of the black box is simple enough to be accurately approximated by an explanation . Explanation Composition. We assume that similar instances admit similar explanations 4 5 and that similar explanations are likely to be composed together into slightly more general ones. We support these hypotheses with GLocalX (GLObal to loCAL eXplainer), a model-agnostic “local-first” explanation algorithm.\nGLocalX is based on the idea of deriving global explanations by inference on a set of logical rules representing local explanations.\nGLocalX aggregates local explanations expressed in form of logical rules into a global explanation by iteratively “merging” the rules in a growing hierarchical structure while accounting for both fidelity, i.e., accuracy in emulating black box predictions, and complexity of the rules.\nThe merge procedure estimates a distance between explanations and yields a set of sorted candidate pairs to merge.\nThen, the pair with minimum distance satisfying constraints on both fidelity and complexity is processed to guarantee generalization and the updated explanation replaces the selected pairs.\nConstraint satisfaction is ensured on each merge.\nThis guarantees high fidelity and low complexity on the final explanation yielded by GLocalX. We showcase the Local to Global formulation in two constrained scenarios typical of real-world use cases: in the former, we consider as available input a restricted number of local explanation rules; while in the latter, we consider no data available for the global explanation construction.\nThese settings can occur when the model is proprietary or data is inaccessible due to privacy concerns.\nEmpirical results over different black box models and datasets indicate that GLocalX achieves both a high fidelity and a low complexity of the rule set representing the model explanation.\nCompared to transparent models that either optimize model complexity or fidelity, but not both, GLocalX reaches simultaneously high fidelity and low complexity.\nThe high accuracy in prediction tasks also suggests that GLocalX might be used directly as a transparent model to replace global classifiers adopted in AI systems. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.\nSection  2 discusses related work.\nSection 3 presents the local to global problem formulation and the idea adopted for solving it.\nSection 4 describes the proposed hierarchical approach for the global explanation.\nExperimental results are presented in Section 5.\nFinally, Section 6 concludes the paper and discusses new research directions.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Intelligence (AI) decision systems have been widely used in a plethora of applications such as credit score, insurance risk, and health monitoring, in which accuracy is of the utmost importance [ref]1.\nComplex nonlinear machine learning models such as ensemble models, deep neural networks (DNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) have shown remarkable performance in these tasks, and have made\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
