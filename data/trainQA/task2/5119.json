      "content": "Paper Title: Guided Depth Super-Resolution by Deep Anisotropic Diffusion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIt is a primordial need for visual data analysis to increase the resolution of images after they have been captured. In many fields one is faced with images that, for technical reasons, have too low resolutions for the intended purposes, e.g., MRI scans in medical imaging , multi-spectral satellite images in Earth observation , thermal surveillance images [ref]1 and depth images in robotics .\nIn some cases, an image of much higher resolution is available in a different imaging modality, which can act as a guide for super-resolving the low-resolution source image, by injecting the missing high-frequency content.\nFor instance, in Earth observation, the guide is often a panchromatic image (hence the term ”pan-sharpening”), whereas in robotics a conventional RGB image is often attached to the same platform as a TOF camera or laser scanner.\nIn this paper, we focus on super-resolving depth images guided by RGB images, but the proposed framework is generic and can be adapted to other sensor combinations, too. Research into guided super-resolution has a long history  . The proposed solutions range from classical, entirely hand-crafted schemes  to fully learning-based methods , while some recent works have combined the two schools of thought, with promising results [ref]33 [ref]5.\nMany classical methods boil down to an image-specific optimization problem that must be solved at inference time, which often makes them slow and memory-hungry. Moreover, they are limited to low-level image properties of the guide, such as color and contrast, and lack the high-level image understanding and contextual reasoning of modern neural networks. On the positive side, by design, they can not overfit the peculiarities of a training set and tend to generalize better.\nRecent work on guided super-resolution has focused on deep neural networks. Their superior ability to capture latent image structure has greatly advanced the state of the art over traditional, learning-free approaches. Still, these learning-based methods tend to struggle with sharp discontinuities and often produce blurry edges in the super-resolved depth maps. Moreover, like many deep learning systems, they degrade – often substantially – when applied to images with even slightly different characteristics.\nNote also that standard feed-forward architectures cannot guarantee a consistent solution: feeding the source and guiding images through an encoder-decoder structure to obtain the super-resolved target will, by itself, not ensure that downsampling the target will reproduce the source. We propose a novel approach for guided depth super-resolution which combines the strengths of optimization-based and deep learning-based super-resolution.\nIn short, our method is a combination of anisotropic diffusion (based on the discretized version of the heat equation) with deep feature learning (based on a convolutional backbone).\nThe diffusion part resembles classical optimization approaches, solved via an iterative diffusion-adjustment loop. Every iteration consists of (1) an anisotropic diffusion step    , with diffusion weights driven by the guide in such a way that diffusion (i.e., smoothing) is low across high-contrast boundaries and high within homogeneous regions; and (2) an adjustment step that rescales the depth values such that they exactly match the low-resolution source when downsampled.\nTo harness the unmatched ability of deep learning to extract informative image features, the diffusion weights are not computed from raw brightness values but are set by passing the guide through a (fully) convolutional feature extractor.\nAn overview of the method is depicted in Fig. 1.\nThe technical core of our method is the insight that such a feature extractor can be trained end-to-end to optimally fulfill the requirements of the subsequent optimization, by back-propagating gradients through the iterations of the diffusion loop.\nDespite its apparent simplicity, this hybrid approach delivers excellent super-resolution results. In our experiments, it consistently outperforms prior art on three different datasets, across a range of upsampling factors from ×\\times4 to ×\\times32.\nIn our experiments, we compare it to six recent learning methods as well as five different learning-free methods. For completeness, we also include a learning-free version of our diffusion-adjustment scheme and show that it outperforms all other learning-free methods.\nBeyond the empirical performance, our method inherits several attractive properties from its ingredients: the diffusion-based optimization scheme ensures strict adherence to the depth values of the source, crisp edges, and a degree of interpretability; whereas deep learning equips the very local diffusion weights with large-scale context information, and offers a tractable, constant memory footprint at inference time.\nIn summary, our contributions are: We develop a hybrid framework for guided super-resolution that combines deep feature learning and anisotropic diffusion in an integrated, end-to-end trainable pipeline; We provide an implementation of that scheme with constant memory demands, and with inference time that is constant for a given upsampling factor and scales linearly with the number of iterations; We set a new state of the art for the Middlebury , NYUv2 0 and DIML 0 datasets, for upsampling factors from 4×\\times to 32×\\times, and provide empirical evidence that our method indeed guarantees exact consistency with the source image.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: for technical reasons, have too low resolutions for the intended purposes, e.g., MRI scans in medical imaging , multi-spectral satellite images in Earth observation , thermal surveillance images [ref]1 and depth images in robotics .\nIn some cases, an image of much higher resolution is available in a different imaging modality, which can act as a guide for super-resolving the low-resolution\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
