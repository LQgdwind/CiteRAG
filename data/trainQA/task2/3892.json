      "content": "Paper Title: PGADA: Perturbation-Guided Adversarial Alignment for Few-shot Learning Under the Support-Query Shift\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFew-shot learning can be divided into three main categories, including optimization-based method 1, hallucination-based method , and metric-based method [ref]30. On the one hand, the optimization-based methods aim to train a quickly adaptive model and quickly adapt to other tasks by fine-tuning 1 [ref]4. On the other hand, the hallucination-based methods hallucinate the scarce labeled data by synthesizing representations  with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) . Our work is most relevant to the metric-based methods where Vinyals et al. [ref]30 and Snell et al.  introduce the pairwise (and classwise) metrics to determine the label of the query set according to the support set. Sung et al.  model the non-linear relation between class representations and queries by neural networks. Moreover, cross-domain few-shot learning  argues that the training and testing sets may not lie in the same distribution. Thus, several techniques such as optimal transport , self-supervised learning   have been introduced to relieve the domain shift.\nWhile the domain shift not only occurs between the training set and the testing set but also between the support set and the query set . In addition, the optimal transport plan can be easily misguided by the perturbation in the images and leads to unacceptable performance.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: Few-shot learning can be divided into three main categories, including optimization-based method 1, hallucination-based method , and metric-based method [ref]30.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
