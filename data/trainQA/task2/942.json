      "content": "Paper Title: Class-Wise Difficulty-Balanced Loss for Solving Class-Imbalance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMNIST. From the standard MNIST handwritten digit recognition\ndataset , we\ngenerate a class-imbalanced binary classification task using a subset of the\ndataset.\nThe experimental setup is exactly same as given in . We select a total of\n5000 training images of class ‚Äò4‚Äô and ‚Äò9‚Äô where ‚Äò9‚Äô is chosen as the majority\nclass. We calculate\nthe ‚Äòmajority class ratio‚Äô as Increasing the majority class ratio increases the imbalance in the training\ndataset. We also use a validation set which is created by selecting 500 images\nfor each of the two classes from the original dataset but these images are\ndifferent from the 5000 images selected for training. A test set was\nalso created by randomly selecting 800 images for each of the classes from the\noriginal MNIST test set. Long-Tailed CIFAR. We conduct experiments on long-tailed\nCIFAR-100 . First a validation set was created from the original training set\nby randomly selecting 50 images per class. After the separation of the\nvalidation set, the remaining images in the training set were used to create a\nlong-tailed version of the dataset using the exact same procedure as stated in\n5. The number of training images per class are reduced following an\nexponential function n=nc‚ÄãŒºcùëõsubscriptùëõùëêsuperscriptùúáùëên=n_{c}\\mu^{c}, where cùëêc is the 0-based index of the class\nand ncsubscriptùëõùëên_{c} is the remaining number of training images of class cùëêc after\nseparation of the validation set and Œº‚àà(0,1)ùúá01\\mu\\in(0,1). Similar to 5, the\n‚Äòimbalance‚Äô factor of a dataset is defined as the number of training samples in\nthe largest class divided by that of the smallest class. The test set used for\nexperiment is exactly same as the original CIFAR test set available and is a\nbalanced set. ImageNet-LT. We also conduct experiments on the long-tailed version of the original ImageNet-2012 [ref]3, as constructed in 0. It comprises of 115,800 images from 1000 categories, where the most frequent class has 1280 image samples and the least frequent class has only 5 images. The test set is balanced. The split constructed by 0 also provides a validation set that is separate from the test set and training set. EGTEA. We also conduct experiments on the EGTEA Gaze+ dataset\n. This is an egocentric dataset that contains trimmed video clips of many\nkitchen-related actions. These video clips are extracted segments from longer\nvideos that were collected by 32 different subjects. Each video clip is\nassigned\na single action label and the challenge is to train a classifier to classify the\nactions from the provided video clips. Each action label is made up of a verb\nand a set of nouns (e.g., the action ‚ÄòWash Plate‚Äô is made up of the verb ‚ÄòWash‚Äô\nand noun ‚ÄòPlate‚Äô). The noun classification task is very similar to the image\nclassification task. So, for our experiments, we focus on the\nverb classification in order to test our proposed method on diverse tasks. This\ndataset has 19 different verb classes (e.g., ‚ÄòOpen‚Äô, ‚ÄòWash‚Äô etc.). EGTEA Gaze+\n is inherently class-imbalanced. Fig. 1(a) shows\nthe data distribution of the\nEGTEA dataset. For our experiments, we use the split1 of the EGTEA dataset (8299\ntraining video clips and 2022 testing video clips). We create our validation set\nby using the training video clips from subjects P20 to P26, resulting in 1927\nvalidation video clips and 6372 training clips.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: used for\nexperiment is exactly same as the original CIFAR test set available and is a\nbalanced set. ImageNet-LT. We also conduct experiments on the long-tailed version of the original ImageNet-2012 [ref]3, as constructed in 0. It comprises of 115,800 images from 1000 categories, where the most frequent class has 1280 image samples and the least frequent class has only 5 images. The test set is\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
