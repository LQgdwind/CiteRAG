      "content": "Paper Title: Symbolic Distillation for Learned TCP Congestion Control\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCongestion control (CC) is fundamental to Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) communication. Congestion occurs when the data volume sent to a network reaches or exceeds its maximal capacity, in which case the network drops excess traffic, and the performance unavoidably declines. CC mitigates this problem by carefully adjusting the data transmission rate based on the inferred network capacities, aiming to send data as fast as possible without creating congestion. For instance, a classic and best-known strategy, Additive-Increase/Multiplicative-Decrease (AIMD) , gradually increases the sending rate when there is no congestion but exponentially reduces the rate when the network is congested. It ensures that TCP connections fairly share the network capacity in the converged state. Figure 1 shows an example where two TCP connections share a link between routers 1 and 2. When the shared link becomes a bottleneck, the CC algorithms running on sources A and B will alter the traffic rate based on the feedback to avoid congestion.\nEfficient CC algorithms have been the bedrock for network services such as DASH video streaming, VoIP (voice-over-IP), VR/AR games, and IoT (Internet of Things), which ride atop the TCP protocol. However, it is nontrivial to design a high-performance CC algorithm. Over the years, tens of CC proposals have been made, all with different metrics and strategies to infer and address congestion, and new designs are still emerging even today  .\nThere are two main challenges when designing a CC algorithm.\n 1 it needs to precisely infer whether the network is congested, and if so, how to adjust the sending rate, based on only partial or indirect observations. Note that CC runs on end hosts while congestion happens in the network, so CC algorithms cannot observe congestion directly. Instead, it can only rely on specific signals to infer the network status. For instance, TCP Cubic  uses packet loss as a congestion signal, and TCP Vegas  opts for delay increase.\n 2 CC algorithms operate within the OS kernel, where the computing and memory resources are limited, and they need to make real-time decisions to adjust the traffic rates frequently (e.g., per round-trip time). Therefore, the algorithm must be very efficient. Spending a long time to compute an action will significantly offset network performance. Over the long history of congestion control, most algorithms are implemented with manually-designed heuristics, including New Reno [ref]6 Vegas , Cubic , and BBR .\nIn TCP New Reno, for example, the sender doubles the number of transmitted packets every RTT before reaching a predefined threshold, after which it sends one more packet every RTT. If there is a timeout caused by packet loss, it halves the sending rate immediately. Unfortunately, manually crafted CCs have been shown to be sub-optimal and cannot support cases that escape the heuristics . For example, packet loss-based CCs like Cubic  cannot distinguish packet drops caused by congestion or non-congestion-related events . Researchers have tried to construct CC algorithms with machine learning approaches to address these limitations    0 1. The insight is that the CC decisions are dependent on traffic patterns and network circumstances, which can be exploited by deep reinforcement learning (RL) to learn a policy for each scenario. The learned policy can perform more flexible and accurate rate adjustments by discovering a mapping from experience, which can adapt to different network conditions and reduce manual tuning efforts. Most notably, Aurora , a deep RL framework for Performance-oriented Congestion Control (PCC), trains a well-established PPO 2 agent to suggest sending rates as actions by observing the network statistics such as latency ratio, send ratio, and sent latency inflation. It achieves competitive results on emulation environments Mininet 3 and Pantheon 4, demonstrating the potential of deep learning approaches to outperform algorithmic, hand-crafted ones.\nDespite its immense success, Aurora being a neural network based approach, is essentially a black-box to users or, in other words, lacks explicit declarative knowledge 5. They also require exponentially more computation resources than traditional hand-crafted algorithms such as the widely deployed TCP-CUBIC .\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: to compute an action will significantly offset network performance.
