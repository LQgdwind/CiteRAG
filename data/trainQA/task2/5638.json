      "content": "Paper Title: PlaNet-ClothPick: Effective Fabric Flattening Based on Latent Dynamic Planning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe benchmark PlaNet-ClothPick (Section 3.2) on fabric flattening with our reward function against SoTA policy learning deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, such as Curl-SAC , DrQ-SAC , Dreamer with normal and categorical distributions, and SLAC (Figure 4(a)), as well as ClothMaskPick-MPC (Section 3.2.3) planning on the LDMs from PlaNet, Dreamer with both variants and SLAC (Figure 4(b)). Note that the policy learning DRL baselines are trained with 500,000 update steps, and LDMs with 100,000 update steps — we employ ClothMaskPick-MPC to plan on these LDMs for consistency. Both sets of baselines learn from our special dataset with the proposed reward function and 64×64646464\\times 64 RGB images as input/output (I/O) observation by rescaling the values within the range of [-0.5, 0.5]. For controlling the variables while comparing against PlaNet-ClothPick, only the LDM baselines apply our data augmentation, as some of the policy learning methods come with their own. We also compare our method against the reported performance of the previous SoTA cloth-flattening robotic systems (Figure 5), such as VSF, VCD and VCD-GI, from Lin et al. (2022) [ref]14. In addition, we experiment on the heuristic method Wrinkle proposed by Sun et al. (2013) [ref]7 via integrating the corresponding implementation of Seita et al. (2020) [ref]8 to our environment. Note that this implementation approximates the detection of wrinkles from the true particle positions of the fabric rather than from the depth camera as in the original method; hence, it only works in simulation. Then, we examine the action inference time of all successful methods on a GeForce RTX 3090 GPU with the systems’ default setting. Our result shows that PlaNet-ClothPick outperforms all the general DRL algorithms in fabric flattening. It also statistically surpasses SoTA NI-against-step performance of VSF and VCD, reaching the same level of competence as VCD-GI. Moreover, our method exhibits around 10×10\\times faster action inference time and 10×10\\times fewer transitional model parameters compared to the three baselines. However, it does need 10×10\\times more data to train.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: come with their own.
