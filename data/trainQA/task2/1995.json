      "content": "Paper Title: Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction via Recursive Hierarchy-Interactive Attention and Entity-Order Perception\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs an important subtask of natural language processing (NLP), relation extraction (RE) task can be divided into sentence-level extraction   [ref]21, document-level extraction  , few-shot extraction , distantly supervised extraction [ref]8   , etc.\nHere we\nconcentrate on the sentence-level distantly supervised relation extraction (DSRE) scenario. For wrong-labeling problem, some people    relax the assumption behind DS and develop multi-instance learning (MIL) framework. After that, many techniques have been applied to DSRE. First, Zeng et al.  improve the sentence encoder with Piecewise Convolutional Neural Networks (PCNN), and identify the instance that most likely expresses the corresponding relation in sentence-bag level. Then, Lin et al.  design a selective attention among sentences/instances in the sentence level. Inspired by this work, attention models in different aspects are proposed, including word-level attention [ref]8, self-attention , bag-level attention  , feature-level attention , segment-level attention , etc. Besides, in order to pick out correct training instances to train the model efficiently, reinforcement learning is introduced into DSRE  . Since the attention mechanism is the most commonly used and successful, we also extend this technique. Relation hierarchies contain taxonomic structure of relations.\nAlthough some relations are long-tail, their sibling or ancestor relations are not. To handle long-tail relations, existing practices take relation hierarchies into account to share knowledge from higher-level data-sufficient relations to the lower-level long-tail ones, which is intended for long-tail relations to benefit from the training phase of sibling/ancestor relations, i.e., supervised signals come from the relation hierarchies.\nHan et al. [ref]13 get advanced performance by introducing a hierarchical attention scheme to derive extra bag-level features.\nZhang et al.  use TransE  and graph convolutional network  to obtain relation embeddings, and design a novel attention network along relation hierarchies. After that, Li et al.  augment the sentence representations with relation embeddings at each level of relation hierarchies to provide more clues to the classifier, while Yu et al.  exploit the relation hierarchies to design a top-down classification strategy. Recently, Peng et al.  explore the correlation of relations in the relation hierarchies from both global and local perspectives, aiming to make long-tail relations benefit from their sibling or ancestor relations.\nThe shortcoming of these models is that the relation levels are discrete, independent and do not affect each other during the calculation, i.e., the heuristic effect between relation levels is ignored. As stated in the Section 1, higher-level relations are instructive to lower-level ones when classifying.\nThis paper aims to address this flaw, and it is our contribution to differentiating from existing studies. Based on the models of Han et al. [ref]13 and Li et al. , although our model also generates extra bag-level features and relation-augmented sentence representations, we further design a recursive interaction method to pass the relation-related heuristic information along the relational hierarchical chains.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: As an important subtask of natural language processing (NLP), relation extraction (RE) task can be divided into sentence-level extraction   [ref]21, document-level extraction  , few-shot extraction , distantly supervised extraction [ref]8   , etc.\nHere we\nconcentrate on the sentence-level distantly supervised relation extraction (DSRE)\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
