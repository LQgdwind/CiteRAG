These methods leverage large amounts of data to learn behavior patterns and strategies, enabling agents to adapt more effectively across diverse tasks and environments. By automatically discovering and capturing strategic behaviors, learning methods empower agents to make adaptive decisions in complex environments. Furthermore, through iterative training, these methods can refine the generated BTs based on its actual effectiveness, ensuring better alignment with desired goals and requirements. Notable examples of these methods include RL-based approaches  [ref]25, evolution-based techniques  , and demonstration-based methods  . RL-Based BT Generation.\nReinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in the generation of BTs. The process entails defining state and action spaces, creating reward functions [ref]25, establishing RL models [ref]27, and determining appropriate representations for BTs . Notably, RL has demonstrated its capability to learn both the structure and parameters of BTs, making them applicable in dynamic settings . Moreover, hierarchical RL techniques have been employed to decompose tasks into subtasks, each with its localized strategy . Evolution-based BT Generation.\nEvolution-based methods, centered around the genetic algorithm, play a crucial role in BT generation. These methods emulate biological evolution by employing selection, crossover, and mutation processes to optimize BTs based on fitness evaluation outcomes [ref]70. In practical implementation, populations are initialized, renewed, and termination criteria are established . Genetic programming is one approach used for BT generation, which involves defining encoding methods . Another approach is grammar evolution, where grammatical rules are specified to constrain the search space of evolutionary algorithms, simplifying problem-solving .\n. Genetic programming has proven effective in handling highly uncertain environments during BT generation , while grammar evolution aids in constraining the search space and streamlining the evolutionary process . Demonstration-Based BT Generation.\nLearning from demonstrations allows the acquisition of complex, multi-step tasks through observation of expert-provided examples . Such a method captures the decision-making pathways and rule sets within these demonstrations, extracting the underlying structures and regulations to form BTs. This approach has enabled the generation of BTs by observing human behaviors  and has led to the development of semi-automatic optimization methods for adjusting expert-constructed BTs .\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: methods can refine the generated BTs based on its actual effectiveness, ensuring better alignment with desired goals and requirements.
