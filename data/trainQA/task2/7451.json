      "content": "Paper Title: A Systematic Review of Data-to-Text NLG.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the field of data-to-text generation, various methodologies have been explored, including templates, statistical models, and neural network-based generation models. A significant number of studies selected for this systematic review opted for neural network models, ranging from basic sequence-to-sequence models  to advanced designs such as transformers  and large pretrained language models. Several studies have introduced refinements to these models to enhance their performance and set new benchmarks. Notably, research conducted by 27 studies, integrated a copy mechanism that uses probabilistic strategies to determine when and which tokens should be directly copied from the reference data. This copy model is particularly useful for ensuring that all data values appear in the generated text . Building on this innovation, subsequent investigations by five (5) studies devised fused attention [ref]26 and hierarchical attention , improving decoder focus on input tokens and enhancing overall generation quality. However, some of these studies employed recurrent neural networks with static embeddings, which have shown suboptimal performance across various application domains such as in AMR-to-text [ref]65 [ref]2, MR-to-text , table-to-text [ref]26 and in data-to-text . Another line of research has focused on retaining the graph structure of the data using graph encoders [ref]65 in graph neural network (GNN). Originally, graph data were linearized into sequences to accommodate sequence-to-sequence models. However, graph encoding has emerged as a promising method in data-to-text generation, especially in AMR-to-text generation. Graph encoders offer improvements over basic sequence-to-sequence models by inherently learning the graph structure and existing relations in the encoder and using an ordinary decoder to generate desired texts. Ribeiro et al.  leveraged dual graph representations in AMR-to-text generation, effectively encoding divergent but complementary perspectives of the structural information in the AMR graph by simultaneously learning top-down and bottom-up node representations . The study by Zhao et al.  introduced DUALENC, a dual encoding model that addresses the structural gap in data-to-text generation by incorporating both graph and linear structures. This approach significantly improves text quality compared to single-encoder models, especially for structured inputs like trees or graphs. The DUALENC model integrates Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) encoders with an intermediate content planning stage. This combination allows the model to capture structural information and enhance the compatibility between input and output sequences . Another research Li et al.  introduces a hierarchical encoder equipped with a reasoning module for graph-based reasoning, which enhances the ability to capture various relations between records in different dimensions. This research also introduces auxiliary supervision tasks, including number ranking and importance ranking, to further improve the model’s ability to handle different record relations . These advancements contribute significantly to the field of GNNs. Eighteen (18) papers were found to have used this method to improve on existing baselines. To address the limitations of static embedding models, some research efforts have embraced transformer models such as RNN transformers  , BERT, T5, BART, XLM , and GPT-2 for data-to-text generation tasks. These transformer-based models incorporate contextualized embeddings and use positional encoding due to their non-recurrent nature. They are trained on a large corpus of online curated texts and seem to perform well across several domains after fine-tuning. A total of 38 studies incorporated transformer models into their research, as detailed in Table 5.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: copy model is particularly useful for ensuring that all data values appear in the generated text .
