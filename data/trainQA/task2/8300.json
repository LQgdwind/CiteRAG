      "content": "Paper Title: Guidelines for Submission to HPCA 2025\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBuilding a secure oblivious RAM (ORAM) design for cloud workloads is critical because it ensures the confidentiality of accessing sensitive data.\nORAMs are designed to offer a secure memory access pattern, concealing the information being accessed and safeguarding the privacy of sensitive data [ref]16.\nThis is particularly important in the context of modern AI workloads (e.g., recommendation and large language models), where the memory access pattern can reveal sensitive prior product selections, such as user preferences or prompts to the language model.\nORAM can protect against these potential vulnerabilities by obfuscating the access pattern to the memory, preventing an attacker from inferring any useful information about where the data is being accessed. However, the obfuscation of the memory access patterns using ORAM incurs a significant performance overhead.\nFor example, to hide memory access in a 16GB protected memory space, classical ORAM implementations such as PathORAM  and RingORAM  on average convert a single access to 576 and 470 accesses, respectively.\nThis is because the critical metadata structure to protect the memory space PosMap is too large to fit on-chip.\nAddressing this issue necessitates a hierarchical ORAM design, often involving three levels, to establish a mapping between the physical and ORAM addresses .\nTherefore, optimizing the performance of ORAM implementations is crucial for practicality. Prior works     present ways to optimize the performance of ORAM by prefetching and eliminating as many ORAM requests as possible.\nHowever, we find two limitations of these works.\nFirst, the benefit of these designs is highly sensitive to the application behavior, benefiting workloads with high spatial locality.\nThey fall short in optimizing other workloads with low data locality.\nSecond, prefetching-based optimizations modify the original PathORAM algorithm, which selects ORAM leaves independently and uniformly at random.\nThese designs map consecutive physical addresses in the original memory space to the same leaf in the ORAM tree.\nThis practice significantly increases the ORAM stash pressure and introduces background evictions, ultimately resulting in diminishing returns and a capped speedup at 3.2×\\times even with a synthetic trace exhibiting perfect locality.\n This paper presents Palermo—a protocol-hardware co-design to improve ORAM performance.\nThe design objective of Palermo is to enhance performance without compromising prior ORAM security guarantees .\nUsing the performance analysis of RingORAM , we discover that the average memory bandwidth utilization of executing RingORAM on the tested benchmarks is less than 30%.\nConsidering the memory-intensive nature of ORAM, this is surprising; our further analysis of reduced bandwidth utilization reveals that enforced dependencies in the protocol limit memory-level parallelism. To this end, we design Palermo that re-architects the ORAM protocol, and designs a novel hardware ORAM controller architecture to fully unlock the potential of our protocol.\nThe protocol is designed to improve the concurrency in serving ORAM requests.\nIn particular, the Palermo protocol introduces intra- and inter-request parallelism to increase memory bandwidth utilization.\nIntra-request parallelism involves overlapping memory requests related to different steps in accessing various hierarchical levels of ORAM.\nInter-request parallelism entails concurrent processing of memory requests across distinct ORAM requests.\nWhile overlapping memory requests, the Palermo protocol identifies and enforces minimal dependencies,\nensuring a consistent view of the ORAM tree after each address remapping.\n To support the proposed protocol, we also present the design of an ORAM controller.\nThe hardware architecture consists of on-chip memory structures for stash, position map, tree-top cache 0, and a mesh of Processing Engines (PEs) that enable concurrent serving of ORAM memory requests.\nWe present both qualitative and quantitative security analyses of Palermo to assess the uniform randomness of the attacker’s view of the DRAM traffic and the isolation of each LLC miss latency, even when concurrently serving multiple ORAM memory requests at the ORAM controller.\n To demonstrate the effectiveness of Palermo, we use a wide range of workloads including SPEC17 , graph analytics  1, deep learning  [ref]18 7, and key-value accesses 3.\nPalermo outperforms PathORAM  and RingORAM  by 2.4×\\times and 2.2×\\times, on average.\nBorrowing ideas from prior prefetching works   , we show that Palermo can further improve this performance gain by 3.1×\\times and 2.8×\\times, respectively.\nWe also show improvements against PageORAM 8, PrORAM , and IR-ORAM  while upholding the same security level as in these works.\nThe performance improvements are attributed to improved memory bandwidth utilization from 21% in the RingORAM baseline to 59% in Palermo.\nOur post-synthesis RTL results reveal that Palermo only consumes 5.78mm2 silicon area (less than 2% in Intel 12th Gen CPU after technology scaling , providing a low-complexity practical solution) and 2.14W.\nThe key contributions of this work are as follows. Performance analysis of prior ORAM implementations revealing further optimization opportunities. Design of a new ORAM protocol that enables overlapping memory requests within the same ORAM request and between multiple ORAM requests. Design of the ORAM controller architecture to apply the minimal required protocol synchronization and improve memory-level parallelism. Palermo: end-to-end protocol-hardware co-design that improves an average performance of RingORAM by 2.8×\\times.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: the confidentiality of accessing sensitive data.\nORAMs are designed to offer a secure memory access pattern, concealing the information being accessed and safeguarding the privacy of sensitive data [ref]16.\nThis is particularly important in the context of modern AI workloads (e.g., recommendation and large language models), where the memory access pattern can reveal sensitive prior product\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
