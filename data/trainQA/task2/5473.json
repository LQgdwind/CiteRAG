      "content": "Paper Title: Diversity is Definitely Needed: Improving Model-Agnostic Zero-shot Classification via Stable Diffusion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nData is a critical element for the successful training of deep learning models  . However, acquiring and curating a high-quality dataset can be challenging, time-consuming, and expensive  . This is especially true for inherently expensive domains, such as remote sensing where the creation of a dataset requires the use of satellites 2. The zero-shot learning tackles the data issue by training a model using no data from the downstream task 7. Generally, zero-shot learning models use specialised architecture   5   or learn auxiliary features to achieve the objective . This limits the array of potential model architectures. On the other hand, the Model-Agnostic Zero-Shot Learning problem aims to address this issue by considering methods that allow any model architecture to perform the zero-shot learning task. In this work, we specifically investigate image classification tasks, and as such, refer to the problem domain as Model-Agnostic Zero-Shot Classification (MA-ZSC). Solving the MA-ZSC problem alleviates the previously mentioned problems of constructing a high-quality dataset without the need for specialised architecture or techniques applied to the model. One avenue to address the MA-ZSC problem is by generating a synthetic dataset which is then used to train a classification model. A Recent work [ref]8 explored the use of generated synthetic images powered by the GLIDE diffusion model  primarily for improving the zero-shot and few-shot performance of CLIP ; however, they briefly explore training classification models, finding synthetic images to be inferior compared to real images. This is thought to be due to a domain gap between real and synthetic images [ref]8. We revisit the issue and find it possible to improve the MA-ZSC performance by increasing the diversity of the images in the generated datasets. Increasing diversity in training data has been utilised in various domains, such as computer vision domains 1 and robotics 3. For instance, in domain randomisation methods in the robotics domain 3, increasing diversity in the training data would help to reduce the ’reality gap’ that separates simulated robotics from experiments on hardware. With enough variability in the simulator, the real world may appear to the model as just another variation. Increasing training data variability is also a common practice in training classification models by employing data augmentation methods 0. The variability of the training data is increased by simply performing data augmentation operations such as flipping, and rotations. Figure 1 presents our overall method, and we present our results as follows. Using the latent diffusion model, Stable Diffusion [ref]27, we start by generating baseline synthetic datasets using the prompt “an image of a {class}” for CIFAR10 , CIFAR100  and EuroSAT , which is particularly difficult for zero-shot classification due to its satellite image domain, as noted in . For each dataset, {class} is replaced iteratively with the class labels to generate images belonging to that class. We then train a ResNet50 model  on these datasets and obtain a zero-shot top-1 accuracy of 60.1%, 29.72% and 36.18% respectively. For reference, the CLIP zero-shot performance with a ResNet50 backbone achieves 75.6%, 41.6%, 41.1%. In order to improve the diversity of images in the generated dataset we propose a set of modifications to the text-to-image generation process, which we refer to as our bag of tricks. Each trick only improves image diversity, with no mitigation of the image domain. In fact, one of our tricks (multi-domain) specifically generates out-of-domain examples. After applying the proposed bag of tricks and finding the best tricks for each dataset, we obtain top-1 zero-shot classification accuracy of 81% (↑↑\\uparrow20.5) on CIFAR10, 45.63% (↑↑\\uparrow15.91) on CIFAR100 and 42.5% (↑↑\\uparrow6.41) on EuroSAT. Surprisingly, these results surpass the performance of CLIP-ResNet50 . We list our contributions as follows: Equipped with insights found in our work, we demonstrate the feasibility of addressing the MA-ZSC problem by training classification models on a high-quality Stable Diffusion [ref]27 generated synthetic dataset. We show that improving the diversity of images in a generated synthetic dataset improves the MA-ZSC performance. We provide a bag of tricks for improving diversity during latent diffusion image generation. We continue our paper as follows. In Section 2, we provide a summary of previous works related to zero-shot learning, image generation, and training with synthetic data. We then describe the problem of model-agnostic zero-shot classification, and introduce our solution in Section 3, before describing the process of how latent diffusion models generate images in Section 4. In Section 4.2, We investigate how we can improve the quality of our generated synthetic datasets. Following this, we propose our bag of tricks to improve the diversity of our generated synthetic datasets in Section 4.3. Finally, we present our experimental results on CIFAR10 , CIFAR100, and EuroSAT  in Section 5, demonstrating the impact of our proposed bag of tricks on zero-shot performance across five classification models.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: architecture or techniques applied to the model.
