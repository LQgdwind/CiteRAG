      "content": "Paper Title: Hidden Biases of End-to-End Driving Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMethods:  This section demonstrates the advantages of TF++ over several state-of-the-art models, which we list below, starting with the most recent.\n(1) Interfuser [ref]35 processes multiple cameras and a BEV LiDAR by encoding each of them individually with a CNN. The resulting feature grids are fed into a transformer and decoded into perception outputs and the path to follow. The network does not predict longitudinal controls. Instead, it uses the BEV bounding boxes and a simple motion forecast (extrapolating historical dynamics) and linearly optimizes for the target speed using heuristically chosen objectives.\n(2) Perception PlanT  is a transformer based method trained in two independent stages that uses BEV bounding boxes as an intermediate representation. Its perception is based on TransFuser, and its planner outputs waypoints.\n(3) TCP [ref]41 is a camera-only model with two output representations: waypoints and controls. During test time, it ensembles the two outputs together with a weighted average that changes based on whether the vehicle is turning.\n(4) TransFuser  fuses perspective cameras with a BEV LiDAR by processing them with individual CNNs and exchanging features using transformers. It uses global average pooling and waypoint outputs, as described in Section 3.\n(5) LAV [ref]9 processes cameras and LiDAR point clouds into an intermediate BEV representation. It trains a planner on this representation that predicts waypoints for the ego vehicle with a NC conditioned GRU followed by a TP conditioned refinement GRU. During training, the planner is also tasked to predict the trajectory of other surrounding vehicles to increase the number of labels. The authors release two versions of this method, which we call LAV v1 and LAV v2.\n(6) WOR  is an IL method for which the labels are enriched using a reward function to provide dense supervision for all possible actions. Unlike the other baselines, it is conditioned with the NC and does not utilize the TP. WOR is the best NC conditioned baseline that is publicly available. Benchmarks:  We use two benchmarks to evaluate on seen and unseen towns, with scenarios taken from  (type 1,3,4,7,8,9 and 10). Table 6 compares the performance of systems on the Longest6 benchmark  which consists of 36 routes in training towns 01 to 06. On Longest6, models trained on any data can be evaluated, so we compare against the author-provided models or directly report numbers from the respective papers. The mean and std of three evaluations is reported. For TF++ we train 3 models and report the average result. Longest6 has the advantage that it evaluates in dense traffic and has diverse towns and routes. The drawbacks are that it does not penalize stop sign infractions or measure generalization to new towns. Therefore, we additionally compare performance on validation towns using the LAV [ref]9 routes in Table 7. These are 4 routes with 4 weathers (16 combined) in Town 02 and 05, which are withheld during training. We re-train methods with the dataset from the corresponding paper 3 times and evaluate each seed 3 times. Reported results are the mean of all runs and the std between the training seeds. We compare against the reported SotA TCP and our reproduced TransFuser baseline on this benchmark and provide additional baselines in the supplementary. Dataset:  For TF++ we collect data on the same training routes as in  with an improved expert labeling algorithm (described in the supplementary material). We repeat this 3 times on the same routes with different traffic, as in . For validation, we withhold Town 02 and 05 during training, else we train on all towns. In total, we train with 750k frames (550k when withholding Town 02 and 05). Results:  We start with the results in training towns (Table 6). The best NC conditioned method, WOR, has significantly lower RC than all TP conditioned systems (22 lower than LAV v1). In particular, the route deviations (Dev) are 10 times higher. Current TP conditioned SotA methods achieve (close to) 0 route deviations with driving scores in the range of 47 DS to 58 DS. TF++ outperforms all baselines on Longest6, showing a 19% relative improvement over the previous SotA Perception PlanT. TF++ achieves close to expert-level performance on all infractions except for vehicle collisions (Veh). On the validation towns (Table 7) TF++ outperforms our reproduced TransFuser by 31 DS improving all metrics, particularly environmental collisions (Stat). It improves the prior SotA result TCP by 21%. Runtime:  Table 8 compares the runtime of TF++ and TransFuser which have the same sensor setup. TF++ yields a large DS improvement while being only 14% slower.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: Methods:  This section demonstrates the advantages of TF++ over several state-of-the-art models, which we list below, starting with the most recent.\n(1) Interfuser [ref]35 processes multiple cameras and a BEV LiDAR by encoding each of them individually with a CNN.
