Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Style-Preserving Lip Sync via Audio-Aware Style Reference\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this work, we compare the proposed method with several representative state-of-the-art (SOTA) subject-generic approaches in audio-driven talking face video generation, including StyleTalk [ref]6, DiffTalk [ref]10, PD-FGC , IP-LAP [ref]8, PC-AVS , and Wav2Lip .\nStyleTalk [ref]6 is a representative subject-generic method capable of modeling speaking style.\nHowever, the code released for StyleTalk is incomplete and unable to generate results, lacking the phoneme label extraction and training code.\nConsequently, we made some minor modifications to its code for comparison purposes. The modified version utilizes DeepSpeech  audio features instead of phoneme labels and is trained using the same objectives as ours. Additionally, StyleTalk’s image rendering network can only accept a reference facial image to provide subject appearance information, whereas other comparison methods input more conditions, such as the upper-half face at the current time step. For a fair comparison, we replaced StyleTalk’s image renderer with our diffusion rendering model to generate results. We only compare with StyleTalk in terms of lip sync quality.\nThe methods including DiffTalk[ref]10, IP-LAP [ref]8, Wav2Lip, and Ours all synthesize talking face videos through inpainting the lower half of the face influenced by the input audio and reference facial image.\nTherefore, for quantitative comparison, the lower half of the face in the input video is masked and then these methods reconstruct the masked area.\nThe input video before masking serves as the ground truth for metric computation.\nWe train DiffTalk [ref]10 using the released official code until convergence, but it generates temporally unstable lip motion.\nIt relies on additional frame-interpolation techniques to smooth the results, affecting the comparison fairness. Therefore, the frame-interpolation post-processing was not utilized for a fair comparison.\nPC-AVS  utilizes a pose source video, an audio input, and a reference facial image to synthesize a talking face video. For a fair comparison, we replace its pose source video with the ground-truth video.\nPD-FGC   inputs a pose source video, an expression source video, an eye blink source video, audio, and a reference facial image to synthesize a talking face video. For a fair comparison, we replace its pose source, expression source, and eye blink source videos with the ground-truth video.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: In this work, we compare the proposed method with several representative state-of-the-art (SOTA) subject-generic approaches in audio-driven talking face video generation, including StyleTalk [ref]6, DiffTalk [ref]10, PD-FGC , IP-LAP [ref]8, PC-AVS , and Wav2Lip .\nStyleTalk [ref]6 is a representative subject-generic method capable of modeling speaking style.\nHowever, the code released for\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
