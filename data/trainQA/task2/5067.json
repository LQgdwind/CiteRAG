This concept was first proposed by Szegedy et al. . With the increasing attention paid by researchers to the explainability of deep learning, adversarial attacks and defense have become research hotspots in recent years   . In graph neural network, an attacker can perform adversarial attacks on a graph by perturbing the nodes, edges, and properties of nodes    . In the real world, modifying the edges or attributes of an existing graph is difficult because of the lack of access to the database that stores graph data [ref]32. Node injection attacks can achieve adversarial attacks by injecting malicious nodes without modifying the existing graph [ref]32  [ref]34 [ref]35. In particular, the node injection poisoning attack (NIPA) proposed by Sun et al. [ref]32 uses a hierarchical Q-learning network to sequentially generate edges and labels of malicious nodes. However, this method cannot generate the attributes of the injected nodes, which are extremely important for evading attacks from malicious nodes, thus limiting further performance improvements. Wang et al. [ref]34 proposed an approximate closed-form attack solution for graph convolutional networks (GCNs) using the approximate fast gradient sign method (AFGSM), this method cannot be applied to all GCNs. Because both NIPA and AFGSM are proposed in poison settings, a defense model needs to be retrained for each attack. Unlike such methods, Zhou et al. [ref]35 proposed a topological defective graph injection attachment (TDGIA) method. This method can attack large-scale graphs that the NIPA cannot handle. Chen et al.  proved that a node injection attack is more harmful than a graph modification attack owing to its high flexibility. To address the challenge of cross-modal matching caused by the diversity of text and pedestrian images, we proposed an adversarial attack and defense method inspired by recent advances in adversarial attacks on graphs [ref]32  [ref]34 [ref]35. This approach treats the diversity of sentences and images as a perturbation that causes changes in the features of text and its corresponding image, and designs an adversarial attack on a graph to simulate this perturbation. Owing to this design, the robustness of the matching model to the diversity of text and the corresponding image was improved. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to introduce the concept of adversarial attack and defense to person text image matching. This method can realize adversarial training of a model without generating adversarial samples; therefore, it is more practical.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: nodes, edges, and properties of nodes    .
