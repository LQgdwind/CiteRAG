      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning for the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe first review the literature on utilizing ML to solve CO, focusing on developing primal heuristics. Readers are referred to  for a more comprehensive modern survey. The application of neural network (NN) to solving CO dates back to the paper by Hopfield and Tank .\nThey define an array representation for TSP solutions.\nIn an nùëõn-city TSP instance, each city iùëñi is associated with an nùëõn-dimensional array VisubscriptùëâùëñV_{i} whose jt‚Äãhsuperscriptùëóùë°‚Ñéj^{th} entry vi,jsubscriptùë£ùëñùëóv_{i,j} takes a value of 111 if city iùëñi is the jt‚Äãhsuperscriptùëóùë°‚Ñéj^{th} city along the route and takes 00 otherwise.\nAll the city arrays form an n√ónùëõùëõn\\times n array modeled by n2superscriptùëõ2n^{2} neurons.\nSome motion equations were constructed to describe the time evolution of the circuit in the analogy network comprised of the neurons.\nThe circuit finally converge to a ‚Äúlow-energy‚Äù state favoring high quality feasible solutions to the TSP.\nAlthough the NN proposed in  does not have a learning process, and its performance heavily relies on the choice of model parameters which hinders its scalability and the generalization capability , it stimulated subsequent research efforts on applying NN to solve CO. One promising direction is to solve CO by learning a value function to evaluate each possible adjustment in the current solution or action for constructing solutions.\nThe value function can then be utilized by search algorithms to find good solutions to the target problem.\nFor example, for a job-scheduling problem of NASA, Zhang et al.  parameterize such a value function as an NN that intakes some hand-designed features of the current schedule and outputs the ‚Äúvalue‚Äù of the possible adjustments.\nFor CO that is defined on a graph, hand designed features could be replaced by graph embedding networks that synthesize the structure as well as local and global information of the graph.\nKhalil et al. [ref]6 use fitted-Q learning to train a graph embedding network (DQN) for action evaluation based on which they greedily decode solutions to target problems including TSP, MVC and MAXCUT.\nOther graph embedding examples could be seen in  [ref]12 [ref]13, though the embedded graph vectors in [ref]12 and [ref]13 are fed to NN to predict problem-specific values instead of evaluating actions. While  [ref]6 mainly focus on how to construct NN to estimate values of actions, there are some other research concentrating on the decoding process based on the value function.\nFor the maximum independent set problem, Li et al.  argue that the naive decoding method, i.e. to greedily select the vertex with the highest value, might lead to poor results because there might exist many optimal solutions and each vertex could participate in some of them.\nTo address the issue, they propose a tree search paradigm supported by the value function enabling the algorithm to explore a diverse set of solutions.\nA graph reduction and a local search component were incorporated to enhance solution efficiency and quality.\nTo further accelerate the search process, Mittal et al.  propose a graph convolution network to prune poor vertices and learn the embeddings of good vertices which are then fed to the model of Li et al.  to produce solution set.\nMoreover, Barrett et al.  proposed the exploratory DQN allowing the algorithm to revise the actions it previously made so as to more comprehensively explore the solution space. There is another group of research on applying policy-based approaches, which learn policies to directly determine the next action given a system state, to solve CO.\nOne good example is the pointer network (PN) developed by Vinyals et al.  for CO, such as TSP and VRP, whose solutions are permutations of the given vertices.\nInspired by the sequence-to-sequence learning  originally proposed for machine translation, the PN intakes the given vertices and predict a permutation of them.\nThe PN is trained in a supervised manner with instance-solution pairs generated by an approximate solver.\nTo generalize the PN to CO for which instance-solution pairs are difficult to obtain, Bello et al.  used a policy gradient method to train the PN.\nThe PN is able to efficietly find close-to-optimal solutions to TSP instances with up to 100100100 vertices.\nNazari et al.  further generalized this method to the VRP whose vertex states change during the decoding process.\nConsidering that the order of the vertices does not provide any additional information for a VRP solver, they replace the RNN encoder in the PN with element-wise projections of vertex information which accelerates the model implementation.\nOn the other hand, Kool et al.  propose a multi-head attention model for the TSP and VRP.\nThe model is trained using policy gradient with roll-out baseline which is easier to implement in practice than the A3C method utilized by . Although value-based methods perform well on various CO problems, they do not directly apply to EVRPTW since some vertices (stations and the depot) could appear more than once in a solution.\nGiven the similarity between the VRP and the EVRPTW, the policy-based framework proposed by Nazari et al.  is a better fit to the EVRPTW, yet global information of the system, which is very important for solving EVRPTW, should also be taken into consideration.\nHence, our proposed model is based on the framework of  and\nincorporates a graph embedding component proposed by [ref]6 to synthesize the local and global information of the network. This research is also related to the stream of literature on applying reinforcement learning in intelligent transportation system.\nWith a very similar idea, Yu et al.  incorporate the Structure2Vec tool  with PN  to develop a distributed system for solving an online autonomous vehicle routing problem.\nZhao et al.  extend the work of  to VRPTW by revising the masking scheme and adding a local search phase to further improve the solution provided by the attention model.\nIn , Shi et al. propose an RL framework for ride-hailing service provision in a local community, while in , Gao et al. employ the idea of RL to build a data-driven cruise control algorithm for the bus transit line connecting New Jersey and Manhattan, New York.\nOur proposed approach differs from them in terms of model architecture, training method as well as problem settings.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: CO that is defined on a graph, hand designed features could be replaced by graph embedding networks that synthesize the structure as well as local and global information of the graph.\nKhalil et al.
