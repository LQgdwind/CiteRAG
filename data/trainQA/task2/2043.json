      "content": "Paper Title: Polygonal Point Set Tracking\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nObject mask tracking in a video is one of the most frequently required tasks in visual effects (VFX). However, the task (i.e. rotoscoping) is so painstaking and time-consuming that even a highly-skilled designer processes only a dozen frames on average per day 8.\nTherefore, propagating object mask information through subsequent frames becomes a critical problem to reduce human labor for rotoscoping.\nPropagation methods are categorized into four groups based on object representations: point, region, contour, and polygonal point set (Figure 2). Each representation carries different amount of information. Patch tracking [ref]14    denotes a target object as point representation and tracks a target point over frames by matching the patch around the point.\nThe tracking enables visual effects that require positional information such as motion tracking and texture mapping.\nThese applications often require multiple patch tracking to compute point-to-point information.\nHowever, conducting each patch tracking independently ignores strong correlations between target points, thus multiple patch tracking are susceptible to a drift problem and are not suitable for mask propagation. Meanwhile, video object segmentation (VOS)       and contour tracking     propagate target object information over subsequent frames by representing the target as a region (i.e. mask) and a contour respectively.\nThese representations can describe only the target area without any pixel correspondences, therefore they are not applicable to complex VFX scenarios that require point-to-point relation information (e.g., Figure 1). On the other hand, polygonal point set tracking combines the positional information with the target region.\nThe polygonal point set is defined as a subset of contour points that represent an object in a polygonal shape. By tracking the point set, we can get both the object contour and the point-to-point matching information. Previous works in this category  8   focus on making the user interaction easier for highly customizable results rather than taking the point-to-point matching (or tracking) into account.\nTherefore, they assume heuristic shape priors of an object and often exhibit propagation failures for challenging object motions. In this paper, we aim to track all points directly through a learning-based approach without assuming a heuristic shape prior and propose a novel point set tracking method.\nAccording to the hypothesis that the target object state in adjacent frames is highly correlated, we train a network to learn progressive alignment of a point set between frames.\nWe first match the point set globally using a simple rigid transformation.\nThen, we further tune each point position in a coarse to fine manner using a local alignment module.\nOur local alignment module (LAM) adopts recurrent neural networks (RNN) to take into account the temporal history of each point and also uses multi-head attention (MHA) modules for non-local communication among the points.\nIn addition, we regularize the alignments to avoid drifting and honor the original topology of a target polygon in challenging situations.\n We introduce a new learning strategy to train our model without fully annotated data.\nCurrently available VOS datasets [ref]9  only contain region information (i.e. masks), thus it cannot be directly applied to our point correspondence learning.\nTo overcome the data issue, we propose an unsupervised learning method based on cyclic consistency between predicted frames  .\nWe also obtain the supervision for point set tracking by synthesizing data from image instance segmentation data.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on learning-based point set tracking that considers the point correspondence. Figure 1 shows an example application that utilizes our network results.\nIn this example, to exaggerate the upper body, the same effect is applied to the target across the entire frame, even if the user edits the points in the set individually only in the first frame. Popular evaluation datasets for video object segmentation are not suitable for evaluating point-set tracking as they only provide mask annotations [ref]9  7 .\nWhile CPC  provides annotations of object contours, it is also not sufficient for the evaluation as there is no point correspondence annotation.\nTo this end, we introduce an evaluation dataset for polygonal point set tracking, consisting of 30 sequences.\nTo build the dataset, named PoST, we augment video clips from existing VOS datasets with additional point set annotations with correspondence.\nWe evaluate our method on PoST and the existing VOS datasets [ref]9 , and we show that our method outperforms competing methods with a large margin. Our contributions are summarized as follows:\n We propose a novel learning-based method for polygonal point set tracking with point correspondence for the first time. We design a local alignment module for point tracking with taking temporal history and communication with other points into account. We present a learning strategy to train a deep network for point set tracking using unsupervised learning and synthesized data. We introduce a new dataset for evaluating performance of point set tracking.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: categorized into four groups based on object representations: point, region, contour, and polygonal point set (Figure 2).
