      "content": "Paper Title: From SLAM to Situational Awareness: Challenges and Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThese algorithms utilize a single sensor source to extract useful environmental information. The two major sensor modalities used in robotics are vision-based sensors and range-based sensors for the rich and plentiful amount of information in their scene observations. Vision-based comprehension started with the early works of Viola and Jones  presenting an object-based detector for face detection using Haar-like features and Adaboost feature classification.\nFollowing works for visual detection and classification tasks such as      utilized well-known image features, e.g.,  Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) ,  Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) ,  Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) , along with  Support Vector Machines (SVM)-based classifiers .\nThe mentioned methods focused on extracting only a handful of useful information from the environment, such as pedestrians, cars, and bicycles, showing degraded performance in difficult lighting conditions and occlusions. With the establishment of DL in computer vision and robotic image processing, recent algorithms in the literature robustly extract the scene information utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks in the presence of different lighting conditions and occlusions.\nIn computer vision, different types of DL-based methods exist based on the type of extracted scene information.\nAlgorithms such as Mask-RCNN [ref]31, RetinaNet [ref]32, TensorMask , TridentNet , and Yolo  perform detection and classification of several object instances, they either provide a bounding box around the object or perform a pixel-wise segmentation for each object instances.\nOther algorithms such as      perform dense semantic segmentation, being able to extract all relevant information from the scene.\nAdditionally,   aim to detect and categorize all object instances in an image through panoptic segmentation, regardless of their size or position, while still maintaining a semantic understanding of the scene.\nThis task is particularly challenging because it requires integrating pixel-level semantics and instance-level information. 2D scene graphs   could then connect the semantic elements detected by panoptic segmentation in a knowledge graph that let reason about relationships. Moreover, this knowledge graph facilitates inferring single behaviors and interactions among the participants in a scene, animate or inanimate . To overcome the limitations of the visible spectrum in the absence of light, thermal infrared sensors have been researched to augment situational comprehension.\nFor instance, one of the earlier methods  finds humans in nighttime images by extracting thermal shape descriptors that are then processed by Adaboost to identify positive detection.\nIn contrast, newer methods   utilize deep CNNs on thermal images for identifying different objects in the scene, such as humans, bikes, and cars.\nThough research in the field of event-based cameras for scene understanding is not yet broad, some works such as  present an approach for dynamic object detection and tracking using the event streams, whereas  present an asynchronous CNN for detecting and classifying objects in real-time.\nEv-SegNet [ref]51 is an approach that introduced one of the first semantic segmentation pipelines based on event-only information.

classification.\nHowever, authors in  utilize range information to identify terrain around the robot and objects and use SVMs to classify each category.\nNowadays, deep learning is also playing a fundamental role in scene understanding using range information.\nSome techniques utilize CNNs for analyzing range measurements translated into camera frames by projecting the 3D points onto an abstract image plane.\nFor example, Rangenet++ , , SqueezeSeg , and SqueezeSegv2  project the 3D point-cloud information onto 2D range based images for performing the scene understanding tasks.\nThe methods mentioned above argue that CNN-based algorithms can be directly applied to range images without using expensive 3D convolution operators for point cloud data.\nOthers apply CNNs directly on the point cloud information for maximizing the preservation of spatial information.\nApproaches such as PointNet , PointNet++ , TangentConvolutions , DOPS , and RandLA-Net , perform convolutions directly over the 3D point cloud data in order to semantically label the point cloud measurements.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: presence of different lighting conditions and occlusions.\nIn computer vision, different types of DL-based methods exist based on the type of extracted scene information.\nAlgorithms such as Mask-RCNN [ref]31,
