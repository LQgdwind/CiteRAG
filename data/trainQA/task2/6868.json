      "content": "Paper Title: BaDExpert: Extracting Backdoor Functionality for Accurate Backdoor Input Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur primary experiment focuses on two widely benchmarked image datasets in backdoor literature, CIFAR10  (Sec 4.2) and GTSRB  (deferred to Appendix C.1). We demonstrate the equivalently successful effectiveness of BaDExpert on a representative large scale dataset, 1000-class ImageNet , in Sec 4.3, to further validate our method’s scalability. We evaluate BaDExpert across various model architectures. Specifically, we adopt the commonly studied ResNet18 [ref]21 through our primary experiment, and validate in Sec 4.3 the effectiveness of BaDExpert on other architectures (VGG [ref]22, MobileNetV2 , and ViT ). We evaluate BaDExpert against 12 state-of-the-art backdoor attacks in our primary experiment, with 9 types initiated during the development stage and the remaining 3 post-development.\nIn the realm of development-stage attacks, we explore 1) classical static-trigger dirty-label attacks such as BadNet , Blend 5, and Trojan ; 2) clean-label attacks including CL  and SIG ; 3) input-specific-trigger attacks like Dynamic , ISSBA , WaNet 6, and BPP .\nAs for post-development attacks, our evaluation considers: 1) direct finetuning of the developed vanilla model on a blending poisoned dataset (FT); 2) trojanning attacks (TrojanNN ); 3) subnet-replacement attacks (SRA ).\nMoreover, in Sec 4.4, we study 6 existing adaptive attacks and a novel tailored adaptive attack against BaDExpert. Our attack configurations largely adhere to the methodologies described in their original papers. Readers interested in the detailed configurations can refer to the Appendix A.3. We compare BaDExpert with 10 established backdoor defense baselines. First, to underscore BaDExpert’s consistent performance in detecting backdoor inputs, we juxtapose it with 3 post-development backdoor input detectors (STRIP 1, Frequency , SCALE-UP 2), all of which share our goal of detecting inference-time backdoor inputs. Additionally, for the sake of comprehensiveness, we repurpose certain development-stage poison set cleansers (AC ) to function as backdoor input detectors for comparative analysis. We also incorporate 6 model repairing defenses (FP , NC , MOTH 3, NAD 0, with ANP  and I-BAU  deferred to Appendix C.8) into our comparison to demonstrate BaDExpert’s consistent performance as a general post-development defense.\nWe describe the hyperparameter selection of BaDExpert in Appendix A.1 and configuration details of other baselines defenses in A.4. We evaluate our results based on two sets of metrics. First, to measure BaDExpert’s effectiveness as a backdoor detector, we report the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC , the higher the better).\nSecond, to directly compare with other non-detector backdoor defenses, we report the clean accuracy (CA, the higher the better) and attack success rate (ASR, the lower the better) of the model equipped with BaDExpert.\nSpecifically, for backdoor input detectors, we interpret correctly filtered backdoor inputs as successfully thwarted attacks, while falsely filtered clean inputs are considered erroneous predictions. Formally, CA=ℙ(x,y)∼𝒫​[ℳ​(x)=y∧𝙱𝙸𝙳​(x)=0]CAsubscriptℙsimilar-to𝑥𝑦𝒫delimited-[]ℳ𝑥𝑦𝙱𝙸𝙳𝑥0\\text{CA}=\\mathbb{P}_{(x,y)\\sim\\mathcal{P}}[\\mathcal{M}(x)=y\\wedge\\mathtt{BID}(x)=0], and ASR=ℙ(x,y)∼𝒫​[ℳ​(𝒯​(x))=t∧𝙱𝙸𝙳​(𝒯​(x))=0]ASRsubscriptℙsimilar-to𝑥𝑦𝒫delimited-[]ℳ𝒯𝑥𝑡𝙱𝙸𝙳𝒯𝑥0\\text{ASR}=\\mathbb{P}_{(x,y)\\sim\\mathcal{P}}[\\mathcal{M}(\\mathcal{T}(x))=t\\wedge\\mathtt{BID}(\\mathcal{T}(x))=0].\nThese metrics provide comprehensive and fair evaluations of our method in different defense scenarios. CA and ASR are reported on the standard validation over clean inputs and their backdoor correspondance, while\nAUROC is calculated over a noisy augmented validation set (same configuration following prior work 2) to prevent overfitting.\nTo ensure rigor, all primary results are averaged over three runs (corresponding standard deviations are reported in Appendix C.9).\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: 1000-class ImageNet , in Sec 4.3, to further validate our method’s scalability.
