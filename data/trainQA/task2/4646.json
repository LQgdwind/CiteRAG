      "content": "Paper Title: Open-Ended Evolution for Minecraft Building Generation This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 programme under grant agreement No 951911.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAssessing an individual’s novelty through its latent representation is a viable method for achieving OE as the boundaries of the latent space can be expanded by retraining the encoder model.\nFurthermore, through this approach novelty is calculated on the high-level patterns encoded in the latent representation, providing a more meaningful measure regarding the (current) possibility space.\nThe deep-learning novelty explorer paradigm  (DeLeNoX) leverages this concept by cycling between phases of exploration and transformation. In exploration, the generator uses the current autoencoder to thoroughly search the current latent space. In the first implementation of DeLeNoX , this was accomplished through neuroevolution of 2D spaceships with constrained novelty search 2 in the latent space. During transformation, the autoencoder is re-trained using the latest novel individuals from the previous exploration phase. This effectively readjusts the boundaries of the latent space and opens up new potential areas of interesting individuals, improving the generator’s ability to conduct an open-ended search. The high-level approach of DeLeNoX has since been adapted and extended for a number of other use cases. A similar study to DeLeNoX generates interesting 2D shapes using variational autoencoders , and demonstrated its effectiveness in generating diversity over directly evolving individuals’ latent vectors. Similar methods have been used for autonomous discovery of novel robot behaviors [ref]8,\ndata efficient search space illumination , the generation of interesting images [ref]7 and Super Mario Levels 3 with open-ended novelty or other diversity measures. Another DeLeNoX-based approach has been used for visual DOOM playing using neuroevolution and a latent representation of raw pixel data 4. To the best of our knowledge, the core principles of DeLeNoX—as explored in this paper—have never been applied to generate novel 3D content such as Minecraft buildings.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: , and demonstrated its effectiveness in generating diversity over directly evolving individuals’ latent vectors.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
