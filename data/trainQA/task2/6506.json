      "content": "Paper Title: DSTCGCN: Learning Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Cross Dependencies for Traffic Forecasting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe baselines used for our comparative evaluation can be divided into four categories. The first category is classic time-series forecasting methods, including HA, ARIMA  with Kalman filter, VAR 0, and FC-LSTM 1. The second category is STGNNs with static graphs with two sub-categories: With static pre-defined adjacency matrice: STGCN  combines graph convolutional and two temporal gated convolutions to capture spatial and temporal dependencies. ASTGCN  applies spatial attention to model spatial dependencies between different locations and temporal attention to capture the dynamic temporal dependencies between different time steps. With static adaptive adjacency matrice: Graph WaveNet  constructs a self-adaptive adjacency matrix using two node embeddings dictionaries and applies graph convolution with dilated casual convolution to capture spatial and temporal dependencies. AGCRN [ref]13 generates an adaptive adjacency matrix using one node embedding and uses node adaptive graph convolution and GRU to capture node-specific spatial and temporal dependencies, respectively. MTGNN  learns a uni-directional adjacency matrix using two node embeddings and uses GNN and dilated convolution for multi-variate time series forecasting. StemGNN 2 embeds the inputs using GRU and treats the attention score of the last hidden state as the adjacency matrice. It then combines graph Fourier transform to model inter-series correlations and discrete Fourier transform to model temporal dependencies. Z-GCNETs 3 integrates the new time-aware zigzag topological layer into time-conditioned GCNs for modeling spatial and temporal dependencies. RGSL  regularizes the adaptive adjacency matrix learned by node embeddings using Gumble-softmax. It applies GNN and GRU to model spatial and temporal dependencies, respectively. The third category is STGNNs with dynamic graphs, including: DCGRN  constructs the adjacency matrix using static node embeddings and integrates dynamic features (time stamps and speeds) to adjust the matrix for modeling dynamic spatial dependencies. DSTAGNN  obtains the adjacency matrix by calculating the cosine similarity of input traffic data and uses attention mechanisms to adjust the matrix for dynamics. The fourth category is STGNNs considering spatial-temporal cross dependencies, including: STSGCN  utilizes localized spatial-temporal subgraphs to capture the localized spatial-temporal dependencies synchronously. STFGCN  assembles a gated dilated CNN module with a spatial-temporal fusion graph module in parallel to capture local and global dependencies simultaneously. TraverseNet  utilizes attention to capture spatial and temporal dependencies.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: constructs a self-adaptive adjacency matrix using two node embeddings dictionaries and applies graph convolution with dilated casual convolution to capture spatial and temporal dependencies. AGCRN [ref]13 generates an adaptive adjacency matrix using one node embedding and uses node adaptive graph convolution and GRU to capture node-specific spatial and temporal dependencies, respectively.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
