      "content": "Paper Title: Scalable Causal Domain Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStandard supervised learning usually assumes that both training and test data are drawn from the same distribution. However, this is a strong assumption and often violated in practice if (1) training\nexamples have been obtained through a biased method (i.e., sample selection bias), or (2) there exist a significant physical or temporal difference between training and test data sources (i.e., non-stationary environments) [ref]23. Domain adaptation approaches aim to learn domain invariant features to mitigate the problem of data shift and enhance the quality of predictions   . Many domain adaptation\ntechniques in the literature consider the covariate shift     9, where the marginal\ndistribution of the features differs across the source and target domains, while the conditional\ndistribution of the target given the features does not change. In causal inference, it has\nbeen noted that covariate shift corresponds to causal learning, i.e., predicting effects from\ncauses . Therefore, taking into account the causal structure of a system of interest and finding causally invariant features in both source and target domains enable us to safely transfer the predictions of the target variable based only on causally invariant features to the target domain    . Following the same line of work, in this paper, we formalize and study the problem of domain adaptation as a feature selection problem where we aim to find an optimal subset that the conditional distribution of the target variable given this subset of predictors is invariant across domains under certain assumptions, as formally discussed in section 3. To illustrate the importance and effectiveness of this approach, consider the following example. According to Diabetes Australia, early diagnosis and initiation of appropriate treatment plays a pivotal role in: (1) helping patients to manage the disease early and (2) reducing the substantial economic impact of diabetes on the healthcare systems and national economies (700 million dollars each year ). To predict diabetes using machine learning techniques, we need its symptoms and clinical data.\nThe common symptoms and possible causes\nof diabetes Type II are weakness, obesity, delayed healing, visual blurring, partial paresis, muscle stiffness, alopecia, among others . Although we do not know what causes diabetes Type II , one may argue that the occurrence, rate, or frequency of Delayed Healing, Blurred Vision, Partial Paresis, and Weakness increases with age, and Delayed Healing and Partial Paresis may cause some complications that result in pancreas malfunction. The causal graph of this scenario can be represented as the directed acyclic graph (DAG) in Figure 1 (a). To provide an instance of a domain adaptation problem, we divided a diabetes dataset 5 into two subpopulations: (1) source domain with patients of the age less than 50 (dubbed young) and (2) target domain with patients of the age greater than or equal to 50 (old patients). As shown in Figure 1 (b) and (c), intervention in age leads to shifting distributions across domains. In our experiments, feature selection methods that do not consider the causal structure select highly relevant features to diabetes, i.e., all four variables Delayed Healing, Blurred Vision, Partial Paresis, and Weakness to achieve high prediction accuracy in the source domain. This per se causes worse predictions in the target domain (MSE = 0.29 and SSE = 65.322) than the case that we only consider causally invariant features, i.e., Delayed Healing and Partial Paresis for predictions in the target domain (MSE = 0.221 and SSE = 49.8927). The reason is that conditioning on the variables Blurred Vision and Weakness makes the paths between age and diabetes open, and hence the set of all features does not generalize to the target domain. However, conditioning only on Delayed Healing and Partial Paresis blocks the paths between age and diabetes. Hence, these causally invariant features enable us to predict diabetes with higher accuracy in the target domain, even in distribution shifts due to the age intervention. An important limitation of existing causal inference methods     is that they, currently, do not scale beyond dozens of variables due to either exponentially large number of conditional independence (CI) tests or difficulties in causal structure recovery .\nTo overcome the problem of scalability, we propose an algorithm based on Markov blanket discovery (see Appendix A for the definition) that in contrast to existing methods: (1) it takes advantage of local computation by finding only the Markov blanket of the target variable(s), and hence (2) reduces the search space for finding causally invariant features drastically because of the small size of Markov blankets (≤10absent10\\leq 10) in (many) causal models in practice, e.g., see . As a result, the CI tests becomes more reliable and robust when the number of variables increases, an essential characteristic in high dimensional and low sample size scenarios. Our main contributions are as follows:\n∙∙\\bullet We propose a new algorithm, called Scalable Causal Transfer Learning (SCTL), to solve the problem of domain adaptation in the presence of covariate shift and scales to high-dimensional problems (section 3).\n∙∙\\bullet For the first time we characterize Markov blankets in Acyclic Directed Mixed Graphs (ADMGs) i.e., causal graphs in the presence of unmeasured confounders111In this paper we will assume that there is\nno selection bias., and we prove that the standard Markov blanket discovery algorithms such as Grow-Shrink (GSMB), IAMB and its variants are still correct under the faithfulness assumption where causal sufficiency is not assumed. We prove the correctness of SCTL based on these new theoretical results (section 3).\n∙∙\\bullet We demonstrate on synthesized and real-world data that our proposed algorithm improves performance over several state-of-the-art algorithms in the presence of covariate shift (section 5).\nCode and data for reproducing our results is available at supplementary materials.\nhttps://github.com/softsys4ai/SCTL.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: through a biased method (i.e., sample selection bias), or (2) there exist a significant physical or temporal difference between training and test data sources (i.e., non-stationary environments) [ref]23.
