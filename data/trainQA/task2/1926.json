      "content": "Paper Title: Move Schedules: Fast persistence computations in coarse dynamic settingsThis work was partially supported by the National Science Foundation through grants CCF-2006661 and CAREER award DMS-1943758.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo the author’s knowledge, work focused on ways of updating a decomposition R=D​V𝑅𝐷𝑉R=DV, for all homological dimensions, is limited: there is the vineyards algorithm  and the moves algorithm , both of which are discussed extensively in section 2. At the time of writing, we were made aware of very recent work  that iteratively repairs a permuted decomposition via a column swapping strategy, which they call “warm starts.” Though their motivation is similar to our own, their approach relies on the reduction algorithm as a subprocedure, which is quite different from the strategy we employ here. Contrasting the dynamic setting, there is extensive work on improving the efficiency of computing a single (static) R=D​V𝑅𝐷𝑉R=DV decomposition. Chen  proposed persistence with a twist, also called the clearing optimization, which exploits a boundary/cycle relationship to “kill” columns early in the reduction rather than reducing them.\nAnother popular optimization is to utilize the duality between homology and cohomology , which dramatically improves the effectiveness of the clearing optimization .\nThere are many other optimizations on the implementation side: the use of ranking functions defined on the combinatorial number system enables implicit cofacet enumeration, removing the need to store the boundary matrix explicitly; the apparent/emergent pairs optimization identifies columns whose pivot entries are unaffected by the reduction algorithm, reducing the total number of columns which need to be reduced; sparse data structures such as bit-trees and lazy heaps allow for efficient column-wise additions with ℤ2=ℤ/2​ℤsubscriptℤ2ℤ2ℤ\\mathbb{Z}_{2}=\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} coefficients and effective O​(1)𝑂1O(1) pivot entry retrieval, and so on  . By making stronger assumptions on the underlying topological space, restricting the homological dimension, or targeting a weaker invariant (e.g. Betti numbers), one can usually obtain faster algorithms.\nFor example, Attali et al.  give a linear time algorithm for computing persistence on graphs.\nIn the same paper, they describe how to obtain ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-simplifications of 111-dimensional persistence diagrams for filtered 222-manifolds by using duality and symmetry theorems.\nAlong a similar vein, Edelsbrunner et al.  give a fast incremental algorithm for computing persistent Betti numbers up to dimension 222, again by utilizing symmetry, duality, and “time-reversal” . Chen & Kerber  give an output-sensitive method for computing persistent homology, utilizing the property that certain submatrices of D𝐷D have the same rank as R𝑅R, which they exploit through fast sub-cubic rank algorithms specialized for sparse-matrices. If zeroth homology is the only dimension of interest, computing and updating both the persistence and rank information is greatly simplified. For example, if the edges of the graph are in filtered order a priori, obtaining a tree representation fully characterizing the connectivity of the underlying space (also known as the incremental connectivity problem) takes just O​(α​(n)​n)𝑂𝛼𝑛𝑛O(\\alpha(n)n) time using the disjoint-set data structure, where α​(n)𝛼𝑛\\alpha(n) is the extremely slow-growing inverse Ackermann function.\nAdapting this approach to the time-varying setting, Oesterling et al. [ref]40 give an algorithm that maintains a merge tree with e𝑒e edges in O​(e)𝑂𝑒O(e) time per-update.\nIf only Betti numbers are needed, the zeroth-dimension problem reduces even further to the dynamic connectivity problem, which can be efficiently solved in amortized O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) query and update times using either Link-cut trees or multi-level Euler tour trees [ref]29.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: time using the disjoint-set data structure, where α​(n)𝛼𝑛\\alpha(n) is the extremely slow-growing inverse Ackermann function.\nAdapting this approach to the time-varying setting, Oesterling et al. [ref]40 give an algorithm that maintains a merge tree with e𝑒e edges in O​(e)𝑂𝑒O(e) time per-update.\nIf only Betti numbers are needed, the zeroth-dimension problem reduces even further to the dynamic\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
