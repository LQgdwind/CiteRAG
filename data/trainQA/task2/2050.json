      "content": "Paper Title: Gradient-based Data Subversion Attack Against Binary Classifiers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRelated works on defenses. In the early days, whenever a classifier was defeated, the only solution to the problem was to retrain the classifier. Dalvi et al  viewed classification as a game between the classifier and the adversary, thereby created a heuristic based algorithm to produce a classifier that defended against the attacks made by the adversary. Biggio et al [ref]7 have a good survey of defensive mechanisms developed over years. Many encouraging mechanisms have been developed by employing concepts in game theory and robust statistics  [ref]2  that are stable theoretically. Defensive mechanisms can be categorized into reactive and proactive defenses where reactive defenses aim to counter past attacks while proactive defenses aim to prevent future attacks. Adversarial attacks do not have a clear-cut set of rules. An attacker can formulate an attack from scratch and execute it. The two main difficulties while developing defense strategies are that 1. the attacker’s goals are hard to estimate 2. most of the defense strategies assume that the data they handle is clean whereas in reality gathering reliable labeled information is expensive considering the human intervention involved. Previous studies have shown that data sanitization can be used for mitigating the data poisoning attack  . For example, if the given data point is far away from the distribution of the training data, then it is likely that the data point is poisoned. Besides, we can make the underlying model robust enough to prevent the attack. Training multiple classifiers and creating robust examples for the training phase are some of the strategies used to improve the robustness of the classifier  0. Apart from that, Zhao et al 3 discuss identification of the attack point and its adjacent points as one defensive mechanism. They also study game models for developing more secure learning algorithms.\nMoreover, transfer attacks gained growing interest in the recent past. In a recent study, Shumailov et al.  discuss blocking of transferability of attacks against neural networks in computer vision applications. Possible future direction on defenses. The learning capability of a model depends on the method used to convert raw features to model features. For example, Anderson et al  used a combination of techniques such as hashing trick and histogram representation for creating suitable malware classifier features. Given that the victim model is a black-box to the attacker, he would have to choose a suitable feature conversion procedure for being able achieve his goal. Hence, we speculate that the choice of methods for raw feature conversion may affect the defensive capability of a classifier. When the dataset is huge, defensive mechanisms such as training multiple classifiers or generating adversarial training points to make robust classifiers are expensive procedures in terms of cost and complexity. Moreover, centralized systems used to store data results in increased exposure of sensitive data and can lead to many attacks that cause extensive damages. Blockchains could be a potential remedy for this problem. A blockchain is a system in which a record of transactions is maintained across several computers that are linked in a peer-to-peer network. The data is stored across a network of nodes, instead of a single central node since a blockchain is decentralized 5. If the data is maintained in a peer-to-peer network and each node runs its own different ‘sanity check’ algorithm, then the attacker has a real tough job at hand. Although blockchain is not immune to problems, it would be interesting to see if we are able to use it to maximum advantage and create a defensive mechanism based on it.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: as a game between the classifier and the adversary, thereby created a heuristic based algorithm to produce a classifier that defended against the attacks made by the adversary.
