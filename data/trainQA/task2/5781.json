      "content": "Paper Title: Better Understanding Differences in Attribution Methods via Systematic Evaluations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPost-hoc attribution methods\nbroadly use one of three main mechanisms.\nBackpropagation-based methods [ref]8   [ref]11 [ref]12    typically rely on the gradients with respect to the input [ref]8  [ref]11  or with respect to intermediate layers .\nActivation-based methods       weigh activation maps to assign importance, typically of the final convolutional layer.\nThe activations may be weighted by their gradients    or by estimating their importance to the classification score .\nPerturbation-based methods      treat the network as a black-box and assign importance by observing the change in output on perturbing the input. This is done by occluding parts of the image    or\noptimizing for a mask that maximizes/minimizes class confidence . In this work, we evaluate on a diverse set of attribution methods spanning all three categories. Evaluation Metrics:\nSeveral metrics have been proposed to evaluate attribution methods, and can broadly be categorised into Sanity checks,\nlocalization-, and perturbation-based metrics.\nSanity checks    test for basic properties attributions must satisfy (e.g., explanations should depend on the model parameters).\nLocalization-based metrics evaluate how well attributions localize class discriminative features of the input.\nTypically, this is done by measuring how well attributions coincide with object bounding boxes or image grid cells (see below)     .\nPerturbation-based metrics measure model behaviour under input perturbation guided by attributions.\nExamples include removing the most or least[ref]12 salient pixels, or using the attributions to scale input features and measuring changes in confidence.\nOur work combines aspects from localization metrics and sanity checks to evaluate the model-faithfulness of an attribution method. Localization on Grids:\nRelying on object bounding boxes for localization assumes that the model only relies on information within those bounding boxes.\nHowever, neural networks are known to also rely on context information for their decisions, cf. .\nTherefore, recent work    proposes creating a grid of inputs from distinct classes and measuring localization to the entire grid cell, which allows evaluation on datasets where bounding boxes are not available.\nHowever, this does not guarantee that the model only uses information from within the grid cell, and may fail for similar looking features (Fig. 3, right). In our work, we propose a metric that controls the flow of information and guarantees that grid cells are classified independently.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Post-hoc attribution methods\nbroadly use one of three main mechanisms.\nBackpropagation-based methods [ref]8   [ref]11 [ref]12    typically rely on the gradients with respect to the input [ref]8  [ref]11  or with respect to intermediate layers .\nActivation-based methods       weigh activation maps to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
