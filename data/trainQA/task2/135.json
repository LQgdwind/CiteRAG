      "content": "Paper Title: Hardness of equations over finite solvable groups under the exponential time hypothesis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince the work of Goldman and Russell  and Barrington et. al. , a long list of literature has appeared investigating EQN-ID and EQN-SAT in groups and other algebraic structures.\nIn  it is shown that EQN-ID is in 𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{P} for nilpotent groups as well as for dihedral groups Dksubscript𝐷𝑘D_{k} where k𝑘k is odd.\nHorváth resp. Horváth and Szabó   extended these results by showing the following among other results: EQN-SAT​(G)EQN-SAT𝐺\\textsc{EQN-SAT}(G) is in 𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{P} for G=Cn⋊B𝐺right-normal-factor-semidirect-productsubscript𝐶𝑛𝐵G=C_{n}\\rtimes B with B𝐵B abelian, n=pk𝑛superscript𝑝𝑘n=p^{k} or n=2​pk𝑛2superscript𝑝𝑘n=2p^{k} for some prime p𝑝p and EQN-ID is in 𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{P} for semidirect products G=Cn1⋊(Cn2⋊⋯⋊(Cnk⋊(A⋊B)))𝐺right-normal-factor-semidirect-productsubscript𝐶subscript𝑛1right-normal-factor-semidirect-productsubscript𝐶subscript𝑛2⋯right-normal-factor-semidirect-productsubscript𝐶subscript𝑛𝑘right-normal-factor-semidirect-product𝐴𝐵G=C_{n_{1}}\\rtimes(C_{n_{2}}\\rtimes\\cdots\\rtimes(C_{n_{k}}\\rtimes(A\\rtimes B))) with A,B𝐴𝐵A,B abelian (be aware that such a group is two-step solvable).\nFurthermore, in  it is proved that EQN-SAT​(G)∈𝖯EQN-SAT𝐺𝖯\\textsc{EQN-SAT}(G)\\in\\mathsf{P} for so-called semi-pattern groups.\nFinally, in  Földvári and Horváth established that EQN-SAT is in 𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{P} for the semidirect product of a p𝑝p-group and an abelian group and that EQN-ID is in 𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{P} for the semidirect product of a nilpotent group with an abelian group.\nNotice that all these groups have in common that their Fitting length is at most two. In   the EQN-SAT and EQN-ID problems for generalized terms are introduced. Here a generalized term means an expression which may also use commutators or even more complicated terms inside the input expression. Using commutators is a more succinct representation, which allows for showing that EQN-SAT is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-complete and EQN-ID is 𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{coNP}-complete in the alternating group A4subscript𝐴4A_{4} .\nIn  this result is extended by showing that, with commutators and the generalized term w​(x,y1,y2,y3)=x8​[x,y1,y2,y3]𝑤𝑥subscript𝑦1subscript𝑦2subscript𝑦3superscript𝑥8𝑥subscript𝑦1subscript𝑦2subscript𝑦3w(x,y_{1},y_{2},y_{3})=x^{8}[x,y_{1},y_{2},y_{3}], EQN-SAT is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-complete and EQN-ID is 𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{coNP}-complete for all non-nilpotent groups.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
