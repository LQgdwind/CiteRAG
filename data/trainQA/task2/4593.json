      "content": "Paper Title: Design Automation for Fast, Lightweight, and Effective Deep Learning Models: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAfter defining the operators that a model can have, it is essential to determine how many operators there are and how these operators are connected, i.e., the backbone of a model. However, operators and backbones are not completely isolated, such as the skip operator, which removes layers or adds connections and can change a model‚Äôs backbone. Depending on the connection topology, backbones can be roughly classified into two categories: chain-structured and multi-branch. Chain-structured Backbones. The chain-structured backbone  is the earliest and simplest topological structure of a neural network. It directly stacks multiple operators in sequence. As shown in Fig. 3 (a), the iùëñith operator (OisubscriptùëÇùëñO_{i}) takes the output of the iùëñi-1th operator (Oi‚àí1subscriptùëÇùëñ1O_{i-1}) as input and its output serves as the input of the operator (Oi+1subscriptùëÇùëñ1O_{i+1}). Therefore, the topological connection of different operators is determined and not searchable. However, it is possible to search how many operators there are, e.g., via the drop skip.\nThis simple backbone is a favourable practice of many hand-crafted CNN models [ref]83   [ref]10. An intuitive implementation is to stack operators layer by layer  .\nMotivated by the design principle of existing success [ref]10 , the chain-structured backbone is more commonly implemented in a cell-based, a.k.a. block- or stage-based, manner    1  , where a backbone is composed of multiple chain-structured cells, each of which contains multiple chain-structured operators. The operators in the same cell can be either identical or diverse in hyperparameters but the same in type. In the sequence of cells, it is a usual principle that the input resolutions are reduced and widths are increased gradually. To achieve the reduced resolutions, the first or last operator in a cell usually has manually set strides and widths. This cell-based implementation is not only effective but also reduces the search space.\nWu et al.  design a chain-structured backbone consisting of four searchable cells. There are 8 candidate convolution operators with various expansion rates, kernel sizes and numbers of groups, and a drop skip operator for searching.\nDifferent cells are separated by their input resolutions and widths, which are determined by manually set parameters. Yan et al.  also follow the same practice to construct their backbone but with more flexibility in searchable parameters. In these studies, it is usually required to predefine some parameters of the backbone, like the number of cells. In comparison with setting backbone structure empirically, some work directly embraces the backbone of existing models as a starting point and then searches beyond that      . This design principle relieves experts‚Äô burden of search space design by reusing prior knowledge, which is important in NAS 7. MONAS  relies on the backbone of a simplified version of AlexNet [ref]83 to search the convolution filter sizes and amounts. Scheidegger et al.  investigate the backbone of MobileNetV2 [ref]10 and allows to search the number of operators in each cell but all operators in a cell have the same settings except for the stride, which is used to modify the output resolution. The complexity reduction is mainly obtained by lowering the channel widths and reducing the number of topological replications. In addition to following the backbone of hand-crafted models, there is a trend to using the backbone of existing searched efficient models.\nMOGA  adopts MobileNetV3-large  as its backbone and keeps the same number and type of operators. It only searches the parameters of operators, like kernel sizes, expansion ratios for MBConv, and whether SE is enabled or not. Cai et al.  also adopts MobileNetV3, but they additionally provide the flexibility of searching the number of operators in each cell. Mutli-branch Backbones. While the chain-structured backbone is simple, it restricts the information flow to be sequential and single-path. Current hand-crafted architectures have suggested that a multi-branch architecture, which allows multi-path information flow and residual skip connections, works impressively better than a chain-structured architecture 8 . As illustrated in Fig. 3 (b), in the multi-branch backbone, an operator OisubscriptùëÇùëñO_{i} is allowed to accept the outputs from some of its previous operators (i.e., O1subscriptùëÇ1O_{1}, O2subscriptùëÇ2O_{2} ‚Ä¶ Oi‚àí1subscriptùëÇùëñ1O_{i-1}) as the input but not necessarily takes all. This setting provides more degrees of freedom on network topology. Note that a chain-structured backbone with residual skip connections, where an operator OisubscriptùëÇùëñO_{i} must receive the output of its immediate previous operator Oi‚àí1subscriptùëÇùëñ1O_{i-1}, is a special case of the multi-branch backbone. The multi-branch backbone can be achieved by using an insertion operation in the search space .\nHowever, searching for a multi-branch backbone as a whole is time-consuming and difficult to find an optimal structure. Similar to the chain-structured backbone, the cell-based principle is also widely adopted in designing a multi-branch backbone   , where the topology within a cell has a multi-branch structure. This results in a Macro-micro Backbone (Fig. 3 (c)) [ref]48  2 . In the macro-structure, residual skips are optional to provide the flexibility of multi-path information flow; in the micro-structure, operators are connected in the multi-branch fashion with the last operator (either parametric or non-parametric) assembling a single output of the cell. For example, MnasNet [ref]48 predefines a backbone of 7 sequentially stacked cells and each cell contains sequentially stacked operators with a searchable amount, types, and parameters. It further allows searchable residual skip connections among operators within a cell. This multi-branch backbone simply augments the chain-structured backbone with residual skips, resulting in more flexibility of multi-path information flow but marginal research space expansion.\nNSGA-Net  and HR-NAS 2, in contrast, allow more general multi-branch connections within a cell. NSGA-Net supports searchable topology while HR-NAS sets fixed multi-branch connections and searches for discarded convolutional channels and transformer queries. Different from searching for a customized structure, following existing success is also a favoured choice in designing multi-branch backbones    . Li et al.  adopt the multi-branch backbone of the EfficientNet and only search operators. MnasFPN  constructs its search space based on the NAS-FPN(Lite) backbone and searches both multi-branch structures and operators in a cell for merging various resolutions. However, to reduce the search burden, it does not allow general connectivity patterns and applies limited merging connections. MobileNetV3  uses the backbone of MnasNet [ref]48 as the seed and proceeds layer-wise search on it. Scheidegger et al.  investigate the backbone of several existing models (DenseNet121 , MobileNetV2 [ref]10, GoogLeNet 9, PNASNet , and ResNeXt ) and demonstrate that their approach is able to provide improved accuracy with hardware constraints and different backbones.\nWhile considering that searching both macro and micro structures overburdens the searching process, most works utilize the multi-branch macro backbone of existing models and only search the micro-structures   . ProxylessNAS  accepts the backbone of the residual PyramidNet , which has a residual skip connection every two operators, and replaces the original operators with their own tree-structured cells .\nDPP-Net  selects the backbone of CondenseNet , which repeats an identical cell abundant times with both residual skip and chain connections, and only searches the operators in the cell. MONAS  also reuses the backbone of CondenseNet but it uses the same cell structure and searches the number of stages and growth rate. Although the macro-micro backbone provides the highest flexibility and complexity among the above three categories, there is no evidence that it is the best choice. However, we note that no matter in which backbone category, cell-based implementation is the most common practice. This is due to the following considerations: i) an effective network usually has gradually shrinking resolutions as going deep, and a cell can have multiple operators on the same resolution to strengthen feature extraction; ii) previous experience with the manually designed network indicates that the cell-based structure is effective for deep learning; iii) the cell-based backbone provides high search efficiency by limiting the search space (e.g., the whole network can stack the same cell and a cell can have the same operator); iv) the cell-based backbone simplifies the network topology with inter- and intra-cell connectivity instead of random edges among all operators.\nSome recent works reveal that search performance may be impeded by these search space design biases . Nevertheless, the choice of the search space principally regulates the difficulty of the search process. Current NAS algorithms are imperfect so more freedoms in the search space do not always lead to better resultant models but inversely overburden the search algorithms. With the continued improvement of NAS algorithms, it is essential to reduce design biases and construct a more general search space.\n\nReference markers found: [83]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]83: determined and not searchable.
