      "content": "Paper Title: Gradient tracking and variance reduction for decentralized optimization and machine learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo present the intuition behind the gradient tracking technique, we first recall the iterations of the (non-stochastic) Decentralized Gradient Descent (DGD) with a constant step-size in (9). Let us first assume, for the sake of argument, that all nodes agree on the minimizer of F𝐹F at some iteration k𝑘k, i.e., 𝜽ki=𝜽∗,∀isuperscriptsubscript𝜽𝑘𝑖superscript𝜽for-all𝑖\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{k}^{i}=\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*},\\forall i. Then at the next iteration k+1𝑘1k+1, we have where 𝜽∗−∇fi​(𝜽∗)≠𝜽∗superscript𝜽∇subscript𝑓𝑖superscript𝜽superscript𝜽\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}-\\nabla f_{i}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*})\\neq\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}, in general. In other words, the minimizer 𝜽∗superscript𝜽\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*} is not necessarily a fixed point of (9). Of course, using the gradient ∇F​(𝜽ki)∇𝐹superscriptsubscript𝜽𝑘𝑖\\nabla F\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{k}^{i}\\right) of the global objective, instead of ∇fi​(𝜽ki)∇subscript𝑓𝑖superscriptsubscript𝜽𝑘𝑖\\nabla f_{i}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{k}^{i}\\right), overcomes this issue but the global gradient is not available at any node. The natural yet innovative idea of gradient tracking is to design a local iterative gradient tracker 𝐝kisuperscriptsubscript𝐝𝑘𝑖\\mathbf{d}_{k}^{i} that asymptotically approaches the global gradient ∇F​(𝜽ki)∇𝐹superscriptsubscript𝜽𝑘𝑖\\nabla F\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{k}^{i}\\right) as 𝜽kisuperscriptsubscript𝜽𝑘𝑖\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{k}^{i} approaches 𝜽∗superscript𝜽\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}\n    . Gradient tracking is implemented with the help of dynamic average consensus (DAC) , briefly described next. In contrast to classical average-consensus  that learns the average of fixed initial states, DAC  tracks the average of time-varying signals. Formally, each node i𝑖i measures a time-varying signal 𝐫kisuperscriptsubscript𝐫𝑘𝑖\\mathbf{r}_{k}^{i} and all nodes cooperate to track the average 𝐫¯k≜1n​∑i=1n𝐫ki≜subscript¯𝐫𝑘1𝑛superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛superscriptsubscript𝐫𝑘𝑖\\overline{\\mathbf{r}}_{k}\\triangleq\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\mathbf{r}_{k}^{i} of these signals. The DAC protocol is given as follows. Each node i𝑖i iteratively updates its estimate 𝐝kisuperscriptsubscript𝐝𝑘𝑖\\mathbf{d}_{k}^{i} of 𝐫¯ksubscript¯𝐫𝑘\\overline{\\mathbf{r}}_{k} as where 𝐝0i=𝐫0i,∀isuperscriptsubscript𝐝0𝑖superscriptsubscript𝐫0𝑖for-all𝑖\\mathbf{d}_{0}^{i}=\\mathbf{r}_{0}^{i},\\forall i. For a doubly-stochastic weight matrix W={wi​r}𝑊subscript𝑤𝑖𝑟W=\\{w_{ir}\\}, it is shown in  that if ‖𝐫k+1i−𝐫ki‖2→0→subscriptnormsuperscriptsubscript𝐫𝑘1𝑖superscriptsubscript𝐫𝑘𝑖20\\left\\|\\mathbf{r}_{k+1}^{i}-\\mathbf{r}_{k}^{i}\\right\\|_{2}\\rightarrow 0, we have that ‖𝐝ki−𝐫¯k‖2→0→subscriptnormsuperscriptsubscript𝐝𝑘𝑖subscript¯𝐫𝑘20\\left\\|\\mathbf{d}_{k}^{i}-\\overline{\\mathbf{r}}_{k}\\right\\|_{2}\\rightarrow 0. Clearly, in the aforementioned design of gradient tracking, the time-varying signal that we intend to track is the average of the local gradients 1n​∑i=1n∇fi​(𝜽ki)1𝑛superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛∇subscript𝑓𝑖superscriptsubscript𝜽𝑘𝑖\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\nabla f_{i}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{k}^{i}\\right). We thus combine DGD (9) and DAC (15) to obtain GT-DGD (DGD with Gradient Tracking)     , as follows: where 𝐝0i=∇fi​(𝜽0i),∀isuperscriptsubscript𝐝0𝑖∇subscript𝑓𝑖superscriptsubscript𝜽0𝑖for-all𝑖\\mathbf{d}_{0}^{i}=\\nabla f_{i}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}^{i}\\right),\\forall i. Intuitively, as 𝜽ki→𝜽¯k→superscriptsubscript𝜽𝑘𝑖subscript¯𝜽𝑘\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{k}^{i}\\rightarrow\\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{k} and 𝐝ki→1n​∑i=1n∇fi​(𝜽ki)→∇F​(𝜽¯k)→superscriptsubscript𝐝𝑘𝑖1𝑛superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛∇subscript𝑓𝑖superscriptsubscript𝜽𝑘𝑖→∇𝐹subscript¯𝜽𝑘\\mathbf{d}_{k}^{i}\\rightarrow\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\nabla f_{i}\\big{(}\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{k}^{i}\\big{)}\\rightarrow\\nabla F\\big{(}\\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{k}\\big{)}, (16a) asymptotically becomes the centralized batch gradient descent. It has been shown in    [ref]25 that GT-DGD converges linearly to the minimizer 𝜽∗superscript𝜽\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*} of F𝐹F under a constant step-size when each fi,j∈𝒮μ,Lsubscript𝑓𝑖𝑗subscript𝒮𝜇𝐿f_{i,j}\\in\\mathcal{S}_{\\mu,L}, unlike DGD that converges sublinearly to 𝜽∗superscript𝜽\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*} with decaying step-sizes. The stochastic variant of GT-DGD is derived in , termed as GT-DSGD (DSGD with Gradient Tracking), and is formally described in Algorithm 2. Under the same assumptions of smoothness, strong-convexity, and bounded variance as in DSGD, the convergence of GT-DSGD is summarized in the following : with a constant step-size, αk=α∈(0,𝒪​((1−λ)2L​κ)],∀kformulae-sequencesubscript𝛼𝑘𝛼0𝒪superscript1𝜆2𝐿𝜅for-all𝑘\\alpha_{k}=\\alpha\\in\\left(0,\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{(1-\\lambda)^{2}}{L\\kappa}\\right)\\right],\\forall k, 𝔼​[‖𝜽ki−𝜽∗‖22]𝔼delimited-[]superscriptsubscriptnormsuperscriptsubscript𝜽𝑘𝑖superscript𝜽22\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{k}^{i}-\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}\\|_{2}^{2}] decays linearly at the rate of (1−𝒪​(μ​α))ksuperscript1𝒪𝜇𝛼𝑘\\left(1-\\mathcal{O}(\\mu\\alpha)\\right)^{k} to a neighborhood of 𝜽∗superscript𝜽\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*} such that Note that GT-DSGD, in contrast to GT-DGD, loses the exact linear convergence to the minimizer because the gradients are now stochastic. Exact convergence can be recovered albeit at a slower sublinear rate, i.e., with a diminishing step-size αk=𝒪​(1k)subscript𝛼𝑘𝒪1𝑘\\alpha_{k}=\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{k}), we have  By comparing DSGD (12) and GT-DSGD (17), we note that under a constant step-size, GT-DSGD removes the bias 𝒪​(α2​κ2​b(1−λ)2)𝒪superscript𝛼2superscript𝜅2𝑏superscript1𝜆2\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha^{2}\\kappa^{2}b}{\\left(1-\\lambda\\right)^{2}}\\right) that comes from b≜1n​∑i=1n‖∇fi​(𝛉∗)‖2≜𝑏1𝑛superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛superscriptnorm∇subscript𝑓𝑖superscript𝛉2b\\triangleq\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left\\|\\nabla f_{i}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}\\right)\\right\\|^{2} in DSGD. However, the network dependence in GT-DSGD, 𝒪​(1(1−λ)3)𝒪1superscript1𝜆3\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{(1-\\lambda)^{3}}\\right), is worse than DSGD where it is 𝒪​(1(1−λ)2)𝒪1superscript1𝜆2\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{(1-\\lambda)^{2}}\\right). A tradeoff here is imminent where the two approaches have their own merits depending on the relative sizes of b𝑏b and λ𝜆\\lambda. Clearly, when the bias b𝑏b dominates, e.g., when the data across nodes is largely heterogeneous, GT-DSGD achieves a lower steady-state error than DSGD.\nUnder diminishing\nstep-sizes, DSGD and GT-DSGD have comparable performance.\nOf relevance here are EXTRA  and Exact Diffusion [ref]28, both of which eliminate the bias caused by b𝑏b and are built on a different principle from gradient tracking. Note that with constant step-sizes, the performance of SGD in (3) and GT-DSGD in (17) is comparable. In particular, both methods converge linearly but there is a steady-state error, which is controlled by the step-size α𝛼\\alpha and the variance σ2superscript𝜎2\\sigma^{2} of the stochastic gradient, see Remark 3. Since GT-DSGD removes the bias in DSGD that comes due to the difference of the local and global objectives (see b𝑏b in (12)), it may be considered as a more appropriate decentralization of SGD. This argument naturally leads to the idea that one can incorporate the centralized Variance Reduction (VR) techniques in the GT-DSGD to further improve the performance and achieve faster convergence. As we show in the following, adding variance reduction to GT-DSGD in fact leads to an exact linear convergence with a constant step-size and further improves its network dependence to 𝒪​(1(1−λ)2)𝒪1superscript1𝜆2\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{(1-\\lambda)^{2}}\\right). We emphasize that adding VR to DSGD does not enable exact linear convergence. Following Remark 1, VR removes the steady-state error caused by the variance of the stochastic gradient. However, in a decentralized setting, the heterogeneity across the local data batches is not accounted for unless gradient tracking is employed. This difference between the local batches across the nodes is captured by the aforementioned bias b𝑏b in (12) and is removed by gradient tracking that estimates the average of local gradients across the nodes.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: F\\big{(}\\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{k}\\big{)}, (16a) asymptotically becomes the centralized batch gradient descent.
