      "content": "Paper Title: Adversarial Deep Reinforcement Learning for Improving the Robustness of Multi-agent Autonomous Driving Policies\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAuthors in [ref]14 use GANs to generate synthetic images to validate the driving robustness of deep learning-based autonomous driving systems. They also use metamorphic testing to check the consistency of the model outputs against different types of synthetic images. Another close work [ref]15 proposes a systematic testing tool for evaluating DNN-based AC models. They do so by generating test cases using real-world conditions such as rain and lightning conditions. They perform DNN logic coverage by adding transformations to test inputs within Udacity self-driving car challenge simulator . Similar to [ref]14, they also use domain-specific metamorphic relations to find fault behaviors of DNN. While the proposed work has achieved great results, it is limited in way that the driving scenarios are only tested in a single-agent environment. Also, both [ref]15 and [ref]14 would benefit from adding the same synthetic images in the retraining of the tested DNN AC models to compare the robustness with the baseline models. The authors in  use a search-based testing technique to automatically create challenging virtual scenarios for testing self-driving cars. These scenarios are used to test AI driving models such as DeepDriving  to perform systematic testing of lane-keeping systems. While the work contributes to having more complex evaluation scenarios, it does not address the problem of AC testing in a realistic multi-agent driving environment. Authors in  use Bayesian optimization for test case generation for ACs. The proposed work learns parameters using the system’s output to create test case scenarios that lead AC into failure states. While the authors are able to identify test cases for complex black boxes like autonomous systems, the work lacks complex driving scenarios with more than one AC in the same environment for testing purposes. A thorough case study by authors in  performs a comparative study of the pros and cons of testing deep learning-based AC models in offline datasets versus online simulation testing. Offline testing focuses on prediction errors against the dataset, while online testing looks for safety violations within driving scenarios. The tests are performed using a pretrained Udacity car simulator driving model. As a limitation, the work needs an extension of multi-agent testing configurations within online and offline driving scenarios to observe which method will be more beneficial for multi-agent ACs testing. Authors in  use OpenStreetMap traffic simulator SUMO to suggest a workflow for generating a collection of challenging and safety-critical test scenarios for the safety validation of motion planning algorithms in automated vehicles. As a limitation, the work requires multi-agent AC testing to take advantage of the publicly available generated scenarios. Authors in  propose an automated fuzzing framework to produce AC safety violation driving scenarios. Using the industrial-grade autonomous driving platform Baidu Apollo, they use domain knowledge of vehicle dynamics and genetic algorithms to find failure scenarios. The experiments are performed in a partial multi-agent environment with one AC under test driving alongside non-AC traffic, as non-players. As a limitation, the work does not address the problem of improving the robustness of the same ACs using industrial-grade urban driving simulators. Furthermore, the work could benefit from adding more than one AI-based AC for testing. Another work in  proposes a programmatic interface that enables designing parameterized environments and test cases for ACs. These test parameters control the behavior and positioning of various actors alongside AC under test, and support test input generation strategies. While the experiments are performed by training the neural network-based driving models, the work is limited to a single-agent AC environment. Also, the work could benefit from parameterized environments for generating edge cases that can increase the robustness of ACs. Furthermore, authors in [ref]37 propose a whitebox method for testing ACs by triggering as many neurons in the driving model as possible for finding failure scenarios. They pose an optimization problem and apply gradient ascent over the results of test inputs in order to maximize the chance of finding corner cases. As a limitation, the driving scenarios are only tested in a single-agent environment. In contrast, our work is focused on blackbox adversarial testing of ACs in a multi-agent driving environment.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: Authors in [ref]14 use GANs to generate synthetic images to validate the driving robustness of deep learning-based autonomous driving systems.
