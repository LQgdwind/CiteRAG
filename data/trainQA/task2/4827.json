      "content": "Paper Title: Gotcha: Real-Time Video Deepfake Detection via Challenge-Response\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn an increasingly interconnected world, the adoption of live, online video interactions has become widespread. Projections for 2023 indicate that 86% of companies are conducting interviews online, while approximately 83% of employees estimate spending about a third of their working week in virtual meetings . This significant uptick in online interactions creates a fertile ground for novel social engineering attacks.\nSpecifically, high-quality tools capable of creating video deepfakes, which can convincingly mimic a target’s facial appearance, are becoming more accessible and can readily circumvent commercial APIs designed for liveness detection and identity verification . While earlier versions of deepfakes primarily targeted public figures , recent advancements in deepfake generation technology have made it possible to impersonate ordinary individuals , even with a limited set of training images [ref]5, in a real-time setting . These systems, named Real-Time Deepfakes (RTDFs), are a sophisticated variant of deepfakes involving live, interactive video impersonations of a target, posing an urgent, burgeoning threat to the integrity of online human interactions across the globe . RTDFs have already become prevalent to the extent that the FBI has warned of their imminent threat and pervasiveness . Known recent incidents include an individual in China transferring $620,000 to an impersonator of their friend after a video call . Also, an impersonation of the former president of Ukraine joined a Kremlin critic during a recorded video call to lure the critic into performing embarrassing acts . Conventional techniques 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 have considered deepfake detection, but in an offline and non-interactive setting. Despite being technically impressive, such techniques are not explicitly designed for RTDFs and operate under the assumption of no interaction between an imposter and the detector. This assumption creates a threat model that favors imposters, who can leverage offline resources to refine their models to target specific individuals. Meanwhile, detection often needs to be performed in real-time without knowledge of the creation process and in potentially constrained environments. Contrary to this traditional strategy, we explore an alternate approach where the detector can interactively present non-trivial tasks or challenges to the imposter. Under this model, the onus of consistently maintaining high-quality deepfakes in real-time, under challenging situations, is now squarely on the imposter. We leverage this asymmetric advantage to design and validate a challenge-response approach for identifying RTDFs. The fundamental conceptual problem is to develop a suite of practical challenges (i.e., the “real user” experience is not significantly altered) yet maximally informative (i.e., “fake user” video outputs are statistically and visually abnormal). In this work, we propose and categorize challenges designed to exploit limitations specific to components of an RTDF generation pipeline, such as a facial landmark detector and auto-encoder. As we propose a variety of challenge categories, the detection accuracy of each challenge may vary depending on the deepfake generation model and the conditions under which the deepfake is enacted, such as ambient lighting or video quality. Therefore, more than a single challenge may be required for accurate detection. A desirable feature of the proposed challenges is that they induce human-visible artifacts in the responses and provide robust signals for downstream automated machine-learning detectors. This feature facilitates easy audit and explainability in their practical implementations. We call the proposed technique Gotcha, echoing the ubiquitous Captcha test used to identify online robots masquerading as humans. At its core, Gotcha presents one or more challenges to a suspected RTDF, which could require physical action or involve digital manipulations in the video feed. We validate Gotcha on a novel video dataset of 56,247 videos derived by collecting data from 47 legitimate users. We conduct both human-based and automated evaluations to test its potential in practical scenarios while establishing a security-usability tradeoff. Our evaluation of Gotcha demonstrates consistent and measurable degradation of deepfake quality across users, highlighting its promise for RTDF detection in real-world settings. Our contributions are as follows: We explore a challenge-response approach for authenticating live video interactions and develop a taxonomy of challenges by exploiting vulnerabilities in real-time deepfake generation pipelines. We collect video data of 47 real users in person, performing eight challenges. The new dataset consists of 56,247 short real and fake videos. We perform human and automated evaluations of the approach, demonstrating consistent and visible degradation of deepfake quality caused by challenges. We train a new self-supervised ML-based fidelity scoring model for this purpose. 111Reproducibility: All participants consented to release their data for academic research. Hence, we will release originally recorded challenges and corresponding deepfakes for non-commercial research, along with the code for the fidelity score model and survey instruments used for human evaluations.  Authentication and Liveness Detection. It is important to note that a Captcha-like test does not assume the availability of any prior knowledge or identification of the target user. This is fundamentally different from “what-you-know” (e.g. passwords) or “who-you-are” (e.g., biometrics) type of authentication systems. Such systems require the user to enroll prior to authentication and perform it by using an identity-matching algorithm. In this work, the imposter is explicitly considered to be present during an interaction, and all impersonations are performed live (consequently, in real-time). The proposed solution trivially addresses presentation attacks, thus differentiating it from methods explicitly designed for liveness detection.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: primarily targeted public figures , recent advancements in deepfake generation technology have made it possible to impersonate ordinary individuals , even with a limited set of training images [ref]5, in a real-time setting .
