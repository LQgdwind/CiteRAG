      "content": "Paper Title: Object Goal Navigation with Recursive Implicit Maps\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSearching for objects in the real world is an essential ability for embodied agents and serves as a precursor to many object manipulation tasks.\nAs a consequence, many recent works have focused on the object goal navigation (ObjectNav)    [ref]4 [ref]5 [ref]6.\nThis task requires an agent to navigate in unknown environments and to reach locations next to an instance of the goal object category. The ObjectNav task is more challenging compared to the classic visual navigation to a given location  .\nIndeed, in addition to finding a collision-free path, ObjectNav also requires to reason about the semantics in the visual world and to develop efficient object-oriented exploration strategies for previously unseen environments.\nRecently, much progress has been made to improve egocentric visual perception  0 1 2 thanks to the advanced visual models 3 4 5 and large-scale self-supervised pretraining 6.\nYet, efficiently exploring the world remains difficult as it requires a long-term scene memory to enable backtracking as well as commonsense knowledge of scene arrangements.\nFor example, a cushion is more likely to be found in the living room than in the kitchen, hence, if searching for a cushion, the exploration should focus more on the former.\nClassical methods 7 using occupancy maps can be complemented with semantic recognition for ObjectNav. However, the lack of learning prevents such methods from acquiring the aforementioned commonsense knowledge.\nTo address this limitation, learning-based approaches  [ref]5 have been proposed to determine object-oriented navigation policies. Existing learning-based approaches to ObjectNav can be divided into two categories, namely modular methods and end-to-end learning methods.\nModular methods  [ref]6 8 extend occupancy maps to semantic maps by adding object dimensions to each map cell. Such methods typically deploy a neural network module to predict goal locations and another module that generates low-level actions towards the goal.\nSemantic maps, however, do not scale well to many objects and are sensitive to noisy sensor measurements.\nEnd-to-end learning methods [ref]4 [ref]5  directly map raw observations to low-level actions.\nSuch methods are more flexible and can easily benefit from advances in visual representation learning 2 6.\nNevertheless, existing policy models mainly adopt recurrent neural networks (RNNs) 9 0. Since trajectories of low-level actions are usually long with hundreds of small steps, RNNs struggle to maintain a long-term memory of explored environments.\nA few works 1 2 proposed an episodic sequence memory using transformers 3.\nSequence representations in such models, however, fail to capture geometric structure of the environment and become inefficient for a large number of navigation steps. In this work, we focus on end-to-end learning-based methods and propose to build a recursive implicit map (RIM) to improve object-oriented exploration, see Figure 1.\nThe implicit map consists of a spatial grid initialized from scratch at the beginning of a navigation episode. It is recursively updated with new observations by a learnable module and encodes the explored environment in geometry-aware latent vectors. Specifically, we use a multi-layer transformer model as the learnable module. The transformer only relies on the geometry and visual features to align the implicit map and observation for each update, discarding any other domain priors for map construction.\nIn order to improve spatial reasoning and to better supervise the learning from our implicit map,\nwe propose auxiliary tasks besides the primary task of action prediction. The auxiliary tasks aim to predict visual representations given the agent’s pose, reconstruct a 2D occupancy map, and perform semantic recognition. We perform extensive experiments on the Matterport3D (MP3D) ObjectNav dataset with human demonstrations [ref]5 for training.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the RIM outperforms other implicit representations including recurrent state and episodic sequence as well as explicit mapping methods.\nGiven outputs for auxiliary tasks, we observe that the implicit map is able to capture the geometry and semantic information in explored environments.\nThe proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MP3D dataset and generalizes well to new environments of the HM3D dataset.\nWe further deploy our RIM model learned in simulation in the real world with a different robot and testing environments.\nOur model achieves encouraging performance after fine-tuning on few real-world demonstrations.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: is an essential ability for embodied agents and serves as a precursor to many object manipulation tasks.\nAs a consequence, many recent works have focused on the object goal navigation (ObjectNav)    [ref]4 [ref]5 [ref]6.\nThis task requires an agent to navigate in unknown environments and to reach locations next to an instance of the goal object category. The ObjectNav task is more challenging\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
