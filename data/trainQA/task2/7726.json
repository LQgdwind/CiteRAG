      "content": "Paper Title: Rapid and Precise Topological Comparison with Merge Tree Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMerge trees are a valuable tool in the scientific visualization of scalar\nfields; however, current\nmethods for merge tree comparisons are computationally expensive, primarily\ndue to the exhaustive matching between tree nodes. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce the Merge Tree Neural Networks (MTNN), a learned neural network model designed for merge\ntree comparison. The MTNN enables rapid\nand high-quality similarity computation. We first demonstrate how graph\nneural networks, which emerged as effective encoders for graphs,\ncan be trained to produce embeddings of merge trees in vector spaces for\nefficient similarity comparison. Next, we formulate the novel MTNN\nmodel that further improves the similarity comparisons by integrating the\ntree and node embeddings with a new topological attention mechanism. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our model on real-world data in different\ndomains and examine our model’s generalizability across various datasets.\nOur experimental analysis demonstrates our approach’s superiority in\naccuracy and efficiency. In particular, we speed up the prior\nstate-of-the-art by more than 100×100\\times on the benchmark datasets while\nmaintaining an error rate below 0.1%percent0.10.1\\%. (a) Merge tree distances, where trees are matched and edited, are computationally heavy and slow to compute. This leads to analyses\nthat can be a bottleneck in scientific workflows. (b) Here, we show an MDS visualization of a test dataset and the significant runtime necessary to produce a pair-wise distance matrix. (c) Rather than\ndirectly compute tree distances, we treat merge tree comparison as a\nlearning task using our novel Merge Tree Neural Networks (MTNN) to calculate the similarity. (d) MDS of the same data as (b) using MTNN. This\nreduces comparison times by orders of magnitude (5, here) with extremely low\nerror added compared to the state-of-the-art merge tree distance.\n\n\\useunder\\ul\n Introduction A fundamental challenge in scientific visualization is analyzing and visualizing\ndata, such as scalar fields, at speeds that support real-time\nexploration. Consider Topological Data Analysis\n(TDA) 7, which is now a critical component in\nmany visualization pipelines due to its ability to extract and succinctly\nsummarize structural information from complex datasets. TDA has been shown to\neffectively visualize  3 and\nanalyze a wide range of applications in\nchemistry  [ref]9,\nneuroscience , social\nnetworks , material\nscience 3, energy , and\nmedical domains 7  ,\nto name a few. However, TDA approaches can be quite slow to compute due to their\ncomputational expense. Therefore, they are difficult to use in scenarios where a\nquick answer is needed for an analysis. In particular, Merge Trees\n(MTs) 7 serve as\nexpressive topological descriptors that capture the complex structure of data,\nencoding the evolution of topological features with a history that records how\ntheir components merge. Despite being a powerful tool in various domains,\nthe computational cost associated with distance calculations for merge trees has been a\nsignificant limitation. This is due to the core operation of computing the\ndistance on merge trees needs to compare the optimal matching between each node of the merge trees.\nThis matching is known to be\nNP-hard 0.\nGiven the importance, yet great difficulty, of computing merge tree distances, a variety of metrics and pseudo-metrics have been proposed, such as functional distortion\ndistance , edit\ndistance , interleaving\ndistance 0 , and distances\nbased on branch decomposition and matching . While many\nof these distance metrics are computationally challenging, it is worth noting\nthat they are not universally NP-Hard . Some\nmetrics may have polynomial-time algorithms under specific conditions.\nHowever, these methods usually require complicated design and implementation\nbased on discrete optimizations. Despite not being exponential, the time\ncomplexity is usually still polynomial or sub-exponential in the number of nodes\nin the merge trees. In this work, we take a different approach. To address the challenge of fast\ncomparisons, we re-frame it as a learning task. Once the similarities\nof merge trees become learnable, we can reduce the comparison runtime by\navoiding the need to compute matchings between two MTs. To do so, we first need an\nencoder to map merge trees into a vector space, and learn this embedding model to\nposition similar merge trees closely and dissimilar ones far apart in this space. We\nfocus our investigation on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as our primary encoder,\na technique extensively studied for graph embeddings yet unexplored for merge trees. In the following, we introduce the first Merge Tree Neural Networks (MTNN)\nthat uses GNNs to learn merge tree similarity. In particular, we design a neural network\nmodel that maps a pair of merge trees into a similarity score. At the training stage,\nthe parameters involved in this model are learned by minimizing the\ndifference between the predicted similarity scores and a ground truth, where\neach training data point is a pair of merge trees with their true similarity score. At\nthe test stage, we can obtain a predicted similarity score by feeding the\nlearned model with any pair of unseen merge trees. To effectively learn both the structural and topological information of merge trees, we\nneed to design the neural network architecture carefully. Traditional GNNs can\nonly encode structural information of graphs, not merge trees. We introduce two key\nstrategies to address this gap: firstly, we employ the Graph Isomorphism Network\n(GIN) as our encoder, which excels in identifying structural distinctions in merge trees due to its design for graph isomorphism tasks. Secondly, we develop an innovative\ntopological attention mechanism designed to identify and highlight\nimportant nodes within a merge tree. This mechanism re-weight nodes based on\ntheir ground truth MT distance and nodes’ topological significance (persistence). We conduct our experiments on five datasets: a synthetic\npoint cloud, two datasets from time-varying flow simulations, one from a\nrepeating pattern flow simulation, and one of 3D shapes. On all datasets, MTNN\nsignificantly enhances efficiency, accelerating the runtime by over 100 times\nwhile maintaining a low error rate when compared to a target MT similarity\nmetric . Our contributions can be summarized as follows: The first neural network model for merge tree similarity, called MTNN; A novel topological-based attention mechanism for GNNs; An evaluation that shows MTNN’s extremely precise(<0.1%absentpercent0.1<0.1\\% mean\nsquared error) and fast (>100×>100\\times speedup) similarity measures; An evaluation of the generalizability of trained models; and An open-source implementation for\nreproducibility 111https://osf.io/2n8dy/?view_only=fd8d0de16b4548f9adc33c091a9aa1f6. The paper is organized as follows: Section 1 discusses related work,\nfocusing on the computation of distance between merge trees and the application of\nlearning methods for graph similarity. Section 2 provides the\nnecessary preliminary background. In Section 3, we examine the\nusing GNNs for merge trees. Our proposed model, MTNN, is detailed in\nSection 4. Section 5 presents our results, and\nSection 6 concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: to its ability to extract and succinctly\nsummarize structural information from complex datasets.
