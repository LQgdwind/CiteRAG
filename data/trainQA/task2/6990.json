Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

For a fair comparison, we apply 20 prompts for each concept by following [ref]31. Moreover, we conduct our experiments on two lifelong generation task settings to evaluate the performance of our method. As shown in Fig. 4, we curate a five-tasks dataset by selecting five concepts from the built datasets in Custom Diffusion and DreamBooth. Evaluation metrics: To fairly evaluate the generation performance in our lifelong learning setting, we generate four images per concept and per prompt for each generation task. After the lifelong diffusion model observes the last task, three metrics are adopted to evaluate the performance of lifelong generation: (1) Image-Alignment (IA), following DreamBooth [ref]29 and Custom Diffusion [ref]31, is the visual similarity computed in the feature space when we fed generated images with target concept and raw images into a pretrained CLIP-L model [ref]37; (2) Text-Alignment (TA), can be obtained from CLIP-L feature space using the given text prompts and generated images; (3) Task Forgetting Rate (TFR), can be computed as TFR-IA: ℱI=1k−1​∑ℓ=1k−1ℐℓ,ℓ−ℐk,ℓsubscriptℱ𝐼1𝑘1superscriptsubscriptℓ1𝑘1subscriptℐℓℓsubscriptℐ𝑘ℓ\\mathcal{F}_{I}=\\frac{1}{k-1}\\sum_{\\ell=1}^{k-1}\\mathcal{I}_{\\ell,\\ell}-\\mathcal{I}_{k,\\ell} and TFR-TA: ℱT=1k−1​∑ℓ=1k−1𝒯ℓ,ℓ−𝒯k,ℓsubscriptℱ𝑇1𝑘1superscriptsubscriptℓ1𝑘1subscript𝒯ℓℓsubscript𝒯𝑘ℓ\\mathcal{F}_{T}=\\frac{1}{k-1}\\sum_{\\ell=1}^{k-1}\\mathcal{T}_{\\ell,\\ell}-\\mathcal{T}_{k,\\ell} by following , where ℐℓ,ℓsubscriptℐℓℓ\\mathcal{I}_{\\ell,\\ell} and 𝒯ℓ,ℓsubscript𝒯ℓℓ\\mathcal{T}_{\\ell,\\ell} denote IA and TA metrics of the ℓℓ\\ell-th generation task, and ℐk,ℓsubscriptℐ𝑘ℓ\\mathcal{I}_{k,\\ell} and 𝒯k,ℓsubscript𝒯𝑘ℓ\\mathcal{T}_{k,\\ell} denote IA and TA metrics of the ℓℓ\\ell-th task after learning the k𝑘k-th generation task.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: Datasets: We follow the dataset setting in DreamBooth [ref]29 and Custom\nDiffusion [ref]31, and adopt the collected 35 subjects in our experimental section, which contains unique pets and objects such as dogs, cats, backpacks and toys.
