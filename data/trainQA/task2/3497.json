      "content": "Paper Title: Robust static and dynamic maximum flows\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this work, we study the robust maximum flow problem in a network with arc\nfailures or delays on arcs.\nAn optimal solution to this problem maximizes the flow reaching a sink tùë°t from a\nsource sùë†s in the case that at most ŒìŒì\\Gamma arcs might fail or be delayed, following\nthe prominent ŒìŒì\\Gamma-approach in robust optimization .\nThe robust maximum flow problem under arc failure has been subject of\nvarious publications in which different models are discussed.\nIn , the authors present a polynomial time algorithm for\ncomputing a solution maximizing the remaining flow when one arc fails.\nThis model is extended to multiple arc failures\nby considering the sùë†s-tùë°t-path¬†decomposition of a flow in .\nIn this model, an arc failure has the effect that the flow on all paths that\ncontain the failing arc is deleted.\nThe goal is to find a flow and its sùë†s-tùë°t-path¬†decomposition such that the guaranteed remaining flow is maximized even if ŒìŒì\\Gamma arcs fail.\nWe call this formulation path model (1)¬†in the following.\nFor Œì=2Œì2{\\Gamma=2},  claimed that the problem is\nNP-hard. However,  pointed out a flaw in the arguments,\nso that the complexity of (1)¬†for fixed Œì‚â•2Œì2\\Gamma\\geq 2 is still open.\nFurther,  show that the problem is NP-hard if ŒìŒì\\Gamma\nis part of the input.\nAnother model for the robust maximum flow problem, which we call arc model (2), is given in :\nflow is assigned to arcs and has to satisfy weak flow conservation\nat every node in every possible scenario, which makes this model quite restrictive.\nHowever, a great advantage of this model is that an optimal solution can be found in\npolynomial time for arbitrary ŒìŒì\\Gamma.\nApart from that,  introduce an adaptive model and also\npropose an approximation for (1), which was later improved in\n. Our main contribution to this setting is the introduction of a new general model\n(3), which combines the properties of the arc model (2)¬†and the path\nmodel (1)¬†and which covers them as special cases:\ninstead of assigning flow to arcs or sùë†s-tùë°t-paths, we assign flow to subpaths.\nTherefore, (3)¬†extends our understanding of robust maximum flows and, in\nparticular, on the connection between (1)¬†and (2), which seemed to\nbe unrelated.\nWe extend most of the NP-hardness results for (1)¬†given in \nto (3).\nWe also show that (3)¬†remains solvable in polynomial time in\nmany special cases for which (1)¬†is solvable in polynomial time,\nfor example if only one arc may fail.\nAdditionally, we provide comparisons\nof the robust optimal values of the three\nmodels and present instances with specific graph structures for which (3)¬†indeed yields better robust optimal values, highlighting the relevance of the new model. The flows in the former setting are independent of time and are thus called static flows.\nHowever, in many applications a time component has to be considered.\nIn detail, every arc in the network is associated with a transit time, or travel time,\nthe flow needs to traverse the arc.\nWe extend our study to these dynamic flows, in the literature often also called flows over time.\nIn the nominal dynamic maximum flow problem,\nthe goal is to maximize the flow that reaches the sink within a given time horizon.\nThis problem was first introduced by Ford and Fulkerson in .\nFor a more recent overview, we refer to e.g. .\nTo the best of our knowledge, there are only two publications\non the theory of robust dynamic maximum flows.\nIn , an adaptive robust model is introduced for the case that arcs\nmight fail.\nIn , one instead assumes that at most ŒìŒì\\Gamma arcs are delayed.\nClearly, if this delay is chosen to be greater than the time horizon, this corresponds to\narc failure.\nThe model in , which we call dynamic path model (11),\nis path-based and can be seen as a generalization of (1)¬†to flows over time.\n prove several results on the complexity of (11)¬†and they also show\nthat temporally repeated flows, a solution concept in the\nnominal case, are not optimal in the robust setting but satisfy certain approximation guarantees. In the dynamic setting, the path model (11)¬†is quite restrictive due to the strict\nflow conservation and capacity constraints for any possible delay and therefore yields\nvery conservative solutions as mentioned in .\nWe address this issue by introducing two new models, the dynamic arc model (12)¬†and\nthe dynamic general model (13).\nThese models are analogous extensions of their static counterparts.\nAgain, we show that (13)¬†contains (11)¬†and (12)¬†as special cases\nand therefore is a relaxation of them.\nIn terms of the computational complexity of the models, we answer an open question\nfrom  by proving that (11)¬†is already NP-hard for one delayed arc,\nwhich is in contrast to the polynomial time solvability in the static case.\nFurther, we clarify the complexity of the new models.\nWhile (13)¬†is NP-hard in all considered cases, (12)¬†is solvable in polynomial\ntime regardless of the number of delayed arcs.\nAs in the static case, we compare the robust values of all three models\nand show that (13)¬†yields the best robust optimal values on all instances\ncompared to the other models.\nThus, we extend the analysis of robust dynamic maximum flows to a\nsimilar basis as for the static case.\n\n The robust maximum flow problem under arc failure can be seen as the opposite version of\nthe network interdiction problem.\nWhile in the robust flow problem the maximum flow is sought under the knowledge\nthat ŒìŒì\\Gamma arcs will be deleted, in the network interdiction problem the task is to\nfind a subset of ŒìŒì\\Gamma arcs whose removal minimizes the maximum flow value in\nthe remaining network, cf. 0 1, or [ref]9 for recent\nhardness results.\nAnother related problem is the so called maximum\nmultiroute flow problem, cf. .\nA solution to this problem is expressed as the conic combination of\nflows on arc-disjoint paths and\nthus the failure of an arc only destroys a certain fraction of the total flow.\n obtain a (Œì+1)Œì1(\\Gamma+1)-approximation to (1)¬†with this concept.\nEstablishing appropriate robust flow models and clarifying\nalgorithmic complexities is also relevant for the study of\nmore general tasks where a minimum-cost robust layout of a\nnetwork is to be determined, cf.¬† [ref]8.\n\n This paper is structured as follows:\nin the next section we state necessary definitions and notation that\nwe will use throughout the paper.\nIn Section¬†3, we consider robust static maximum flows.\nWe present the two known robust maximum flow models, (1)¬†and (2),\nin Section¬†3.1 and introduce the new model (3).\nWe prove several results on the complexity of (3)¬†in\nSection¬†3.2.\nIn Section¬†3.3, we compare the solution quality\nof the three models.\nThe section on robust dynamic maximum flows, Section¬†4,\nis structured similarly.\nIn Section¬†4.1, we discuss (11)¬†\nand state the new models, (12)¬†and (13).\nWe present complexity results for the three models in\nSection¬†4.2.\nIn Section¬†4.3, we compare the solution quality\nof the models,\nfollowed by a brief discussion of possible approximation approaches for\n(13)¬†in Section¬†4.4.\nFinally, in Section¬†5, we collect open questions and discuss further\nresearch directions.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: ŒìŒì\\Gamma arcs will be deleted, in the network interdiction problem the task is to\nfind a subset of ŒìŒì\\Gamma arcs whose removal minimizes the maximum flow value in\nthe remaining network, cf. 0 1, or [ref]9 for recent\nhardness results.\nAnother related problem is the so called maximum\nmultiroute flow problem, cf. .\nA solution to this problem is expressed as the conic combination of\nflows on\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
