      "content": "Paper Title: The Structure of Hypergraphs Arising in Cellular Mobile Communication Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCombinatorial interference models for wireless communication networks such as conflict graphs and conflict hypergraphs have been widely studied in the literature, and the performance of various protocols and distributed algorithms for resource allocation and scheduling have been investigated using these models. The combinatorial objects that arise in this context due to geometric, graph-theoretic, or physical (SINR) constraints have additional structure that can be exploited to design efficient algorithms that are guaranteed to be close to optimal for various problems. For example, unit disk graphs have additional structure - the interference degree of a unit disk graph (defined below) is at most 555 - and this implies that the performance of the distributed maximal scheduling algorithm is a factor of at most 555 away from optimal. An open problem in the literature that we consider in the present work is to extend the results in the literature on unit disk graphs to hypergraph models. When entities in a network compete for resources, the competition can be modeled by a conflict graph, whose vertices correspond to the entities and whose edges correspond to pairs of vertices that cannot be assigned the same resource. Thus, many resource allocation and scheduling problems are variations of the problem of coloring the conflict graph  . In a wireless network, nodes which are in the same vicinity interfere with each other and correspond to adjacent vertices in the conflict graph . Given the conflict graph of a wireless network and the fraction of each unit of time that each node demands to be active, the admission control problem is to determine whether the set of demands is feasible. The optimal, centralized version of the admission control problem is NP-hard . A distributed algorithm for the admission control problem that relies only on localized information and has low processing complexity is maximal scheduling [ref]46, also known as rate constraints   or row constraints . The interference degree of a graph is the maximum number of vertices that are neighbors of a vertex and that are pairwise nonadjacent. In    it was shown that in the worst case, the performance of the maximal scheduling algorithm is away from optimal by a factor equal to the interference degree of the conflict graph. In some real world problems, the conflict graph has additional structure, based on geometric or other constraints, which can be exploited to give efficient algorithms whose suboptimality is bounded by a fixed constant. For example, consider a wireless network whose nodes are equipped with omnidirectional antennas and have the same transmission range. Suppose two nodes interfere with each other whenever unit disks centered at their locations intersect . The resulting conflict graph is called a unit disk graph. The interference degree of a unit disk graph is at most 555 . By the results in the preceding paragraph, the maximal scheduling algorithm is a factor of 555 away from optimal in the worst case for unit disk graphs  . An open problem in the literature (cf. [15, p. 1333]) is to extend the results in the literature on unit disk graphs to hypergraph models. Hypergraph interference models and physical (SINR) models capture certain complexities which cannot be captured by graphs and hence achieve better performance     . For example, in a wireless network with three nodes, it is possible for the interference to be such that any two nodes can be simultaneously active, and if all three nodes are simultaneously active then the interference is intolerable. A subset of nodes that causes intolerance interference is called a forbidden set. The interference can be modeled by a hypergraph, whose hyperedges are the minimal forbidden sets. A maximal scheduling algorithm for wireless networks under the hypergraph interference model was proposed in . The interference degree of a hypergraph was defined in  and was shown to characterize the worst-case performance of the maximal scheduling algorithm. In the present work, we investigate the interference degree of structured hypergraphs. The problem of computing the interference degree of a hypergraph is shown to be NP-hard, and the interference degree of certain structured hypergraphs is determined. We also investigate which hypergraphs are realizable, i.e. which hypergraphs arise as the interference model of a wireless network. For various values of the path loss exponent, we determine the maximal value of r𝑟r such that the hypergraph K1,rsubscript𝐾1𝑟K_{1,r} is realizable. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the system model; formal definitions of the unit disk graph model and hypergraph model are given, and the interference degree of a hypergraph is defined. Section 3 discusses related work. In Section 4, we show that the problem of computing the interference degree of a hypergraph is NP-hard and determine the interference degree of some structured hypergraphs. In Section 5 we prove some preliminary results, which are used in Section 6, Section 7, Section 8, and Section 9 to prove that certain hypergraphs are not realizable when α=4,3,2𝛼432\\alpha=4,3,2 and 111, respectively. In Section 10, these results are extended to nonintegral values of the path loss exponent α𝛼\\alpha. In Section 11 some results concerning the hypergraphs of line networks are obtained. Section 12 contains concluding remarks.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: the admission control problem is NP-hard .
