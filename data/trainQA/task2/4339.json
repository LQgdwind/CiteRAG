      "content": "Paper Title: Revealing Unfair Models by Mining Interpretable Evidence\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDiscrimination and fairness are like two sides of the same coin.\nA low level of fairness usually means a high level of discrimination.\nTherefore, we can measure the significance of discrimination of a machine learning model based on the fairness measurements of the model    [ref]22  . Existing model fairness measurements can be categorized into the following two major categories. The individual fairness measurements  [ref]40 evaluate whether a data instance is treated fairly by a model by investigating how likely a pair of similar instances receive similar predictions from the model.\nA data instance is said to be treated fairly by the model if it receives a similar prediction with that of another similar data instance. The group fairness measurements   [ref]22   evaluate the fairness of a model on all data instances by evaluating how balanced the predictions of the model are on a pre-defined pair of protected groups of data instaces (e.g., the group of ‘female’ versus the group of ‘male’). Since our goal is to reveal the unfairness of a trained machine learning model, we are more interested in measuring the fairness of the model on all data instances instead of individual data instances.\nTherefore, the group fairness measurements are more suitable for our task. Many group fairness measurements have been developed in literature, such as disparate impact , demographic parity   [ref]22, difference of F1-scores , equal odds , and equal opportunities .\nMany of these measurements can be incorporated into our proposed framework to reveal the unfairness of models.\nWithout loss of generality, we focus on developing our framework based on demographic parity   [ref]22.\nIn the end of Section III-B,\nwe will discuss the key idea to incorporate some other group fairness measurements into our framework. Next, we give a brief introduction to demographic parity   [ref]22 and extend it to a discrimination score to measure the discrimination significance of a model on a group of data instances. Denote by g𝑔g a trained classification model and by 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} a set of data instances.\nAmong all the classes, we assume that there is one favorable class/prediction. The choice of favorable prediction is application dependent. For example, it may be getting a mortgage application approved in a bank or a suspect being freed by a law system. We denote by 𝚏𝚊𝚟𝚏𝚊𝚟\\mathtt{fav} the favorable class/prediction. Denote by 𝒮⊂𝒟𝒮𝒟\\mathcal{S}\\subset\\mathcal{D} a group of data instances in 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} and by 𝒟∖𝒮𝒟𝒮\\mathcal{D}\\setminus\\mathcal{S} the other group containing the rest of the data instances in 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}.\nLet ℙ​(𝚏𝚊𝚟∣𝒮)ℙconditional𝚏𝚊𝚟𝒮\\mathbb{P}(\\mathtt{fav}\\mid\\mathcal{S}) and ℙ​(𝚏𝚊𝚟∣𝒟∖𝒮)ℙconditional𝚏𝚊𝚟𝒟𝒮\\mathbb{P}(\\mathtt{fav}\\mid\\mathcal{D}\\setminus\\mathcal{S}) be the probabilities of a data instance 𝐱∈𝒟𝐱𝒟\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathcal{D} receiving a favorable prediction from g𝑔g when 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} is uniformly sampled from 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} and 𝒟∖𝒮𝒟𝒮\\mathcal{D}\\setminus\\mathcal{S}, respectively. According to the definition of demographic parity   [ref]22, the model g𝑔g is said to be fair with respect to the groups 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} and 𝒟∖𝒮𝒟𝒮\\mathcal{D}\\setminus\\mathcal{S} if which means the instances in the groups 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} and 𝒟∖𝒮𝒟𝒮\\mathcal{D}\\setminus\\mathcal{S} have equal probabilities of receiving favorable predictions. Demographic parity is a boolean measurement that only tells whether a model is fair or not. It cannot be directly applied to measure the discrimination significance of a model.\nTherefore, we extend demographic parity to compute the discrimination score of g𝑔g on 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} as which has a real valued range from −11-1 to 111 to measure the significance of discrimination of a model. If D​S​c​o​r​e​(𝒮)=0𝐷𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝒮0DScore(\\mathcal{S})=0, then ℙ​(𝚏𝚊𝚟∣𝒮)=ℙ​(𝚏𝚊𝚟∣𝒟∖𝒮)ℙconditional𝚏𝚊𝚟𝒮ℙconditional𝚏𝚊𝚟𝒟𝒮\\mathbb{P}(\\mathtt{fav}\\mid\\mathcal{S})=\\mathbb{P}(\\mathtt{fav}\\mid\\mathcal{D}\\setminus\\mathcal{S}), thus the model g𝑔g is fair. If D​S​c​o​r​e​(𝒮)∈[−1,0)𝐷𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝒮10DScore(\\mathcal{S})\\in[-1,0), then ℙ​(𝚏𝚊𝚟∣𝒮)>ℙ​(𝚏𝚊𝚟∣𝒟∖𝒮)ℙconditional𝚏𝚊𝚟𝒮ℙconditional𝚏𝚊𝚟𝒟𝒮\\mathbb{P}(\\mathtt{fav}\\mid\\mathcal{S})>\\mathbb{P}(\\mathtt{fav}\\mid\\mathcal{D}\\setminus\\mathcal{S}), which means a data instance in 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} has a higher probability to receive a favorable prediction than a data instance in 𝒟∖𝒮𝒟𝒮\\mathcal{D}\\setminus\\mathcal{S}.\nTherefore, the group 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} is not discriminated by the model g𝑔g. If D​S​c​o​r​e​(𝒮)∈(0,1]𝐷𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝒮01DScore(\\mathcal{S})\\in(0,1], then ℙ​(𝚏𝚊𝚟∣𝒮)<ℙ​(𝚏𝚊𝚟∣𝒟∖𝒮)ℙconditional𝚏𝚊𝚟𝒮ℙconditional𝚏𝚊𝚟𝒟𝒮\\mathbb{P}(\\mathtt{fav}\\mid\\mathcal{S})<\\mathbb{P}(\\mathtt{fav}\\mid\\mathcal{D}\\setminus\\mathcal{S}), which means a data instance in 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} has a lower probability to receive a favorable prediction than a data instance in 𝒟∖𝒮𝒟𝒮\\mathcal{D}\\setminus\\mathcal{S}. Therefore, the group 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} is discriminated by the model g𝑔g. A larger value of D​S​c​o​r​e​(𝒮)𝐷𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝒮DScore(\\mathcal{S}) means that an instance in 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S}\nhas a lower probability to receive a favorable prediction than an instance in 𝒟∖𝒮𝒟𝒮\\mathcal{D}\\setminus\\mathcal{S}, which further indicates a more significant discrimination on 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S}.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: of fairness usually means a high level of discrimination.\nTherefore, we can measure the significance of discrimination of a machine learning model based on the fairness measurements of the model    [ref]22  .
