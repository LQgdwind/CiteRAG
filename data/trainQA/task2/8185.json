The APOP was introduced in [ref]8 for the CMA-ES and tested on a larger set of noiseless functions.\nThe basic idea is to count the number of (median-)fitness deteriorations within the last L𝐿L generations (in [ref]8 they use a fixed length L=5𝐿5L=5).\nDefining the median over selected f𝑓f-values as fmed(g)≔median⁡(fm;λ(g))≔superscriptsubscript𝑓med𝑔mediansuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝑚𝜆𝑔f_{\\mathrm{med}}^{(g)}\\coloneqq\\operatorname{median}(f_{m;\\lambda}^{(g)}), m=1,…,μ𝑚1…𝜇m=1,...,\\mu, the difference is given by Then, the ratio Pfsubscript𝑃𝑓P_{f} is evaluated by counting the occurrence of Δ​f(g)>0Δsuperscript𝑓𝑔0\\Delta f^{(g)}>0.\nOne has L−1𝐿1L-1 differences for L𝐿L values of fmed(g)superscriptsubscript𝑓med𝑔f_{\\mathrm{med}}^{(g)}.\nUsing the indicator function 𝟙1\\mathbbm{1}, the ratio yields A threshold 𝒯f=1/5subscript𝒯𝑓15\\mathcal{T}_{f}=1/5 is chosen in [ref]8 based on empirical studies and will be adopted.\nPf>𝒯fsubscript𝑃𝑓subscript𝒯𝑓P_{f}>\\mathcal{T}_{f} triggers a population increase due to insufficient performance, for Pf=𝒯fsubscript𝑃𝑓subscript𝒯𝑓P_{f}=\\mathcal{T}_{f} no change occurs, and for Pf<𝒯fsubscript𝑃𝑓subscript𝒯𝑓P_{f}<\\mathcal{T}_{f} the population is decreased.\nAs for all the PCS considered here, the respective threshold value 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} has significant influence on the performance of the PCS and exchanging the CSA will lead to notable performance differences on simple test functions. The pcCMSA was introduced in  and further analyzed in .\nIt was originally introduced as a covariance-matrix self-adaptive ES for population control on noisy functions and later tested on multimodal functions in .\nIn this paper, only the hypothesis test for convergence is implemented using a CSA, calling it pcCSA.\nIn  it is argued that stagnation or divergence behavior coincides with a non-negative trend within the observed\nfitness value dynamics of the ES (for minimization).\nFor a trend analysis, a regression model of the parental recombinant fitness sequence f​(𝐲(g))𝑓superscript𝐲𝑔f(\\mathbf{y}^{(g)}) of length L𝐿L is used and a hypothesis test on the slope is done.\nThe (fluctuating) fitness dynamics f𝑓f is modeled assuming a linear model with slope a𝑎a, intercept b𝑏b, and random normal fluctuations ϵisubscriptitalic-ϵ𝑖\\epsilon_{i} as f(g)=a​g+b+ϵisuperscript𝑓𝑔𝑎𝑔𝑏subscriptitalic-ϵ𝑖f^{(g)}=ag+b+\\epsilon_{i}.\nDenoting the standard error of the estimated slope a^^𝑎\\hat{a} as sa^subscript𝑠^𝑎s_{\\hat{a}}, the (standardized) test statistic is a t𝑡t-distributed variate with L−2𝐿2L-2 degrees of freedom The hypothesis test is defined as H0subscript𝐻0H_{0}: a≥0𝑎0a\\geq 0, indicating no significant trend and insufficient performance.\nThe alternative H1subscript𝐻1H_{1}: a<0𝑎0a<0 indicates sufficient performance.\nWe will evaluate the P𝑃P-value of the test (Pt,L−2subscript𝑃𝑡𝐿2P_{t,L-2} denoting the distribution function of T𝑇T with L−2𝐿2L-2 degrees of freedom) rejecting H0subscript𝐻0H_{0} at a significance level PH<0.05subscript𝑃𝐻0.05P_{H}<0.05 (𝒯H=0.05subscript𝒯𝐻0.05\\mathcal{T}_{H}=0.05).\nIn this case, μ𝜇\\mu is decreased, or otherwise increased. The core ideas of the PSA-CMA-ES were introduced in  and further extended in .\nIt is based on the idea of measuring the change of search space parameters, namely the covariance matrix 𝐂𝐂\\mathbf{C} and the mean search vector 𝐲𝐲\\mathbf{y}.\nBy accumulating the information using two cumulation paths, their respective lengths are used as an indicator of ES performance.\nThe key element is to distinguish random selection (insufficient performance) from non-random selection (sufficient performance).\nThe measured path lengths are used to change the population size, given a certain threshold.\nIn contrast to pcCSA and APOP, the performance is measured solely in search space and not in f𝑓f-space\n222Note that  and  elaborate the similarities between their update equations and the natural gradient interpretation of the CMA-ES.\nThis is omitted at this point since we will investigate a simplification of the PSA-CMA-ES by only including the CSA without covariance matrix adaptation..The main idea is to define two cumulation paths for the change of the mean Δ​𝐦(g+1)=𝐲(g+1)−𝐲(g)Δsuperscript𝐦𝑔1superscript𝐲𝑔1superscript𝐲𝑔\\Delta\\mathbf{m}^{(g+1)}=\\mathbf{y}^{(g+1)}-\\mathbf{y}^{(g)}, and the change of 𝐂𝐂\\mathbf{C} and σ𝜎\\sigma as Δ​𝚺(g+1)=(σ(g+1))2​𝐂(g+1)−(σ(g))2​𝐂(g)Δsuperscript𝚺𝑔1superscriptsuperscript𝜎𝑔12superscript𝐂𝑔1superscriptsuperscript𝜎𝑔2superscript𝐂𝑔\\Delta\\bm{\\Sigma}^{(g+1)}=(\\sigma^{(g+1)})^{2}\\mathbf{C}^{(g+1)}-(\\sigma^{(g)})^{2}\\mathbf{C}^{(g)}.\nThen, Δ​𝐦(g+1)Δsuperscript𝐦𝑔1\\Delta\\mathbf{m}^{(g+1)} and Δ​𝚺(g+1)Δsuperscript𝚺𝑔1\\Delta\\bm{\\Sigma}^{(g+1)} are transformed using their respective Fisher transformation matrices to achieve invariance w.r.t. the chosen (normal) search space distribution.\nUsing a CSA-ES, i.e., 𝐂=𝐈𝐂𝐈\\mathbf{C}=\\mathbf{I} (identity matrix), the update equations simplify significantly.\nThe detailed derivation is presented in the supplementary material section A-B.\nThe corresponding cumulation paths from eq. A.11 and eq. A.13 yield with 𝟏=[1,…,1]11…1\\mathbf{1}=[1,\\dots,1] of length N𝑁N.\nThe PSA measures the squared norm of eq. 27 and eq. 28.\nAggregating both vectors into a single update vector 𝐩θ(g+1)=(𝐩m(g+1),𝐩c(g+1))superscriptsubscript𝐩𝜃𝑔1subscriptsuperscript𝐩𝑔1𝑚subscriptsuperscript𝐩𝑔1𝑐\\mathbf{p}_{\\theta}^{(g+1)}=(\\mathbf{p}^{(g+1)}_{m},\\mathbf{p}^{(g+1)}_{c}), one evaluates The results of eq. 27 and eq. 28 are notable.\nWhile eq. 27 mirrors the cumulation of the CSA (using a different constant β𝛽\\beta and normalization w.r.t. N𝑁N, see also CSA-update in eq. 14), cumulation eq. 28 aggregates relative σ𝜎\\sigma-changes.\nThe PSA works by measuring ‖𝐩θ‖2=‖𝐩m‖2+‖𝐩c‖2superscriptnormsubscript𝐩𝜃2superscriptnormsubscript𝐩𝑚2superscriptnormsubscript𝐩𝑐2\\norm{\\mathbf{p}_{\\theta}}^{2}=\\norm{\\mathbf{p}_{m}}^{2}+\\norm{\\mathbf{p}_{c}}^{2} and comparing it to the threshold 𝒯θ=1.4subscript𝒯𝜃1.4\\mathcal{T}_{\\theta}=1.4, cf. Fig. fig. 8.\nUnder random selection, one observes ‖𝐩m‖2≈1superscriptnormsubscript𝐩𝑚21\\norm{\\mathbf{p}_{m}}^{2}\\approx 1 and ‖𝐩c‖2⪆0greater-than-or-approximately-equalssuperscriptnormsubscript𝐩𝑐20\\norm{\\mathbf{p}_{c}}^{2}\\gtrapprox 0, which indicates insufficient performance (‖𝐩θ‖2<𝒯θsuperscriptnormsubscript𝐩𝜃2subscript𝒯𝜃\\norm{\\mathbf{p}_{\\theta}}^{2}<\\mathcal{T}_{\\theta}) and increases μ𝜇\\mu.\nRandom selection with ‖𝐩m‖2=1superscriptnormsubscript𝐩𝑚21\\norm{\\mathbf{p}_{m}}^{2}=1 can be obtained by evaluating ‖𝐩m(g+1)‖2superscriptnormsubscriptsuperscript𝐩𝑔1𝑚2||\\mathbf{p}^{(g+1)}_{m}||^{2} in eq. 27.\nAssuming a steady-state in expectation, one has E​[‖𝐩m(g+1)‖2]=E​[‖𝐩m(g)‖2]=‖𝐩m‖2Edelimited-[]superscriptnormsubscriptsuperscript𝐩𝑔1𝑚2Edelimited-[]superscriptnormsubscriptsuperscript𝐩𝑔𝑚2superscriptnormsubscript𝐩𝑚2\\mathrm{E}[||\\mathbf{p}^{(g+1)}_{m}||^{2}]=\\mathrm{E}[||\\mathbf{p}^{(g)}_{m}||^{2}]=||\\mathbf{p}_{m}||^{2}, E​[𝐩m(g)​⟨𝐳⟩(g+1)]=0Edelimited-[]superscriptsubscript𝐩𝑚𝑔superscriptdelimited-⟨⟩𝐳𝑔10\\mathrm{E}[\\mathbf{p}_{m}^{(g)}\\langle\\mathbf{z}\\rangle^{(g+1)}]=0 (no preferred search direction) and E​[‖⟨𝐳⟩‖2]=N/μEdelimited-[]superscriptnormdelimited-⟨⟩𝐳2𝑁𝜇\\mathrm{E}[\\norm{\\langle\\mathbf{z}\\rangle}^{2}]=N/\\mu from [12, (5.2)],\nsuch that one simply gets ‖𝐩m‖2=1superscriptnormsubscript𝐩𝑚21||\\mathbf{p}_{m}||^{2}=1.\nThe analogous calculation holds for the steady-state E​[‖𝐬‖2]=NEdelimited-[]superscriptnorm𝐬2𝑁\\mathrm{E}[||\\mathbf{s}||^{2}]=N of the CSA under random selection.\nFrom the update rules eq. 15 and eq. 16 one infers that σ𝜎\\sigma does not change in expectation. Hence, the contribution of eq. 28 vanishes, giving ‖𝐩c‖2=0superscriptnormsubscript𝐩𝑐20\\norm{\\mathbf{p}_{c}}^{2}=0.\nIf the selection is not random, both ‖𝐩m‖2superscriptnormsubscript𝐩𝑚2\\norm{\\mathbf{p}_{m}}^{2} and ‖𝐩c‖2superscriptnormsubscript𝐩𝑐2\\norm{\\mathbf{p}_{c}}^{2} yield relevant contributions and the population is controlled to maintain ‖𝐩θ‖2≈𝒯θsuperscriptnormsubscript𝐩𝜃2subscript𝒯𝜃\\norm{\\mathbf{p}_{\\theta}}^{2}\\approx\\mathcal{T}_{\\theta}.\nAnalytic investigations of ‖𝐩m‖2superscriptnormsubscript𝐩𝑚2\\norm{\\mathbf{p}_{m}}^{2} and ‖𝐩c‖2superscriptnormsubscript𝐩𝑐2\\norm{\\mathbf{p}_{c}}^{2} in the sphere steady-state are given in the supplementary material section A-C. Before continuing the analysis, the performance measures of the PCS are evaluated with deactivated population control.\nIn Fig. fig. 5, the sphere eq. 30a and random function eq. 30b are evaluated at N=100𝑁100N=100 for three constant μ𝜇\\mu-values.\nThe respective quantities Pfsubscript𝑃𝑓P_{f}, PHsubscript𝑃𝐻P_{H}, and ‖𝐩θ‖2superscriptnormsubscript𝐩𝜃2\\norm{\\mathbf{p}_{\\theta}}^{2} are measured.\nWe are interested in the signal levels in relation to their thresholds.\nPfsubscript𝑃𝑓P_{f} from APOP decreases for increasing μ𝜇\\mu on fsphsubscript𝑓sphf_{\\mathrm{sph}}.\nLarger populations yield less deterioration of the median fitness due to a more robust search.\nNote that at μ=10𝜇10\\mu=10, Pf>𝒯f=0.2subscript𝑃𝑓subscript𝒯𝑓0.2P_{f}>\\mathcal{T}_{f}=0.2 most of the time.\nWith active population control, this would trigger an (undesired) μ𝜇\\mu-increase on the sphere.\nOn fransubscript𝑓ranf_{\\mathrm{ran}}, the signals fluctuate around Pf≈0.5subscript𝑃𝑓0.5P_{f}\\approx 0.5 (above 𝒯fsubscript𝒯𝑓\\mathcal{T}_{f}), successfully indicating bad performance due to random selection.\nFor the pcCSA, PHsubscript𝑃𝐻P_{H} mostly stays below the significance level 𝒯H=0.05subscript𝒯𝐻0.05\\mathcal{T}_{H}=0.05 on the sphere, which indicates good performance.\nOn fransubscript𝑓ranf_{\\mathrm{ran}}, PHsubscript𝑃𝐻P_{H} lies mostly above the threshold, correctly indicating bad performance.\nSporadic f𝑓f-fluctuations may (falsely) indicate good performance.\nFor the PSA, ‖𝐩θ‖2superscriptnormsubscript𝐩𝜃2\\norm{\\mathbf{p}_{\\theta}}^{2} shows different levels depending on μ𝜇\\mu.\nAt μ=10𝜇10\\mu=10, ‖𝐩θ‖2superscriptnormsubscript𝐩𝜃2\\norm{\\mathbf{p}_{\\theta}}^{2} is smaller than the threshold 𝒯θ=1.4subscript𝒯𝜃1.4\\mathcal{T}_{\\theta}=1.4.\nAt μ=100,1000𝜇1001000\\mu=100,1000, it lies above it.\nSimilar to the APOP, the PSA will increase μ𝜇\\mu on the sphere function to reach ‖𝐩θ‖2≈1.4superscriptnormsubscript𝐩𝜃21.4\\norm{\\mathbf{p}_{\\theta}}^{2}\\approx 1.4.\nThis effect is due to the aggregation of relative σ𝜎\\sigma-changes via eq. 28 which increase for larger μ𝜇\\mu due to faster convergence (large ‖𝐩c‖2superscriptnormsubscript𝐩𝑐2\\norm{\\mathbf{p}_{c}}^{2}-contributions compared to ‖𝐩m‖2superscriptnormsubscript𝐩𝑚2\\norm{\\mathbf{p}_{m}}^{2}, see supplementary material section A-C).\nOn the random function, the three signals lie in the vicinity of ‖𝐩θ‖2≈1superscriptnormsubscript𝐩𝜃21\\norm{\\mathbf{p}_{\\theta}}^{2}\\approx 1 mostly due to ‖𝐩m‖2≈1superscriptnormsubscript𝐩𝑚21\\norm{\\mathbf{p}_{m}}^{2}\\approx 1 and vanishing ‖𝐩c‖2⪆0greater-than-or-approximately-equalssuperscriptnormsubscript𝐩𝑐20\\norm{\\mathbf{p}_{c}}^{2}\\gtrapprox 0 (fluctuations can be observed).\nIn general, the PSA detects random selection well.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: For the subsequent investigations, three state-of-the-art PCS are implemented based on [ref]8 (APOP),  (pcCMSA), and  (PSA).\nThese algorithms were designed and tested for adaptive population control on ES for a broader range of functions (noisy and/or multimodal, details below).\nAs for\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
