      "content": "Paper Title: Token-Label Alignment for Vision Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImplementation Details.\nWe first evaluate TL-Align on ImageNet [ref]35 for image classification.\nImageNet [ref]35 contains ∼similar-to\\sim 1.2M training images and 50K validation images from 1K categories and is a widely-used benchmark for performance evaluation.\nWe implement our method based on PyTorch  and the timm library .\nWe conduct experiments on various transformer architectures: three variants of DeiT [ref]40 (DeiT-T, DeiT-S, and DeiT-B), two variants of PVT  (PVT-T, PVT-S) and three variants of Swin Transformer  (Swin-T, Swin-S, and Swin-B).\nFor tiny and small models, we train from scratch for 300 epochs following the same training recipe using CutMix as DeiT [ref]40, PVT  and Swin .\nWe keep all the data augmentation policies and all hyperparameter settings unchanged for fair comparisons.\nThe only modification is that we replace the mixing targets in CutMiX with the labels obtained by our TL-Align.\nFor base models (i.e., Deit-B and Swin-B), we finetune the official pre-trained models for 40 epochs with a constant learning rate of 1e-5 and a weight decay of 1e-8. Performance on Different Architectures.\nAs shown in Table 1, TL-Align steadily improves the performance of different vision transformer architectures.\nSpecifically, TL-Align boosts the top-1 accuracy of DeiT-T, DeiT-S, and DeiT-B by 1.0%, 0.8%, and 0.5%, respectively, in a parameter-free manner.\nMoreover, our method is generalizable and can be directly applied to hierarchical vision transformers like Swin.\nIt is worth noting that most existing methods need either architecture modifications (adding a class token in  [ref]7) or extra computations (saliency map extraction in ) when applied to Swin.\nIn contrast, our TL-Align method can be used as a plug-and-play module and achieves consistent improvement on variants of Swin. Comparison with Other Training Strategies.\nWe also compare our method with the state-of-the-art training strategies for data mixing on DeiT-S, including CutMix , Puzzle-Mix , SaliencyMix , Attentive-CutMix , and TransMix [ref]7.\nSpecifically, we train the DeiT-S model while only disabling CutMix as the baseline method, which is denoted as Vanilla in Table 2.\nMoreover, since TransMix [ref]7 reports the EMA accuracy with different hyperparameters, we reproduce it under the same training recipe [ref]40 for a fair comparison.\nAs demonstrated in Table 2, TL-Align shows significantly better performance than the other mixup variants while maintaining the number of parameters and training speed.\nPuzzle-Mix obtains the same classification accuracy as CutMix but results in a much lower training speed as it relies on an extra model to get the optimal solution.\nSaliencyMix and Attentive-CutMix lead to performance degeneration when built upon DeiT-S backbone.\nNotably, our method also achieves higher top-1 accuracy than ViT-targeted TransMix.\nDue to the token fluctuation phenomenon, the class token attention utilization in TransMix can not reflect the actual contribution of different tokens.\nDifferently, TL-Align obtains accurate alignment of the tokens and labels, resulting in improved performance.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: Implementation Details.\nWe first evaluate TL-Align on ImageNet [ref]35 for image classification.\nImageNet [ref]35 contains ∼similar-to\\sim 1.2M training images and 50K validation images from 1K categories and is a widely-used benchmark for performance\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
