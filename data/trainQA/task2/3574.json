      "content": "Paper Title: KPE: Keypoint Pose Encoding for Transformer-based Image Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMost GAN-based text-to-image models such as StackGAN[ref]8, AttenGAN[ref]9, DM-GAN[ref]10, DF-GAN and XMC-GAN are forms of conditional GAN  where the text sequence is projected to an embedding vector as a conditioning feature, i.e. the text is modelled as continuous variables. More recently, researchers turned their attention to the transformer architecture that has proven to excel in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Instead of using a single embedding vector for the entire word sequence, it is encoded into a sequence of discrete text tokens. Each token is then projected into the transformer‚Äôs embedding space. The transformer is trained to predict the text tokens autoregressively in sequence. However, there are challenges in applying the transformer to computer vision tasks. The high dimensionality of image pixels makes it computationally expensive as the transformer computational complexity is O‚Äã(N2)ùëÇsuperscriptùëÅ2O(N^{2}). Moreover, image pixels are considered continuous real values and do not fit into the discrete token needed by the transformer. DALL-E  addressed these problems by using VQ-VAE which is a variant of dVAE to encode the image into discrete tokens. Hence, both text and image are represented as discrete tokens, allowing the adoption of generic transformers to predict the image tokens from text tokens. The resulting image is generated by feeding the image tokens to the decoder part of dVAE. This method forms the basis of many modern transformer-based text-to-image models such as CogView, N√úWA and Make-a-scene. We employ a similar method to tokenise the text in our models but condition our transformer on a further additional modality, i.e., pose, to enrich the image quality and precision. Recently, a new image generation family known as diffusion models  emerge. In training, noise is added to target image in forward diffusion steps, and a U-Net is trained to predict the noise in reverse diffusion steps to generate images from noise. GLIDE, DALL-E 2 and Imagen applies additional text condition as embedding into U-Net to create text-to-image models. Using our KPE method to create pose embedding has shown to work with diffusion models but the computational benefit is more profound for transformer hence our focus.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Most GAN-based text-to-image models such as StackGAN[ref]8, AttenGAN[ref]9, DM-GAN[ref]10, DF-GAN and XMC-GAN are forms of conditional GAN  where the text sequence is projected to an embedding vector as a conditioning feature, i.e. the text is\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
