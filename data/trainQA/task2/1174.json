      "content": "Paper Title: Video Big Data Analytics in the Cloud: A Reference Architecture, Survey, Opportunities, and Open Research Issues\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA combination of numerous actions, objects, and scenes forms complex events . Video analytics against complex events is a nontrivial task. Complex event detection demands the association of multiple semantic concepts because it is almost impossible to capture the complex event through a single event class label . Video segmentation is required to mine informative segments regarding the event happening in the video. For effective event detection in video segmentation, it is vital to take into account the temporal relations between key segments in a particular event. The event videos hold intra-class variation, and several training videos are required to consider all possible instances of event classes. Song and Wu  suggested a methodology to extract key segments automatically for event detection in videos by learning from a loosely tagged pool of web videos and images. For the positions of key segments and content depiction in the video, they used an adaptive latent structural SVM model and semantic concepts, correspondingly. They also developed two types of models, i.e., Temporal Relation Model and Segment-Event Interaction Model, for the temporal relations between video segments, and for evaluating the correlation between key segments and events respectively. They adapted labeled videos and images from the Web into their model and employed ’N’ adjacent point sample consensus  for noise elimination. A knowledge-base was produced by Zhang et al.  to decrease the semantic gap between complex events. To effectively model event-centric semantic concepts, they used a large-scale of web images for learning noise-resistant classifiers. Action recognition in videos encompasses both segmentation and classification. Action recognition can be tackled by sliding windows and aggregation in sequential as well as isolated manner, or by performing both tasks parallel.   are some of the good examples of video segmentation based event detection. The related literature on video segmentation based action recognition can be classified as action segmentation, a depth-based approach, and deep learning-based motion recognition. The most popular action segmentation model is dynamic time warping scheme . Action segmentation from videos using an appearance-based method considers a comparison between the start and end frames of contiguous actions. Quantity of movement  and KNN along with HOG  are commonly used to identify the start and stop frames of actions. Similarly, for action recognition, depth-based approaches have been developed which consist of binary range-sample feature , capturing local motion and geometry information , histogram oriented 4D normal , and combination of depth motion map and HOG .   [ref]203 have applied deep learning approaches to depth-based action recognition methods. Besides, for motion recognition, deep learning has been utilized in many ways. One is a suboptimal way, in which video represented as still images is fed to the channel of a CNN  . Sometimes video as compact images are given as input to the already trained CNN to achieve good performance [ref]204. Video in the form of a sequence of images is input to the Recurrent neural network (RNN) for sequential parsing of video frames for long as well as short-term patterns  . In order to introduce a temporal dimension, video is regarded as a volume and substitutes the 2D filters of CNN with 3D filters  . In many application areas, e.g., resource tracking, action recognition, human behavior recognition, and traffic control, object tracking and motion detection in videos are vital. The process of detecting moving objects in videos is known as object tracking. For object tracking, initially, the foreground information is extracted in videos, and then the background modeling of the scene is captured using a background subtraction algorithm, i.e., IAGMM  . To increase the accuracy, subsequently, shadow elimination algorithms are applied to the foreground frame . A connected component algorithm is used to determine the bounding box of an object. To ensure frame-to-frame matching of the detected object, a method such as adaptive mean shift  can be used for comparison. Factors like size and distance are used to object matching between frames. Finally, the occlusion scheme is used to detect and resolve occlusion. On the other hand, motion detection can be detected via foreground images extracted by the Gaussian Mixture Model background and connected component algorithm for noise removal. The area of detection is refined using a connected component algorithm and produces the bounding box information of the moving objects . The output of the detection is a binary mask representing the moving object for each frame in a particular sequence. Object detection for moving objects is challenging, especially in the case of shadows and cloud movement . The related literature for moving object detection and classification can be categorized as a stationary camera with a moving object and moving objects with moving camera. In fixed camera video, the background image pixels in each frame remain the same, and thus simple background subtraction techniques are required. The object detection approaches using a fixed camera can be grouped as feature-based, motion-based, classifier-based, and template-based models . Categorization of object tracking in videos into point tracking, kernel tracking, and silhouette tracking as well as feature-based, region-based, and contour-based was performed by  [ref]215 respectively. Unlike a fixed camera, moving object detection with a moving camera is relatively challenging because of camera motion and background modeling for generating foreground and background pixel fails . Trajectory classification involves computing long trajectories for feature point and discriminating trajectories that belong to different objects from those backgrounds using the clustering method. Some recommended algorithms include compensating long term motion based on flow optic technique , bag-of word classifier, and pre-trained CNN method for detecting moving object trajectories . In background modeling based methods, for each sequence, the frame-by-frame background is created utilizing the motion compensation method. Some popular algorithms are Mixture of Gaussian , complex homography , gaussian-based method , adaptiveMoG , multi-layer homography transform , thresholding , and CNN-based method  for background modeling. In extension of background subtraction method, low rank and sparse matrix decomposition method for static camera  are extended to moving camera. If there exists coherency between a set of image frames, then a low-rank representation of the matrix created by these frames contains the coherency, and the sparse matrix representation contains the outliers, which represents the moving object in these frames. Low rank and sparse decomposition involve segmenting moving objects from the fixed background by applying principal component pursuit. It is a valuable technique in background modeling. Mathematical formula and optimization of this method can be found in .\n\nReference markers found: [203]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]203: have been developed which consist of binary range-sample feature , capturing local motion and geometry information , histogram oriented 4D normal , and combination of depth motion map and HOG .
