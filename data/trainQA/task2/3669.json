Here, 𝒙​(0)∼p0similar-to𝒙0subscript𝑝0\\bm{x}(0)\\sim p_{0}, where p0=pdatasubscript𝑝0subscript𝑝datap_{0}=p_{\\text{data}}, and p1subscript𝑝1p_{1} approximates isotropic Gaussian distribution. In other words, the data distribution is transformed to a tractable Gaussian as t↦1maps-to𝑡1t\\mapsto 1. To formally represent this, we first introduce the following forward SDE where 𝒇𝒇\\bm{f} is a linear drift coefficient, g𝑔g is a scalar diffusion coefficient, and 𝒘𝒘\\bm{w} is a standard D𝐷D-dimensional Wiener process. In our case, we define 𝒇,g𝒇𝑔\\bm{f},g to be with This choice is called variance exploding SDE (VE-SDE) 7, and is widely used due to its impressive sample quality. By Anderson’s theorem , we subsequently have the following reverse SDE where the differential d​t𝑑𝑡dt indicate time running backwards, and 𝒘¯¯𝒘\\bar{{\\bm{w}}} is again a standard D𝐷D-dimensional Wiener process running backwards in time. Here, we see that the reverse SDE involves the score function (i.e. gradient of the log probability). In order to estimate the score function, denoising score matching [ref]28 objective is used, which sidesteps the difficulties, and makes the training easily scalable to higher dimensions [ref]29. More specifically, we train a time-conditional neural network 𝒔θ​(𝒙,t)subscript𝒔𝜃𝒙𝑡{\\bm{s}}_{\\theta}(\\bm{x},t) with the following objective: where U​(0,1)𝑈01U(0,1) denotes the uniform distribution in the interval  01 .\nHere, we use the fact that the perturbation kernel ∇𝒙log⁡p0​t​(𝒙​(t)|𝒙​(0))subscript∇𝒙subscript𝑝0𝑡conditional𝒙𝑡𝒙0\\nabla_{{\\bm{x}}}\\log p_{0t}({\\bm{x}}(t)|{\\bm{x}}(0)) is always Gaussian when 𝒇𝒇\\bm{f} is chosen to be affine, which is trivially true in our case. Hence, the derivative with respect to 𝒙𝒙\\bm{x} can be computed analytically, which makes the training procedure simple and scalable. Once the network is optimized via (5), one can plug in the trained score function to numerically solve (4). This can be done by e.g. Euler-Maruyama discretization 7, or higher order methods . On the other hand, one can use predictor-corrector (PC) samplers 7, which alternate between numerical SDE solver and Langevin dynamics .\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: running backwards in time.
