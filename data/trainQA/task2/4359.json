      "content": "Paper Title: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis for Self-attention in Convolutional Neural Network♣\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLottery Tickets Hypothesis (LTH). The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis  conjectures that: every random initialized and dense NN contains a subnetwork that can be trained in isolation with the original initialization to achieve comparable performance to the original NN. This original LTH attracts many researchers to rethink the training of the overparameterized model, leading to variants of LTH under different learning paradigms and machine learning fields 1   On the other hand, Malach et al.  try to prove a LTH variants 1 by showing that given a target NN of depth l𝑙l and width d𝑑d, any random initialized network with depth 2​l2𝑙2l and width O​(d5​l2/ϵ2)𝑂superscript𝑑5superscript𝑙2superscriptitalic-ϵ2O\\left(d^{5}l^{2}/\\epsilon^{2}\\right) contains subnetworks that can approximate the target network with ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon error. Following works   further reduce the width to O​(d​log⁡(d​l/ϵ))𝑂𝑑𝑑𝑙italic-ϵO(d\\log(dl/\\epsilon)) for the random initialized network. Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Designing a satisfactory neural architecture automatically, also known as neural architecture search, is of significant interest for academics and industries. Such a problem may always be formulated as searching for the optimal combination of different network granularities. The early NAS works require expensive computational costs for scratch-training a massive number of architecture candidates  . To alleviate the searching cost, the recent advances of one-shot approaches for NAS bring up the concept of supernet based on the weight-sharing heuristic. Supernet serves as the search space embodiment of the candidate architectures, and it is trained by optimizing different sub-networks from the sampling paths, e.g., SPOS , GreedyNAS . Self-Attention Mechanism. The self-attention mechanism is widely used in CNNs for computer vision [ref]2  [ref]5   . Squeeze-Excitation (SE) module [ref]2 leverages global average pooling to extract the channel-wise statistics and learns the non-mutually-exclusive relationship between channels. Spatial Group-wise Enhance (SGE) module  learns to recalibrate features by saliency factors learned from different groups of the feature maps. Dense-Implicit-Attention (DIA) module [ref]5 captures the layer-wise feature interrelation with a recurrent neural network (RNN).\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: it is trained by optimizing different sub-networks from the sampling paths, e.g., SPOS , GreedyNAS .
