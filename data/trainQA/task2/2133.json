      "content": "Paper Title: SDGMNet: Statistic-based Dynamic Gradient Modulation for Local Descriptor Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEvaluating local correspondences of images is a fundamental problem in many computer vision tasks, such as visual localization¬†, image registration¬† and retrieval¬†. For this purpose, the classic two-stage pipeline including keypoint detection and patch description was proposed decades ago. Although promising end-to-end methods¬†     spring up in recent years, the traditional pipeline remains competitive due to its robustness and efficiency in practice¬†. Moreover, deep local descriptors¬†   4 6 [ref]11   1 5     that are learned with deep neural networks have noticeably outperformed their hand-crafted counterparts,¬†e.g., SIFT¬†, and boosted the performance of the two-stage pipeline. Therefore, local descriptors based on deep learning merit deeper study. Benefiting from the great potentials of Deep Neural Network (DNN), deep local descriptors dispense with heuristic designs to acquire invariance as early efforts¬†  did. Overall, local descriptor learning is exactly a branch of metric learning¬†5. Specifically, this task aims to encode local patches into discriminative descriptors, and then predict whether pairs of patches are matching or not according to distances between descriptors. To train the encoder, we need to minimize the distance of matching/positive pairs and maximize non-matching/negative ones in the loss function. Various loss functions taking pairs as basic units are proposed, such as softmax loss with deep metric¬†, pair-wise loss¬†, triplet loss¬† 3, n-pair loss¬†4 and ranking loss¬†[ref]11. Particularly, HardNet¬†3 constructs a potent triplet loss by mining hard negatives in L2Net¬†4 batch. Recent works mainly focus on modifying this loss due to its simplicity and superiority. Besides imposing extra regularization¬†6  or resampling patches¬†, most modifications¬† 1 5   devote to modulating gradients of pairs according to their hardness of discriminating or identifying. Specifically, if an individual positive pair is too distant to identify, its back-propagated gradients should be weighted more largely during optimization. In contrast, the weight for a hard negative pair that is closer should be larger. Moreover, the hardness of Siamese pairs that share the same anchor also deserves attentions. This kind of hardness can be similarly defined with relative distance. These principles for gradient modulation are so-called hard example mining (HEM). We briefly illustrate them in Fig.¬†1. HEM also dominates the design of pair-based loss functions in other metric learning tasks¬†7     9 1 . Their successes demonstrate the significance of gradient modulation. However, most modulations are static. The values of the modulation functions depend on individual pairs or Siamese pairs, but do not involve the training phase or the global information. Such modulations suffer from changes of training phases and datasets. Thus, standing on modulating the gradients of individual pairs and Siamese pairs, we concentrate on proposing a dynamic modulation for local descriptor learning. Drawing on global statistical characteristics that are dynamically estimated is promising. Statistics can provide global information that varies over time and datasets, which makes the learning adaptive. While we are formulating a statistic-based dynamic gradient modulation, more details should be explored. Firstly, related works¬† 7 indicate that once a specific metric,¬†e.g., L2subscriptùêø2L_{2} distance or inner product is chosen, an implicit modulation harbored in deep back propagation would disorder the elaborate schedule. Secondly, strict HEM should not be encouraged. Because this task is often featured with open-set¬†, few-shot¬†0 and large-scale¬†. For example, the training set of Liberty in UBC PhotoTour¬†2 contains 161161161K classes with only less than 333 patches in a class on average. It is unreasonable and impossible to fit the hard pairs perfectly. Finally, the balance between the total modulation weights of negative pairs and positive pairs is fatal for optimization. An overwhelmed ratio of two total weights caused by the modulation would break down the training. In contrast, an appropriate ratio would help convergence and improve generalization. In this paper, we propose SDGMNet, a statistic-based dynamic gradient modulation to tackle problems mentioned above. SDGMNet is also based on triplet loss proposed by HardNet. We integrate four modifications in SDGMNet. Firstly, we analyze the back-propagated gradient of triplet loss. We explore that angular distance provides the relative flatten magnitude characteristic of gradients before modulation. SDGMNet is easily implemented by pair weighting with the included angle as distance measure (Section¬†III-A). Secondly, we propose auto-focus modulation to modulate gradients for individual pairs. Auto-focus modulation utilizes the statistical characteristics of distances between individual pairs. It does not follow HEM principle. It mines statistically reliable pairs whose distances lay around the location of the distribution to orient the optimization (Section¬†III-B). Thirdly, probabilistic margin employs statistical characteristics of relative distance of Siamese pairs,¬†i.e., triplets. It is applied to cut off the gradients of proportional Siamese pairs that are believed to reach the optimums. Meanwhile, the novel margin draws on hard mining for better convergence (Section¬†III-C). Finally, we adjust the ratio of positive and negative total weights with weight normalization and attenuation coefficient (Section¬†III-D). All statistics are estimated dynamically with rough Bayesian sequential update¬†. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks including patch verification, matching, retrieval tasks confirm the superiority of the descriptors learned with SDGMNet. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We explore the special characteristic of angular distance in back propagation. We propose statistics-based auto-focus modulation to moderates the impact of uncommon individual pairs. We propose dynamic probabilistic margin to mine Siamese pairs that are hard to discriminate. We propose power adjustment to balance total weights of negative and positive pairs for better generalization.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: promising end-to-end methods¬†     spring up in recent years, the traditional pipeline remains competitive due to its robustness and efficiency in practice¬†.
