      "content": "Paper Title: RadSegNet: A Reliable Approach to Radar Camera Fusion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor our image segmentation network, we use a pre-trained semantic segmentation model from the model zoo provided by the official DeeplabV3+ implementation [ref]8 [ref]9. We use the ResNet-101 model  which is trained on the Cityscapes dataset  for semantic segmentation task. We choose this model for its accuracy and generalizability. However, depending upon usage an alternative model optimized for speed can also be chosen. Our approach is agnostic to the type of network we choose. In this architecture, we are using a combination of two-loss functions as our objective to train the network. The classification head uses a focal loss  which provides better results for sparse radar point clouds than binary cross entropy. For regression head we use a Smooth L1 loss which combines L1 and L2 losses. The losses are given by: where ptsubscript𝑝𝑡p_{t} is the confidence output of classification head, ΔΔ\\Delta is the refinement value and α,γ,σ2𝛼𝛾superscript𝜎2\\alpha,\\gamma,\\sigma^{2} are hyper-parameters of loss functions. For each frame in the datasets, the radar data is processed to extract the initial feature channels. The input into the network is a (N,C,W,H)𝑁𝐶𝑊𝐻(N,C,W,H) tensor where N=2,C=22,W=128,H=128formulae-sequence𝑁2formulae-sequence𝐶22formulae-sequence𝑊128𝐻128N=2,C=22,W=128,H=128. The channels correspond to semantic segmentation values (9), BEV occupancy grid map (1) and point features (12). We use BEV ground-truth labels to train the classification and regression head. We use the average dimension of the ground truth labels as our fixed anchor box sizes. We use a target IoU (Intersection over Union) of 0.5 to determine the positive and negative examples of the anchor boxes for classification. Only the boxes marked as positive examples are used for regression loss. The values of our hyper-parameters are ascertained empirically. These are: α=0.9,γ=2.0,t​a​r​g​e​tI​o​U=0.5,1σ2=1formulae-sequence𝛼0.9formulae-sequence𝛾2.0formulae-sequence𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒subscript𝑡𝐼𝑜𝑈0.51superscript𝜎21\\alpha=0.9,\\gamma=2.0,target_{IoU}=0.5,\\frac{1}{\\sigma^{2}}=1. Our network is trained using a learning rate of λ=0.001𝜆0.001\\lambda=0.001 and a weight decay of η=1​e−5𝜂1𝑒5\\eta=1e-5 for the Adam Optimiser. We train our network for around 20 hours using 2 GTX 1080TIs and batch size of 2, to reach convergence and use early stopping to evaluate the system using the best model. We perform k-fold cross validation to ensure better generalizability. We use BEV average precision (AP) as our main metric in our evaluation. AP is defined for a particular Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold of a predicted bounding box with the ground truth box. We use IoU threshold of 0.5 in our evaluation to determine True Positives, which is commonly used across all BEV object detection benchmarks . We choose CenterFusion, the state-of-the-art perspective view based camera radar fusion approach, as one of our baselines. In this approach, the authors create a feature map of radar point clouds and process it along with the corresponding image based feature map to perform detections. We also compare our approach against a camera only approach called CenterNet. CenterNet is essentially CenterFusion without the corresponding radar data. We use the official GitHub implementation of these networks. We take the pre-trained network provided by the authors and fine-tune it on the Astyx dataset in order to make it a fair comparison. The pre-trained network performed better than training the network from scratch on the Astyx dataset. Hence, we provided only the results for the fine-tuned network. We use [ref]17 as our multi-view aggregation based baseline. [ref]17 uses an AVOD  architecture to perform radar-camera fusion. Due to the unavailability of official code from [ref]17 we use the official implementation of AVOD and train it on the Astyx dataset to compare the performance. We dub this approach as AVOD-fusion. This is also the SOTA approach for sensor fusion. We perform an evaluation on two datasets. First we show results on Astyx Hi-res radar dataset  and comprehensively benchmark our approach. We also create augmented weather in this dataset to evaluate the reliability of different camera-radar fusion approaches in adverse conditions. Next, we evaluate on RADIATE dataset  which contains images from real world bad weather environment.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: For our image segmentation network, we use a pre-trained semantic segmentation model from the model zoo provided by the official DeeplabV3+ implementation [ref]8 [ref]9.
