      "content": "Paper Title: Framing Relevance for Safety-Critical Autonomous Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEpistemology is the theory of knowledge and concerned with information-processing and cognitive success  .\nDoxastic means “relating to belief” .\nBy using the term “doxastic”, we want to stress that our formalism focuses on beliefs.\nIn the epistemic logic literature, the semantics of doxastic languages are often given via doxastic models, that are special Kripke structures .\nA doxastic model (S,v,→i)𝑆𝑣subscript→𝑖(S,v,\\rightarrow_{i}) consists of a set of nodes S𝑆S representing possible worlds w𝑤w, a valuation function v:S→2AP:𝑣→𝑆superscript2APv:S\\rightarrow 2^{\\textit{{AP}}} for the set of atomic facts AP and a belief relation →isubscript→𝑖\\rightarrow_{i} for each player i𝑖i, that specifies “i𝑖i deems w′superscript𝑤′w^{\\prime} possible in w𝑤w” if “w𝑤w →isubscript→𝑖\\rightarrow_{i} w′superscript𝑤′w^{\\prime}”. With other words, the belief of i𝑖i at w𝑤w is defined as the worlds accessible via the agent i𝑖i’s belief relation, →isubscript→𝑖\\rightarrow_{i}  . In this paper, we use complex possible worlds instead of the plain nodes of a Kripke structure.\nIn our framework, each possible world is a Kripke structure itself, called alternative reality.\nIt encodes the believed histories, the current states and possible futures.\nA system 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} uses alternative realities to simulate its strategy in order to decide on its current action.\nIn our framework, a reality constitutes an extensive form two-player zero-sum game, where the winning condition is defined by the list of linear temporal logic (LTL) goals of 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S}.\nThe belief formation is based on partial observations and the currently available knowledge/strong beliefs. A couple of epistemic temporal logics have been suggested for specifying aspects of knowledge throughout time for multi-agent systems. These logics combine temporal logics with knowledge operators, like KCTL [ref]5, KCTL∗ or HyperCTLl​p∗subscriptsuperscriptabsent𝑙𝑝{}^{*}_{lp} . They are interpreted over Kripke structures.\nBut since an agent i𝑖i has its local view, only certain propositions are assumed to be observable, so that an observational equivalence relation ∼isubscriptsimilar-to𝑖\\sim_{i} on the traces arises.\n“Agent i𝑖i knows φ𝜑\\varphi” then means that φ𝜑\\varphi holds on all i𝑖i-equivalent initial traces.\nThe alternating time temporal logics (ATL)  has been developed for reasoning about what agents can achieve by themselves or in groups throughout time.\nIn ATL, the path quantifiers of CTL are replaced by modalities that allow to quantify paths in the control of groups of agents.\nATL is interpreted over concurrent game structures (CGS), which are labelled state transition systems.\nBy adding a knowledge operator, ATL has been extended to an epistemic variant, ATEL .\nTo this end the concurrent game is extended by an observational equivalence relation per agent modelling the agent’s limited view. Just like the logics above, we assume that 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} can only partially observe the ground truth.\nOur beliefs, however, cannot straightforwardly be expressed in terms of an equivalence on the ground truth, since an alternative reality may be a distinct Kripke structure and a belief does not have to include the ground truth.\nIn contrast to be above logics, we use in our framework a variant of LTL to specify constraints on the beliefs.\nA so-called BLTL formula is therefore interpreted on a belief B𝐵B, i.e. a set of alternative realities.\nSince the set of possible beliefs 𝔹𝔹\\mathbb{B} is finite, a formula 𝖪​φ𝖪𝜑\\mathsf{K}\\varphi means the finite conjunction ⋀r∈Br⊧φmodelssubscript𝑟𝐵𝑟𝜑\\bigwedge_{{r}\\in B}{r}\\models\\varphi. The field of epistemic planning is concerned with computing plans (“a finite succession of events” 3) that achieve the desirable state of knowledge from a given current state of knowledge .\nDEL, dynamic epistemic logic, is a formalism to describe planning tasks succinctly by a semantic and action model based approach.\nEpistemic models capture the knowledge state of the agents, and epistemic action models describe how these are transformed.\nAn evolution results from a stepwise application of the available actions.\nIn 3 distributed synthesis of observational-strategies for multiplayer games are considered.\nWhile ATEL and DEL allow for reasoning about a combination of knowledge and strategies, we are interested in the belief formation.\nWe ask whether there exists a belief formation that justifies a strategy that successfully achieves temporal goals within a given ground truth world. Properties of belief formation are studied in the field of belief revision and update.\nBelief revision is done when a new piece of information contradicts the current information, and it aims to determine a consistent belief set.\nBelief updates may be necessary when the world is dynamic .\nThe works in this field are concerned with rational belief formation, following e.g. some guiding principle like making minimal changes .\nIn our work, we consider very general belief formation functions, since we focus on safety-critical autonomous systems. BDI agents are rational agents with the mental attitudes of belief (B), desire (D) and intention (I) .\nBeliefs describe what information the agent has,\ndesires represent the agent’s motivational state and specify what the agent would like to achieve,\nwhile intentions represent the currently chosen course of action.\nThese attitudes allow an agent balancing between deliberation about its course of action and its commitment to the chosen course of action.\nIn our framework, an agent deliberates about its course of action at each state.\nWe do not enforce commitment to a certain course of action, as we are interested in whether some belief formation exists.\nNevertheless, the framework conceptually allows capturing notions of commitment, and we plan to examine these in future work.\nBasically, a chosen action represents a set of believed best possible world strategies. These can be considered as the current intent.\nSo, a notion of commitment could require that (some) strategies of the previous belief are still best strategies in the current belief.\nAn engineer may then specify when a system should be committed.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: of epistemic temporal logics have been suggested for specifying aspects of knowledge throughout time for multi-agent systems.
