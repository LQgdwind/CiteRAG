Apart from global feature descriptor rendered from a full-image, patch-descriptors have attained remarkable progress using deep learning. Part-based methods focusing on local descriptions and semantic correlations are integrated [ref]3. In this direction, multi-scale region proposals, and fixed-size patches have attained much research attention. In [ref]5, multi-scale region features are encoded via the LSTM units. In , mask-RCNN is employed to localize discriminative regions. Several approaches have explored attention mechanism to improve FGIC performance including food recognition [ref]3. Few methods have proposed an ensemble of various CNNs, fusion of two or more sub-networks for performance gain . Recently, vision transformers (ViT) have embedded non-overlapping patches with multi-head self-attention module . The performance can be boosted by the random erasing data augmentation for multi-scale patch-based feature representation . Various food-dishes classification is discussed in , , . Researchers have summarized a comprehensive study on FGIC , and food recognition . The Forward Step-wise Uncertainty-Aware Model Selection has described an deep learning based ensemble method for food-dishes classification . Underwater object detection, segmentation, and classification is a challenging research area in computer vision. Studies on the marine lives detection using deep learning techniques are summarized in , . Also, early diagnosis of skin cancer from skin lesions using hybrid models CNN-ANN and CNN-RF is presented 4. A survey in this direction has been studied in [ref]26. Several benchmark public datasets are developed by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) for detection and classification of skin cancer, melanoma, and lesions using dermoscopy images , , . Marine-life classification using transfer learning based on pre-trained CNNs is described . A video dataset on underwater marine animals of six categories is proposed with baseline results . Before the deep learning era, different local shape and texture information including the LBP, geometric properties, shape profiles, bag of words, Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), colors, and many more have been described in the literature , , 3, , [ref]26, 4, , . Most of these conventional feature descriptors are used for recognizing the human faces, emotions, hand-shape, palmprint, skin lesions, and other biometric modality and object categories. A significant number of works on face recognition have computed local textures using the LBP family and others. A classical gray-scale, rotation invariant, and uniform LBP at circular neighborhoods is introduced in . Recently, a learning 2D co-occurrence LBP is described to attain scale invariance for image recognition 0. Deep architectures have been developed underlying the LBP for textural feature extraction for face recognition . Empirical model with local binary convolution layers is explored . Weighted-LBP emphasizes more importance on regions which are more influenced by aging effects . Multi-scale LBP and SIFT descriptors are used for multi-feature discriminant analysis in 0. The VGG-Face model is used for extracting the features for face recognition 1. A journey of LBP since the past two decades is sketched in .\nWith a brief study, this paper explores a combination of deep features using CNN and texture features using LBP for classifying images with diverse categories.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: rendered from a full-image, patch-descriptors have attained remarkable progress using deep learning.
