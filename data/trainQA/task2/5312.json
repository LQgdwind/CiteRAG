      "content": "Paper Title: On Finding Small Hyper-Gradients in Bilevel Optimization: Hardness Results and Improved Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe goal of bilevel optimization is to minimize the upper-level function f​(x,y)𝑓𝑥𝑦f(x,y) under the constraint that y𝑦y is minimized with respect to the lower-level function g​(x,y)𝑔𝑥𝑦g(x,y). Formally, it is defined as, Bilevel optimization in this form has received increasing attention due to its wide applications in many machine learning problems, including hyperparameter tuning  , neural architecture search 7   , meta-learning     , out-of-distribution learning ,\nadversarial training    , reinforcement learning  , causal learning  . The hyper-objective approach  reformulates Problem (1) by a minimization problem defined below, is called the hyper-objective. When φ​(x)𝜑𝑥\\varphi(x) has Lipschitz continuous gradients, a common is to find almost stationary points of φ​(x)𝜑𝑥\\varphi(x). Finding stationary points can be especially easy when the lower-level function is strongly convex, because Equation 2 can be simplified to the composite optimization problem below. Specifically, since Y∗​(x)superscript𝑌𝑥Y^{*}(x) has only one element when the lower-level function is strongly convex, we have Y∗​(x)={y∗​(x)}superscript𝑌𝑥superscript𝑦𝑥Y^{*}(x)=\\{y^{*}(x)\\} and Further, the implicit function theorem  implies This equation enables one to estimate the hyper-gradient ∇φ​(x)∇𝜑𝑥\\nabla\\varphi(x) and perform gradient descent on φ​(x)𝜑𝑥\\varphi(x).\nAID  and ITD  estimate\n∇φ​(x)∇𝜑𝑥\\nabla\\varphi(x) with Hessian-vector-product oracles.\nThe more recently proposed F2BA [ref]8 estimate ∇φ​(x)∇𝜑𝑥\\nabla\\varphi(x) with gradient oracles.\nAll these methods\ncan find a stationary point of φ​(x)𝜑𝑥\\varphi(x). However, due to the prevalence of nonconvex functions in real-world scenarios, the strong convexity assumption may limit the applicability of algorithms. Therefore, our work first aims to whether convexity, as a relaxation of strong convexity, suffices for finding small hyper-gradients efficiently. Specifically, we hope to answer the question below. Can we find stationary points of φ​(x)𝜑𝑥\\varphi(x) when the lower level function g​(x,y)𝑔𝑥𝑦g(x,y) is (strictly) convex but not strongly convex in y𝑦y? We provide a negative answer to the above question. We first prove in\nExample 3.1 that in the case where g​(x,⋅)𝑔𝑥⋅g(x,\\cdot) is merely convex, φ​(x)𝜑𝑥\\varphi(x) may not have stationary points since\nφ​(x)𝜑𝑥\\varphi(x) may be discontinuous.\nFurthermore, we show that the continuity of φ​(x)𝜑𝑥\\varphi(x) can be fully characterized by the Pompeiu–Hausdorff continuity of Y∗​(x)superscript𝑌𝑥Y^{*}(x)\nin Theorem 3.1. We then study the cases when ∇φ​(x)∇𝜑𝑥\\nabla\\varphi(x) exists, e.g. when\nthe lower-level function is strictly convex. We demonstrate that the stationary points of φ​(x)𝜑𝑥\\varphi(x) may still be computationally hard for any zero-respecting algorithms.\nThis algorithm class contains a broad range of existing algorithms, including all the algorithms mentioned in this paper. There exists a bilevel problem instance whose lower-level function is strictly convex and both f,g𝑓𝑔f,g satisfy regular smoothness conditions, such that any zero-respecting algorithm gets stuck at the initialization x0subscript𝑥0x_{0}. Given the negative result, we aim to study intermediate function classes that are not strongly convex but computationally tractable. In particular, we study the cases when the lower-level function satisfies the Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) conditions. This condition allows global nonconvexity but ensures local strong convexity uniformly in a subspace. The PL condition can pose nontrivial challenges since we have neither Equation 3 nor (4) in this case.\nResearchers have provided novel analyses in this case.\nXiao et al.  proposed a Hessian-vector-product-based method GALET with non-asymptotic convergence to KKT points of the gradient-based reformulated problem (Equation 11) when g𝑔g is PL in y𝑦y.\nKwon et al.  proved the differentiability of φ​(x)𝜑𝑥\\varphi(x) when the penalty function σ​f+g𝜎𝑓𝑔\\sigma f+g is uniformly PL in y𝑦y for all σ𝜎\\sigma in the neighborhood of zero, and\nshowed a proximal variant of F2BA, which we call Prox-F2BA, can find a stationary point of φ​(x)𝜑𝑥\\varphi(x). Based on their differentiability result, we show that GALET also converges to a stationary point of φ​(x)𝜑𝑥\\varphi(x) in Appendix C. Although Prox-F2BA  has been shown to converge to an ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-stationary point of φ​(x)𝜑𝑥\\varphi(x) with 𝒪~​(ϵ−3)~𝒪superscriptitalic-ϵ3\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\epsilon^{-3}) first-order oracle calls,\nthe rate is suboptimal compared with the Ω​(ϵ−2)Ωsuperscriptitalic-ϵ2\\Omega(\\epsilon^{-2}) lower bound for finding stationary points of nonconvex functions [ref]6 111Carmon et al. [ref]6 proved the Ω​(ϵ−2)Ωsuperscriptitalic-ϵ2\\Omega(\\epsilon^{-2}) lower bound for nonconvex single-level optimization. This lower bound applies to nonconvex-PL bilevel optimization since it is a more general problem. . Therefore, listed as an important future direction, Kwon et al.  asked the question below. Can one achieve (near)-optimal rates for nonconvex-PL bilevel problems with gradient oracles? We give a positive answer to this question.\nInterestingly, we prove that the original F2BA [ref]8 is already near-optimal for this case, via an in-depth analysis to deal with the challenges arising from the PL condition. (a) Although Xiao et al.  did not provide the dependency on κ𝜅\\kappa in the complexity, we can calculate by the way in our Remark C.1.\nTheir analysis additionally requires the smallest singular value of ∇y​y2g​(x,y)superscriptsubscript∇𝑦𝑦2𝑔𝑥𝑦\\nabla_{yy}^{2}g(x,y) has a constant gap between zero, but such an assumption seems to be redundant by our Remark C.2. (b) We use p1,p2,p3subscript𝑝1subscript𝑝2subscript𝑝3p_{1},p_{2},p_{3} to denote the polynomial dependency in κ𝜅\\kappa since they are not provided by Kwon et al. .\n Under regular conditions as in Kwon et al. ,\nF2BA can provably find an ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-stationary point of φ​(x)𝜑𝑥\\varphi(x) with 𝒪~​(ϵ−2)~𝒪superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\epsilon^{-2}) first-order oracle calls for nonconvex-PL bilevel problems. We also extend our analysis to stochastic bilevel problems when an algorithm only has access to a noisy estimator of ∇f∇𝑓\\nabla f and ∇g∇𝑔\\nabla g. Under the partially stochastic setting when the noise is only in ∇g∇𝑔\\nabla g, we prove the stochastic F2BA has the near-optimal 𝒪~​(ϵ−4)~𝒪superscriptitalic-ϵ4\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\epsilon^{-4}) first-order oracle complexity . Under the more general fully stochastic setting when noise appears both in ∇f∇𝑓\\nabla f and ∇g∇𝑔\\nabla g, we prove the method has an 𝒪~​(ϵ−6)~𝒪superscriptitalic-ϵ6\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\epsilon^{-6}) complexity. Compared with Xiao et al. , our deterministic F2BA achieves the near-optimal rate on ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon without the assistance of Hessian-vector-product oracles. Our method also has a better dependency on κ𝜅\\kappa since we do not use a squared trick on the Hessian of g𝑔g. And we additionally study stochastic problems that have not been studied by Xiao et al. . Compared with Kwon et al. , we strictly improve the complexities for both deterministic and stochastic cases under the same assumptions.\nWe compare our results with prior works in Table 1, and leave a more detailed introduction of related works in Appendix A.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: ∇φ​(x)∇𝜑𝑥\\nabla\\varphi(x) and perform gradient descent on φ​(x)𝜑𝑥\\varphi(x).\nAID  and ITD  estimate\n∇φ​(x)∇𝜑𝑥\\nabla\\varphi(x) with Hessian-vector-product oracles.\nThe more recently proposed F2BA [ref]8 estimate ∇φ​(x)∇𝜑𝑥\\nabla\\varphi(x) with gradient oracles.\nAll these methods\ncan find a stationary point of φ​(x)𝜑𝑥\\varphi(x).
