Table¬†2 shows the system parameters we use. To measure CPU energy consumption, we use Intel RAPL¬†. We capture GPU kernel execution time that excludes data initialization/transfer time. To measure GPU energy consumption, we use the nvml API¬†.\nWe implement SIMDRAM on gem5, taking into account that the latency of executing the back-to-back ACTs is only 1.1√ó\\times the latency of tR‚ÄãA‚ÄãSsubscriptùë°ùëÖùê¥ùëÜt_{RAS}¬†   [ref]122  , and validate our implementation rigorously with the results reported in . We use CACTI¬† to evaluate MIMDRAM and SIMDRAM energy consumption, where we take into account that each additional simultaneous row activation increases energy consumption by 22%¬† .\nOur simulation accounts for the additional latency imposes by MIMDRAM‚Äôs mat isolation transistors and row decoder latches (i.e., measured (using CACTI¬† ) to incur less than 0.5% extra latency for an ACT).\nWe open-source our simulation infrastructure at https://github.com/CMUSAFARI/MIMDRAM. Real-World Applications. We analyze 117 applications from seven benchmark suites (SPEC 2017¬†, SPEC 2006¬†, Parboil¬†, Phoenix¬†, Polybench¬†, Rodinia¬†, and SPLASH-2¬†) to select applications that\n(i)¬†are memory-bound, and\n(ii)¬†the most time-consuming loop can be auto-vectorized.\nFrom this analysis, we collect 12 multi-threaded CPU applications (disable,disable,todo: disable,#D3as Table¬†3 describes) from different domains (i.e., video compression, data mining, pattern recognition, medical imaging, stencil computation), and their respective GPU implementations, when available. Our evaluated applications are:\n(i)¬†525.x264_r (x264) from SPEC 2017;\n(ii)¬†heartwall (hw), kmeans (km), and backprop (bs) from Rodinia;\n(iii)¬†pca from Phoenix; and\n(iv)¬†2mm, 3mm, covariance (cov), doitgen (dg), fdtd-apml (fdtd), gemm (gmm), and gramschmidt (gm) from Polybench.141414Several prior works¬†  [ref]120 [ref]143    show disable,disable,todo: disable,#E1 that our selected twelve workloads can benefit from different types of PIM architectures. \nSince our base PUD substrate (SIMDRAM) does not support floating-point, we manually modify the selected floating-point-heavy auto-vectorized loops to operate on fixed-point data arrays.151515disable,disable,todo: disable,#D10We only modify the three applications from the Rodinia benchmark suite to use fixed-point operations. Prior works¬†[ref]143   also employ fixed-point for the same three Rodinia applications. The applications from Polybench can be configured to use integers; the auto-vectorized loops in 525.x264_r use uint8_t; pca uses integers. We do not observe an output quality degradation when employing fixed-point for the selected loops. We use the largest input dataset available and execute each application end-to-end in our evaluations.disable,disable,todo: disable,#E1 ‚Ä†: D = division, S = subtraction, M = multiplication, A = addition, R = reduction, C = copy\n\n\n‚Ä°: application with independent PUD operations Multi-Programmed Application Mixes. To measure system throughput and fairness, we manually create 495 application mixes by randomly selecting eight applications (from our group of 12 applications) for execution co-location. We classify each application mix into one of three categories:\nlow, medium, and high vectorization factor (VF) mixes based on Fig.¬†3.\nIn the low mix, the maximum VF of all eight applications is lower than 16K;\nin the medium mix, at least one application has a maximum vectorization factor between 16K (inclusive) and 64K; and\nin the large mix, at least one application has a maximum VF larger than 64K (inclusive).  Comparison to State-of-the-Art PIM Architectures. We compare MIMDRAM to two other state-of-the-art PIM architectures: DRISA¬† and Fulcrum¬†.\nDRISA is a combined PUM and PNM architecture that significantly modifies the DRAM microarchitecture and organization to enable bulk in-DRAM computation (e.g., by using 3T1C DRAM cells to execute in-situ bitwise NOR operations and by adding logic gates near the subarray‚Äôs sense amplifiers). \nFulcrum is a PNM architecture that adds computation logic near subarrays.\nFulcrum‚Äôs primary components are a series of shift registers (called walkers) that latch input/output DRAM rows and a narrow scalar ALU that executes arithmetic and logic operations. We model the DRISA 3T1C implementation and Fulcrum (i)¬†using a DRAM module of equal dimensions (i.e., number of DRAM ranks, chips, banks, mats, rows, and columns) as the baseline DDR4 DRAM we use for SIMDRAM and MIMDRAM (see Table¬†2) and\n(ii)¬†including all the changes that the DRISA 3T1C and Fulcrum architectures propose to the DRAM cell array and DRAM subarray.\n\nReference markers found: [122]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]122: we use the nvml API¬†.\nWe implement SIMDRAM on gem5, taking into account that the latency of executing the back-to-back ACTs is only 1.1√ó\\times the latency of tR‚ÄãA‚ÄãSsubscriptùë°ùëÖùê¥ùëÜt_{RAS}¬†   [ref]122  , and validate our implementation rigorously with the results reported in .
