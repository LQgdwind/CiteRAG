      "content": "Paper Title: An Energy-Efficient Edge Computing Paradigm for Convolution-based Image Upsampling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhen building deep learning solutions for latency-sensitive image upsampling problems such as real-time super resolution, systems designers are forced to balance trade-offs between image fidelity and hardware performance.\nModels trained using resize convolution 0 learn to upsample images without introducing checkerboard artifacts, but rely on memory-intensive pre-processing to then inefficiently execute compute operations in a higher dimensional space where the cost is greater [ref]11 .\nModels trained with sub-pixel convolution  converge faster with less test error when properly initialized , but require even more memory-intensive post-processing with every inference pass.\nUsing deconvolution , a model can efficiently generate images without any additional data processing, but training can introduce checkerboard artifacts with gradient updates  0.\nWe propose a novel edge computing paradigm that eases the selection between these algorithms by using each in their optimal context.\nAs depicted in Figure 1, our framework confines the use of sub-pixel or resize convolution to training in the cloud, where the cost of their memory-intensive feature map transformations is less severe.\nThe learned convolution kernels are then transformed to deconvolution kernels, effectively reducing data transfer penalties without sacrificing image fidelity when deployed for energy-efficient inference at the edge as a functionally equivalent deconvolution. The goal of this paper is to synthesize a collection of previous works into an edge computing design methodology to support real-time convolution-based image upsampling applications111In this paper, we use convolution-based upsampling to denote algorithms relying on either convolution or transposed convolution, commonly known as deconvolution..\nIn such applications, inference at the edge is physically separated from cloud-based training.\nThis cloud-to-edge separation of hardware is currently standard practice and reduces strain on network bandwidth, decreases system latency, and improves overall security .\nAs shown in Figure 1, standard edge computing frameworks deploy pre-trained neural networks to execute locally on edge devices and the high-level algorithms used during training are the same as those used during inference.\nDuring inference, these high-level algorithms are executed directly as latency-optimized compute kernels often selected by a runtime optimizer without explicit directive from a systems designer.\nWe refer to these compute kernels as low-level algorithms so as to not confuse them with learned convolution weights, which are also referred to as kernels.\nOur proposed edge computing paradigm enables the use of low-level deconvolution algorithms as inference solutions for real-time image upsampling applications without sacrificing image fidelity.\nUnder our paradigm, the high-level algorithms used for training are not the same as those used for inference.\nBy doing so, we significantly reduce data transfer penalties to improve both latency and energy efficiency during inference at the edge.\nBelow, we summarize our contributions222Find all algorithms described in this paper at https://github.com/icolbert/upsampling. We enable the physical separation of high-level training algorithms from high-level inference algorithms by introducing a set of single-use kernel transformations that translate sub-pixel and nearest neighbor resize convolutions to functionally equivalent deconvolutions (Section 4). We provide a comprehensive analysis of existing formulations of deconvolution inference solutions and explore their use as low-level algorithms at the edge (Section 2.3). We introduce a novel variant of the reverse looping deconvolution algorithm [ref]33 that exposes more opportunities for concurrent execution and improves its adaptability to the limited resource availability of edge platforms (Section 3). We analyze and compare the properties of these algorithms under a quantitative model to verify our design paradigm to show that translating to deconvolution for inference at the edge from sub-pixel or resize convolution in the cloud reduces time and energy costs (Section 5). We summarize the implications of these experiments and provide recommendations for system designers to support real-time, energy-efficient convolution-based upsampling (Section 6).\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: without introducing checkerboard artifacts, but rely on memory-intensive pre-processing to then inefficiently execute compute operations in a higher dimensional space where the cost is greater [ref]11 .\nModels trained with sub-pixel convolution  converge faster with less test error when properly initialized , but require even more memory-intensive post-processing with every inference\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
