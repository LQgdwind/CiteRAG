      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Avoidance of Vulnerabilities in Auto-completed Smart Contract Code Using Vulnerability-constrained Decoding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPrograms can be synthesized by leveraging the semantics of code  or neural networks [ref]2. Inspired by the success of large natural language models, e.g., Embeddings from Language Models (ELMo)  and Generative Pre-trained Transformer  (GPT), large-scale Transformer models have been applied in the domains of code synthesis [ref]5 [ref]6 . One kind of code synthesis is to generate complete function-level code based on specifications [ref]5 [ref]6. Another type of code synthesis uses existing code as context and developers’ comments as input to generate new code to auto-complete a function, e.g., using the neural network model bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) to automatically propose new code to developers based on existing code and comments specifying the code to be generated [ref]2. GitHub Copilot [ref]5, which is based on Codex  by OpenAI, auto-completes the code to speed up the coding significantly. Massive LLM like ChatGPT  has also enabled the capability to perform program synthesis. Although state-of-the-art models provide powerful synthesis capabilities, they also have challenges 0, especially related to security. Pearce et al. 1 analyzed the insecure code generated by GitHub Copilot. Their analysis of 1,689 synthesized Python and C programs concluded that approximately 40% of the synthesized code was vulnerable, showing a dire need to reduce the number of vulnerabilities generated with language models. The much larger ChatGPT model also faces many of the same issues. Khoury et al. 2 evaluated 21 generated programs in different programming languages and found that 16 were vulnerable. To eliminate vulnerabilities in the generated code, once the vulnerabilities in the training datasets are identified, the ideal approach is to remove the vulnerable code in the training dataset and re-train the whole model. However, re-training the whole model can be slow. For a popular LLM used by many developers daily to generate code, its slow re-training may result in many vulnerabilities being introduced in the auto-completed codes. Thus, it is critical to be able to quickly fine-tune the model to reduce the impact of the vulnerabilities. Facing such a challenge, this study aims to answer the research question: How to efficiently fine-tune the transformer model to avoid vulnerabilities in the auto-complete code? To answer the research question, we propose the vulnerability-constrained decoding method, which fine-tunes the transformer using labeled vulnerable code and then restricts the model from generating vulnerable code by using labels as guidance during the decoding. To evaluate our method, we performed case studies focused on synthesizing SCs, which have an exceptionally high demand for security, as SC codes are very difficult to be changed after the contracts are deployed. SCs are also desirable targets for adversaries due to the monetary and anonymous nature of Blockchain 3. We first downloaded Ethereum SCs and fine-tuned the pre-trained GPT-J-6B model 4 to auto-complete SCs with a BLEU score of 0.557. “A BLEU score of 0.6 or 0.7 is considered the best you can achieve 5.” The results show that our model can auto-complete SCs with the desired functions. We hypothesized that many of the generated functions might be vulnerable because we used real Ethereum SCs, which might contain vulnerabilities, as the model training dataset. We chose 176 SCs containing ten types of vulnerabilities from the 6 dataset and found out that over 70% of the auto-completed SCs based on the code before the vulnerable lines are insecure. After implementing the vulnerability-constrained decoding approach, we re-completed the same 176 SCs. Compared to re-training the who model, which needs more than one week with ten GPUs, the fine-tuning to implement the vulnerability-constrained decoding approach takes only one hour with four GPUs and could avoid many of the vulnerabilities. Our contributions are as follows: We propose a novel vulnerability-constrained decoding approach to avoid vulnerabilities in the generated code efficiently and effectively. The approach can help companies quickly update LLMs to avoid the negative consequence caused by vulnerabilities in the model training dataset. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first one using a fine-tuned transformer-based language model to auto-complete SCs with a high BLEU score. Last but not least, we have created the current largest SC dataset that could be used to train transformers to auto-complete SCs. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We explain the design of our approach in Section II. Section III presents the implementation of the approach and the evaluations. Section IV introduces related work. Section V discusses our results. Section VI concludes the study and proposes future work.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Programs can be synthesized by leveraging the semantics of code  or neural networks [ref]2.
