      "content": "Paper Title: Scalable computational algorithms for geo-spatial COVID-19 spread in high performance computing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAfter the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many policy decisions directly affecting personal gatherings, business operations, and healthcare utilization have been predicated on forecasted case counts and hospitalization statistics. Many such predictions use compartmental models based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which capture temporal variation for a population. Compartmental models derived from the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, have been used extensively. These models often include additional compartments and stratifications based on age, comorbidity, sex etc., to account for complex disease dynamics  . These approaches are based on an aggregated population for a given geographical domain and are well suited for individual population centres and cities or for studying global trends in broader regions. Agent and network-based models   are also popular particularly for studying localized virus spread by employing micro-scale data concerning disease transmission and population structure, which are difficult to acquire for large geographical domains. However, when the geographical domain of interest is a province/state/region or a country, spatial variations in disease dynamics become critical for accurate predictions  . Critically compartmental models based on partial differential equations (PDEs)     capture the continuous spread of virus both in space and time, providing a more complete description of disease dynamics over a large geographical domain. Their outputs indicate highly contagious zones and the evolution of disease dynamics among other clinically relevant information which can inform the decision makers about preventative measures and hospital preparedness. The numerical solution of the problem involves spatial and temporal discretizations leading to nonlinear system of equations, typically with millions of unknowns. A parallel iterative solver with an appropriate preconditioner can be used to achieve faster solutions for the linearized system derived from the nonlinear system. Domain decomposition (DD) methods refer to approaches for solving linear (or nonlinear) systems arising from PDEs that rely on dividing the domain into smaller sub problems and concurrently iterating to find a converged solution. They are generally used as preconditioners to Krylov subspace based solvers because of the inherent parallelism and ability to adapt to complex problems providing faster convergence. Development of DD has parallelly evolved into two branches of overlapping and non-overlapping decompositions     . We utilize an overlapping Schwarz DD framework to develop efficient preconditioners for the nonlinear system. Newton-Krylov methods linearize the system using Newton’s iteration and then employ a preconditioned Krylov solver for the linear system obtained at each step  . Other nonlinear preconditioning techniques available in the literature    solve nonlinear problems in subdomains with modified preconditioners. These are mainly suitable when localized nonlinearity cannot be effectively handled by global linearization. In this paper we use Picard linearization for our nonlinear system followed by a DD-based iterative solver at each step for simplicity. We find our linearization and preconditioning strategy satisfactory for the current five-compartment model problem to demonstrate the importance and suitability of DD methods to compartmental models of COVID-19. Now, we note below the compelling reasons for applying a DD-based solver for COVID modelling. Like their ODE-based counterparts, PDE-based compartmental models can be very fine grained, accounting for accurate dynamics among population (see Appendix C). This can further be extended to consider different age groups, socio-economic status, vaccination status, and co-morbidity (e.g., ). We note that corresponding spatial and temporal data for these stratifications could be obtained from private healthcare databases (e.g. ). This highly complex coupled model can be solved efficiently using an iterative solver equipped with parallel preconditioners offered by domain decomposition methods. The application of the above mentioned five-compartment model with finer spatial and temporal discretizations covering large geographical areas (including many public health units) involves system sizes above millions and the associated computational cost. The inclusion of uncertainty in the model (as in  [ref]7) by considering parameters as random variables or random fields leads to stochastic PDEs which can be solved using sampling (Monte Carlo or quadrature) methods or sampling-free stochastic Galerkin methods . Slow convergence of Monte Carlo or large stochastic dimensions can increase the number of deterministic sample evaluations which in turn increases the computational cost for sampling approaches. Even though DD-based solvers can be utilized for each deterministic evaluation, parallel overhead may reduce its efficiency. Sampling-free stochastic Galerkin methods demand solutions of a large linear/nonlinear system of equations for the stochastic PDEs. Depending on the stochastic discretization (number of input random variables/order of output expansion), the size of this linear system may grow exponentially which requires scalable parallel solvers built on DD-based methods (e.g. ). In the Bayesian inference framework, inverse problems for the estimation of model parameters requires the forward model to be evaluated numerous times for the computation of the likelihood function . For a high resolution model with many compartments where a single forward evaluation takes hours, this computation could take months to complete. With a highly scalable and efficient solver developed here, this computational cost can be reduced to days or even hours. For time-dependant nonlinear system of PDEs such as compartmental model of COVID-19, different solution strategies can be adopted as: (i𝑖i) discretize in time, linearize and adopt a linear preconditioner for the iterative solver for non-symmetric system, (i​i𝑖𝑖ii) discretize in time and apply a nonlinear preconditioner   , (i​i​i𝑖𝑖𝑖iii) apply a parallel in time method . The first strategy is adopted in this paper for which an efficient preconditioner for the GMRES iterative solver is described. In contrast to the conjugate gradient (CG) method used for symmetric and positive definite systems, the convergence criteria of the GMRES algorithm is difficult to establish using the spectral information on the coefficient matrix. It is thus important to identify a problem-specific preconditioner that expedites the convergence and improves scalabilities of the iterative solver. To this end, the main contributions of the paper are as follows. Development of a parallel scalable solver for the solution of complex compartmental models of COVID-19 for large geographical areas. Scalability studies of the one-level restricted additive Schwarz (RAS) and two-grid Schwarz preconditioner variants in terms of the iteration count and solution time. Development of an efficient solver using a two-grid restricted additive Schwarz (RAS) preconditioner for the nonlinear coupled PDEs: The adapted solver with an algebraic multigrid preconditioning for the coarse problem reduces the execution time and improves scalabilities. The comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of this two-grid RAS solver against the other variant of two-grid RAS preconditioner. Numerical illustration of a SEIRD model with spatio-temporally varying infection rate parameters that capture the realistic trends of infection through the region. Application of the two-grid RAS-based solver to a large geographical domain of Southern Ontario with over 92 million unknowns demonstrating the efficiency of the solver in a realistic setting. Verification studies for one and two-dimensional compartmental models of COVID-19 using the method of manufactured solutions (MMS). The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the PDE-based compartmental model and formulation of weak form on which the solver is applied. Section 3 briefly covers the basics of overlapping Schwarz method and coarse corrections. Section 4 applies the different preconditioners and assesses their relative effectiveness. The selected approach is then applied to a realistic model of Southern Ontario. The weak form of the equations are given in Appendix A, the model validation is shown in Appendix B, and details on a more complex 222222-compartment PDE-based model are provided in Appendix C.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: covering large geographical areas (including many public health units) involves system sizes above millions and the associated computational cost.
