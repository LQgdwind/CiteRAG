      "content": "Paper Title: Quantized Embedding Vectors for Controllable Diffusion Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nControllable text generation (CTG) is the task of generating text while adhering to a given controlled element [ref]20. In plug-and-play controllable generation, the LM is kept frozen, and its output is constrained using potential functions, such as classifiers [ref]8 . FUDGE [ref]3 focuses on the partial sequence and reweights the LM prediction at each token based on an estimate of control satisfaction. DExperts  achieves control by reweighting the LM prediction at each token using a smaller fine-tuned or trained LM for the specific control task. Diffusion-LM  fine-tunes the pre-trained weights while updating them based on a controllable text generation algorithm. In CTG, given a vocabulary V, the goal is to generate a target text X={x0,x1,…,xt,…,xT}𝑋subscript𝑥0subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑡…subscript𝑥𝑇X=\\left\\{x_{0},x_{1},\\ldots,x_{t},\\ldots,x_{T}\\right\\}, where xt∈Vsubscript𝑥𝑡Vx_{t}\\in\\textbf{\\em V}, while taking into account a control element denoted as w𝑤w. Formally, CTG can be expressed as follows: The specific expression of w𝑤w may vary in accordance with different tasks. For the sentence Y𝑌Y generated by the model, it is also expected to conform to the constraint conditions and the general natural language characteristics (e.g., fluency, rationality, readability, and control success). [ref]3 . To convert a continuous diffusion model into discrete text representation, we employ an embedding function EMB⁡(wi)EMBsubscript𝑤𝑖\\operatorname{EMB}\\left(w_{i}\\right), which maps each word’s embedding space to a corresponding vector in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}. The embedding vector is represented as EMB⁡(𝐰)=[EMB⁡(w1),…,EMB⁡(wn)]∈ℝn​dEMB𝐰EMBsubscript𝑤1…EMBsubscript𝑤𝑛superscriptℝ𝑛𝑑\\operatorname{EMB}(\\mathbf{w})=\\left[\\operatorname{EMB}\\left(w_{1}\\right),\\ldots,\\operatorname{EMB}\\left(w_{n}\\right)\\right]\\in\\mathbb{R}^{nd}, where n𝑛n is the length of the text. In the forward process, the diffusion model introduces a Markov transition from discrete words ww\\mathrm{w} to x0subscriptx0\\mathrm{x}_{0}, which is parameterized by qϕ​(X0∣𝐰)=𝒩​(EMB⁡(𝐰),σ0​I)subscript𝑞italic-ϕconditionalsubscriptX0𝐰𝒩EMB𝐰subscript𝜎0𝐼q_{\\phi}\\left(\\mathrm{X}_{0}\\mid\\mathbf{w}\\right)=\\mathcal{N}\\left(\\operatorname{EMB}(\\mathbf{w}),\\sigma_{0}I\\right). In the reverse process, a trainable rounding step is added, which is parameterized by pθ​(𝐰∣X0)=∏i=1npθ​(wi∣xi)subscript𝑝𝜃conditional𝐰subscriptX0superscriptsubscriptproduct𝑖1𝑛subscript𝑝𝜃conditionalsubscript𝑤𝑖subscript𝑥𝑖p_{\\theta}\\left(\\mathbf{w}\\mid\\mathrm{X}_{0}\\right)=\\prod_{i=1}^{n}p_{\\theta}\\left(w_{i}\\mid x_{i}\\right). This rounding step optimizes the connection between the continuous x0subscript𝑥0x_{0} and discrete text, where pθ​(wi∣xi)subscript𝑝𝜃conditionalsubscript𝑤𝑖subscript𝑥𝑖p_{\\theta}\\left(w_{i}\\mid x_{i}\\right) is modeled as a Softmax distribution. The training objective introduced above is now updated according to: Then we get We employ the same simplification which transforms ℒvlb →ℒsimple →subscriptℒvlb subscriptℒsimple \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{vlb }}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{simple }} to transform ℒvlb e2e→ℒsimple e2e→superscriptsubscriptℒvlb e2esuperscriptsubscriptℒsimple e2e\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{vlb }}^{\\mathrm{e}2\\mathrm{e}}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{simple }}^{\\mathrm{e}2\\mathrm{e}}, this result is consistent with  , that is: Accordingly, the training objective introduced above now becomes: We get the same formula in accordance to  and train the Transformer model to directly predict x0subscriptx0\\mathrm{x}_{0} via fθ​(xt,t)subscript𝑓𝜃subscriptx𝑡𝑡f_{\\theta}\\left(\\mathrm{x}_{t},t\\right) , and use the tractable Gaussian posterior q​(xt−1∣x0,xt)𝑞conditionalsubscriptx𝑡1subscriptx0subscriptx𝑡q\\left(\\mathrm{x}_{t-1}\\mid\\mathrm{x}_{0},\\mathrm{x}_{t}\\right) to compute the mean of xt−1subscriptx𝑡1\\mathrm{x}_{t-1}, conditioned on predicted x0subscriptx0\\mathrm{x}_{0} and observed xt:αt−1​βt1−α¯t​x0+αt​(1−α¯t−1)1−α¯t​xt:subscriptx𝑡subscript𝛼𝑡1subscript𝛽𝑡1subscript¯𝛼𝑡subscriptx0subscript𝛼𝑡1subscript¯𝛼𝑡11subscript¯𝛼𝑡subscriptx𝑡\\mathrm{x}_{t}:\\frac{\\sqrt{\\alpha_{t-1}}\\beta_{t}}{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_{t}}\\mathrm{x}_{0}+\\frac{\\sqrt{\\alpha_{t}}\\left(1-\\bar{\\alpha}_{t-1}\\right)}{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_{t}}\\mathrm{x}_{t}.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: Controllable text generation (CTG) is the task of generating text while adhering to a given controlled element [ref]20.
