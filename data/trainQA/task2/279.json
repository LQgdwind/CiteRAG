      "content": "Paper Title: On the Convergence Analysis of Asynchronous SGD for Solving Consistent Linear Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the era of big data and artificial intelligence, optimization problems have become increasingly complex in nature. Although the computers are now more powerful and inexpensive, the problems have grown continuously larger in size and they are difficult to be maneuvered by a single processor. Owing to the nature of the high-volume of the data, an emerging interest is to device and analyze scalable, parallel, and distributed algorithms that can handle the data more efficiently as compared to the traditional optimization algorithms designed to run on a single processor. To deal with the large-scale data, these new class of algorithms can take advantage of a multi-processor system where each processor has access to its own data-partition and it processes the data-partitions in mini-batches. Shalev-Shwartz et al.  in 2007 and Gimpel et al.  in 2010, explored the idea of mini-batches for stochastic algorithms in both the serial and parallel settings. In 2011, Dekel et al. [ref]9 proposed a distributed mini-batch algorithm (for online predictions)—a method that converts many serial gradient-based online prediction algorithms into distributed algorithms with an asymptotically optimal regret bound. However, in a distributed environment, the synchronous parallel algorithms tend to slow down due to unpredictable communication faults, significant network latency, and processors with different processing speeds. To overcome the above issues posed by the synchronous parallel algorithms in a distributed environment, there has been a recent focus on developing and analyzing asynchronous algorithms. In asynchronous algorithms, processors with different storage capacity and processing speeds perform updates without synchronizing with others. Asynchronous algorithms were first introduced by Chazan and Miranker on chaotic relaxation in 1969  (also, see Frommer and Szyld  and ). However, not only the inherent dynamics of asynchronous algorithms are challenging compared to their synchronous counterparts, but also their convergence analyses are much more mathematically involved. Historically, in the literature, the comparisons between the convergence rates of the asynchronous algorithms and their synchronous counterparts are also not vastly present and less understood. In this paper, our goal is to understand the convergence rates of the asynchronous and synchronous SGD in a fairly simple set-up. However, before discussing problem formulation, set-up, and contribution, we start with a brief overview of stochastic optimization. In machine learning and data-fitting applications, stochastic optimization is a broadly studied field. Consider the stochastic optimization problem: where 𝒟𝒟{\\cal D} is an user inferred distribution and 𝐒𝐒{\\bf S} is a random sample drawn from that distribution. In supervised machine learning or deep learning, the above problem is known as empirical risk minimization (ERM) problem: where fi​(x)subscript𝑓𝑖𝑥f_{i}(x)’s are instantiated by different distributions 𝒟isubscript𝒟𝑖{\\cal D}_{i} and 𝐒isubscript𝐒𝑖{\\bf S}_{i} is sampled from 𝒟isubscript𝒟𝑖{\\cal D}_{i}.\nIn the distributed setting, n𝑛n in the ERM problem denotes number of processors/workers. Therefore, (2) is an important problem from the deep learning perspective as it captures data-parallelism (distributed over n𝑛n processors (GPUs/CPUs etc.)). One of the most popular algorithms for solving (1) is the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) 6. For a given sequence of stepsize parameters {ωk}subscript𝜔𝑘\\{\\omega_{k}\\} with ωk>0subscript𝜔𝑘0\\omega_{k}>0 and the sequence of iterates {xk}subscript𝑥𝑘\\{x_{k}\\}, the updates of SGD take the form: where ∇f𝐒k​(xk)∇subscript𝑓subscript𝐒𝑘subscript𝑥𝑘\\nabla f_{{\\bf S}_{k}}(x_{k}) is the stochastic gradient arising from the sample 𝐒k∼𝒟similar-tosubscript𝐒𝑘𝒟{\\bf S}_{k}\\sim{\\cal D} drawn afresh in each iteration and is an unbiased estimator of the gradient of f𝑓f. A natural next direction in solving (1) is to design a synchronized parallel update by using SGD . If more than one processors are available, then they can work simultaneously and each one of them can calculate a stochastic gradient independent of the other processors. At the end, the user can average the stochastic gradients from all processors to obtain the update as: where ∇f𝐒k​i​(xk)∇subscript𝑓subscript𝐒𝑘𝑖subscript𝑥𝑘\\nabla f_{{\\bf S}_{ki}}(x_{k}) is the stochastic gradient arising from the independent sample 𝐒k​i∼𝒟similar-tosubscript𝐒𝑘𝑖𝒟{\\bf S}_{ki}\\sim{\\cal D} from each of the τ𝜏\\tau processors and ωk>0subscript𝜔𝑘0\\omega_{k}>0 is a uniform stepsize across kthsuperscript𝑘thk^{\\rm th} iteration. Note that, if τ=1𝜏1\\tau=1, then the update scheme in (4) is (3).\nIn this paper, we compare the convergence rates of the asynchronous and synchronous algorithms in a fairly simple set-up of solving any arbitrary consistent linear systems by reformulating them into stochastic optimization problems. Before explaining our main contributions, we introduce the stochastic reformulation of a linear system.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: mini-batches.
