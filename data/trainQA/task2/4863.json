      "content": "Paper Title: Inductive Logical Query Answering in Knowledge Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDataset.\nDue to the absence of inductive logical query benchmarks, we create a novel suite of datasets based on FB15k-237 [ref]29 (open license) and following the query generation process of BetaE [ref]24.\nGiven a source graph with ℰℰ{\\mathcal{E}} entities, we sample |ℰtrain|=r⋅|ℰ|,r∈[0.1,0.9]formulae-sequencesubscriptℰtrain⋅𝑟ℰ𝑟0.10.9|{\\mathcal{E}}_{\\textit{train}}|=r\\cdot|{\\mathcal{E}}|,r\\in[0.1,0.9] nodes to induce a training graph 𝒢trainsubscript𝒢train{\\mathcal{G}}_{\\textit{train}}.\nFor validation and test graphs, we split the remaining set of entities into two non-overlapping sets each with 1−r2​|ℰ|1𝑟2ℰ\\frac{1-r}{2}|{\\mathcal{E}}| nodes.\nWe then merge training and unseen nodes into the inference set of nodes ℰinfsubscriptℰinf{\\mathcal{E}}_{\\textit{inf}} and induce inference graphs for validation and test from those sets, respectively, i.e., ℰinfval=ℰtrain∪ℰvalsuperscriptsubscriptℰinfvalsubscriptℰtrainsubscriptℰval{\\mathcal{E}}_{\\textit{inf}}^{\\textit{val}}={\\mathcal{E}}_{\\textit{train}}\\cup{\\mathcal{E}}_{\\textit{val}} and ℰinftest=ℰtrain∪ℰtestsuperscriptsubscriptℰinftestsubscriptℰtrainsubscriptℰtest{\\mathcal{E}}_{\\textit{inf}}^{\\textit{test}}={\\mathcal{E}}_{\\textit{train}}\\cup{\\mathcal{E}}_{\\textit{test}}.\nThat is, validation and test inference graphs both extend the training graph but their sets of new entities are disjoint. Finally, we sample and remove 15% of edges 𝒯predsubscript𝒯pred{\\mathcal{T}}_{\\text{pred}} in the inference graphs as missing edges for sampling queries with those missing edges.\nOverall, we sample 9 such datasets based on different choices of r𝑟r, which result in the ratios of inference graph size to the training graph ℰinf/ℰtrainsubscriptℰinfsubscriptℰtrain{\\mathcal{E}}_{\\textit{inf}}/{\\mathcal{E}}_{\\textit{train}} from 105% to 550%. For each dataset, we employ the query sampler from BetaE [ref]24 to extract 14 typical query types 1p/2p/3p/2i/3i/ip/pi/2u/up/2in/3in/inp/pin/pni.\nTraining queries are sampled from the training graph 𝒢trainsubscript𝒢train{\\mathcal{G}}_{\\textit{train}}, validation and test queries are sampled from their respective inference graphs 𝒢infsubscript𝒢inf{\\mathcal{G}}_{\\textit{inf}} where at least one edge belongs to 𝒯predsubscript𝒯pred{\\mathcal{T}}_{\\text{pred}} and has to be predicted at inference time. As inference graphs extend training graphs, training queries are very likely to have new answers when executed over 𝒢infsubscript𝒢inf{\\mathcal{G}}_{\\textit{inf}} with simple graph traversal and without any link prediction. We create an additional set of true answers for all training queries executed over the test inference graph 𝒢inftestsuperscriptsubscript𝒢inftest{\\mathcal{G}}_{\\textit{inf}}^{\\textit{test}} to measure the entailment capabilities of query answering models.\nThis is designed to be an inference task and extends the faithfullness evaluation of [ref]26.\nDataset statistics can be found in Appendix B. Evaluation Protocol.\nFollowing the literature [ref]24, query answers are separated into two sets: easy answers that only require graph traversal over existing edges, and hard answers that require inferring missing links to achieve the answer node.\nFor the main experiment, evaluation involves ranking of hard answers against all entities having easy ones filtered out.\nFor evaluating training queries on inference graphs, we only have easy answers and rank them against all entities.\nWe report Hits@10 as the main performance metric on different query types. Implementation Details.\nAll NodePiece-based models  were pre-trained until convergence on a simple 1p link prediction task with the relations-only vocabulary and entity tokenization, MLP encoder, and ComplEx  scoring function.\nWe used a 2-layer CompGCN  as an optional message passing encoder on top of NodePiece features.\nThe non-parametric CQD-Beam  decoder for answering complex queries is tuned for each query type based on the validation set of queries, most of the setups employ a product t-norm, sigmoid entity score normalization, and beam size of 32.\nFollowing the literature, the GNN-QE models  were trained on 10 query patterns (1p/2p/3p/2i/3i/2in/3in/inp/pin/pni) where ip/pi/2u/up are only seen at inference time.\nEach model employs a 4-layer NBFNet  as a trainable projection operator with DistMult  composition function and PNA  aggregation.\nOther logical operators (∧,∨,¬\\land,\\lor,\\lnot) are executed with the non-parametric product t-norm and t-conorm.\nBoth NodePiece-QE and GNN-QE are implemented444Code and data are available at https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/InductiveQE with PyTorch  and trained with the Adam  optimizer. NodePiece-QE models were pre-trained and evaluated on a single Tesla V100 32 GB GPU whereas GNN-QE models were trained and evaluated on 4 Tesla V100 16GB.\nAll hyperparameters are listed in Appendix D.\nTo show that the proposed models are non-trivial, we compare them with an Edge-type Heuristic baseline (Appendix E), which selects all entities that satisfy the relations in the last hop of the query in 𝒢infsubscript𝒢inf{\\mathcal{G}}_{\\textit{inf}}.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: Dataset.\nDue to the absence of inductive logical query benchmarks, we create a novel suite of datasets based on FB15k-237 [ref]29 (open license) and following the query generation process of BetaE [ref]24.\nGiven a source graph with ℰℰ{\\mathcal{E}} entities, we sample\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
