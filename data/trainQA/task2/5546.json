      "content": "Paper Title: Pseudo Contrastive Learning for Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHardware&Software.\nAll the experiments were conducted on a single NVIDIA Tesla V100100100 409640964096 Ti with 161616 GB memory size. The CPU is Intel Xeon E555-265026502650 v444 with 200200200 GB memory size. We implement all the models by PyTorch Geometric  with the Adam optimizer . Backbones.\nWe consider six models as backbone models including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) that is attribute-based models ignoring the graph structure. L𝐿L-localized Graph Convolution Network (ChebNet) [ref]57 that uses Lt​hsuperscript𝐿𝑡ℎL^{th}-order polynomial in the Laplacian to define the convolution operation on graphs. GraphSAGE [ref]9 that performs under both the inductive and transductive settings for large graphs. Graph Convolution Network (GCN) [ref]5 that is one of the most popular GNNs. Graph Attention Network (GAT)  that aggregates neighbors’ features based on the attention mechanism. Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN)  that shows equal power to the WL test. Comparing General Techniques.\nWe compare PCL against three general techniques including a PL-based method and two discrimination-enhanced methods as follows: UPS  that combines PPL and NPL to generate pseudo-labels with uncertainty-aware selection. Lower uncertainty stands for a higher quality of the generated pseudo-label. PairNorm (PN)  which is a normalizing scheme to prevent learned embeddings from becoming too similar. DropEdge (DE)  that removes a certain part of edges during training to generate multiple augmented input graphs. Comparing SOTA Graph-based SSL Methods.\nWe compare PCL against three PL-based methods with GCN as the backbone model and three semi-supervised GCL methods as follows: Co-training/Self-training/Union/Intersection  that proposes different strategies to select pseudo-labels, i.e., co-training a GCN with a random walk model (Co-training), typical pseudo-label selection (Self-training), and using union or intersection of two pseudo-label sets from Co-training and Self-training. M3S  which selects pseudo-labels with a self-checking mechanism consisting of Deep Cluster algorithm  and an aligning mechanism. InfoGNN  which proposes informativeness measure to select high-quality pseudo-labels. CG3  which contrasts node representations from a GNN model and a generation model. CGPN  which leverages a contrastive Poisson network to enhance the learning ability of GNNs under limited labeled nodes. TIFA-GCL  which proposes annotated information to chooses contrasting pairs. Hyperparameters.\nFor each backbone, we perform a small grid search to decide the best hyperparameters, e.g., dropout rate (dp) in {0.1,⋯,0.7}0.1⋯0.7\\{0.1,\\cdots,0.7\\}, learning rate (lr) in {0.01,0.001,0.05}0.010.0010.05\\{0.01,0.001,0.05\\}, hidden dimension (hd) in {64,128,256}64128256\\{64,128,256\\}, and weight decay (wd) in {5​e−4,5​e−6,5​e−9}5𝑒45𝑒65𝑒9\\{5e-4,5e-6,5e-9\\}. For each general technique, we directly apply them on the backbone with hyperparameter adjustments according to the suggested configurations from their public source codes. For our PCL, we search the threshold γ+∈{0.5,⋯,0.9}superscript𝛾0.5⋯0.9\\gamma^{+}\\in\\{0.5,\\cdots,0.9\\} and K∈{10,20,⋯,100}𝐾1020⋯100K\\in\\{10,20,\\cdots,100\\}. Besides, we set the E1=200subscript𝐸1200E_{1}=200, E2=300subscript𝐸2300E_{2}=300, and τ=0.05𝜏0.05\\tau=0.05.\n\nReference markers found: [57]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]57: consider six models as backbone models including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) that is attribute-based models ignoring the graph structure.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
