      "content": "Paper Title: Task-Oriented GNNs Training on Large Knowledge Graphs for Accurate and Efficient Modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExisting HGNN methods build upon GNN techniques designed for homogeneous graphs by incorporating multi-layer GCNs and employing sampling in mini-batch training [ref]7 [ref]8  [ref]10 . In HGNNs, the number of GCN layers is associated with the number of metapaths in the heterogeneous graph.\nMetapaths can range from a single edge type and one-hop to paths with multiple hops and edge types  . For a\nK​G=(𝒱,𝒞,ℒ,ℛ,𝒯)𝐾𝐺𝒱𝒞ℒℛ𝒯KG=(\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{C},\\mathcal{L},\\mathcal{R},\\mathcal{T}), a metapath is defined as a sequence of relations across node types in 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} in the form of c1→r1c2→r2…→rhch+1subscript𝑟1→subscript𝑐1subscript𝑐2subscript𝑟2→…subscript𝑟ℎ→subscript𝑐ℎ1c_{1}\\xrightarrow[\\text{}]{\\text{$r_{1}$}}c_{2}\\xrightarrow[\\text{}]{\\text{$r_{2}$}}...\\xrightarrow[\\text{}]{\\text{$r_{h}$}}c_{h+1}. This leads to composite relations (metapaths), which construct all possible combinations of 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} and ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} for hop hℎh based on the KG schemas. Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) is based on a metapath of one hop and edge type. RGCN uses a stack of GCNs, where each GCN is dedicated to a metapath involving one specific edge type. Various GNN methods, such as GraphSAINT[ref]7, Shadow-GNN [ref]8, MorsE , and FastGCN , have adapted RGCN to support heterogeneous graphs. We refer to this category of methods as RGCN-based HGNN methods. Another category of HGNN methods supports metapaths involving multiple hops of different edge types, e.g., SeHGNN , MHGCN [ref]10, and FastGTN .\nWe refer to this category as metapath-based methods . In both categories, the initial node embeddings are iteratively aggregated with embeddings received from neighboring nodes connected to a specific relation until the embeddings of all nodes converge. For instance, in RGCN-based methods, the final embedding of a node is obtained through two aggregations: an outer aggregation over each relation type and an inner aggregation over neighbouring nodes of a specific relation and defined by RGCN  as follows: where l𝑙l is an RGCN layer, hj(l+1)subscriptsuperscriptℎ𝑙1𝑗h^{(l+1)}_{j} is the hidden embedding of node j𝑗j at layer l+1𝑙1l+1, σ𝜎\\sigma is element-wise activation function, Nirsuperscriptsubscript𝑁𝑖𝑟N_{i}^{r} denotes the set of neighbour indices of node i𝑖i under relation r∈ℛ𝑟ℛr\\in\\mathcal{R}, ci,rsubscript𝑐𝑖𝑟c_{i,r} is a problem-specific normalization constant that can either be learned or chosen in advance (such as ci,r=|Nir|subscript𝑐𝑖𝑟superscriptsubscript𝑁𝑖𝑟c_{i,r}=|N_{i}^{r}|), Wr(l)subscriptsuperscript𝑊𝑙𝑟W^{(l)}_{r} is the weight matrix for relation r𝑟r at layer l𝑙l, and W0lsubscriptsuperscript𝑊𝑙0W^{l}_{0} is the initial weight matrix at layer l𝑙l.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Existing HGNN methods build upon GNN techniques designed for homogeneous graphs by incorporating multi-layer GCNs and employing sampling in mini-batch training [ref]7 [ref]8  [ref]10 .
