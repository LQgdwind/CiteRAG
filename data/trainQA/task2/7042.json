      "content": "Paper Title: On the Fine-Grained Query Complexity of Symmetric Functions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExploring quantum advantages is a key problem in quantum computing. A lot of research work has revolved around analyzing and characterizing quantum advantages, such as     .\nQuery complexity is a complexity model commonly used to describe quantum advantages, since it enables the establishment of both nontrivial upper and lower bounds.\nA comprehensive survey on the query complexity can be found in . A series of works [ref]2 [ref]53   has shown that for partial functions, quantum query complexity could be exponentially smaller (or even less) than the randomized query complexity, while for total functions, they are always polynomially related [ref]4. Although the query complexity model has demonstrated the powerful ability of a quantum computer to solve certain “structured” problems more efficiently than a classical computer, such as Simon’s problem  and integer factorization problem , there only exist at most quadratic quantum speedups for some “unstructured” problems, such as black-box search problems . Thus, one natural question is to explore how much structure is needed for significant quantum speedups . Watrous conjectured that the randomized query complexity and quantum query complexity of partial symmetric functions are polynomial equivalent . Later, Aaronson and Ambainis  initiated the study of quantum speedup on the quantum query complexity of symmetric functions, showing that partial functions invariant under full symmetry do not exhibit super-polynomial quantum speedups, which resolves the Watrous conjecture. Their result was later improved by Chailloux 7, who achieved a tighter bound and removed a technical dependence of output symmetry.\nRecently 3 performed a systematic analysis of functions symmetric under other group actions and characterized when super-polynomial quantum speedups are achievable.\nHowever, all these results work in the bounded error regime and do not explicitly consider arbitrary small biases. In this paper, we propose and investigate a fine-grained version of the Watrous conjecture concerning the quantum and randomized query complexities of symmetric functions with an arbitrary error close to 1/2. Before stating the conjecture, we need to introduce two notions which are essential to this paper. For any Boolean function f𝑓f and T>0𝑇0T>0, let the classical T𝑇T-bias δC​(f,T)subscript𝛿𝐶𝑓𝑇\\delta_{C}(f,T) be the optimal success probability of T𝑇T-query randomized algorithms minus 1/2121/2 over all possible inputs. The quantum T𝑇T-bias δQ​(f,T)subscript𝛿𝑄𝑓𝑇\\delta_{Q}(f,T) is defined for quantum algorithms analogously. There exists a constant c≥2𝑐2c\\geq 2 satisfying that for any partial symmetric function f𝑓f and any T>0𝑇0T>0, δC​(f,c⋅T)≥δQ​(f,T)𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​(T)subscript𝛿𝐶𝑓⋅𝑐𝑇subscript𝛿𝑄𝑓𝑇𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝑇\\delta_{C}(f,c\\cdot T)\\geq\\frac{\\delta_{Q}(f,T)}{\\mathsf{poly}(T)}. The reason for c≥2𝑐2c\\geq 2 is that the n𝑛n-bit parity function can be exactly computed with n/2𝑛2n/2 quantum queries, while any randomized algorithm with less n𝑛n queries succeeds with probability 1/2121/2. It is also not hard to see the fine-grained Watrous conjecture implies that quantum and randomized query complexities of symmetric functions are polynomially related. Indeed, if δQ​(f,T)subscript𝛿𝑄𝑓𝑇\\delta_{Q}(f,T) is lower bounded by some constant, then δC​(f,c⋅T)≥Ω​(1𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​(T))subscript𝛿𝐶𝑓⋅𝑐𝑇Ω1𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝑇\\delta_{C}(f,c\\cdot T)\\geq\\Omega(\\frac{1}{\\mathsf{poly}(T)}), which implies the randomized query complexity of f𝑓f is 𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​(T)𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝑇\\mathsf{poly}(T) by error reduction.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: used to describe quantum advantages, since it enables the establishment of both nontrivial upper and lower bounds.\nA comprehensive survey on the query complexity can be found in .
