      "content": "Paper Title: Policies Grow on Trees: Model Checking Families of MDPsThis work is partially supported by the Czech Science Foundation grant GA23-06963S (VESCAA) the NWO Veni grant ProMiSe (222.147).\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMarkov decision processes (MDPs) are the ubiquitous model to describe sequential decision making uncertainty: the outcomes of nondeterministic actions are determined by a probability distribution over the successor states. MDP policies resolve the non-determinism and describe for each state which action to take. A classical synthesis task in MDPs is to compute policies that achieve reachability specifications: Given a set of target states and a threshold ŒªùúÜ\\lambda, find a winning policy, i.e., a policy that ensures that the targets are reached with probability at least ŒªùúÜ\\lambda, if one exists. Winning policies are efficiently computed by modern probabilistic model checkers such as¬†Storm¬† or Prism¬†. In this paper, we generalise the synthesis task: We consider not one, but a set of MDPs. The MDPs model variations of the same system, this is a natural approach to capture alternative environment conditions for an agent¬†, protocol variations¬†, or alternative hardware choices¬†1. In such scenarios, even huge sets of MDPs can be concisely represented.\nThe goal is to compute a (potentially different) winning policy for every MDP, if possible. Naively, this problem is straightforward to solve using either of two baselines: Either we enumerate over the MDPs and solve each MDP individually, or we create an all-in-one MDP that contains the disjoint union of all MDPs and obtain a policy for that (giant) MDP¬†[ref]21 . The first challenge that this paper tackles is to support solving this problem for families with millions of MDPs, where both baselines have clear scalability issues111The all-in-one MDP may be stored symbolically¬†, however, in many cases, existing symbolic techniques for probabilistic model checking do not work well¬†.. Furthermore, we consider the representation of the resulting set of policies. We conjecture that a small number of different policies is often sufficient to win in every MDP. Thus, as a second challenge, we want to find a concise representation of a function that maps from the MDP to a winning policy. We consider a delivery robot that brings coffee to a desk. Rooms are parameterised by the location of obstacles such as chairs, in this case of a single chair at (OX, OY). Upon entering, the robot scans the room to obtain the location of the obstacles and plans how to reach the desk. We do not consider exiting the room afterwards. Due to the imprecision of the actuators, the system can be modelled as a slippery gridworld. See Fig.¬†1(a). As a manufacturer, we aim to ensure a 99%percent\\% success rate for various room configurations. The policy that ensures this success rate may depend on the location of the chair. We want to obtain a solution that looks as illustrated in Fig.¬†1(b): If a chair is in the upper left quadrant, our policy travels via the right bottom corner; if the chair is on the right, the robot travels via the left wall. If the chair is near the entrance, no policy ensures reaching the desk with more than 99%percent9999\\% probability. Let us clarify the setup of the relevant problems.\nWe have indexed sets of MDPs, which are represented using any program-like description language222We use the standard Prism language¬†. featuring some undefined integer constants or input arguments. The assignments to these constants can be used as indices for the individual MDPs: In our example, we have an MDP for (OX=3,OY=3)formulae-sequenceOX3OY3(\\textrm{OX}{=}3,\\textrm{OY}{=}3), an MDP for (OX=4,OY=2)formulae-sequenceOX4OY2(\\textrm{OX}{=}4,\\textrm{OY}{=}2), etc. For a fixed description, a set of indices corresponds to a set of MDPs.\nFor each MDP, we want to point to a potentially different winning policy. We suggest using policy trees: These trees recursively partition the set of MDPs into subsets. The leaves of the tree thus correspond to a set of MDPs. If such a leaf is labelled with a policy œÉùúé\\sigma, this policy is winning for all MDPs in the subset. Leafs labelled with ‚àÖ\\varnothing indicate no MDP in the subset has any winning policy. As we search for a policy for every MDP individually, it suffices to assume that winning policies are memoryless, i.e., mappings from states to actions. Furthermore, in this paper, we assume an arbitrary but atomic333dtControl¬†[ref]5 or Uppaal¬† concisely represent individual policies, e.g., as decision trees. We are not considering the space requirement of representing the policies.  representation of these policies. However, our leaves are labelled with a single policy that is winning on all MDPs. The question of whether such a robust policy exists is, in general, much harder¬†, since it can profit from (arbitrary) memory: Intuitively, based on the observed transitions, the policy may infer the likelihood of being applied to a particular MDP. The problem is indeed closely related to solving policies for partially observable MDPs. We avoid the computational costs and the potential lack of concise policies by considering only memoryless policies. However, even for an explicitly represented set of MDPs, it is NP-complete to consider the existence of such a policy. This is in contrast to the polynomial-time complexity of finding winning policies for every MDP. To find a (concise) expression capturing all MDPs that allow for a winning policy,\nwe propose an adaptation of a game-based abstraction approach¬†  that has been successful in the verification of sets of Markov chains¬† and for parametric MDPs¬†3. We discuss differences in Section¬†6.\nIn a nutshell, the game-based approach operates as follows: from the concise representation of the set of MDPs, a stochastic game (SG) is constructed that mimics all MDPs at once. One player selects actions in the MDP, and the other player selects in which MDP to evaluate the action. The constructed game is an abstraction, as the player choosing the MDPs can switch between MDPs based on the current state of the system.\nIf the SG satisfies a reachability property, then there is a winning policy for every MDP. In fact, there must be a robust winning policy, and this robust policy is easy to obtain.\nThe reverse does not hold. Thus, we either find a robust policy or obtain an inconclusive result. In the latter case, we divide-and-conquer: We split the set of MDPs and recursively invoke our algorithm on the smaller sets. The abstraction is effective when the number of necessary splits remains limited. Importantly, the size of the resulting tree corresponds to the number of¬†splits. An abstraction-refinement approach must be paired with efficient heuristics for refinement. We carefully study several variations that are guided by the model checking results. Furthermore, once we have found robust policies for various subfamilies, they are a good basis for further pruning of the tree, thereby yielding smaller trees with negligible overhead. We studied a rich set of alternatives to the main approach we present in the paper.\nMost prominently, to ensure that our game-based abstraction is not overly conservative, we compute policies that work well against a (uniform) distribution and then only verify whether they are robust. Our experiments show that the game-based abstraction dominates such an alternative. In summary, we contribute a scalable approach to policy synthesis for sets of MDPs. The key technique is a game-based abstraction (Sec.¬†3), embedded in a recursive approach with context-specific ways to refine the abstraction (Sec.¬†4). The result is an algorithm that finds policies for millions of (similar) MDPs at once and represents the necessary policies compactly. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates (Sec.¬†5) the superior scalability and discusses strengths and weaknesses, along with an ablation study to understand the origins of the performance. We extensively discuss further related work in Sec.¬†6.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: two baselines: Either we enumerate over the MDPs and solve each MDP individually, or we create an all-in-one MDP that contains the disjoint union of all MDPs and obtain a policy for that (giant) MDP¬†[ref]21 .
