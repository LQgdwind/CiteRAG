      "content": "Paper Title: An Extendable, Efficient and Effective Transformer-based Object Detector\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nObject detection  is a task of predicting a set of bounding boxes and classification labels for each object of interest. There have been significant efforts to develop efficient and effective detection backbones and pipelines  . Typically, as a pre-trained backbone is fine-tuned in single- and two-stage fashion; single-stage detectors produce predictions directly w.r.t. anchors or a grid of possible object centers, e.g., SSD  and YOLO , while two-stage detectors predict bounding boxes w.r.t. region proposals, e.g.,. Faster R-CNN 8. The success of modern object detectors has achieved very high detection accuracy, but they heavily depend on some meticulously designed components, such as anchor generation and non-maximum suppression  . In addition, finding the optimal trade-off between detection accuracy and inference speed is not a trivial task. In this paper, we study the integration of vision and detection transformers and show its potential to be a new generic detection pipeline, achieving good performance trade-offs without the meticulously designed components. Vision transformers  process an image as a sequence of small image patches, thereby facilitating consideration of\ninteraction among patches at all positions  (i.e., global attention).\nHowever, the original ViT  cannot be easily scaled to a wide range of vision tasks due to its high computational complexity, which increases quadratically with respect to image size.\nThe Swin Transformer [ref]7 alleviates the complexity issue by introducing the notion of shifted windows that support local attention and patch reduction operations, thereby improving compatibility for dense prediction tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation.\nA few approaches use vision transformers as detector backbones but achieve limited success [ref]7 9 .\nIn this work, we significantly improve the performance of detectors with transformer backbones by the proposed architectural changes and extensions for multi-task learning. Detection transformers   eliminate the meticulously designed components\n(e.g., anchor generation and non-maximum suppression)\nby combining convolutional network backbones and Transformer encoder-decoders.\nWhile the original DETR  achieves high detection performance, it suffers from slow convergence compared to previous detectors.\nFor example, DETR requires 500 epochs while the Faster R-CNN 8 needs only 37 epochs 0 for training.\nTo mitigate the issue, Zhu et al. 1 propose Deformable DETR which introduces deformable attention for utilizing multi-scale features as well as expediting the slow training process of DETR.\nIn this paper, we use the Deformable DETR as our base detection transformer framework and integrate it with the three recent vision transformers. DETR (ViT)   is a straightforward integration of DETR and ViT, which uses ViT as a feature extractor, followed by the transformer encoder-decoder in DETR.\nAs illustrated in Figure 2(a), it is a body–neck–head structure; the representation of input [𝙿𝙰𝚃𝙲𝙷]delimited-[]𝙿𝙰𝚃𝙲𝙷[\\mathtt{PATCH}] tokens are extracted by the ViT backbone and then directly fed to the transformer-based encoding and decoding pipeline.\nTo predict multiple objects, a fixed number of learnable [𝙳𝙴𝚃]delimited-[]𝙳𝙴𝚃[\\mathtt{DET}] tokens are provided as additional input to the decoder.\nSubsequently, the output embeddings by the decoder are considered as final predictions through the detection heads for classification and box regression.\nSince DETR (ViT) does not modify the backbone at all, it can be flexibly changed to any latest ViT model, e.g., Swin Transformer.\nAdditionally, its neck decoder facilitates the aggregation of multi-scale features and the use of additional techniques, such as auxiliary decoding loss and iterative box refinement, which help detect objects of different sizes and speed up the training process 1.\nHowever, the attention operation at the neck encoder adds significant computational overhead to the detector.\nIn contrast, ViDT resolves this issue by directly extracting fine-grained [𝙳𝙴𝚃]delimited-[]𝙳𝙴𝚃[\\mathtt{DET}] features from the Swin Transformer with RAM without maintaining the transformer encoder in the neck architecture. YOLOS    is a ViT architecture for object detection with minimal modifications.\nAs illustrated in Figure 2(b), YOLOS consists of a neck-free structure by appending randomly initialized learnable [𝙳𝙴𝚃]delimited-[]𝙳𝙴𝚃[\\mathtt{DET}] tokens to the sequence of input [𝙿𝙰𝚃𝙲𝙷]delimited-[]𝙿𝙰𝚃𝙲𝙷[\\mathtt{PATCH}] tokens.\nSince all the embeddings for [𝙿𝙰𝚃𝙲𝙷]delimited-[]𝙿𝙰𝚃𝙲𝙷[\\mathtt{PATCH}] and [𝙳𝙴𝚃]delimited-[]𝙳𝙴𝚃[\\mathtt{DET}] tokens interact via global attention, the final [𝙳𝙴𝚃]delimited-[]𝙳𝙴𝚃[\\mathtt{DET}] tokens are generated by the fine-tuned ViT backbone and then directly generate predictions through the detection heads without requiring any neck layer.\nWhile the naive DETR (ViT) suffers from the computational overhead from the neck layer, YOLOS enjoys efficient computations\nby treating the [𝙳𝙴𝚃]delimited-[]𝙳𝙴𝚃[\\mathtt{DET}] tokens as additional input for ViT.\nYOLOS shows that 2D object detection can be accomplished in a pure sequence-to-sequence manner, but this solution entails two inherent limitations: YOLOS inherits the drawback of the original ViT; the high computational complexity attributed to the global attention operation.\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, YOLOS shows poor latency compared with other fully transformer-based detectors, especially when its model size becomes larger, i.e., small →→\\rightarrow base. Thus, YOLOS is not scalable for the large model. YOLOS does not benefit from using any additional techniques essential for better detection performance, e.g., multi-scale features, due to the absence of the neck layer.\nAlthough YOLOS used the same DeiT backbone with Deformable DETR (DeiT), its AP was lower than the straightforward integration. In contrast, the encoder-free neck architecture of ViDT enjoys additional optimization techniques from Zhu et al. 1, resulting in faster convergence and better performance.\nFurther, our RAM enables us to combine the Swin Transformer222It is not limited to the Swin Transformer.\nOur reconfiguration scheme can be easily applied to other variants with simple modifications. See Appendix B.1 for the combination with CoaT and PVT-v2. and sequence-to-sequence paradigm for detection.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: the original ViT  cannot be easily scaled to a wide range of vision tasks due to its high computational complexity, which increases quadratically with respect to image size.\nThe Swin Transformer [ref]7 alleviates the complexity issue by introducing the notion of shifted windows that support local attention and patch reduction operations, thereby improving compatibility for dense prediction\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
