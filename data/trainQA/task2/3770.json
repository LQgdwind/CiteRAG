However, for some types of surrogate models, such as neural networks, using these few queries to train them may not be optimal. If an attacker has access to additional data with ground-truth labels, they may use them to stabilize the training process and improve the surrogate model. This additionally labeled dataset, therefore, would not be used to query the target. The additional dataset must not interfere with learning the target’s decision boundary. Therefore a sample weighting process is necessary. More formally, transfer learning (TL) or domain adaptation is the process where knowledge from a source domain 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} where we usually have plentiful labeled instances is transferred to a target domain 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} where labeled data are usually scarce. Data-based approaches view TL as knowledge transfer via data transformation and adjustment . One of the data-based approaches is instance-based TL, where the source domain data samples supplement the training data of the target domain using some form of weighting in the loss function. A general formulation for this approach is the following: where α∈[ref]0 𝛼01\\alpha\\in[ref]0  and ℒTsubscriptℒ𝑇\\mathcal{L}_{T} and ℒSsubscriptℒ𝑆\\mathcal{L}_{S} are the losses over the source and target domain data instances, respectively . In the above formulation, an active learner can play the part of the target domain, where an oracle provides the labels for the target data samples. This makes active learning more efficient since it can take advantage of more labeled instances from the source domain and thus minimize the queries of the target domain. In the literature, different proposals aim to select the most suitable data from the source domain. However, in our case, we use all available data. To adapt the above to the model stealing methodology from Section 4.1, all is required is to add another labeled source of data 𝒟𝒮subscript𝒟𝒮\\mathcal{D_{S}}, to the labeled pool of data in Figure 3. The active learning sampling strategies work exactly the same as before, using the thief dataset 𝒟t​h​i​e​fsubscript𝒟𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑒𝑓\\mathcal{D}_{thief}. During training, we perform sample weighting using the loss function below: where, s𝑠s is the number of source data points, t𝑡t is the number of labeled thief data points using the AL queries, and wisubscript𝑤𝑖w_{i} is calculated as follows: The wisubscript𝑤𝑖w_{i} is formulated in a way that it does not only contain the α𝛼\\alpha but, in addition, adjusts the weights based on the number of training data points in the 𝒟Ssubscript𝒟𝑆\\mathcal{D}_{S} and 𝒟t​h​i​e​fsubscript𝒟𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑒𝑓\\mathcal{D}_{thief} respectively. The values of α𝛼\\alpha determine the trade-off between the source and target domain data. When α=1𝛼1\\alpha=1, we only use the target data (𝒟t​h​i​e​fsubscript𝒟𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑒𝑓\\mathcal{D}_{thief}), and this is essentially the same as performing the original active learning model extraction attack. When α=0𝛼0\\alpha=0, we only use the source data, similar to using an independent model as a surrogate. According to , the optimal α𝛼\\alpha provides a measure of the similarity of the source and target domains. If the optimal α𝛼\\alpha is close to zero, the two domains are so similar that it is unnecessary to use many of the target data points. Similarly, if the optimal value of α𝛼\\alpha is high, the two domains are quite dissimilar, and therefore using 𝒟Ssubscript𝒟𝑆\\mathcal{D}_{S} might not be that beneficial. In all our experiments, we set α=0.8𝛼0.8\\alpha=0.8. The value was determined empirically by testing different values of α𝛼\\alpha on different targets. The combined attack described in this section assumes that the attacker has access to another labeled dataset (𝒟Ssubscript𝒟𝑆\\mathcal{D}_{S}), however, this dataset is not used for making queries to the target. Therefore, this allows the attacker to use publicly available data such as Ember  and Sorel20m , usually coming as pre-extracted features and do not contain the original binary files. Such datasets cannot be used to query AV targets requiring actual files for scanning. However, our combined transfer and active learning attack allows the attacker to combine smaller datasets of actual files with larger feature-only datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: the source domain data samples supplement the training data of the target domain using some form of weighting in the loss function. A general formulation for this approach is the following: where α∈[ref]0 𝛼01\\alpha\\in[ref]0  and ℒTsubscriptℒ𝑇\\mathcal{L}_{T} and ℒSsubscriptℒ𝑆\\mathcal{L}_{S} are the losses over the source and target domain data instances, respectively .
