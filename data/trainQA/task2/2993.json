      "content": "Paper Title: Interpreting Representation Quality of DNNs for 3D Point Cloud Processing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep neural networks (DNNs) have exhibited superior performance in various tasks, but the black-box nature of DNNs hampers the analysis of knowledge representations. Previous studies on explainable AI mainly focused on the following two directions. The first is to explain the knowledge encoded in a DNN, e.g. visualizing patterns encoded by a DNN  [ref]36 [ref]50 and estimating the saliency/importance/attribution of input variables w.r.t. the network output [ref]20  . The second is to evaluate the representation power of a DNN, e.g. the generalization and robustness of feature representations. This paper focuses on the intersection of the above two directions, i.e. analyzing the quality of knowledge representations of DNNs for 3D point cloud processing. Specifically, we aim to design metrics to illustrate properties of feature representations for different point cloud regions, including various types of regional sensitivities, the spatial smoothness of encoding 3D structures, and the representation complexity of a DNN. These metrics provide new perspectives to diagnose DNNs for 3D point clouds. For example, unlike the image processing relying on color information, the processing of 3D point clouds usually exclusively uses 3D structural information for classification. Therefore, a well-trained DNN for 3D point cloud processing is supposed to just use scale information and 3D structures for inference, and be robust to the rotation and translation. Regional sensitivities. We first propose six metrics to disentangle the overall model vulnerability into the regional rotation sensitivity, the regional translation sensitivity, the regional scale sensitivity, and three types of regional structure sensitivity (sensitivity to edges, surfaces, and masses), so that we can use such sensitivity metrics to evaluate the representation quality of a DNN (as Fig. 1 (a-b) shows). Each sensitivity metric (let us take the rotation sensitivity for example) is defined as the vulnerability of the regional attribution when we rotate the 3D point cloud with different angles. The regional attribution is computed as the Shapley value, which is widely used as a unique unbiased estimation of an input variable’s attribution  [ref]20   from the perspective of game theory. Based on the sensitivity metrics, we have discovered the following new insights, which have exposed problems with classic DNNs.\n ∙∙\\bullet Insight 1. Rotation robustness is the Achilles’ heel of most DNNs for point cloud processing. The rotation sensitivities of PointNet , PointNet++ , DGCNN , the non-dynamic version of DGCNN (referred to as GCNN in this paper) , and PointConv  are much higher than other sensitivities (see Fig. 1 (a)). ∙∙\\bullet Insight 2. It is usually difficult for DNNs to extract rotation-robust features from 3D points at edges and corners. These points are usually vulnerable to rotation-based attacks. ∙∙\\bullet Insight 3. What’s worse, DNNs usually cannot ignore features of such points at edges and corners. Instead, such rotation-sensitive points usually have large regional attributions. ∙∙\\bullet Insight 4. PointNet fails to model local 3D structures, because convolutional operations in PointNet encode each point independently. Thus, PointNet has low sensitivity to local 3D structures. Spatial smoothness. Beyond the sensitivity metrics, we also evaluate the spatial smoothness of knowledge representations of DNNs. We define the spatial smoothness of knowledge representations as the similarity among the neighboring regions’ attributions to network output. Most widely-used benchmark datasets for point cloud classification   only contain objects with simple 3D structures (e.g. a bed mainly composed of a few surfaces in Fig. 1 (c)), in which adjacent regions usually have similar 3D structures. Therefore, most adjacent regions are supposed to have similar attributions to the network output. We also find that the adversarial training increases the spatial smoothness of knowledge representations. Representation complexity. Besides regional sensitivities, we further extend the metric of multi-order interaction  to evaluate the representation complexity of a DNN, i.e. the maximum complexity of 3D structures that can be encoded in a DNN. The interaction of the m𝑚m-th order measures the additional benefits brought by collaboration between two point cloud regions i,j𝑖𝑗i,j under the contexts of other m𝑚m regions, where m𝑚m reflects the contextual complexity of the collaboration between regions i𝑖i and j𝑗j. High-order interactions usually represent global and complex 3D structures, corresponding to the collaboration between point cloud regions i,j𝑖𝑗i,j and massive other regions. Low-order interactions usually describe local and simple 3D structures, without being influenced by many contextual regions (see Fig. 1 (d)). Based on such interactions, we have discovered the following new insights. ∙∙\\bullet Insight 5. Most DNNs fail to encode high-order interactions. I.e. most DNNs mainly focus on local structures and do not extract many global and complex structures from normal samples. ∙∙\\bullet Insight 6. Rotation-sensitive regions usually activate abnormal high-order interactions (global and complex structures). The very limited global structures modeled by the DNN are usually over-fitted to training samples. Thus, when the sample is rotated, the activated global and complex structures usually appear as abnormal patterns. ∙∙\\bullet Insight 7. Besides, in terms of model robustness, adversarial training based on adversarial samples w.r.t. using rotations/translations for attack is a typical way to improve the robustness to rotation and translation. Thus, we use the proposed sensitivity metrics to explain the inner mechanism of how and why the adversarially trained DNN is robust to rotation and translation. We find that (1) the adversarial training shifts the attention from the global orientations and positions to the structural information, thereby boosting the sensitivity to local 3D structures. (2) The adversarial training usually increases both the quantity and the complexity of 3D structures (high-order interactions from normal samples) modeled in a DNN, which boosts the robustness to the rotation and translation.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: Previous studies on explainable AI mainly focused on the following two directions.
