      "content": "Paper Title: Time-Aware Neighbor Sampling for Temporal Graph Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany real-world graphs are not static but evolving, e.g., edges can appear at any time .\nNodes may interact either due to gradual trends or fortuitous encounters.\nThese graphs are called temporal (or dynamic) graphs .\nUsing static graph methods, e.g., GraphSAGE [ref]6, to model temporal graphs is suboptimal since they cannot capture the evolutionary patterns.\nRecently, temporal graph networks (TGNs)    have been proposed to support learning on temporal graphs. Advanced TGNs utilize a temporal graph aggregation module to obtain a target node‚Äôs embedding  , which aggregate the messages from the target node‚Äôs neighbors.\nThe embedding is used to predict the target node‚Äôs properties [ref]19.\nTo prevent the number of neighbors from increasing without limitation as time flows, TGNs sample neighbors for the message aggregation (see Fig. 1), which improves their efficiency and stabilization [ref]6  .\nSpecifically, [ref]6 and  utilize uniform neighbor sampling, that samples every neighbor with the same probability.\n improves the neighbor sampling by incorporating temporal information, which samples the neighbors that interacted with the target node most recently. Although sampling the most recent neighbors is generally more effective than uniform sampling ,\nwe argue that this may not be the only or the best option to utilize temporal information for neighbor sampling.\nFirst, sampling successive neighbors along the time axis can induce information redundancy.\nFor example, a student can repeatedly interact with his classmates for several times in a short period because they are interested in a new computer game.\nRepeatedly considering such redundant interactions does not provide more useful information.\nSecond, sampling the most recent neighbors limits the temporal scale of the receptive neighborhood [ref]22, i.e., the neighborhood contributing to the target node‚Äôs embedding.\nEffectively predicting a node‚Äôs properties may require long-range dependencies.\nFor example, a woman meets her fitness coach for exercising every Saturday.\nSampling the most recent neighbors cannot capture her long-range exercising trends.\n To address the above issues, we propose an expanded neighbor sampling approach, which inserts spacing between the sampled neighbors on the time axis.\nWe define the expansion rate to control the spacing size.\nWith the expansion rate as rùëür, every sampled neighbor skips the next r‚àí1ùëü1r-1 neighbors in time order (see Fig. 2).\nThe inserted spacing reduces the redundancy between the sampled neighbors, while extending the temporal scale of the receptive neighborhood. This expanded neighbor sampling fixes a unified expansion rate for all the nodes at any time.\nThis may be suboptimal since predicting different nodes‚Äô time-varying properties can require various expansion rates.\nHence, beyond the unified expansion rate,\nwe aim to learn suitable and adaptive expansion rates from temporal information to offer appropriate receptive neighborhoods.\nLearning how to sample neighbors is non-trivial, since the neighbor indices in time order are discrete and not differentiable.\nIn this work, we view the neighbors as image pixels and neighbors‚Äô messages as pixel values, and compare the neighbor sampling to the process of image rendering .\nConcretely, we transfer the neighbor indices from discrete values to continuous ones by interpolating neighbors‚Äô messages, so that the neighbors‚Äô messages of any index in time order, even if not an integer, can be accessed.\nWe encapsulate this idea into a new neighbor sampling method, called TNS (Time-aware Neighbor Sampling), which learns expansion rates using an expansion learning module,\nand then uses the learned expansion rates to guide the neighbor sampling for message aggregation. TNS can be incorporated into the popular TGN models to enhance their performance.\nIt needs no extra supervision and can be trained in an end-to-end style.\nWe analyze the back-propagation\non TNS and find that TNS is automatically and implicitly guided to sample the neighbors that are most beneficial for prediction.\nIn addition, theoretical analysis shows that using our TNS to improve the effectiveness of TGNs does not increase their time complexity. We evaluate our TNS method on edge prediction and node classification tasks using the standard temporal graph datasets: Reddit , Wikipedia , MOOC .\nWe measure its performance\nthrough the metrics: test accuracy, average precision (AP), and the area under the ROC accuracy curve (AUC), under inductive and transductive settings.\nOverall, TNS achieves substantial improvements when applied to popular TGN models  \nand enhances them to outperform the baseline methods.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: can appear at any time .\nNodes may interact either due to gradual trends or fortuitous encounters.\nThese graphs are called temporal (or dynamic) graphs .\nUsing static graph methods, e.g., GraphSAGE [ref]6, to model temporal graphs is suboptimal since they cannot capture the evolutionary patterns.\nRecently, temporal graph networks (TGNs)    have been proposed to support learning on temporal\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
