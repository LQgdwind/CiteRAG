(Social Networks, Gssubscript𝐺𝑠G_{s}) A social network, Gssubscript𝐺𝑠G_{s}, is a triple\n(V​(Gs),E​(Gs),ϕ​(Gs))𝑉subscript𝐺𝑠𝐸subscript𝐺𝑠italic-ϕsubscript𝐺𝑠(V(G_{s}),E(G_{s}),\\phi(G_{s})), where V​(Gs)𝑉subscript𝐺𝑠V(G_{s}) is a set of M𝑀M users\nu1subscript𝑢1u_{1}, u2subscript𝑢2u_{2}, …italic-…\\dots, and uMsubscript𝑢𝑀u_{M}, E​(Gs)𝐸subscript𝐺𝑠E(G_{s}) is a set of edges\neu,vsubscript𝑒𝑢𝑣e_{u,v} (friendship between two users u𝑢u and v𝑣v), and\nϕ​(Gs)italic-ϕsubscript𝐺𝑠\\phi(G_{s}) is a mapping function: V​(Gs)×V​(Gs)→E​(Gs)→𝑉subscript𝐺𝑠𝑉subscript𝐺𝑠𝐸subscript𝐺𝑠V(G_{s})\\times V(G_{s})\\rightarrow E(G_{s}). In Definition 1, each user, ujsubscript𝑢𝑗u_{j} (for 1≤j≤M1𝑗𝑀1\\leq j\\leq M), in the social network Gssubscript𝐺𝑠G_{s} is associated with a vector of possible keywords (or skills) uj.k​e​y=(k​e​y1j,k​e​y2j,…,k​e​y|k​e​y|j)formulae-sequencesubscript𝑢𝑗𝑘𝑒𝑦𝑘𝑒subscriptsuperscript𝑦𝑗1𝑘𝑒subscriptsuperscript𝑦𝑗2…𝑘𝑒subscriptsuperscript𝑦𝑗𝑘𝑒𝑦u_{j}.key=(key^{j}_{1},key^{j}_{2},\\dots,key^{j}_{|key|}). Each edge (friendship), eu,vsubscript𝑒𝑢𝑣e_{u,v} (∈E​(Gs)absent𝐸subscript𝐺𝑠\\in E(G_{s})), in social networks is associated with a vector of topics of interest eu,v.𝒯=(tpu,v1,tpu,v2,e_{u,v}.\\mathcal{T}=(tp^{1}_{u,v},tp_{u,v}^{2}, …,tpu,v|𝒯|)\\dots,tp^{|\\mathcal{T}|}_{u,v}),\nwhere t​pu,vj𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑢𝑣𝑗tp_{u,v}^{j} is the influence probability (weight) of interested topic j𝑗j and |𝒯|𝒯|\\mathcal{T}| is the size of the topic set eu,v.𝒯formulae-sequencesubscript𝑒𝑢𝑣𝒯e_{u,v}.\\mathcal{T}. Modeling Structural Cohesiveness: Previous works usually defined the community as a subgraph in social networks Gssubscript𝐺𝑠G_{s} with high structural cohesiveness. In this paper, to capture structural cohesiveness in Gssubscript𝐺𝑠G_{s}, we consider the connected (k,d)𝑘𝑑(k,d)-truss [ref]31. Specifically, we first define a triangle in Gssubscript𝐺𝑠G_{s}, which is a cycle of length 3 denoted as △ua​ub​ucsubscript△subscript𝑢𝑎subscript𝑢𝑏subscript𝑢𝑐\\triangle_{u_{a}u_{b}u_{c}}, for user vertices ua,ub,uc∈V​(Gs)subscript𝑢𝑎subscript𝑢𝑏subscript𝑢𝑐𝑉subscript𝐺𝑠u_{a},u_{b},u_{c}\\in V(G_{s}); the support, s​u​p​(e)𝑠𝑢𝑝𝑒sup(e), of an edge e∈E​(Gs)𝑒𝐸subscript𝐺𝑠e\\in E(G_{s}) is given by the number of triangles containing e𝑒e in Gssubscript𝐺𝑠G_{s} . Then, the connected (k,d)𝑘𝑑(k,d)-truss is defined as follows. (Connected (k,d)kd(k,d)-Truss [ref]31):\n\nGiven a graph Gssubscript𝐺𝑠G_{s}, and an integer k𝑘k, a connected subgraph S∈Gs𝑆subscript𝐺𝑠S\\in G_{s} is called a (k,d)𝑘𝑑(k,d)-truss if two conditions hold: (1) ∀e∈E​(S),s​u​p​(e)≥(k−2)formulae-sequencefor-all𝑒𝐸𝑆𝑠𝑢𝑝𝑒𝑘2\\forall e\\in E(S),sup(e)\\geq(k-2), and (2) ∀u,v∈V​(S),d​i​s​tS​N​(u,v)formulae-sequencefor-all𝑢𝑣𝑉𝑆𝑑𝑖𝑠subscript𝑡𝑆𝑁𝑢𝑣\\forall u,v\\in V(S),dist_{SN}(u,v) <dabsent𝑑<d, where s​u​p​(e)𝑠𝑢𝑝𝑒sup(e) is the number of triangles containing e𝑒e and d​i​s​tS​N​(u,v)𝑑𝑖𝑠subscript𝑡𝑆𝑁𝑢𝑣dist_{SN}(u,v) is the shortest path distance (the minimum number of hops) between users u𝑢u and v𝑣v on social networks. Modeling Social Influences: Now, we discuss the data model for social influences in social networks. Each edge eu,vsubscript𝑒𝑢𝑣e_{u,v} is associated with a vector, 𝒯=(tpu,v1,tpu,v2,\\mathcal{T}=(tp^{1}_{u,v},tp_{u,v}^{2}, …,tpu,v|𝒯|)\\dots,tp^{|\\mathcal{T}|}_{u,v}), of influence probabilities on different topics. Further, we denote the path p​a​t​hu,v𝑝𝑎𝑡subscriptℎ𝑢𝑣path_{u,v} as a path on the social network connecting two users u𝑢u and v𝑣v such that p​a​t​hu,v=(u=a1→a2→…→a|p​a​t​hu,v|=v)𝑝𝑎𝑡subscriptℎ𝑢𝑣𝑢subscript𝑎1→subscript𝑎2→…→subscript𝑎𝑝𝑎𝑡subscriptℎ𝑢𝑣𝑣path_{u,v}=(u=a_{1}\\to a_{2}\\to\\dots\\to a_{|path_{u,v}|}=v).\nIt is worth noting that, Barbieri et al.  extended the classic IC and LT models to be topic-aware and introduced a novel topic-aware influence-driven propagation model that is more accurate in describing real-world cascades than standard propagation models.\nIn fact, users have different interests and items have different characteristics, thus, we follow the text-based topic discovery algorithm   to extract user’s interest topics and their distribution on each edge.\nSpecifically, for each edge eu,vsubscript𝑒𝑢𝑣e_{u,v}, we obtain an influence score vector, for example, (basketball:0.1, technology:0.8), indicating that the influence probabilities of user v𝑣v influenced by user u𝑢u on topics, basketball and technology, are 0.1 and 0.8, respectively. Below, we define the influence score function. (Influence Score Function ).\nGiven a social-network graph Gssubscript𝐺𝑠G_{s}, a topic vector 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T}, and two social-network users u,v∈V​(Gs)𝑢𝑣𝑉subscript𝐺𝑠u,v\\in V(G_{s}), we define the influence score from u𝑢u to v𝑣v as follows: For two vertices u,v∈V​(Gs)𝑢𝑣𝑉subscript𝐺𝑠u,v\\in V(G_{s}) such that p​a​t​hu,v=(u=a1→a2→…→a|p​a​t​hu,v|=v)𝑝𝑎𝑡subscriptℎ𝑢𝑣𝑢subscript𝑎1→subscript𝑎2→…→subscript𝑎𝑝𝑎𝑡subscriptℎ𝑢𝑣𝑣path_{u,v}=(u=a_{1}\\to a_{2}\\to\\dots\\to a_{|path_{u,v}|}=v), and a topic vector 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T},\nwe define the influence score on p​a​t​hu,v𝑝𝑎𝑡subscriptℎ𝑢𝑣path_{u,v} as follows: where f​(ai,ai+1|𝒯)𝑓subscript𝑎𝑖conditionalsubscript𝑎𝑖1𝒯f(a_{i},a_{i+1}|\\mathcal{T}) is the influence score from aisubscript𝑎𝑖a_{i} to ai+1subscript𝑎𝑖1a_{i+1} of the two adjacent vertices aisubscript𝑎𝑖a_{i} and ai+1subscript𝑎𝑖1a_{i+1} based on the query topic vector 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T}. We compute the influence score between any two adjacent vertices aisubscript𝑎𝑖a_{i} and ai+1subscript𝑎𝑖1a_{i+1} as follows: where t​pu,vj𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑢𝑣𝑗tp_{u,v}^{j} is the weight probability on topic j𝑗j, 𝒯jsuperscript𝒯𝑗\\mathcal{T}^{j} is the j𝑗j-th query topic, and |𝒯|𝒯|\\mathcal{T}| is the length of the topic set 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T}. In Definition 3, we define the influence score between any two users in the social network Gssubscript𝐺𝑠G_{s}. Given a topic vector 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} and a subset S⊆Gs𝑆subscript𝐺𝑠S\\subseteq G_{s}, we define the influence score between subgraph S𝑆S and a user v𝑣v as follows: where i​n​f​S​c​o​r​e​(u,v|𝒯)𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑢conditional𝑣𝒯infScore(u,v|\\mathcal{T}) is defined in Eq. (2). Note that, the pairwise influence (or mutual influence) in our TCS-SSN problem indicates the influence of one user on another user in the community. In particular, the pairwise influence is not symmetric, in other words, for two users u𝑢u and v𝑣v, the influence of u𝑢u on v𝑣v can be different from that of v𝑣v on u𝑢u. Thus, in our TCS-SSN community definition, we require both influences, from u𝑢u to v𝑣v and from v𝑣v to u𝑢u, be greater than the threshold θ𝜃\\theta (i.e., mutual influences between u𝑢u and v𝑣v are high), which ensures high connectivity or interaction among users in the community.\nOther metrics such as pairwise keyword similarity  (e.g., Jaccard similarity) are usually symmetric (providing a single similarity measure between two users), which cannot capture mutual interaction or influences. Most importantly, users u𝑢u and v𝑣v may have common keywords/topics, however, it is possible that they may not have high influences to each other in reality.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: in social networks Gssubscript𝐺𝑠G_{s} with high structural cohesiveness.
