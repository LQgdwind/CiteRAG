      "content": "Paper Title: ART-Rx: A Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Controlled Adaptive Real-Time Threshold Receiver for Molecular Communication\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe algorithm of ART-Rx is based on control theories and consists of three main components: the proportional term, the integral term, and the derivative term. Each of the components contributes to the control signal that ultimately adjusts the Rx detection threshold in a manner that accommodates instantaneous corrections and long-term optimizations of the system. Figure 3 presents a flow diagram of the algorithm behind ART-Rx. At each symbol interval t𝑡t, the error e​(t)𝑒𝑡e(t) is calculated as the difference between the peak receptor binding level observed y​(t)𝑦𝑡y(t) and the desired setpoint r​(t)𝑟𝑡r(t), i.e., The observed value y​(t)𝑦𝑡y(t) represents the maximum number of bound receptors during the symbol interval, which is directly related to the drain-source current IDSsubscript𝐼DSI_{\\text{DS}} of BioFET-based Rx [ref]12. The setpoint r​(t)𝑟𝑡r(t) is a reference value that represents the optimal level of receptor binding for accurate detection. This can be determined based on prior knowledge of the system or, in other cases, dynamically updated using statistical measures such as a moving average . The proportional term P​(t)𝑃𝑡P(t) provides the system with an immediate corrective action that is proportional to the current error. where KPsubscript𝐾𝑃K_{P} is the proportional gain. P​(t)𝑃𝑡P(t) makes adjustments to the detection threshold directly proportional to the magnitude of the error  , allowing an initial rapid response of the system to changes in the observed signal. A higher value of KPsubscript𝐾𝑃K_{P} will increase the system’s sensitivity to the current error, but if not properly tuned, may lead to an overshoot. The role of the integral term I​(t)𝐼𝑡I(t) is to address the accumulated past errors in the system, effectively eliminating offsets and biases in the steady state. where KIsubscript𝐾𝐼K_{I} is the integral gain and Δ​tΔ𝑡\\Delta t is the time interval between symbol transmissions. Through the integration of errors over time, I​(t)𝐼𝑡I(t) corrects for any persistent discrepancies between the setpoint and the observed value, steering the system toward global optimality through the minimization of cumulative errors. However, an excessively high KIsubscript𝐾𝐼K_{I} can lead to negative effects within the system such as integral wind-up and instability  . The role of the derivative term D​(t)𝐷𝑡D(t) is to predict future errors by observing the rate of change in errors within the system. where KDsubscript𝐾𝐷K_{D} is the derivative gain. D​(t)𝐷𝑡D(t) enhances the system’s responsiveness by providing a damping effect which reduces overshoot and prevents oscillations. The derivative term anticipates future errors based on the current error’s rate of change, contributing to system stability and achieving local optimality by minimizing instantaneous deviations  . We can therefore obtain the control signal u​(t)𝑢𝑡u(t) from the sum of the proportional, integral, and derivative terms, i.e., The detection threshold θ​(t)𝜃𝑡\\theta(t) is updated iteratively according to the control signal, i.e., The updated threshold is then used for the detection of the subsequent symbol, enabling the system to adapt to changes in the MC channel in discrete real-time. To avoid integral windup, which happens when the integral term accumulates excessively due to sustained errors, anti-windup strategies are implemented by clamping the integral term within predefined limits, i.e., where clamp​(x,a,b)clamp𝑥𝑎𝑏\\mathrm{clamp}(x,a,b) restricts x𝑥x within the ranges of [a,b]𝑎𝑏[a,b], and Iminsubscript𝐼minI_{\\text{min}}, Imaxsubscript𝐼maxI_{\\text{max}} are the minimum and maximum allowed integral values, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: value y​(t)𝑦𝑡y(t) represents the maximum number of bound receptors during the symbol interval, which is directly related to the drain-source current IDSsubscript𝐼DSI_{\\text{DS}} of BioFET-based Rx [ref]12.
