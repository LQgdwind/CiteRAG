Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

And they get along.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe consider the same two datasets as in our domain generalization experiments in Section 2.4.\nWe use prediction consistency (PC) to quantify individual fairness following prior works studying these datasets [ref]3 [ref]9.\nFor the Toxicity dataset, we modify identity tokens in the test comments and compute prediction consistency with respect to all 50 identity tokens [ref]8.\nA pair of comments that only differ in an identity token, e.g., “gay” vs “straight”, are intuitively similar and should be assigned the same prediction to satisfy individual fairness.\nFor the Bios dataset, we consider prediction consistency with respect to changes in gender pronouns and names. Such changes result in biographies that should be treated similarly. In these experiments, we have one labeled training dataset, rather than labeled source and unlabeled target datasets typical for DA setting.\nAs shown in Section 3, the key idea behind achieving individual fairness using DA techniques is to split the available train data into source and target domains such that aligning their representations pertains to the fairness goals.\nTo this end, in the Bios dataset we split the train data into all-male and all-female biographies, and the Toxicity dataset we split into a domain with comments containing any of the aforementioned 50 identity tokens and a domain with comments without any identity tokens.\nThe ERM baseline is trained on the complete training dataset.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: the same two datasets as in our domain generalization experiments in Section 2.4.\nWe use prediction consistency (PC) to quantify individual fairness following prior works studying these datasets [ref]3 [ref]9.\nFor the Toxicity dataset, we modify identity tokens in the test comments and compute prediction consistency with respect to all 50 identity tokens [ref]8.\nA pair of comments that only\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
