Efficient Graph Neural Networks\nTo accelerate the optimization through batch gradient descent to GNN without\ntoo much deviation,\nseveral models [ref]14    propose to sample data points according to graph topology.\nThese models propose different sampling strategies to obtain stable results.\nGraphSAGE [ref]14 produces a subgraph with limited neighbors for\neach node while FastGCN  samples fixed nodes for each layer\nwith the importance sampling.\nThe variance of sampling is further controlled in .\nClusterGCN  aims to generate an approximate graph\nwith plenty of connected components so that each component can be used\nas a batch per step.\nSGC  simplifies GCN by setting all activations of middle layers\nas linear functions and SSGC  further improves it.\nIn summary, SGNN proposed in this paper retains the non-linearity and requires\nno node sampling or sub-graph sampling.\nL2-GCN  attempts to extend the idea of the classical stacked auto-encoder\ninto the popular GCN while DGL-GNN  further develops a parallel version.\nThey both fail to train all GNN modules jointly\nbut SGNN firstly offers a novel framework to train them\nlike training layers in a conventional neural network. Connections to Existing Models\nStacked Auto-Encoder (SAE)  is a model applied to the pre-training of neural networks.\nIt trains the current two-layer auto-encoder  and then feeds the latent\nfeatures output by the middle layer to the next auto-encoder.\nThe model is often used as a pre-training model instead of a formal model.\nMGAE  is an extension of SAE and its fundamental module is graph auto-encoder .\nThe main difference compared with the proposed model is whether each module\ncould be perceived by modules from both forward and backward directions.\nThe stack paradigm is similar to the classical boosting models   0 while\nsome works 1 2 also investigated the boosting algorithm of neural networks.\nIn recent years, some boosting GNN models 3 4 are also developed.\nThe most boosting algorithms (e.g., 1 3) aim to learn a prediction function gradually\nwhile the proposed SGNN aims to learn ideal embeddings gradually.\nNote that AdaGCN 4 is also trained gradually and the features\nare combined using AdaBoost .\nMore importantly, all these boosting methods for GNNs are only\ntrained forward and the backward training is missing.\nDeep neural interface 5 proposes to decouple neural networks to\nasynchronously accelerate the computation of gradients. The decoupling\nis an acceleration trick to compute the gradients of LùêøL-layer networks,\nwhile SGNN proposed in this paper explicitly separates an LùêøL-layer GNN into\nLùêøL simple modules. In other words, the ultimate goal of SGNN is not to optimize\nan LùêøL-layer GNN.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: other applications  .\nAs  claimed that GNNs suffer from the over-smoothing problem,\nGALA  develops the graph sharpening and ResGCN  attempts to\ndesigns a deeper architecture.\nThe theoretical works   [ref]31\nhave different views towards the depth of GNNs.\nSome works   claimed that the expressive power of GNN decreases with the increase\nof layers, while the others argue that the assumptions in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
