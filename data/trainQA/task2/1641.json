      "content": "Paper Title: Comparative evaluation of CNN architectures for Image Caption Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImage Caption Generation involves training a Machine Learning model to learn to automatically produce a single sentence description for an image. For human beings it is a trivial task. However for a Machine Learning method to be able to perform this task, it has to learn to extract all the relevant information contained in the image and then to convert this visual information into a suitable representation of the image which can be used to generate a natural language sentence description of the image. The visual features extracted from the image should contain information about all the relevant objects present in the image, the relationships among the objects and the activity settings of the scene. Then the information needs to be suitably encoded, generally in a vectorized form, so that the sentence generator module can convert this into a human readable sentence. Furthermore, some information may be implicit in the scene such as a scene where a group of football players are running in a football field but the football is not present in the scene frame. Thus the model may need to learn some level of knowledge about the world as well. However, the ability to automate the caption generation process has many benefits for the society as it can either replace or complement any method that seeks to extract some information from the images and has applications in the fields of education, military, medicine, etc., as well as applications in some specific problems such as helping visually impaired people in navigation or generating news information from images. During the last few years there has been tremendous progress in Image caption generation due to advances in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing domains. The progress made in Object Recognition task due to availability of large annotated datasets such as ImageNet  has led to availability of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models which can extract useful information from the image in vectorized form which can then be used by caption generation module (called the decoder) to generate caption sentences. Similarly, progress in solving machine translation with methods such as encoder-decoder framework proposed in , [ref]3 has led to adoption of similar format for Image Caption Generation where the source sentence in machine translation task is replaced by the image in caption generation task and then the process is approached as ’translation’ of image to sentence, as has been done in works such as ,,[ref]6. The attention based framework proposed by  where the decoder learns to focus on certain parts of the source sentence at certain time-steps has been adapted in caption generation in such as way that the decoder focuses on portions of image at certain time-steps [ref]8. A detailed survey of Image Caption Generation has been provided in  and 0. Although there has been a lot of focus on the decoder which ’interprets’ the image features and ’translates’ them into a caption, there has not been enough focus on the encoder which ’encodes’ the source image into a suitable visual representation (called image features). This is mainly because most methods use transfer learning to extract image features from pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) 1 which are trained on the Object Detection task of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2 where the goal is to predict the object category out of 1000 categories annotated in the dataset. Since the last layer of the CNN produces a 1000 length vector containing relative probabilities of all object categories, the last layer is dropped and the output(s) of intermediate layer(s) is(are) used as image features. Numerous CNN architectures have been proposed with varying complexity and efficacy and many have been utilized for Image Caption Generation as well. However, this makes it difficult to undertake a fair comparison of Image Caption Generation methods since the difference in performance could be either due to difference in effectiveness of decoders in sentence generation or due to difference in effectiveness of encoders in feature extraction. Hence, in this work we evaluate Image Caption Generation using popular CNN architectures which have been used for Object Recognition task and analyse the co-relation between model complexity, as measured by the total number of parameters, and the effectiveness of different CNN architectures on feature extraction for Image Caption Generation. We use two popular Image Caption Generation frameworks: (a) Neural Image Caption (NIC) Generator proposed in [ref]6 and (b) Soft Attention based Image Caption Generation proposed in [ref]8.\nWe observe that the performance of Image Caption Generation varies with the use of different CNN architectures and is not directly correlated with either the model complexity or performance of CNN on object recognition task. To further validate our findings, we evaluate multiple versions of ResNet CNN 3 with different depths (number of layers in the CNN) and complexity: ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, ResNet101, ResNet152 where the numerical part in the name stands for the number of layers in the CNN (such as 18 layers in ResNet18 and so on). We evaluate multiple versions of VGG CNN 4 architecture: VGG-11, VGG-13, VGG-16 and VGG-19 and multiple versions of DenseNet CNN 5 architecture: Densenet121, Densenet169, DenseNet201 and Densenet161, each of which has different number of parameters. We observe that performance does not improve with the increase in the number of layers, and consequently, increase in model complexity. This further validates our observation that effectiveness of CNN architectures for Image Caption Generation depends on the model design and that the model complexity or the performance on Object Detection task are not good indicators of effectiveness of CNN for Image Caption Generation.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first such detailed analysis of the role of CNN architectures as image feature extractors for Image Caption Generation task. In addition, to further the future research work in this area, we also make the implementation code111https://github.com/iamsulabh/cnn_variants available for reference. This paper is divided into following sections: In Section II,we discuss the relevant methods proposed in the literature, in Section III, we discuss the methodology of our work, in Section IV we present and discuss the experimental results and in Section V we discuss the implications of our work and possible future studies.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: used by caption generation module (called the decoder) to generate caption sentences.
