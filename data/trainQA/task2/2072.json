      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Explanations With Relevant Sets\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent work proposed δ𝛿\\delta-relevant inputs (or\nsets) 2, which represent probabilistic\nexplanations for the predictions made by a classifier given some\ninput.\nδ𝛿\\delta-relevant sets were shown to generalize both\nAnchors  and\nPI-explanations , thus revealing a connection\nbetween model-agnostic explanations (e.g. Anchors) and model-accurate\nexplanations (e.g. PI-explanations).\nMoreover, δ𝛿\\delta-relevant sets offer a natural solution for\nincreasing the interpretability of PI-explanations, at the cost of\nobtaining intuitive explanations that hold in most, but not all,\npoints in feature space.\nA formidable downside of δ𝛿\\delta-relevant sets is that their\ncomputation is hard for NPPPsuperscriptNPPP\\textnormal{NP}^{\\textnormal{PP}}. This signifies that for most\npractical examples, the time for computing minimum δ𝛿\\delta-relevant\nsets will be prohibitive in practice.\nTo address the computational complexity of finding minimum\nδ𝛿\\delta-relevant sets, a number of solutions can be envisioned.\nA first solution is the approximate computation of δ𝛿\\delta-relevant\nsets. However, for this solution, the formal guarantees offered by\nδ𝛿\\delta-relevant sets may no longer hold.\nA second solution is to identify which ML models allow for the\nefficient computation of δ𝛿\\delta-relevant sets.\nFinally, a third solution is to investigate possible ways of relaxing\nthe original definition of δ𝛿\\delta-relevant\nsets 2. This paper addresses the second and third solutions listed above.\nFirst, the paper proposes alternative definitions of δ𝛿\\delta-relevant\nsets. Second, the paper analyzes the computation of (different\nvariants of) δ𝛿\\delta-relevant sets in the case of decision trees\n(DTs). Although generally regarded as\ninterpretable [ref]7  , recent\nwork showed that DTs can exhibit explanation\nredundancy  , i.e. there exist DTs\ncontaining paths that are (possibly arbitrarily) longer than a\nPI-explanation . Furthermore, existing\nexperimental evidence confirms that explanation redundancy is observed\nin DTs learned with state of the art DT learners .\nThus, even in the case of DTs, the computation of δ𝛿\\delta-relevant\nsets is of interest when the goal is to improve the interpretability\nof ML models. The main results of the paper can thus be summarized as follows.\nFirst, the paper shows that, for the decision version of computing a\nminimum size δ𝛿\\delta-relevant set (i.e. the problem studied in\nrecent work 2), is in NP in the case of DTs.\nThe proof of this result offers a solution for computing a\nminimum-size δ𝛿\\delta-relevant set, in the case of DTs, by using\nmaximum satisfiability modulo theories\n(MaxSMT)  .\nSecond, the paper shows that, in the case of DTs, a relaxed definition\nof δ𝛿\\delta-relevant set enables the computation of (relaxed)\nsubset-minimal δ𝛿\\delta-relevant sets in polynomial time.\nThird, the paper shows that ML models based on knowledge compilation\n(KC) languages 1, including those studied in\nrecent papers on XAI for KC\nlanguages  7   ,\nthe computation of (relaxed) subset-minimal δ𝛿\\delta-relevant sets is\nalso in polynomial time.\nFourth, the paper shows that recently proposed duality results for\nexplanations 5 3, which in practice enable\nthe enumeration of explanations, can be extended to the setting of\nδ𝛿\\delta-relevant sets.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: δ𝛿\\delta-relevant\nsets. Second, the paper analyzes the computation of (different\nvariants of) δ𝛿\\delta-relevant sets in the case of decision trees\n(DTs). Although generally regarded as\ninterpretable [ref]7  , recent\nwork showed that DTs can exhibit explanation\nredundancy  , i.e. there exist DTs\ncontaining paths that are (possibly arbitrarily) longer than a\nPI-explanation .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
