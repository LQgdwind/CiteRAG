Usually the training of a DNN will optimize the output f𝜽subscript𝑓𝜽f_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} with respect to a cost functional 𝒞:ℱ→ℝ:𝒞→ℱℝ\\mathcal{C}:\\mathcal{F}\\to\\mathbb{R}, where the usual gradient descent will be driven by the differential equation ∂t𝜽=−∇𝜽𝒞subscript𝑡𝜽subscript∇𝜽𝒞\\partial_{t}\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=-\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\mathcal{C}. However, a nontrivial insight from  shows that it is technically easier to lift the equation to the Hilbert space level. Observe that ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} becomes a Hilbert space with respect to the inner product ⟨.,.⟩N0\\langle.,.\\rangle_{N_{0}} given by ⟨f,g⟩=𝔼𝒙∼𝐃⁡[f​(𝒙)T​g​(𝒙)]𝑓𝑔subscript𝔼similar-to𝒙𝐃𝑓superscript𝒙𝑇𝑔𝒙\\langle f,g\\rangle=\\operatorname{\\mathbb{E}}_{\\boldsymbol{x}\\sim\\mathbf{D}}\\left[f(\\boldsymbol{x})^{T}g(\\boldsymbol{x})\\right] for a given data distribution 𝐃𝐃\\mathbf{D} on the input space ℝN0superscriptℝsubscript𝑁0\\mathbb{R}^{N_{0}}. Now, using the chain rule, we get where ∂f𝒞subscript𝑓𝒞\\partial_{f}\\mathcal{C} denotes the usual Fréchet derivative. This implies that the training evolution is given by where the right hand side denotes the kernel gradient with respect to the NTK 𝚯L​(𝜽)superscript𝚯𝐿𝜽\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}^{L}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}), which in turn is defined by: For a further detailed discussion of the kernel gradient and the NTK, we refer the reader to Section 3 of  and [ref]14. Now we give a proof of Proposition 6.1. To keep the discussion technically less demanding, we give a detailed proof for the sequential case, and indicate how a proof can be given for the simultaneous limit regime, following . Let us first tackle the base case of the induction. Recall that the tangent kernel 𝚯1superscript𝚯1\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}^{1} is defined by Now, (𝑾1​𝒙)k=∑iγ1​Wk​i1​xisubscriptsuperscript𝑾1𝒙𝑘subscript𝑖superscript𝛾1subscriptsuperscript𝑊1𝑘𝑖subscript𝑥𝑖(\\boldsymbol{W}^{1}\\boldsymbol{x})_{k}=\\sum_{i}\\gamma^{1}W^{1}_{ki}x_{i}, which gives that ∂θm​n(𝑾1​𝒙)k=∑iγ1​δm​k​δn​i​xisubscriptsubscript𝜃𝑚𝑛subscriptsuperscript𝑾1𝒙𝑘subscript𝑖superscript𝛾1subscript𝛿𝑚𝑘subscript𝛿𝑛𝑖subscript𝑥𝑖\\partial_{\\theta_{mn}}(\\boldsymbol{W}^{1}\\boldsymbol{x})_{k}=\\sum_{i}\\gamma^{1}\\delta_{mk}\\delta_{ni}x_{i}. So, we have Now we go for the induction. It is already known that in the large width regime, the preactivations α~iL−1subscriptsuperscript~𝛼𝐿1𝑖\\tilde{\\alpha}^{L-1}_{i} are centered Gaussian processes. Assume that the NTK 𝚯k​k′L​(𝒙,𝒙′)superscriptsubscript𝚯𝑘superscript𝑘′𝐿𝒙superscript𝒙′\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}_{kk^{\\prime}}^{L}(\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{x}^{\\prime}) of the smaller network converges in probability: The new neural net has the old parameters θpsubscript𝜃𝑝\\theta_{p}, and the added parameters on the L𝐿L-th layer, namely, Wi​jLsubscriptsuperscript𝑊𝐿𝑖𝑗W^{L}_{ij} and bkLsubscriptsuperscript𝑏𝐿𝑘b^{L}_{k}. We first look at the contribution towards the kernel from the parameters θpsubscript𝜃𝑝\\theta_{p}. Since the new layer is not dependent on the old parameters, we have, We first comment on the case of sequential limits. We have that where in the second last step we have used the induction hypothesis, and in the last step we have used the weak law of large numbers, as in (44). The rest of the proof (looking at the contribution of the new parameters Wi​jL,bkLsubscriptsuperscript𝑊𝐿𝑖𝑗subscriptsuperscript𝑏𝐿𝑘W^{L}_{ij},b^{L}_{k}) follows along similar lines as in the base case above. For the case of simultaneous limits, one can verbatim follow the induction scheme in the proof of Theorem D.1 of , inserting the outcome of Proposition 4.2 of the main text at the last step. Since there are no new ideas in our case, we skip writing out the details. However, we make two important observations about the proof of Theorem D.1 of  which illustrate the essential points of difference with the sequential proof. Firstly, the induction step in Theorem D.1 starts by expressing the NTK as l=1,…,L𝑙1…𝐿l=1,\\dots,L. This leads to a somewhat different induction scheme (see pp. 25 of ) than the one above. Secondly, the main technical ingredient introduced in  that makes the induction argument go through is recorded in the significantly involved Theorem 5.1 which gives the stronger almost sure convergence (instead of convergence in probability) at the last step of the induction. This theorem allows one to justify the gradient independence assumption. Observe that the last step in the sequential induction argument tacitly makes an assumption about the gradient independence. This point has also been explicitly mentioned in .\n∎ The proof is long, but virtually similar to the proof of Theorem 2 of  (observe that we have stated this result only in the sequential limit regime), so we refer the reader for details therein. A technical requirement for the proof of Proposition 6.2 is that one needs to be careful with the normalization γlsuperscript𝛾𝑙\\gamma^{l} in the update rule (1) of the main text. For Proposition 6.2 to hold, one has to choose the normalizations γlsuperscript𝛾𝑙\\gamma^{l} such that This is clear on careful scanning of the proof of Lemma 1 of . We point out that this requirement is not essential for Theorem 4.1 and Proposition 6.1 to work, where we can choose γl=1,l=1,…,L−1formulae-sequencesuperscript𝛾𝑙1𝑙1…𝐿1\\gamma^{l}=1,\\;l=1,\\dots,L-1. For overparametrized DNNs, it is observed in practice that gradient descent is largely restricted to a low dimensional linear subspace of the parameter space, which essentially remains fixed throughout the training process [ref]13 . Such a phenomenon is independent of the initialization, provided one is looking at standard SGD based learning. However, stable rank constrained gradient based learning will with high probability take the learning gradient out of its subspace.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: which in turn is defined by: For a further detailed discussion of the kernel gradient and the NTK, we refer the reader to Section 3 of  and [ref]14.
