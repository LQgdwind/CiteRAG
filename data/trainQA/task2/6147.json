      "content": "Paper Title: Dual Forgetting Operators in the Context of Weakest Sufficient and Strongest Necessary Conditions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTheorem 2.1(5) indicates that computing forgetting using the Lin&Reiter-like forgetting operator is equivalent to eliminating second-order quantifiers ∃p¯​(…)¯𝑝…\\exists\\bar{p}(\\ldots).\nWhile definitions (3)–(4) allow one to eliminate second-order quantifiers, they lead to an exponential growth of the resulting formula wrt the number of quantifiers. Therefore, as a computationally more appropriate tool, we will use the following lemma of Ackermann, already proved in  (see also  [ref]19). This usage typically results in much shorter formulas as a result of quantifier eliminations in many cases. Let A𝐴A be a propositional formula without occurrences of propositional variable p𝑝p, and B​(p)𝐵𝑝B(p) be a propositional formula on a vocabulary containing p𝑝p:777For the sake of clarity we assume that B𝐵B contains p𝑝p, but the lemma is trivially true also when this is not the case. □□\\Box The lemma remains true when p𝑝p is replaced by a second-order variable, say P𝑃P, representing propositional formulas. For example, (8) can be formulated as: Lemma (2.2) serves as a blueprint for specifying an algorithm to eliminate 2nd-order quantifiers in many cases. It shows that if one can syntactically transform a formula F​(p¯)𝐹¯𝑝F(\\bar{p}), where p∈p¯𝑝¯𝑝p\\in\\bar{p}, into an equivalent formula with the syntactic structure on the lhs of equivalences (8) or (9), respectively, then one can eliminate ∃p𝑝\\exists p by substitution of A𝐴A for p𝑝p in B𝐵B, resulting in the equivalent B​(p=A)𝐵𝑝𝐴B(p=A). This syntactic technique can be iterated for all 2nd-order quantifiers in F​(p¯)𝐹¯𝑝F(\\bar{p}), resulting in a logically equivalent propositional formula. To transform a formula into a form required in (8) or (9), one can use the Dls algorithm of . For propositional formulas, one of the forms in the lefthand sides of equivalences (8) or (9) can always be obtained, thus guaranteeing removal of all 2nd-order quantifiers in an arbitrary propositional theory. Figure 1 illustrates the idea behind Ackermann-like lemmas, where the terms “grows” and “shrinks”, illustrated by dash arrows within ovals, refer to the standard ordering on truth values, 𝔽<𝕋𝔽𝕋\\mathbb{F}<\\mathbb{T}, compatible with the semantics of implication, which can be given by:888More formally, we deal here with the construction of a partial order among formulas for the Lindenbaum and Tarski algebra 1. The Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra of a theory T𝑇T consists of the equivalence classes of formulas of the theory, where two formulas are equivalent when the theory T𝑇T proves that each implies the other. The partial order in question is then defined as:\n‖A‖≤T‖B‖​ iff ​T⊢A→B,provessubscript𝑇norm𝐴norm𝐵 iff 𝑇→𝐴𝐵||A||\\leq_{T}||B||\\mbox{ iff }T\\vdash A\\rightarrow B,\nwhere ‖C‖norm𝐶||C|| denotes an equivalence class of a formula C𝐶C. Given the constraint p→A→𝑝𝐴p\\rightarrow A in (8) (or, respectively, A→p→𝐴𝑝A\\rightarrow p in (9)), the greatest value of B​(p)𝐵𝑝B(p) is obtained when p𝑝p takes its greatest (respectively, smallest) value, i.e., the value given by A𝐴A. Of course, in such cases, the existential quantifier ∃p​(…)𝑝…\\exists p(\\ldots) obtains the greatest value of B​(p)𝐵𝑝B(p), achieved for p=A𝑝𝐴p=A. In this case, each of the constraints p→A→𝑝𝐴p\\rightarrow A (in (8)) as well as A→p→𝐴𝑝A\\rightarrow p (in (9)) evaluate to 𝕋𝕋\\mathbb{T}, and so disappear from the result.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: growth of the resulting formula wrt the number of quantifiers.
