      "content": "Paper Title: Semantics-preserving Reinforcement Learning Attack Against Graph Neural Networks for Malware Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe detect-evade “game” between malware scanners (e.g., antivirus software) and malware writers is a long-lasting theme in cybersecurity. With the emergence of public online malware scanning platforms such as VirusTotal, it has been reported in recent years that some in-development malware were found on VirusTotal before their major outbreaks. For example, the very first known LeakerLocker sample could data back to November 2016 when it was submitted to VirusTotal , but not until July 2017 did security analysts find it widespread. The study conducted in  shows that many malware writers have been anonymously submitting in-development malware samples to online malware scanning platforms. Since such platforms are hosting a comprehensive collection of state-of-the-art malware scanners, the scan reports would provide malware writers with a best possible assessment. In addition, through a continuous submit-and-revise process, an in-development malware sample can evolve in such a way that when it was released into the wild and known to public, no signature was available and all the malware scanners running on VirusTotal mistakenly reported benign. Since it usually takes more than six months to generate well-crafted signatures , the above-mentioned evasion strategy renders a very serious security threat to the society. In order to help solve this serious problem, new kinds of malware scanners (e.g.,  [ref]5) have been proposed in recent years to complement the existing scanners, and a key characteristic of these new malware scanners is that they all leverage machine learning, especially deep-learning (DL) models, to detect malware. The main merits of DL-based malware scanners are reflected in the following comparison: (a) While signature-based malware scanners often require substantial manual effort to extract signatures, DL-based malware detection models are automatically trained; (b) While signature-based malware scanners usually require a significant amount of domain knowledge, DL-based malware detection models could be well trained with minimum domain knowledge; (c) Due to the generalization ability of DL-based malware detection models, a malware sample revised (by its malware writer) to avoid having any known signatures could still be detected. Since the DL-based malware scanners could make\nthe above-mentioned evasion strategy ineffective,\nthe malware writers must answer three key questions. Question 1: Are the current malware revising techniques (e.g. code obfuscation) still effective? If not, why? Question 2: If the current malware revising techniques are no longer very effective, how to revise a malware sample in a new way? Question 3: How to ensure that the new way of malware revising will not introduce too much extra burden? Although how to evade DL-based malware detection models has been attracting an increasing interest in the research community, the existing works are still very limited in answering the three questions. Almost all the existing works (e.g.,  [ref]7 [ref]8) focus on investigating how CNN (convolutional neural network) or RNN (recurrent neural network) detection models could be evaded by adversarial examples. Although these works have made substantial progress on answering Question 2, most of them could not answer Question 1 or Question 3 due to the following reasons. First, to avoid changing the malware semantics (e.g. functionality of the malicious code), most existing works restrict the\nadversarial examples by only modifying certain metadata,\nsuch as PE header metadata and Section metadata, or injecting some bytes .\nSecond,\nalthough code obfuscation techniques such as polymorphic malware have been playing a very dominant role in real-world to evade malware scanners, very few existing works study the relationships between code obfuscation and adversarial examples.\nSince byte-level data (e.g., a malware sample is largely viewed as a stream of bytes) are used, the trained CNN and RNN models are\nlargely a black box and very hard to be explained.\nAccordingly, the semantics of the generated adversarial examples are very hard to be linked with code obfuscation (unless the models are assumed to be white-box).\nHence, it is very difficult to answer Question 3 and reduce the extra burden by piggybacking the generation of adversarial examples on code obfuscation. In this work, we seek to answer these questions in a systematic manner.\nOur new insight is as follows: instead of using CNN or RNN models, Graph Neural Network (GNN) malware detection models (e.g.,\n0 [ref]5), which are as\neffective as CNN and RNN models,\ncan be leveraged to discover and understand the inherent relationships among code obfuscation, the dominant technology in malware revising, and adversarial examples, the dominant concept in evading a deep neural network. These inherent relationships then enable us to answer the three key questions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work investigating how GNN based detection models could be automatically evaded by revising the\nbasic blocks of a malware sample in a semantics-preserving way. Our insight is gained based on two observations. First,\nsince Control Flow Graphs (CFG) play an essential role in both\ncode obfuscation and training of GNN based detection\nmodels [ref]5, CFGs are a natural connection\nbetween code obfuscation and adversarial examples.\nSecond, since CFG and basic block data are used to train\na GNN based detection model, some adversarial examples\nare inherently related to basic-block-level code obfuscation.\nTo systematically answer the aforementioned key questions,\nwe face the following challenges:\n1) Given a malware sample, the features in its graph structure involve discrete data, so we cannot directly leverage gradient-based attacks to\ngenerate infinitesimal small perturbation to its original CFG.\n2) The generated adversarial examples should not change the original\nmalware semantics. In each adversarial example, which\nis also a malware sample, the attacker must\npreserve exactly the same functionality as the original\nmalware sample. Thus, the manipulation should not remove original features including edges and nodes. To address these challenges, we proposed a novel method to automatically\ngenerate adversarial examples for GNN malware detection models\nwhile preserving the original malware functionality and semantics.\nWe designed a reinforcement learning approach, namely the\nSemantics-preserving Reinforcement Learning (SRL) attack, to generate adversarial examples.\nThe key factor of adversarial malware generation via semantic Nops injection is to select the appropriate semantic Nops and their corresponding basic blocks. However, since the decision making process involves discrete values, we cannot directly apply gradient based attack to make such decisions.\nThe proposed SRL attack uses reinforcement learning\nto automatically make the above-mentioned decisions.\nThese decisions result in\nsequentially injecting semantic Nops into the CFGs.\nSince semantic Nops will never change malware functionality,\nthe SRL attack achieves semantics-preserving. To evaluate the proposed SRL attack, we let it\nbe compared with four baseline attacks: the binary diversification attack[ref]7, the Semantics-preserving Random Insertion (SRI) attack inspired by classical code obfuscation methods 1, the Semantics-preserving Accumulated Insertion (SAI) attack inspired by hill-climbing methods [ref]7, and the Semantics-preserving Gradient based Insertion (SGI) attack inspired by FGSM attacks2.\nFor this purpose,\nwe extracted CFGs from 8,000 benign and malicious real-world Windows\nprograms and constructed abstract directed graphs to represent\nthe CFGs. We then trained two kinds of GNN models, the basic GCN model 3 and the DGCNN model0, respectively,\nto classify the graphs. We found that the four baseline attacks are limited in evading\nGNN malware detection models.\nThe experimental results have shown that the binary diversification attack achieved less than 10% on the basic GCN models and the DGCNN models.\nThe SRI attack achieved an evasion rate of 45% on the basic GCN models and 72% on the DGCNN models.\nThe SGI attack fooled the basic GCN model with an evasion rate near 41% and deceived the DGCNN models with evasion rate 83%. The SAI attack achieved\nover 90% evasion rate on both models.\nIn contrast, the proposed SRL attack achieved\n100% evasion rate on both the basic GCN models and the DGCNN models.\nWe added the adversarial samples and retrained the detection models to\ndefend against those attacks. The retrained models can achieve similar\ndetection accuracy, but the evasion rates of the SRI attack, the SAI attack\n, and the SGI attack significantly dropped\nto 2%, 16%, and 0.7%, respectively.\nIn contrast, the evasion rate of the proposed SRL attack\ndropped to 85%, which is still a fairly high evasion rate. In summary, we have made the following contributions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on semantics-preserving black-box attacks against GNN malware detection models. The proposed SRL attack achieves semantics-preserving using reinforcement learning to select semantic Nops and their corresponding basic blocks. Using both the basic GCN malware detection models and the DGCNN models,\nwe evaluated and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed\nSRL attack via extensive experiments with\ndifferent settings.\nWe built a baseline with four attacks, and thoroughly compared\nthe proposed SRL attack with the baseline attacks.\nThe results show that the proposed SRL attack is significantly more\neffective than the baseline attacks. The remaining of the paper is organized as follows.\nIn Section 2, we review some background of malware detection and graph neural networks. The threat model and problem statement are presented in Section 3.\nThe proposed SRL attack is described in Section 4.\nThe proposed attack is compared with three baseline attacks in\nSection 5. In Section 6, we discuss\nthe related works. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 7.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: signatures , the above-mentioned evasion strategy renders a very serious security threat to the society.
