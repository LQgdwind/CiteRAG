      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Interpretable and Robust Hand Detection via Pixel-wise Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVIVA Hand Detection Dataset is published by the Vision for Intelligent Vehicles and Applications Challenge¬† for hand detection subtask. The dataset includes 5,50055005,500 training and 5,50055005,500 testing images. The images are collected from 545454 videos captured in naturalistic driving scenarios. There are 777 possible viewpoints in the videos. Annotations for the images are publicly accessible. The bounding boxes of hand regions in an image are given by (x,y,w,h)ùë•ùë¶ùë§‚Ñé(x,y,w,h) in the .txt format annotation file. x,yùë•ùë¶x,y are the upper-left coordinates of the box and wùë§w, h‚Ñéh are the width and height of the box, respectively. As the given annotations are axis-aligned, the rotation angles are set to 00 in training and the predictions are axis-aligned bounding boxes in our experiments on this dataset. We evaluate the algorithms on two levels according to the size of the hand instances using the evaluate kit provided by the Vision for Intelligent Vehicles and Applications Challenge. Level-1 focuses on the hand instances with a minimum height of 707070 pixels, only over the shoulder (back) camera view, while Level-2 evaluates hand samples with a minimum height of 252525 pixels in all camera views. Evaluation metrics include the Average Precision (AP) and Average Recall (AR). AP is the area under the Precision-Recall curve and AR is calculated over 999 evenly sampled points in log space between 10‚àí2superscript10210^{-2} and 100superscript10010^{0} false positives per image. As performed in PASCAL VOC¬†, the hit/miss threshold of the overlap between a pair of predicted and ground truth bounding boxes is set to 0.50.50.5. As presented in Table.¬†1, we compare our methods with MS-RFCN¬† , Multi-scale fast RCNN¬†[ref]12, FRCNN¬†[ref]27, YOLO¬† and ACF_Depth4¬†. The Precision-Recall curves and ROC curves of these methods and our model (ResNet50+HFF+Auxiliary Losses) are shown in Fig.¬†5. Our model achieves 92.3%/89.1%percent92.3percent89.192.3\\%/89.1\\% (AP/AR) at Level-1 while 83.6%/68.8%percent83.6percent68.883.6\\%/68.8\\% (AP/AR) at Level-2 using VGG16 as the backbone network. The ResNet50 based PHDN network obtains more accurate performance, i.e., 94.8%/91.1%percent94.8percent91.194.8\\%/91.1\\% (AP/AR) at Level-1 and 86.3%/75.8%percent86.3percent75.886.3\\%/75.8\\% (AP/AR) at Level-2. Apart from the accuracy, the detection speed is also an important metric. As we can see in Table.¬†1, YOLO¬† performs hand detection in real-time, but its accuracy is unsatisfactory. On the contrary, MS-RFCN¬† performs against other detectors in accuracy but the detecting speed is very slow, i.e., 4.654.654.65 fps. With our PHDN based on VGG16 and ResNet50, the detection speeds are up to 13.1013.1013.10 and 19.6819.6819.68 fps, respectively. The model (ResNet50+HFF+Auxiliary Losses) obtains competitive accuracy while a 4.234.234.23 times faster running speed compared to . Therefore, it is of great significance that our model achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and speed.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: threshold of the overlap between a pair of predicted and ground truth bounding boxes is set to 0.50.50.5.
