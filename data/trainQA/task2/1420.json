      "content": "Paper Title: Color Channel Perturbation Attacks for Fooling Convolutional Neural Networks and A Defense Against Such Attacks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, the researchers have observed that the trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can be fooled by attacking the test image. However, the synthesized test image preserves the semantic meaning of the original test image. The performance of the CNN’s giving the correct result for the original test image degrades suddenly over the synthesized test image. Different types of attack methods have been explored in recent days. However, the existing attacking methods fail to utilize the color property of the image. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet effective Color Channel Perturbation (CCP) attacks on the image data to fool the CNNs. The proposed attack is based on the color property of the image. Any color image (I𝐼I) contains three channels, namely Red (R𝑅R), Green (G𝐺G), and Blue (B𝐵B) in RGB color space. The proposed CCP attack uses the original color channels (i.e., Red (R𝑅R), Green (G𝐺G), and Blue (B𝐵B)) of the image (I𝐼I) to generate the new transformed color channels (i.e., transformed Red (RTsuperscript𝑅𝑇R^{T}), transformed Green (GTsuperscript𝐺𝑇G^{T}), and transformed Blue (BTsuperscript𝐵𝑇B^{T})) of the transformed image (ITsuperscript𝐼𝑇I^{T}). Basically, each one of RTsuperscript𝑅𝑇R^{T}, GTsuperscript𝐺𝑇G^{T}, and BTsuperscript𝐵𝑇B^{T} is the weighted combination of R𝑅R, G𝐺G, and B𝐵B and given as, where s𝑠s is a scale factor hyperparameter, b𝑏b is a bias hyperparameter, {Ri,Gi,Bi}∈ℝsubscript𝑅𝑖subscript𝐺𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖ℝ\\{R_{i},G_{i},B_{i}\\}\\in\\mathbb{R} are the intensity values in Red, Green and Blue channels of it​hsuperscript𝑖𝑡ℎi^{th} input image (Iisubscript𝐼𝑖I_{i}) of the test set (i.e., i∈[1,Nt​e​s​t]𝑖1subscript𝑁𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡i\\in[1,N_{test}] where Nt​e​s​tsubscript𝑁𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡N_{test} is the number of images in the test set), {RiT,GiT,BiT}∈ℝsubscriptsuperscript𝑅𝑇𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝐺𝑇𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝐵𝑇𝑖ℝ\\{R^{T}_{i},G^{T}_{i},B^{T}_{i}\\}\\in\\mathbb{R} are the intensity values in Red, Green and Blue channels of the transformed image (IiTsubscriptsuperscript𝐼𝑇𝑖I^{T}_{i}) corresponding to Iisubscript𝐼𝑖I_{i}, αi={αir,αig,αib}subscript𝛼𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝛼𝑟𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝛼𝑔𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝛼𝑏𝑖\\alpha_{i}=\\{\\alpha^{r}_{i},\\alpha^{g}_{i},\\alpha^{b}_{i}\\}, βi={βir,βig,βib}subscript𝛽𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝛽𝑟𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝛽𝑔𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝛽𝑏𝑖\\beta_{i}=\\{\\beta^{r}_{i},\\beta^{g}_{i},\\beta^{b}_{i}\\} and γi={γir,γig,γib}subscript𝛾𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝛾𝑟𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝛾𝑔𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝛾𝑏𝑖\\gamma_{i}=\\{\\gamma^{r}_{i},\\gamma^{g}_{i},\\gamma^{b}_{i}\\} are the random weights to generate the Red, Green and Blue channels of the transformed image, respectively, corresponding to it​hsuperscript𝑖𝑡ℎi^{th} input image with {αiη,βiη,γiη}∈[L,U]subscriptsuperscript𝛼𝜂𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝛽𝜂𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝛾𝜂𝑖𝐿𝑈\\{\\alpha^{\\eta}_{i},\\beta^{\\eta}_{i},\\gamma^{\\eta}_{i}\\}\\in[L,U], ∀η∈{r,g,b}for-all𝜂𝑟𝑔𝑏\\forall{\\eta\\in\\{r,g,b\\}} where L𝐿L and U𝑈U are the lower and upper limits of random numbers/weights generated, respectively. Note that we use L=0𝐿0L=0 and U=1𝑈1U=1 in the experiments until or otherwise specified. The scale s𝑠s and bias b𝑏b are used to adjust the visual appearance of the generated image. We propose two schemes of the proposed CCP attack, namely fixed random weight based CCP attack (C​C​PF𝐶𝐶subscript𝑃𝐹CCP_{F}) and variable random weight based CCP attack (C​C​PV𝐶𝐶subscript𝑃𝑉CCP_{V}). Note that in both the cases, the random weights generated are same for all the pixels of an image to preserve the relative local neighborhood information in the image. However, the random weights for different channels are generated independently in both the cases. In fixed scheme C​C​PF𝐶𝐶subscript𝑃𝐹CCP_{F}, the random weight generated is same for all the test images, i.e., αiη=αjηsubscriptsuperscript𝛼𝜂𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝛼𝜂𝑗\\alpha^{\\eta}_{i}=\\alpha^{\\eta}_{j}, βiη=βjηsubscriptsuperscript𝛽𝜂𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝛽𝜂𝑗\\beta^{\\eta}_{i}=\\beta^{\\eta}_{j} and γiη=γjηsubscriptsuperscript𝛾𝜂𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝛾𝜂𝑗\\gamma^{\\eta}_{i}=\\gamma^{\\eta}_{j}, ∀{i,j}∈[1,Nt​e​s​t]for-all𝑖𝑗1subscript𝑁𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡\\forall{\\{i,j\\}\\in[1,N_{test}]} and ∀η∈{r,g,b}for-all𝜂𝑟𝑔𝑏\\forall{\\eta\\in\\{r,g,b\\}}.\nHowever, in the variable scheme C​C​PV𝐶𝐶subscript𝑃𝑉CCP_{V}, independent random weights are generated for different test images, i.e., the weights αiηsubscriptsuperscript𝛼𝜂𝑖\\alpha^{\\eta}_{i}, βiηsubscriptsuperscript𝛽𝜂𝑖\\beta^{\\eta}_{i} and γiηsubscriptsuperscript𝛾𝜂𝑖\\gamma^{\\eta}_{i}, ∀η∈{r,g,b}for-all𝜂𝑟𝑔𝑏\\forall{\\eta\\in\\{r,g,b\\}} are drawn at random for each image Iisubscript𝐼𝑖I_{i} with i∈[1,Nt​e​s​t]𝑖1subscript𝑁𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡i\\in[1,N_{test}] independently. The sample images generated using the proposed color channel perturbation (CCP) method in fixed and variable schemes are shown in the 2n​dsuperscript2𝑛𝑑2^{nd} and 3r​dsuperscript3𝑟𝑑3^{rd} rows, respectively in Fig. 2 corresponding to the original images shown in the 1s​tsuperscript1𝑠𝑡1^{st} row of the same figure. The original sample images are taken from the CIFAR10 dataset [ref]39. It can be easily seen that the semantic meaning of the images with respect to the underlying objects within the image is preserved in the generated images. Even then there is a significant performance drop in image classification due to the CCP transformation. The color distribution of the output images using fixed scheme is similar (see 2n​dsuperscript2𝑛𝑑2^{nd} row) due to the fixed random weights used for all images in this scheme. However, the different color distributions (see 3r​dsuperscript3𝑟𝑑3^{rd} row) can be observed in the images generated using variable random weights. The sample images generated using the Adversarial attack [ref]11 and the One-pixel attack [ref]14 are also shown in 4t​hsuperscript4𝑡ℎ4^{th} and 5t​hsuperscript5𝑡ℎ5^{th} rows, respectively. It can be observed that the adversarial and one-pixel attacks try to follow the similar color distributions as in the original images. The histograms of Red, Green and Blue channels for sample images are illustrated in Fig. 3 by red, green and blue colors, respectively. The sample images in the first three rows and the last three rows are taken from CIFAR10 [ref]39 and Caltech256  datasets, respectively. The sample images in the 1s​tsuperscript1𝑠𝑡1^{st} column are the original images, whereas the images in the other columns are generated using the different transformation approaches. The 2n​dsuperscript2𝑛𝑑2^{nd} and 3r​dsuperscript3𝑟𝑑3^{rd} columns are corresponding to the proposed CCP attack based transformation under fixed random and variable random settings, respectively. The 4t​hsuperscript4𝑡ℎ4^{th} and 5t​hsuperscript5𝑡ℎ5^{th} columns are corresponding to the One-pixel attack [ref]14 and Adversarial attack [ref]11 based transformations, respectively.\nThe x-axis and y-axis in each plot represent the bin and frequency, respectively.\nIt is noticed from these plots that the proposed CCP attack leads to the variations in the color distributions using both fixed and variable random weight schemes (i.e., 2nd and 3rd columns, respectively) preserving the density distribution of the intensity values. These properties of CCP transformation enforces the different color combinations in the generated image while retaining the visual appearance and semantic meaning of the objects.\nThe histogram plots generated using the One-pixel attack [ref]14 (4t​hsuperscript4𝑡ℎ4^{th} column) and Adversarial attack [ref]11 (5t​hsuperscript5𝑡ℎ5^{th} row) show that these transformations try to preserve only the density distribution without preserving the color variation. We generate two transformed test sets using the proposed CCP transformation using the original test set as depicted in the right side in Fig. 4. The two transformed settings used are 1) CCP attack using fixed random weights for all the test examples (i.e., C​C​Pf𝐶𝐶subscript𝑃𝑓CCP_{f}) and 2) CCP attack using variable random weights for different test examples (i.e., C​C​Pv𝐶𝐶subscript𝑃𝑣CCP_{v}). The number of images in each transformed test set is same as the original test set. In order to show the impact and defense of CCP attack, we perform the experiments using two training sets, including 1) the original training set having training images without CCP based augmentation and 2) the modified training set having training images with CCP based augmentation as depicted on the left side of Fig. 4.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: rows, respectively in Fig. 2 corresponding to the original images shown in the 1s​tsuperscript1𝑠𝑡1^{st} row of the same figure.
