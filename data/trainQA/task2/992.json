      "content": "Paper Title: Hybrid-S2S: Video Object Segmentation with Recurrent Networks and Correspondence Matching\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA large body of research in Computer Vision literature has studied VOS during the last decade.\nThe classical methods for solving VOS were mainly based on energy minimization¬†[ref]4  [ref]26 .\nBrox et al.¬†[ref]4 propose a model based on motion clustering and segment the moving object via the analysis of the point trajectories throughout the video.\nThey also use motion cues to distinguish foreground from background.\nFaktor et al.¬†\npresent a method based on consensus voting.\nThey extract the superpixels in each frame, and by computing the similarity of the superpixel descriptors, then use the nearest neighbor method to cluster the most similar superpixels together in a segmentation mask.\n addresses the problem of fast motion and appearance change in the video by extending the idea of using superpixels to using super-voxels (adding the time dimension) and taking into account the long-range temporal connection during the object movement. Since the advent of Deep Learning¬†9, the Computer Vision community has witnessed a significant progress in the accuracy of VOS methods¬†  .\nThe success of learning based methods can largely be accounted to progress made in learning algorithms¬†9  and the availability of large-scale VOS datasets such as Youtube-VOS¬†. In one-shot VOS, there exist two training schemes, namely offline and online training. Offline training is the standard training phase in learning-based techniques.\nAs the segmentation mask of the first object appearance is available at test time, online training refers to further fine-tuning the model on this mask with extensive data augmentation.\nThis additional step considerably improves the segmentation quality at the expense of slower inference. Considering offline training, one can divide the proposed solutions into multiple categories.\nSome methods focus on learning the object masks using only the frame-wise data¬† .\nIn¬†, authors extended a VGG-based architecture designed for retinal image understanding¬† for VOS.\nThey start with the pre-trained weights on ImageNet¬†, and then further train the parent network on a specialized VOS dataset¬†.\nThis model relies on online training and boundary snapping for achieving good performance.\n further improves this method by employing online adaption to handle drastic changes in the object‚Äôs appearance.\nPerazzi et al.¬† provide a solution based on guided instance segmentation.\nThey utilize a DeepLab architecture¬† and modify the network to accept the previous segmentation mask as an additional input.\nTherefore, a rough guidance signal is provided to the model to mark the approximate location where the object of interest lies.\nYang et al.¬† take a meta-learning approach and train an additional modulator network that adjusts the middle layers of a generic segmentation network to capture the appearance of the target object. In¬† a Siamese architecture is used to segment the object based on its similarity to the mask template in the first frame.\nSimilarly,  proposes a zero-shot VOS model, where the object mask at every time step is detected based on the similarity of the current frame to the anchor frames¬†(first frame and the frame at t‚àí1ùë°1t-1).\nFollowing this idea,  suggests a generative approach for segmenting the target object, introducing an appearance module to learn the probabilistic model of the background and the foreground object.\nIn¬†, the authors develop a model that propagates the segmentation mask based on an affinity in the embedding space.\nThey propose to model the local dependencies via using motion and spatial priors and the global dependencies based on the visual appearance learned by a convolutional network.\nAlthough these methods obtain good performance on the standard benchmarks¬† , they do not utilize temporal information and motion cues. Another line of work relies on region proposal techniques such as .\nFor example,  takes a multi-step approach, in which they first generate the region proposals and then refine and merge promising regions to produce the final mask.\nFurthermore, they use optical flow to maintain the temporal consistency.\nIn¬†, an additional re-identification method based on template-matching is used.\nThis way, the model can recapture objects lost at some point in the sequence.\nThese methods are quite complex in architecture design and relatively slow at inference time. A different group of methods focus on utilizing a memory module to process motion and compute spatio-temporal features.\nIn order to obtain temporally consistent segmentation masks,¬†    employ a ConvLSTM¬† (or ConvGRU) memory module while¬† resorts to using an external memory to process the space-time information. In this work, we build on top of the S2S¬† architecture, which is an RNN-based method, on account of exploiting the spatio-temporal features, good performance, and the simple architecture. We study some of this model‚Äôs shortcomings stemming from the finite memory and error propagation in RNNs.\nTo address these limitations, we propose a hybrid design that combines the spatio-temporal features from the RNN with similarity matching information, as it will be elaborated in the next section.\nUnlike¬†, our model does not require any form of external memory.\nThis is advantageous since using external memory results in additional constraints in the inference phase (e.g. memory overflow for long video sequences).\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: A large body of research in Computer Vision literature has studied VOS during the last decade.\nThe classical methods for solving VOS were mainly based on energy minimization¬†[ref]4  [ref]26 .\nBrox et al.¬†[ref]4 propose a model based on motion clustering and segment the moving object via the analysis of the point trajectories throughout the video.\nThey also use motion\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
