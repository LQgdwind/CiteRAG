      "content": "Paper Title: Energy-Efficient Deflection-based On-chip Networks: Topology, Routing, Flow Control\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this Section, we now discuss other approaches that are designed to improve scalability of NoCs. Ring-based NoCs. Hierarchical ring-based interconnect was proposed in a previous line of work          . We have already extensively compared to past hierarchical ring proposals qualitatively and quantitatively. The major difference between HiRD and these previous approaches is that HiRD uses deflection-based bridge routers with minimal buffering, and node routers with no buffering. In contrast, all of these previous works use routers with in-ring buffering, wormhole switching and flow control.\nKim et al. propose tNoCs, hybrid packet-flit credit-based flow control  and Clumsy Flow Control (CFC) . However, these two designs add additional complexity because tNoCs  requires an additional credit network to guarantee forward progress while CFC requires coordination between cores and memory controllers. Flow control in HiRD is different from that in these works due to HiRD’s simplicity (with deflection based flow control, the Retransmit-Once mechanism, and simpler local-to-global and global-to-local buffers). Additionally, throttling decisions in HiRD can be made locally in each local ring as opposed to global decisions in CFC  and tNoCs . Udipi et al. propose a hierarchical topology using global and local\nbuses . Using buses limits scalability in favor of simplicity. In contrast, HiRD design has more favorable scaling, in exchange for using more complex flit-switching routers. Das et al.  examine several hierarchical designs, including a concentrated mesh (one mesh router shared by several nearby nodes). A previous system, SCI (Scalable Coherent Interface) ,\nalso uses rings, and can be configured in many topologies (including\nhierarchical rings). However, to handle buffer-full conditions, SCI\nNACKs and subsequently retransmits packets, whereas HiRD deflects only\nsingle flits (within a ring), and does not require the sender to\nretransmit its flits. SCI was designed for off-chip interconnect,\nwhere tradeoffs in power and performance are very different from those in\non-chip interconnects. The KSR (Kendall Square Research) machine \nuses a hierarchical ring design that resembles HiRD, yet these techniques\nare not disclosed in detail and, to our knowledge, have not been\npublicly evaluated in terms of energy efficiency. Scalable Topology Design. While low-radix topologies (e.g., ring, tori , meshes , Express Cubes  and Kilo-NoC   ) offers low area and power consumptoin, high-radix topologies  [ref]112  provide scalable alternatives to large scale systems. A flattened butterfly topology provides a scalable design that allows routers to send flits using two hops . A HyperX network [ref]112 extends the hypercube  design to minimize cost and lowering the latency. A SlimNoC  network provides a low-diameter, high-radix that further reduces the power and area through a SlimFly topology . Low Cost Router Designs. Kim  proposes a low-cost router design that is superficially similar to HiRD’s node router design where routers convey traffic along rows and columns in a mesh without making use of crossbars, only pipeline registers and MUXes. Once traffic enters a row or column, it continues until it reaches its destination, as in a ring. Traffic also transfers from a row to a column analogously to a ring transfer in our design, using a “turn buffer.” However, because a turn is possible at any node in a mesh, every router requires such a buffer  ; in contrast, HiRD require similar transfer buffers only at bridge routers, and their cost is paid for by all nodes.\nAdditionally, this design does not use deflections when there is contention. Mullins et al.  propose a buffered mesh router with\nsingle-cycle arbitration. Abad et al.  propose the Rotary Router that consists of two independent rings that join the router’s\nports and perform packet arbitration similar to standalone ring-based networks. Both the Rotary Router and HiRD allow a packet to circle a ring again in a “deflection” if an ejection (ring transfer or router exit) is unsuccessful. Nicopoulos et al.  propose a buffer structure that allows the network to dynamically regulate the number of virtual channels. Kodi et al.  propose an orthogonal mechanism that reduces buffering by using links as buffer space when necessary. Multidrop Express Channels  also provides a low cost mechanism to connect multiple nodes using a multidrop bus without expensive router changes.\n\nReference markers found: [112]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]112: of energy efficiency.
