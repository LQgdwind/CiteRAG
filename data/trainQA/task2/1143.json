      "content": "Paper Title: Adaptive Linear Span Network for Object Skeleton Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAblation studies are performed on SK-LARGE¬†, which is the most used benchmark for object skeleton detection. In the search phase, by default, we set the index of side-outputs as {1,2,3,4,5}12345\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}, the channel number of the nodes (Channel Number) as 323232, the intermediate node number (Intermediate Node) as 444. The kernel size and dilation rate of the convolution layers in the alternative operator set (Operator) vary in {1,3,5}135\\{1,3,5\\} and {1,2,4,8}1248\\{1,2,4,8\\}, respectively. Architecture Search.\nIn Table¬†II, one can see that the searched AdaLSNs significantly outperform the randomly sampled architectures by ‚àº3%similar-toabsentpercent3\\sim 3\\% F-score. AdaLSNs also demonstrate robustness to search initializations. In Table¬†III, we re-train the most excellent individual selected in each population iteration, and report the performance every ten generations. It can be seen that the top-1 individuals evolve quickly and the F-score increases significantly from 0.727 to 0.751, and slightly improves to 0.7530.7530.753 after 30 more generations. We search fifty generations by default. These results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In Table¬†IV, we validate the effectiveness of the encoding areas including multiple side-outputs (A1subscriptùê¥1A_{1}), short connection (A2subscriptùê¥2A_{2}), feature transform (A3subscriptùê¥3A_{3}), and intermediate supervision (A4subscriptùê¥4A_{4}). Specifically, we compare the performance of partial search by screening an encoding area (w/o) and randomly sampling the corresponding area after complete search (Rand.). Experiments show that the encoding areas can boost the performance significantly, validating that the search space is more complete.

In A1subscriptùê¥1A_{1}, Fig.¬†3a shows that the side-output numbers in deep stages are significantly larger than those in shallow stages. This is because the features from deep stages have small resolutions yet coarse-scale granularity and strong representation capability. More deep stage features imply higher accuracy. The adaptive configuration of multi-stage features greatly eases the scale variation problem. In A2subscriptùê¥2A_{2}, we divide the short connections adjacent ones and cross-stage ones, Fig.¬†3b. Considering the degradation caused by feature upsampling, the adjacent connections are preferred. In A3subscriptùê¥3A_{3}, we compare LSU operator distributions, including skips and convolutions with different kernel sizes, Fig.¬†3c. For the moderate performance gain (0.750 v‚Äãsùë£ùë†vs 0.753) with dilated convolutions, we calculate the average number of different convolutions in an LSU according to their kernel size only. It can be seen that the C‚Äão‚Äãn‚Äãv3ùê∂ùëúùëõsubscriptùë£3Conv_{3} and C‚Äão‚Äãn‚Äãv5ùê∂ùëúùëõsubscriptùë£5Conv_{5} are more preferred than C‚Äão‚Äãn‚Äãv1ùê∂ùëúùëõsubscriptùë£1Conv_{1}. This is because they correspond to stronger representation capability and larger receptive fields to ease the imbalance of semantic level and scale granularity. In the early search phrase, the number of C‚Äão‚Äãn‚Äãv3ùê∂ùëúùëõsubscriptùë£3Conv_{3} is noticeably larger than that of C‚Äão‚Äãn‚Äãv5ùê∂ùëúùëõsubscriptùë£5Conv_{5} while the gap reduces when search goes on. The reason lies in that with less parameters, C‚Äão‚Äãn‚Äãv3ùê∂ùëúùëõsubscriptùë£3Conv_{3} layers are easy to be optimized. When sufficient evolution takes place, C‚Äão‚Äãn‚Äãv5ùê∂ùëúùëõsubscriptùë£5Conv_{5} with large receptive field and representation capability show its advantages. This validates AdaLSN‚Äôs adaptability on network architecture configuration. In A4subscriptùê¥4A_{4}, we calculate the ratio of intermediate supervision, Fig.¬†3d. It can be seen that in the early phase, the architecture is more dependent on intermediate supervision because intermediate supervision can force the feature subspaces to expand to fit the ground-truth. With sufficient training after tens of generations, architectures with less intermediate supervision can ease the error accumulation issue while fulfilling complementary learning for feature space expansion. AdaLSN Exemplars.\nThe computational cost and the prediction accuracy of AdaLSNs largely depend on the search space settings, Table¬†V. Specifically, we explore the effect of ‚Äúchannel number‚Äù, ‚Äúintermediate node‚Äù, and ‚Äúoperator‚Äù ({kernel size}-{dilation rate}) at the unit level; and the effect of ‚Äúside-output‚Äù at the pyramid level. When the channel number increases from 2 to 64, the memory cost increases from 8.1‚ÄãG8.1ùê∫8.1G to 24.0‚ÄãG24.0ùê∫24.0G. The parameters and runtime of the searched network in the retraining phase increase moderately from (14.7‚ÄãM14.7ùëÄ14.7M, 12.52‚Äãm‚Äãs12.52ùëöùë†12.52ms) to (16.1‚ÄãM16.1ùëÄ16.1M, 14.21‚Äãm‚Äãs14.21ùëöùë†14.21ms), while the F-score increases significantly from 0.7260.7260.726 to 0.7590.7590.759, Table¬†V. We conclude the channel number is an important factor in balancing the computational cost and accuracy for our approach. When adding intermediate nodes in each LSU from 00 to 444, one can see that the computational cost in both phases increases moderately, while the F-score greatly increases from 0.7040.7040.704 to 0.7530.7530.753. It is worth noting that comparing LSUs without any intermediate node, the F-score increases impressively from 0.7040.7040.704 to 0.7400.7400.740 with only 111 intermediate node used in each LSU. This validates the importance of operators and their combinations in the explicit feature transform for feature space expansion. However, when the intermediate node number increases to 555, the F-score of AdaLSN falls to 0.7490.7490.749. This is because the more intermediate nodes means higher search complexity, which significantly improves the difficult to search optimal architectures. We evaluate the convolution operators with different kernel sizes and dilation rates. Table¬†V shows that convolutions with kernel sizes larger than 111 have superiority for feature space expansion, e.g.formulae-sequenceùëíùëîe.g., the F-score increases from 0.7130.7130.713 to 0.7500.7500.750 with negligible computational cost. When the dilation rate enlarges properly as {1,2,4,8}1248\\{1,2,4,8\\}, which enriches the scale granularity, the performance improves up to 0.7530.7530.753. Nevertheless, the F-score falls upon larger dilation rates, because convolution operators with large dilation tend to missing feature details. Accordingly, the kernel sizes and dilation rates are set as {1,3,5}‚àí{1,2,4,8}1351248\\{1,3,5\\}-\\{1,2,4,8\\}. As features from shallow stages are less representative but have high resolution, we gradually reduce the shallow side-outputs in the search phase to figure out the effect of each side-output. As shown in the bottom row of Table¬†V, without S1subscriptùëÜ1S_{1} and S2subscriptùëÜ2S_{2}, the memory cost reduces significantly from 19.8‚ÄãG19.8ùê∫19.8G to 11.3‚ÄãG11.3ùê∫11.3G and the search time decreases from 47.5‚Äãh47.5‚Ñé47.5h to 39.5‚Äãh39.5‚Ñé39.5h, while the F-score reduces slightly.\nIn Fig.¬†4, we visualize the figures of ablation on channel number and side-output in Table¬†V and Table¬†VI using the VGG backbone. One can find that when reducing the shallow network stages {1,2}12\\{1,2\\} while increasing the channel number from 323232 to 128128128, the F-scores of the searched architectures increase significantly. When we reduce the deep stages with medium channel numbers, the F-score significantly drops. For instance, with the channel number 323232, the F-score drops from 0.7460.7460.746 to 0.7230.7230.723 when the side-outputs reduce from {4,5}45\\{4,5\\} to {5}5\\{5\\}. Empirically, we set the side-output as {2,3,4,5}2345\\{2,3,4,5\\} and change the channel number and intermediate node to (2, 1) for a small AdaLSN(SùëÜS) , while (64, 4) for a medium AdaLSN(MùëÄM). By increasing the channel number to 128128128 while reducing the side-output to {3,4,5}345\\{3,4,5\\}, we have a large AdaLSN(LùêøL). The detailed structures of three versions of AdaLSN with VGG¬† are depicted in Fig.¬†5. Comparing to the state-of-the-art approaches, such as HED¬†, SRN¬†[ref]8, and LSN¬†, AdaLSN(SùëÜS) has significant accuracy improvement (about 0.056‚àº0.227similar-to0.0560.2270.056\\sim 0.227 F-score gain) with negligible parameter cost. Comparing with DeepFlux¬†, AdaLSN(MùëÄM) achieves better F-score (0.760 v‚Äãsùë£ùë†vs 0.724) with less params (16.6 M v‚Äãsùë£ùë†vs 18.3 M) . In Table¬†VI, we can find that with the InceptionV3 ¬† backbone, AdaLSN(LùêøL) achieves 0.786, improving the state-of-the-art with a large margin.

It can be seen that with only parallel side-outputs for scale-aware feature utilization, the predictions of HED¬† suffer background noise in shallow network stages and mosaic effects in deep stages. With adding short connections among side-outputs for feature integration, SRN¬†[ref]8 purses the residual between adjacent stages to progressively improve the predictions in a deep-to-shallow manner so that the predictions in shallow stages are greatly improved. To learn more complementary features and span a larger feature space, LSN¬† builds dense short connections among side-outputs for feature space expansion. However, without explicitly feature transform, LSN only moderately improves the result comparing with SRN. Deepflux¬† generates a slim skeleton with manually designed ASPP modules¬† and the context flux constrain. However, the prediction is also barely satisfactory. AdaLSN incorporates these advantages in the linear span view and updates them with the adaptive architecture search algorithm. As the searched architectures are adaptive to the skeleton characteristics, feature subspaces are adaptively expanded while forced to be complementary with each other. This explains why the prediction results at all stages are more precise, clear, and consecutive.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: we have a large AdaLSN(LùêøL).
