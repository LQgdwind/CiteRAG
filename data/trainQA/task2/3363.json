      "content": "Paper Title: CVAE-H: Conditionalizing Variational Autoencoders via Hypernetworks and Trajectory Forecasting for Autonomous Driving\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOver the last few years, companies have made major progress towards the real-world deployment of autonomous driving technologies. In late 2020, Waymo, Googleâ€™s autonomous vehicle (AV) company, became the first company that offered commercial autonomous taxi rides to the public in Pheonix, Arizona. With the initial milestone for the deployment made, the challenge of developing effective AV technologies that can operate in a wide variety of complex urban environments has never been more important. As pointed out by a recent publication from Waymo, generalization within and between operating regions is crucial to the overall viability of AV technologies . Autonomous vehicles interact with stochastic road users such as human drivers in different driving scenarios and road topologies. The presence of multiple stochastic agents creates uncertainties that grow over time, contributing to the increase in the number of variations of the environments and scenarios that an autonomy stack (perception, prediction, planning, and control) of the AV needs to handle. Among the modules of the autonomy stack, the prediction is where the stochasticity and diversity culminates, as it is responsible of understanding scene contexts of various complex environments and predicting a set of possible future trajectories of road users. There are four key attributes that a prediction module should possess: probabilistic, multi-modal, context-driven, and general. Autonomous driving often involves interactions with stochastic road users. Upon the presence of road users, AV needs to predict their states to avoid collisions. In addition to bare predictions, a prediction model should also output the quantified uncertainties of the predictions, which are essential in the downstream modules such as planning. Another characteristic of road agents is the diversity of possible trajectories. For example, a vehicle approaching a 4-way intersection has four possible modes; go straight, turn left, turn right, or yield if there is a lead vehicle waiting in the queue. A vehicle passing through a crosswalk may slow down or maintain its speed. There are various factors that contribute to the diversity of the trajectories. Such factors include the relative states of dynamic agents, road geometries, and static obstacles in the scene. To consider these factors, it is important to capture the impact of both social features (e.g., interactions among road-agents) and spatial features (e.g., lanes, stop signs, and crossroads) in the prediction. Last attribute of autonomous driving is that numerous instances of driving environments exist. Road configuration alone is diverse; examples include un-signalized intersections with single-lane, two-lanes, 2-way stops, or u-turns, one-way roads, straight roads, curved roads, and so on. The presence of static and dynamic agents diversify the urban environments as well. This means that an ad-hoc prediction approach customized to a specific instance of an environment is impractical. A scalable prediction model should adaptively produce predictions in various environments. It is not trivial for a prediction model to satisfy all four attributes. First of all, not all neural-network models are probabilistic unless they build on explicit density models such as Mixture Density Network (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Models) [ref]2 , Normalizing-flow models [ref]4 , Variational Autoencoder (VAE) [ref]6. Secondly, not all probabilistic models are multi-modal, for instance, a uni-modal Gaussian. Third, to be fully context-driven, the model should leverage both the social and spatial information. Some models   are based exclusively on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and may not best capture social features. Similarly, models that rely solely on social features  0 1 may not consider spatial features of the environment that come from HD Maps, images, and/or lidar point clouds. Finally, generality of a prediction model is hard to achieve. Models that leverage scenario-specific heuristics or knowledge may sacrifice generality over the precision for the targeted scenarios. To build a model that possesses all four attributes of a ideal prediction model, we leverage the following two architectures: VAE 2, which is an explicit generative model, and hypernetwork 3, which may consist of diverse kinds of neural networks for the context-driven prediction. By integrating a hypernetwork into a VAE, we propose CVAE-H. This facilitates the informational flow of the conditions to the VAE network across all layers and allows the VAE to effectively scale up to work with large conditional inputs. We first evaluate CVAE-H on simple Gaussian experiments to show that CVAE-H is probabilistic, multi-modal, context-driven, and general. Then, we demonstrate that the proposed model effectively solves a self-driving prediction problem by utilizing both social and spatial features of the environments and producing accurate predictions of road agents in various environments.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: all four attributes.
