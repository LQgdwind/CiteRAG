      "content": "Paper Title: Multiscale Positive-Unlabeled Detection of AI-Generated Texts\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe also experiment our method on ChatGPT corpora that are much harder to detect. In the ChatGPT text detection experiments, we follow the setting of HC3  to test the performance of our method. HC3  is a dataset targeted at ChatGPT text detection. All texts are reduced into shorter texts for a sentence-level variant. We apply the MPU framework on the full-scale dataset of HC3 . Several baseline detectors are chosen to demonstrate the outstanding detection performance of our MPU method. These baselines are open-source and replicable. Among these baselines, GLTR [ref]12, PPL , and DetectGPT [ref]26 are zero-shot methods that do not require further training: they rely on the likelihood outputs of a pretrained language model. The OpenAI Detector [ref]30 is a RoBERTa detector finetuned on OpenAI’s GPT-2  corpora. RoBERTa-Stylo  is one of the latest detection baseline targeted for short texts. BERT-Finetuned and RoBERTa-Finetuned are language models plainly finetuned on HC3 , following the official setting; while BERT-MPU and RoBERTa-MPU are language models trained on HC3  via the proposed MPU method. It could be observed from Table 4 that most existing methods perform poorly on short texts. The statistics verify our previous claim that the detection of shorter texts is a difficult problem. Specifically, finetuned BERT and RoBERTa are good at detecting long, full-level texts, but they fail to filter out shorter AI-generated texts. On the contrary, our MPU method could greatly improve short-text performances and boost long AI-generated text detection as well. We will further investigate the effect of solitary MPU components in Sec. 3.5.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: of HC3 .

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
