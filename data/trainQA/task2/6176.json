      "content": "Paper Title: Towards credible visual model interpretation with path attribution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning is fast approaching the maturity where it can be commonly deployed in safety-critical applications , , . However, its black-box nature presents a major concern for its use in high-stake applications , [ref]3, 0, and its ethical use in general , . These facts have led to the development of numerous techniques of explaining deep learning models [ref]3, , 6, 4, , 1, 6. Whereas rendering the models intrinsically explainable is an active parallel research direction [ref]3, 0, 6, 7, post-hoc model interpretation methods are currently highly popular. These methods are used to explain the predictions of already deployed models. Path attribution methods 0, 6, , 6 hold a special place among the post-hoc interpretation techniques due to their clear theoretical foundations. These methods compute attribution scores (or simply the attributions) for the input features to quantify their importance for model prediction, where the attributions and the methods follow certain desirable axiomatic properties 6. These properties emerge from the cooperative game-theory roots of the path attribution framework 2, 6. To compute the attribution score for an input feature, the path attribution framework defines a baseline, and a path between the input and the baseline. Following the original game-theory intuitions , 2, 6, the baseline signifies ‘absence’ of the input feature, and the path gradually flows from this absence to the ‘presence’ of the feature in the input. This intuition has direct implications for the desirable axiomatic properties of the framework. However, an unambiguous definition of ‘feature absence’ still eludes visual modelling 0, , 5. This leads to ill-defined baselines, which in turn also results in problematic features on the path between the baseline and the input. These features violate the original assumption that their existence is between the extremities of the absence and presence of the input feature - see Fig. 1.\nBesides, Srinivas et al. 4 also showed that the existing path attribution methods for deep learning can compute counter-intuitive results even when they satisfy their claimed axiomatic properties. In this work, we address the above-noted shortcomings of the path attribution framework for interpreting deep visual models. The key contributions of this paper are: With a systematic theoretical formulation, it pinpoints the conflicts that result in the problems of (i) counter-intuitive attributions, (ii) ambiguity in the baseline and (iii) non-conformant path features; which collectively compromise the reliability of the path attribution framework for deep visual model interpretation. For each of these problems, it proposes a theory-driven solution, which conforms to the original game-theory intuitions of the path attribution framework. It combines the solutions into a well-defined path attribution method to compute reliable attributions. It thoroughly establishes the efficacy of the proposed method with extensive experiments using multiple models, datasets and evaluation metrics.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: fast approaching the maturity where it can be commonly deployed in safety-critical applications , , .
