      "content": "Paper Title: Do Differentiable Simulators Give Better Policy Gradients?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we elaborate and discuss on some of the ramifications of our work. Impact on Computation Time. The convergence rate of gradient descent in stochastic optimization scales directly with the variance of the estimator 9. For smooth and well-behaved landscapes, FoBG often converges faster since Var​[∇¯​F]<Var​[∇¯[ref]0​F]Vardelimited-[]superscript¯∇delimited-[]1𝐹Vardelimited-[]superscript¯∇delimited-[]0𝐹\\textbf{Var}[\\bar{\\nabla}^{}F]<\\textbf{Var}[{\\bar{\\nabla}^{[ref]0}F}]. However, when there are discontinuities or near-discontinuities in the landscape, this promise no longer holds since gradient descent using FoBG might not converge due to bias. Indeed, Example 3.6 tells us that bias due to discontinuities can be interpreted as infinite variance. Under this interpretation, the convergence rate of gradient descent is ill-defined. In practice; however, the computation cost of obtaining the gradient must be taken into consideration as well. Given the same number of samples N𝑁N, the computation of FoBG is more costly than the ZoBG, as FoBG requires automatic differentiation through the computation graph while ZoBG simply requires evaluation. Thus, the benefits of convergence rates using the FoBG must justify the additional cost of computing them. Implicit time-stepping. In our work, we have mainly addressed two classes of simulation methods for contact. The first uses the penalty method 8 , which approximates contact via stiff springs, and the second uses event detection , which explicitly computes time-of-impact for automatic differentiation. In addition to the ones covered, we note a third class of simulators that rely on optimization-based implicit time-stepping     [ref]21, which can be made differentiable by sensitivity analysis . These simulators suffer less from stiffness by considering more long-term behavior across each timestep; however, geometrical discontinuities can still remain problematic. We leave detailed empirical study using these simulators to future work. Analytic Smoothing. Randomized smoothing relies on smoothing out the policy objective via the process of noise injection and sampling. However, one can also resort to analytic smoothing, which finds analytically smooth approximation of the underlying dynamics ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi  [ref]21. Modifying and smoothing ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi directly also has the effect of smoothing the induced value function, though the resulting landscape will be different from the landscaped induced by appending noise to the policy output. However, even when ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi can be analytically smoothed, Monte-Carlo sampling is still required for optimization across initial conditions ρ𝜌\\rho. For such settings, the findings of Section 3.2 is still highly relevant, as the performance of FoBG still suffers from the stiffness of the smoothed approximation of ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi. However, as many smoothing methods provide access to parameters that control the strength of smoothing, algorithms may be able to take a curriculum-learning approach where dynamics become more realistic, and less smooth, as more iterations are taken for policy search.\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: rate of gradient descent in stochastic optimization scales directly with the variance of the estimator 9.
