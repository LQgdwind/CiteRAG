      "content": "Paper Title: Spectrum Sharing Among Multiple-Seller and Multiple-Buyer Operators of A Mobile Network: A Stochastic Geometry Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn Fig. 11, we compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with the algorithms presented in [ref]17 and  versus the maximum interference threshold ζssubscript𝜁𝑠\\zeta_{s} for different values of BS intensity. For generating this figure, we consider a single seller and buyer MNO where the seller MNO has one licensed sub-band, as in [ref]17 and . As observed in Fig. 11(a) and Fig. 11(b), the proposed algorithm outperforms the other algorithms presented in [ref]17 and . In fact, the proposed algorithm adjusts the transmit power of buyer MNO’s BSs in such a way that the interference imposed on all corresponding seller users is below ζssubscript𝜁𝑠\\zeta_{s}. Thus, the expected rate of seller users improves significantly. Furthermore, in Fig. 11(a) and Fig. 11(b), we can see that the expected rates of buyer and seller users remain constant in [ref]17 when the maximum interference threshold ζssubscript𝜁𝑠\\zeta_{s} increases. The reason for this is that there is no power control strategy in [ref]17. In Fig. 12, we compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with the algorithm presented in [ref]17, the complete sharing algorithm in , and no sharing algorithm versus the minimum data rate requirements (rthsuperscript𝑟thr^{\\text{th}}) for different numbers of licensed sub-bands per seller MNO (Ls,s∈𝒮subscript𝐿𝑠𝑠𝒮L_{s},s\\in\\mathcal{S}), as in [ref]17,  and . For a fair comparison, we consider a cellular network in which there is a single buyer MNO. In addition, we omit constraints C0 and C2 in problem (LABEL:Problem_5). For generating this figure, we set the number of seller MNOs to 2 (S=2𝑆2S=2), where the seller MNOs may lease all of their licensed sub-bands to the buyer MNO. As observed in Fig. 12, the proposed algorithm outperforms the other algorithms. The reason is that the algorithm presented in [ref]17 is a greedy algorithm that minimizes the total cost of purchasing licensed sub-bands (i.e., min𝐀⁡cb​(𝐀),∀b∈ℬsubscript𝐀subscript𝑐𝑏𝐀for-all𝑏ℬ\\min_{\\boldsymbol{\\rm{A}}}c_{b}(\\boldsymbol{\\rm{A}}),\\forall b\\in\\mathcal{B}, where |ℬ|=1ℬ1|\\mathcal{B}|=1), while the proposed algorithm maximizes the profit of the buyer MNO by a joint power control and licensed sub-band sharing. From Fig. 12, we can see that the average profit of the buyer MNOs is zero with no sharing, while sharing all sub-bands among MNOs does not necessarily increase efficiency. Another important observation from Fig. 12 is that the stationary point obtained by the proposed algorithm is considerably close to the globally optimal solution.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: In Fig. 11, we compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with the algorithms presented in [ref]17 and  versus the maximum interference threshold ζssubscript𝜁𝑠\\zeta_{s} for different values of BS intensity.
