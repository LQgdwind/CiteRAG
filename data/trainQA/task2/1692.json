      "content": "Paper Title: Group-wise Inhibition based Feature Regularization for Robust Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate the performance of TENET Training from three aspects, i.e. standard classification, robustness and generalization (see Table 1). Standard Classification. \nIn this case, ResNet-18 1 is selected as the backbone in our TENET Training. PASCAL VOC 2012 [ref]9 is used for the evaluation, while 5,717 and 5,823 images are used for the training and validation, respectively. The protocol in  is adopted. The CNNs for evaluation are pretrained on the ImageNet , and fine-tuned on PASCAL VOC 2012 training set. In the training stage, the shorter side of image is resized to a random value within  80 for the scale augmentation. The resized image is then randomly cropped to the size of 224√ó224224224224\\times 224 for the training based on the batch size of 256. In the testing stage, ten-crop testing is used to evaluate the performance. Robustness. \nIn this case, the robustness of the proposed algorithm against both adversarial attack and image corruption is evaluated on CIFAR 10/100 , CIFAR 10/100-C 2 and ImageNet-C 2. ResNeXt-29  and ResNet-50 1 are chosen as the backbones.\nTo test the robustness of the proposed method against adversarial attacks, two popular attacks, FGSM  and PGD , are employed. The performance is then evaluated according to the protocol in . The perturbation budget (œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon) is set to 8/25582558/255 or 4/25542554/255 under l‚àûsubscriptùëôl_{\\infty} norm distance for the two attacks. PGD-K stands for K-step attack with a step size of 2/25522552/255.\nMeanwhile, adversarial training is used to defense powerful iterative attacks of PGD. To make the results more convincing, an efficient adversarial training method (free-AT)  is adopted, where the hop step of free-AT, i.e. mùëöm, is set to 444. Against image corruption, 15 different kinds of corruptions, such as noise, blur, weather and digital corruptions, are performed on CIFAR 10/100-C and ImageNet-C for the evaluation, and each kind of corrupted data has five different severity levels 2. We follow the training protocols and evaluation metrics used in Augmix 4 and WResNet50 .\nThe Clean Error is the regular classification error on the original (uncorrupted) test or validation dataset, and\nmCE (Mean Corruption Error) for CIFAR-10/100-C is the mean over all 15 corruptions. Meanwhile, the mCE for ImageNet-C is normalized by the corruption error of AlexNet 9.\nDue to the computational efficiency, Augmix without Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) loss is implemented. Generalization. \nSince CUB-200  contains only 30 images for each of the 200 species of birds, it is used as a popular benchmark to test the generalization of CNNs.\nWe follow the protocol in , and evaluate the generalization with three numbers of samples per class (SPC) for training, i.e. 10, 20 and 30.\nFor a fair comparison, the same ResNet-50 1 in the protocol  is adopted as the backbone.\nTo train the CNNs, the smaller side of the images from CUB-200 is resized to 256, the scaled images are then randomly cropped to the size of 224√ó224224224224\\times 224. In the testing stage, the prediction is based on the center cropping with the size of 224√ó224224224224\\times 224. TENET Training.\nFor the hyper parameter setting, the cluster number NGsubscriptùëÅùê∫N_{G} is set to 6, while Œ±ùõº\\alpha and Œºùúá\\mu are set as 0.1 and 0.1, respectively. The public platform pytorch 2 is used for the implementation of all the experiments on a work station with CPU of 2.8GHz, RAM of 512GB and GPU of NVIDIA Tesla V100.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: i.e. standard classification, robustness and generalization (see Table 1).

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
