      "content": "Paper Title: Identification of Systematic Errors of Image Classifiers on Rare Subgroups\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVehicle Experiment.\nWe evaluate 5 models trained for image classification on ImageNet1k. We focus on a subset of classes belonging to the vehicle subcategory, more specifically on misclassifying samples of the class “minivan” 𝐲~=𝐲m​i​n​i​v​a​n~𝐲subscript𝐲𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑣𝑎𝑛\\mathbf{\\tilde{y}}=\\mathbf{y}_{minivan} into other classes that have a distance of 2 in the WordNet [ref]14 hierarchy, e.g., “police van” and “snowplow”. We focus on an operational design domain 𝐙𝐙\\mathbf{Z} with five semantic dimensions, corresponding to viewpoint, object size, object color, weather, and background. We use the prompt template Tp=subscript𝑇𝑝absentT_{p}=“{viewpoint} view of {size} {color} (minivan:1.5) in front of {weather} {background}”. We use combinatorial testing with nC=3subscript𝑛𝐶3n_{C}=3, exploring |𝐙C|=1.230subscript𝐙𝐶1.230|\\mathbf{Z}_{C}|=1.230 out of |𝐙|=18.720𝐙18.720|\\mathbf{Z}|=18.720 subgroups, and generate nS=16subscript𝑛𝑆16n_{S}=16 image samples per subgroup using Stable Diffusion v1.5. For a full description of experimental setting, we refer to Section A.1. We analyse the median predicted probability medianpT​2​I​(𝐱|Tp​(𝐲~,𝐳))f​(𝐲(t)|𝐱)subscriptmediansuperscript𝑝𝑇2𝐼conditional𝐱subscript𝑇𝑝~𝐲𝐳𝑓conditionalsuperscript𝐲𝑡𝐱\\operatorname*{median}_{p^{T2I}(\\mathbf{x}|T_{p}(\\mathbf{\\tilde{y}},\\mathbf{z}))}f(\\mathbf{y}^{(t)}|\\mathbf{x}) of different target classes 𝐲(t)superscript𝐲𝑡\\mathbf{y}^{(t)} for the strongest prompts identified by PromptAttack. We compare these prompts to a neutral baseline prompt t=𝑡absentt=“center view of (minivan:1.5) in front of background.”. Results for 4 selected target classes 𝐲(t)superscript𝐲𝑡\\mathbf{y}^{(t)} are summarized in Figure 5 (see also Table 1). It can be seen that samples of the baseline prompt are assigned with very high confidence to the correct class “minivan”. However, for target classes 𝐲(t)superscript𝐲𝑡\\mathbf{y}^{(t)} such as “pickup”, “police van”, or “snowplow”, PromptAttack can identify prompts that result in systematic misclassifications, that is considerably increased value for the target class. We depict the top-ranked subgroups for three target classes in Figure 1. We note that the sensitivity of models to these subgroups vary (in accordance with Figure 5): for ts​n​o​w​p​l​o​w⋆=subscriptsuperscript𝑡⋆𝑠𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑝𝑙𝑜𝑤absentt^{\\star}_{snowplow}=“rear view of small orange minivan in front of snowy forest.”, a VGG16 [ref]46 misclassifies 25%percent2525\\% of the samples as snowplows while a ConvNeXt-B 1 misclassifies only 1%percent11\\%. This indirectly confirms that misclassifications are not due to OOC samples because the same samples are classified correctly by a ConvNeXt-B (see also Section C for an illustration of misclassified samples). Moreover, we selected 16 images from LAION-5B  that best match ts​n​o​w​p​l​o​w⋆subscriptsuperscript𝑡⋆𝑠𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑝𝑙𝑜𝑤t^{\\star}_{snowplow} (using CLIP retrieval  followed by manual filtering). The models misclassify between 6 (ConvNeXt-B) and 8 (ResNet50 , VGG16) of those as snowplows. Figure 6 depicts a (cumulative) functional ANOVA analysis  of median predicted probability of different target classes 𝐲(t)superscript𝐲𝑡\\mathbf{y}^{(t)}. One can see that different semantic dimensions are relevant for different target classes; for instance, the combination of background and object color has a high fANOVA score for police-van but a low score for snowplow. Moreover, for target classes like snowplow, at least 333 semantic dimensions are required for explaining the bulk of the variance. This is also illustrated in Figure 7 where changing a single dimension does not mislead a ViT-B/16 , while a specific combination of shifts such as ts​n​o​w​p​l​o​w⋆subscriptsuperscript𝑡⋆𝑠𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑝𝑙𝑜𝑤t^{\\star}_{snowplow} results in misclassifying 300 out of 1000 samples as snowplow. A possible explanation for this increased error rate is that (i) snowy forests are more often in the background for snowplows than minivans, (ii) snowplows are more often orange than minivans, and (iii) rear views hide a distinctive feature of snowplows, namely their plow in the front.\nIn summary, our findings support the hypothesis that studying single shifts can be insufficient as often specific combinations of compounding shifts result in a systematic error. PromptAttack allows finding such rare subgroups. Person Experiment.\nIt has been observed before that systematic errors on under-represented demographic subgroups can result in reduced fairness and even derogatory behaviour such as misclassifying black people as “gorillas” . We check two models trained for image classification on ImageNet21k for similar issues using PromptAttack: we set source class 𝐲~=~𝐲absent\\mathbf{\\tilde{y}}=“homo” and target class “ape”. We use an operational design domain 𝐙𝐙\\mathbf{Z} with the 5 semantic dimensions age, gender, geographic region, hairtype, and background. We use the prompt template Tp=subscript𝑇𝑝absentT_{p}=“A {age} {gender} {region} (person:1.5) with {hairtype} hairs in front of {background}”. We use combinatorial testing with nC=3subscript𝑛𝐶3n_{C}=3, exploring |𝐙C|=1371subscript𝐙𝐶1371|\\mathbf{Z}_{C}|=1371 out of |𝐙|=12.150𝐙12.150|\\mathbf{Z}|=12.150 subgroups. For a full description of experimental setting and additional results, we refer to Section A.2. The outcome is summarized in Figure 8 and Table 2: while samples of most subgroups are classified correctly as “homo”, samples of specific subgroups (see Figure 15) identified by PromptAttack such as t=𝑡absentt=“old male african (person:1.5) with long hairs” have a misclassification rate of up to 25%percent2525\\% into “ape”. PromptAttack thus allows identifying systematic errors on under-represented demographic subgroups.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: specifically on misclassifying samples of the class “minivan” 𝐲~=𝐲m​i​n​i​v​a​n~𝐲subscript𝐲𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑣𝑎𝑛\\mathbf{\\tilde{y}}=\\mathbf{y}_{minivan} into other classes that have a distance of 2 in the WordNet [ref]14 hierarchy, e.g., “police van” and “snowplow”.
