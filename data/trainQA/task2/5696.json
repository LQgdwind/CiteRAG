Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Transformer-based Planning for Symbolic Regression\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate TPSR and several baseline methods on the following four standard benchmark datasets: Feynman, Black-box, and Strogatz from SRBench [ref]42, and In-domain Synthetic Data generated based on [ref]18. More details on each of these datasets are given below. Feynman555https://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/aifeynman.html: \n\nThis dataset contains 119119119 equations sourced from Feynman Lectures on Physics database series . The regression input points (x,y)𝑥𝑦(x,y) from these equations are provided in Penn Machine Learning Benchmark (PMLB) dataset [ref]42 [ref]43 and have been studied in SRBench [ref]42 for the symbolic regression task. The input dimension is limited to d≤10𝑑10d\\leq 10 and the true underlying function of points is known. We split the dataset into B𝐵B bags of 200200200 input points (when N𝑁N is larger than 200200200) since the transformer SR model is pretrained on N≤200𝑁200N\\leq 200 input points as per [ref]18.\n Strogatz666https://github.com/lacava/ode-strogatz: This dataset comprises 141414 symbolic regression problems sourced from the ODE-Strogatz database  for nonlinear dynamical systems. The input points for these problems are included in PMLB [ref]43 and have been examined in SRBench [ref]42 for symbolic regression. The input dimension for these problems is restricted to d=2𝑑2d=2 and the true underlying functions are provided. Black-box777https://github.com/EpistasisLab/pmlb/tree/master/datasets: The black-box regression datasets from PMLB [ref]43 are used for the symbolic regression task and studied in SRBench [ref]42 among various baselines. The aim of SR study on these black-box datasets is to find an interpretable model expression that fits the data effectively. We limit the datasets to those with continuous features and input dimension d≤10𝑑10d\\leq 10, as the transformer SR model [ref]18 is pretrained with dm​a​x=10subscript𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥10d_{max}=10. In total, there are 575757 black-box datasets that consist of real-world and synthetic datasets with varying levels of noise. In-domain Synthetic Data: Following [ref]18, we construct a fixed validation set consisting of 400400400 equation examples in which the validation functions were uniformly distributed across three different difficulty factors: input dimension (d𝑑d), number of unary operators (u𝑢u), and binary operators (b𝑏b). Specifically, we set d∼𝒰​(1,dm​a​x)similar-to𝑑𝒰1subscript𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥d\\sim\\mathcal{U}(1,d_{max}), b∈𝒰​(d−1,d+bm​a​x)𝑏𝒰𝑑1𝑑subscript𝑏𝑚𝑎𝑥b\\in\\mathcal{U}(d-1,d+b_{max}), and u∼𝒰​(0,um​a​x)similar-to𝑢𝒰0subscript𝑢𝑚𝑎𝑥u\\sim\\mathcal{U}(0,u_{max}), where dm​a​x=10subscript𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥10d_{max}=10, um​a​x=5subscript𝑢𝑚𝑎𝑥5u_{max}=5, and bm​a​x=5+dsubscript𝑏𝑚𝑎𝑥5𝑑b_{max}=5+d. The equation sequence is generated for each function by providing N=   𝑁50100150200N=    input points (x,y)𝑥𝑦(x,y), and the prediction accuracy is assessed on Nt​e​s​t=200subscript𝑁𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡200N_{test}=200 points that are randomly extracted from a multimodal distribution, as described in [ref]18. This data is referred to as “in-domain” because the validation data is generated using the same approach as the data on which the model [ref]18 is pretrained.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: We evaluate TPSR and several baseline methods on the following four standard benchmark datasets: Feynman, Black-box, and Strogatz from SRBench [ref]42, and In-domain Synthetic Data generated based on [ref]18.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
