      "content": "Paper Title: Self-supervised Matting-specific Portrait Enhancement and Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGenerative models show great potential in synthesizing various images by taking random latent codes as inputs. It‚Äôs evidenced that a pre-trained generator encodes rich knowledge prior, which benefits many downstream works, such as face swapping, super-resolution, semantic editing, and so on¬†    . Particular, there are many image editing methods explore the latent space of a pre-trained generative model (e.g., StyleGAN) in supervised or unsupervised manners¬†     . Different from existing works that learn the end-to-end models for image enhancement or restoration¬† 9 , GAN-based editing methods need to invert a target image to the latent code in advance, which is called GAN inversion¬†[ref]1    [ref]43. GAN inversion works discover a latent code that can produce the closest result to the input real image. In particular, Abdal¬†et al.¬†[ref]1 propose an optimization-based algorithm that optimizes the latent code in the¬†ùí≤+limit-fromùí≤\\mathcal{W+}¬†of a fixed StyleGAN governed by pixel-wise reconstruction. Their subsequent work¬† introduces noise optimization as a complement to the¬†ùí≤+limit-fromùí≤\\mathcal{W+}¬†latent space for restoring the high-frequency details in images. Zhu¬†et al.¬† propose to learn an encoder that ensures the inverted code in the semantic domain of the original latent space and explores many semantic image editing tasks. Compared to these works, we have a different objective that aiming at producing matting-specific portrait. We emphasize editing portraits with the minimum changes while making them the most ‚Äúpredictable‚Äù by a matting model.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: works that learn the end-to-end models for image enhancement or restoration¬† 9 , GAN-based editing methods need to invert a target image to the latent code in advance, which is called GAN inversion¬†[ref]1    [ref]43.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
