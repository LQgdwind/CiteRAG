      "content": "Paper Title: Surface Denoising based on Normal Filtering in a Robust Statistics Framework\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the last two decades, many surface smoothing algorithms have been developed. Due to the large number of available methods, for a comprehensive overview we refer to  [ref]3. Here, we give a short overview of methods highly related to the robust statistics setting and of the most important state-of-the-art methods. As stated above, the removal of noise components is equivalent to the removal of high frequency components. Here, the Fourier transform is a common tool, allowing efficient implementations of low-pass filters to cut off high frequencies. It has been generalized to manifold harmonics to be applicable to 2-manifold surfaces via the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator of these surfaces. Its matrix representation encodes the natural vibrations of a triangle mesh in its eigenvectors and the natural frequencies in its eigenvalues, see  . One drawback is its cost for many applications as the eigenvector decomposition of the Laplace matrix is numerically challenging to compute, see . A similar removal of high-frequency components can be achieved by utilizing the diffusion flow, which dampens high frequencies (instead of cutting them off) by a multiplication with a Gaussian kernel. It can be computed directly on the mesh, making it cheaper and hence more practical than the Fourier transform. Let f​(p→,t):ℝ3​|P|+1→ℝ:𝑓→𝑝𝑡→superscriptℝ3𝑃1ℝ{f(\\vec{p},t):\\mathbb{R}^{3|P|+1}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}} be a given signal with p→=(p1,…,p|P|)T→𝑝superscriptsubscript𝑝1…subscript𝑝𝑃𝑇{\\vec{p}=(p_{1},\\ldots,p_{|P|})^{{\\color[rgb]{0,0,0}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0,0,0}\\pgfsys@color@gray@stroke{0}\\pgfsys@color@gray@fill{0}T}}}. The diffusion equation: describes the change of f𝑓f over time by a scalar diffusion coefficient λ∈ℝ𝜆ℝ{\\lambda\\in\\mathbb{R}} multiplied with its spatial Laplacian Δ​fΔ𝑓\\Delta f, which can be replaced by the Laplace-Beltrami operator on manifolds. As the discretization asks for small time steps to be numerically robust in the integration, the authors of  proposed an implicit time integration providing unconditional robustness even for large time steps. A smoothing procedure can be derived from this as update of the vertex positions pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} by a point-wise update scheme because the Laplace-Beltrami operator on vertices corresponds to the mean curvature. Hence, all vertices pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} move in the corresponding normal direction nisubscript𝑛𝑖n_{i} by a magnitude regulated by the mean curvature H𝐻H. This is known as the mean curvature flow, see . The isotropic Laplacian has been extended by a data-dependent diffusion tensor yielding the anisotropic flow equation:\n where f𝑓f is a signal as in Equation (1) and gσ​(⋅)subscript𝑔𝜎⋅g_{\\sigma}(\\cdot) is an edge stopping function (anisotropic weighting function), which is responsible for feature-preservation with a user input parameter σ𝜎\\sigma during denoising operations, see  . Further examples for the usage of the anisotropic diffusion equation can be found in  and . The same concept is extended to the context of point set smoothing by Lange and Polthier  and to face normal filtering by Tasdizen et al. . Another set of denoising techniques consists of two-stage mesh denoising algorithms. Here, at the first stage, face normals are filtered and in the second stage vertex positions are updated according to the newly computed face normals, see . Face normal filtering is performed by using several linear and non-linear filters in order to preserve sharp features [ref]3 [ref]4    0 and vertex updates are performed by using the edge-face orthogonality 1. Finally, there are several denoising methods utilizing bilateral filtering. It arose from image processing 2 and uses a combination of two different weighting functions: a spatial kernel and a range kernel to preserve features and remove noise components. It got adapted to surface denoising for instance in 3, where the information of spatial distances and the local variation of vertex normal vectors is combined for denoising. Bilateral filters are extended for face normal filtering, where a range kernel (Gaussian function) is defined based on the normal differences in the neighborhood  4. A variation of bilateral filtering is also used extensively in mesh denoising in order to remove noise and retain sharp features 5 6.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: In the last two decades, many surface smoothing algorithms have been developed.
