      "content": "Paper Title: HARDC : A novel ECG-based heartbeat classification method to detect arrhythmia using hierarchical attention based dual structured RNN with dilated CNN\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nElectrocardiogram (ECG) records are a commonly used diagnostic method used in monitoring heart activity. The information in ECG recordings can indicate heart irregularities and facilitate diagnoses of cardiac pathologies, such as arrhythmia, ischemic heart conditions, and the occurrence of myocardial infarction . Arrhythmia involves irregularities in heartbeat rate due to electrical conduction issues, while atrial fibrillation (AF) is a persistent and particularly dangerous type of arrhythmia with very rapid cardiac contractions. AF and other types of arrhythmias can be monitored using ECG signals . To identify arrhythmias and their severity, clinical assessment of patients and their ECG signals by health professionals is the current practice. However, automated analysis solutions are beginning to emerge. . A machine learning-based approach to automated detection of ECG signals requires feature detection and extraction, followed by classification. However, many automated categorization techniques face challenges in achieving detection with sufficient accuracy[ref]14 . This also includes issues with ECG signal classification and labeling , data annotation  , interpretability   , efficiency , labeling of class correctly, and handling multimodal data  . Other specific challenges that arise during ECG signal preprocessing are standardization, handling of various ECG signal patterns, waveform variability in ECG signals, and long-length ECG signal processing. ECG signal identification currently requires expert opinion to detect and diagnose arrhythmia, but various hybrid approaches to this detection problem have been proposed, which involve machine learning methods  [ref]14 . However, deep learning-based methods have generally outperformed classic machine learning techniques      [ref]18 and produced excellent results with respect to precision and performance. Deep learning methods use algorithm stages in a model construction trained with the underlying data properties. Deep learning techniques, especially convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN), which primarily contain long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) networks, have been particularly successful in ECG signal processing . CNN is a common technique in deep learning studies         because it performs both feature and classification processes with a traditional training stage. Several convolutional and pooling layers are cascaded in the CNN model to form a deep network capable of extracting inherent input features. Because CNN structures have proven to be effective in computationally demanding studies, they are a good fit for ECG signal recognition mechanisms . Acharya et al.  constructed a CNN architecture with 11 layers that automatically identify signatures that reveal shockable and non-shockable ventricular arrhythmias in segmented ECG signals. CNN has also been utilized for automatic arrhythmia detection at varying intervals of heartbeat ECG segments . Yildirim et al.  employed a 16-layer deep CNN model to categorize extended-duration ECG data. Another important method that has been widely used in recent deep learning-based work is the LSTM  networks. The categorization of ECG signals has also been performed with LSTMs  and several approaches for enhancing the efficiency of LSTM networks have been developed. LSTM and CNN have also been integrated into recent work to provide a hybrid method for arrhythmia identification using variable-length heartbeats . Tan et al.  used an LSTM network employing CNN that was able to detect coronary artery disease from ECG signal recordings automatically and with acceptable accuracy. Using only wavelet sequencing as the network input can significantly boost the performance of LSTM-based algorithms . RNN experiences vanishing gradient problems and difficulties in handling long sequence dependency among features 0. However, as previous LSTM networks have only been able to model such sequences in one way, Bi-LSTM was developed to analyze the pattern in both forward as well as backward directions simultaneously. Although Bi-LSTM generally outperforms LSTM in various settings, multiple investigations have revealed that it suffers from problems associated with data duplication. Schuster et al.  showed that while Bi-LSTM performs well for some applications, this work did not demonstrate how to use and combine feature representations with the forward and backward options efficiently and has a problem of information redundancy in the network. According to Pascanu et al. , Bi-LSTM is prone to information redundancy with gradient explosion problems, making it unsuitable for lightweight devices. We employed an arrhythmia-diagnosis method employing hybrid deep learning to detect AF automatically from the ECG dataset. Our proposed method consists of data processing, synthetic signal generation, feature extraction, and classification. It combines four primary stages: Synthetic ECG generation with a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) done after the preprocessing; Bidirectional RNN; Dilated CNN; and hierarchical attention layer to extract features and classify ECG. The first stage of preprocessing requires peak detection and data segmentation to collect the input data. This is then input to the second stage, which employs dilated convolution layers and two Bidirectional Long-short Term memory(BiLSTM)-Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit(BiGRU) (BiLSTM-BiGRU) blocks to accomplish automatic feature extraction. The ECG signal episodes are then input to a dilated convolutional network with two completely connected layers with a SoftMax layer, which has two fully connected layers. The generated output is then forwarded to the hierarchical attention layer for final categorization after the operation of the Dilated CNN layer.\nThe basic steps of our proposed methodology are presented using the flowchart in figure 1. Finally, we have performed tests to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Utilizing the extensive-ranging extracted features from the BiLSTM-BiGRU as well as the speedily extracted relevant feature from the dialed CNN layer, this hierarchical attention method improves feature extraction interpretability. This improves the prediction accuracy of ECG signal categorization. In summary, the primary contributions of this paper are, first, demonstrating an improved BiLSTM-BiGRU method enabling the capture of variable-sized and long-ranged features important for ECG signal analysis. Second, the development of an updated hierarchical attention method to optimize feature weights that improve ECG feature selection interpretability and enhance ECG signal classification results. Finally, we propose a novel dilated CNN to handle more complex features with fewer network parameters that are able to increase the classification performance with less complexity. Our method eliminates the requirement for traditional manual feature extraction methods while delivering accurate results with improved interpretability, so it constitutes a novel method for classifying ECG signals.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: of ECG signals requires feature detection and extraction, followed by classification.
