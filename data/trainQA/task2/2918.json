Then, once converged to the solution of the continuous relaxation of the problem, we need to project the solution back to the discrete space of architectures, specified in equation 6, as done in [ref]29. This step could deviate from the solution and cause degradation in performance. Due to the formulation of the NAS problem 11 as a Bilinear Programming (BLP) [ref]11 with bilinear constraints (BLCP) we design Algorithm 1 that applies the BCFW with line-search for this special case. Thus\nmore specific convergence guarantees can be provided together with the sparsity of the solution, hence no additional discretization step is required.\nThe following theorem states that after 𝒪​(1/ϵ)𝒪1italic-ϵ\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon) iterations, Algorithm 1 obtains an ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-approximate solution to problem 11. For each k>0𝑘0k>0 the iterate ζk=(𝛂k,𝛃k)subscript𝜁𝑘subscript𝛂𝑘subscript𝛃𝑘\\zeta_{k}=(\\bm{\\alpha}_{k},\\bm{\\beta}_{k}) of Algorithm 1 satisfies: where ζ∗=(𝛂∗,𝛃∗)superscript𝜁superscript𝛂superscript𝛃\\zeta^{*}=(\\bm{\\alpha}^{*},\\bm{\\beta}^{*}) is the solution of a continuous relaxation of problem 11 and the expectation is over the random choice of the block 𝛂𝛂\\bm{\\alpha} or 𝛃𝛃\\bm{\\beta}. The proof is in Appendix 0.F.\nWe next provide a guarantee that Algorithm 1 directly yields a sparse solution, representing a valid sub-network\nwithout the additional discretization step required by other continuous methods [ref]27   [ref]29.\n The output solution (𝛂,𝛃)=ζ∗𝛂𝛃superscript𝜁(\\bm{\\alpha},\\bm{\\beta})=\\zeta^{*} of Algorithm 1 contains only one-hot vectors for αb,cssubscriptsuperscript𝛼𝑠𝑏𝑐\\alpha^{s}_{b,c} and βbssubscriptsuperscript𝛽𝑠𝑏\\beta^{s}_{b}, except from a single one for each of those blocks, which contains a couple of non-zero entries.\n The proof is in Appendix 0.G.\nIn practice, a negligible latency deviation is associated with taking the argmaxargmax\\operatornamewithlimits{argmax~{}} over the only two couples. Differently from the sparsity guarantee for the discretization step in [ref]29, Theorem 3.3 guarantees similar desirable properties but for the fundamentally different Algorithm 1 that does not involve an additional designated projection step.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: As pointed out by [ref]29, since ΘΘ\\Theta is constructed from measured latency in equation 9, it is not guaranteed to be positive semi-definite, hence, the induced quadratic constraint makes the feasible domain in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
