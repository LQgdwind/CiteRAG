      "content": "Paper Title: Dual Instrumental Method for Confounded Kernelized Bandits\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nContextual bandit problems have been studied to capture the trade-off between exploration and exploitation in online decision-making.\nVarious formulations of the problems show wide applications ranging from scheduling, dynamic pricing, packet routing, online auctions, e-commerce, and matching markets [ref]7.\nAt each round, a learner chooses an action for an observed context to generate a reward, which depends on the action and context.\nThe goal is to maximize the cumulative expected rewards, or equivalently, to minimize the cumulative expected regret.\nMany algorithms have been designed in literature (see a book of bandit algorithm summary [ref]20) to achieve near-optimal regret rates. Many existing studies on contextual bandits, including linear bandits ,\ngeneralized linear bandits  and kernelized bandits [ref]45,\nrely on one essential assumption: the independence between noise and contexts.\nIn this paper, we relax this assumption by modeling the correlation using causal graphs where the noise becomes a latent confounder.\nSuch a causal relationship is arguably sensible for practical applications in the real world.\nMany practical problems can be modeled using this framework 3  .\nUnder such a framework, we need to estimate the unknown function from noisy and possibly high-dimensional samples affected by the unobserved confounders while striking a balance between exploration and exploitation to achieve optimal regret.\nWe apply causal tools, e.g., the instrumental variable (IV) regression, to tackle the challenge brought by latent confounders.\nCombined with the kernel trick and dual formulation, the instrumental variable method elegantly does regressions in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) and accurately identify the causal effect.\nTo deal with the non-i.i.d.Â issue of bandit data, we divide the time horizon into epochs, in each of which, our proposed action sampling policy can effectively balance the exploration and exploitation and efficiently reduce the computational burden.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: in online decision-making.\nVarious formulations of the problems show wide applications ranging from scheduling, dynamic pricing, packet routing, online auctions, e-commerce, and matching markets [ref]7.\nAt each round, a learner chooses an action for an observed context to generate a reward, which depends on the action and context.\nThe goal is to maximize the cumulative expected rewards, or\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
