      "content": "Paper Title: Diffusion Video Autoencoders: Toward Temporally Consistent Face Video Editing via Disentangled Video Encoding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are various attempts to manipulate images with diffusion models [ref]23  [ref]17  [ref]25  such as text-guided inpainting  [ref]25 , stroke-based editing [ref]17, and style transfer . Among those, we are especially interested in facial attribute editing tasks. Kim et al.  propose text-based image manipulation by optimizing an unconditional diffusion model to minimize local directional CLIP loss . This method is superior to GAN-based methods as it can successfully edit even occluded or overly decorated faces by the excellent reconstruction ability of diffusion models. However, due to the absence of semantically meaningful latent space, there exist some semantic features that are unable to be changed. Another parallel work proposes diffusion autoencoder (DiffAE) [ref]23, which takes a learnable encoder to obtain semantic representations of which the underlying diffusion model is conditioned. The model can perform face attribute manipulation by moving the semantic vector to a target direction. Based on DiffAEs, we design our diffusion video autoencoders to perform temporally-consistent video editing.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: There are various attempts to manipulate images with diffusion models [ref]23  [ref]17  [ref]25  such as text-guided inpainting  [ref]25 , stroke-based editing [ref]17, and style transfer .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
