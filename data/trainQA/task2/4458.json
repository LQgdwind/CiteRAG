      "content": "Paper Title: Encoding Concepts in Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHere, we will detail how we compute the five metrics for evaluating task accuracy, task completeness, concept interpretability and explanation performance. The first metric is classification accuracy, which we compute by dividing the number of correctly classified samples by the total number of samples. Secondly, we calculate concept completeness [ref]22, which is the accuracy of a decision tree classifier trained to predict the output label from the concept encoding in the case of CGNs and cluster number in the case of GCExplainer. Thirdly, we compute concept purity. We follow the approach proposed by  Magister et al. [ref]21, which is to calculate the graph edit distance between the top representation of a concept and the two closest concept representations to it. We compute the minimum purity score, because we want to compare the best concepts found by CEM and GCExplainer. As the graph edit distance is expensive to compute, only smaller, meaningful graphs are considered. Table 5 summarises and justifies the graph sizes considered. We aim for the maximum graph size to be twice the size of the concept, however, we cap this threshold at 13 if the concept is too big. This is reasonable, as in the synthetic datasets noisy concepts representing the base graph are identified. Similar to the completeness score, we compute the accuracy of logic explanations by taking the accuracy of a decision tree classifier trained on mapping between concepts activated according to logic formula and the output label. Finally, we compute the complexity of logic explanations by measuring the length of the logic formula. The metrics reported are the mean of the five experiment runs for each dataset, including the 95%percent9595\\% confidence intervals computed using the Box-Cox transformation for non-normal distributions.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: The first metric is classification accuracy, which we compute by dividing the number of correctly classified samples by the total number of samples.

Thirdly,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
