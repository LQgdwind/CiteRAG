      "content": "Paper Title: Asymmetric Leaky Private Information Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we present our main results on the optimal download cost and the required amount of shared randomness for AL-PIR. Given desired privacy budgets ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon and δ𝛿\\delta for the user and DB privacy leakage, respectively, we state our main results in the following Theorems. Define d1​(ϵ,δ):=1+1N−1−δ​eϵNK−1−1assignsubscript𝑑1italic-ϵ𝛿11𝑁1𝛿superscript𝑒italic-ϵsuperscript𝑁𝐾11d_{1}(\\epsilon,\\delta):=1+\\frac{1}{N-1}-\\frac{\\delta e^{\\epsilon}}{N^{K-1}-1}.

As a result of Theorem 1, we have the following remark. The required size of shared randomness for our achievability scheme, as given by α1​(ϵ,δ)subscript𝛼1italic-ϵ𝛿\\alpha_{1}(\\epsilon,\\delta) in (16), yields an upper bound on the optimal size of minimum shared randomness α∗​(ϵ,δ)superscript𝛼italic-ϵ𝛿\\alpha^{*}(\\epsilon,\\delta) as defined in (15), i.e.,\nα∗​(ϵ,δ)≤α1​(ϵ,δ).superscript𝛼italic-ϵ𝛿subscript𝛼1italic-ϵ𝛿\\alpha^{*}(\\epsilon,\\delta)\\leq\\alpha_{1}(\\epsilon,\\delta). Moreover, α1​(ϵ,δ)subscript𝛼1italic-ϵ𝛿\\alpha_{1}(\\epsilon,\\delta) is also sufficient to satisfy (ϵ′,δ′)superscriptitalic-ϵ′superscript𝛿′(\\epsilon^{\\prime},\\delta^{\\prime}) privacy constraints, such that ϵ′≥ϵsuperscriptitalic-ϵ′italic-ϵ\\epsilon^{\\prime}\\geq\\epsilon and δ′≥δsuperscript𝛿′𝛿\\delta^{\\prime}\\geq\\delta. In other words, if a given amount of common randomness is sufficient to satisfy (ϵ,δ)italic-ϵ𝛿(\\epsilon,\\delta) privacy, then it is also sufficient if the privacy budgets are increased. In Figure 2, we show the effect of ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon and δ𝛿\\delta on the download cost for the case when N=K=2𝑁𝐾2N=K=2. We can observe the following:\na) the download cost is a monotonically decreasing function of the privacy budgets ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon and δ𝛿\\delta;\nb) as ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon approaches infinity, which corresponds to no user privacy, the achieved download cost approaches 111; c) for ϵ=0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon=0 (perfect user privacy) and as δ𝛿\\delta approaches zero (perfect DB privacy), the achieved download cost is 222 which matches the case of SPIR studied in [ref]9 where the optimal download cost is NN−1=2𝑁𝑁12\\frac{N}{N-1}=2; and d) for δ≥δ1​(ϵ)=1/(eϵ+1)𝛿subscript𝛿1italic-ϵ1superscript𝑒italic-ϵ1\\delta\\geq\\delta_{1}(\\epsilon)=\\nicefrac{{1}}{{(e^{\\epsilon}+1)}} (or ϵ≥ln⁡(1/δ−1)italic-ϵ1𝛿1\\epsilon\\geq\\ln(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{\\delta}}-1)), the download cost is only a function of ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon (the line corresponding to δ=0.4𝛿0.4\\delta=0.4). Define d2​(ϵ,δ):=1+1N​eϵ−1−δ(N​eϵ)K−1−1assignsubscript𝑑2italic-ϵ𝛿11𝑁superscript𝑒italic-ϵ1𝛿superscript𝑁superscript𝑒italic-ϵ𝐾11d_{2}(\\epsilon,\\delta):=1+\\frac{1}{Ne^{\\epsilon}-1}-\\frac{\\delta}{(Ne^{\\epsilon})^{K-1}-1}.\nFor N≥2𝑁2N\\geq 2, and shared randomness S𝑆S with size H​(S)≥α2​(ϵ,δ)​L,𝐻𝑆subscript𝛼2italic-ϵ𝛿𝐿H(S)\\geq\\alpha_{2}(\\epsilon,\\delta)L, where the optimal download cost of AL-PIR subject to ϵ−limit-fromitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-user privacy and δ−limit-from𝛿\\delta-DB privacy is lower-bounded by where Furthermore, the optimal size of common randomness satisfying ϵ−limit-fromitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-user privacy and δ−limit-from𝛿\\delta-DB privacy is lower-bounded by α∗​(ϵ,δ)≥α2​(ϵ,δ)superscript𝛼italic-ϵ𝛿subscript𝛼2italic-ϵ𝛿\\alpha^{*}(\\epsilon,\\delta)\\geq\\alpha_{2}(\\epsilon,\\delta). The proof of Theorem 2 is presented in Section 5. We note that the results in Theorems 1 and 2 hold for N≥2𝑁2N\\geq 2 DBs. In the following proposition, we characterize the capacity for the case of one database. The optimal download cost D∗​(ϵ,δ)superscript𝐷italic-ϵ𝛿D^{*}(\\epsilon,\\delta) for N=1𝑁1N=1 and for any 0≤ϵ<∞0italic-ϵ0\\leq\\epsilon<\\infty is given by: The above result shows that the problem of AL-PIR for one database is degenerate. In particular, to satisfy the ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-user privacy constraint, any query/answer pair has to be requested to retrieve each of the K𝐾K messages with non-zero probability. Since N=1𝑁1N=1, the only solution is to download all messages, i.e., a download cost of K𝐾K. However, upon downloading all K𝐾K messages, the leakage about the remaining (K−1)𝐾1(K-1) messages is fixed and given by δ=K−1𝛿𝐾1\\delta=K-1. Hence, if the DB privacy budget is δ<(K−1)𝛿𝐾1\\delta<(K-1), the AL-PIR problem is infeasible and the capacity is 00, i.e., D∗​(ϵ,δ<K−1)=∞superscript𝐷italic-ϵ𝛿𝐾1D^{*}(\\epsilon,\\delta<K-1)=\\infty. We prove Proposition 3 in Appendix D. In the next Corollary, we show that our proposed scheme in Theorem 1 is information-theoretically optimal for perfect user privacy, i.e., ϵ=0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon=0, and is optimal within a maximum multiplicative gap ratio of N−e−ϵN−1𝑁superscript𝑒italic-ϵ𝑁1\\frac{N-e^{-\\epsilon}}{N-1} for any (ϵ,δ)italic-ϵ𝛿(\\epsilon,\\delta). The proof of the corollary is presented in Appendix A. The multiplicative gap ratio between the upper and lower bounds on the download cost of the AL-PIR, given by Theorems 1 and 2, respectively, is bounded as follows: In Figure 3, we show the upper and lower bounds on the download cost of the AL-PIR and the numerical multiplicative gap ratio, as a function of system parameters (N,K,ϵ,δ)𝑁𝐾italic-ϵ𝛿(N,K,\\epsilon,\\delta).\nSpecifically, in Figure 3a, we set the allowed DB privacy leakage to the maximum leakage, i.e., δ>max⁡(δ1​(ϵ),δ2​(ϵ))𝛿subscript𝛿1italic-ϵsubscript𝛿2italic-ϵ\\delta>\\max(\\delta_{1}(\\epsilon),\\delta_{2}(\\epsilon)) as defined in (18) (no shared randomness required for this case). This gives the results of the L-PIR model considered in .\nAs the number of messages increases, both upper and lower bounds increase, whereas both decrease with N𝑁N. This happens as increasing N𝑁N increases the number of bits that can be utilized as a side information to retrieve the desired message. On the other hand, increasing K𝐾K adds an overhead on any retrieval scheme to satisfy the privacy by considering the symmetry among downloaded bits from different messages.\nWe observe a similar trend for the multiplicative gap ratio as well. In Figure 3b, we fix the value of the DB privacy leakage to δ=4×10−5𝛿4superscript105\\delta=4\\times 10^{-5}. This choice insures that δ<min⁡(δ1​(ϵ),δ2​(ϵ))𝛿subscript𝛿1italic-ϵsubscript𝛿2italic-ϵ\\delta<\\min(\\delta_{1}(\\epsilon),\\delta_{2}(\\epsilon)) for all ϵ∈[0:10]\\epsilon\\in[0:10] considered in the plots. We note that while increasing K𝐾K does not have significant impact on the bounds, both the download cost and multiplicative gap ratio decrease with N𝑁N. Moreover, we observe that the bounds match when ϵ=0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon=0, i.e., when perfect user privacy is required, and when ϵ→∞→italic-ϵ\\epsilon\\to\\infty, i.e., no user privacy is required. The generality of the AL-PIR problem formulation allows us to recover several existing results on PIR as special cases of Theorems 1 and 2. These cases are discussed in the following remark. From Theorems 1 and 2, the lower and upper bounds on the optimal download cost D∗​(ϵ,δ)superscript𝐷italic-ϵ𝛿D^{*}(\\epsilon,\\delta) for any (ϵ,δ)italic-ϵ𝛿(\\epsilon,\\delta) can be used to derive the following prior results. ∙∙\\bullet    No user privacy and perfect DB privacy (ϵ→∞,δ=δ1​(ϵ→∞)=δ2​(ϵ→∞)=0)formulae-sequence→italic-ϵ𝛿subscript𝛿1→italic-ϵsubscript𝛿2→italic-ϵ0(\\epsilon\\to\\infty,\\delta=\\delta_{1}(\\epsilon\\to\\infty)=\\delta_{2}(\\epsilon\\to\\infty)=0).\nFrom the shared randomness bounds (16) and (18), when ϵ→∞→italic-ϵ\\epsilon\\to\\infty and δ=0𝛿0\\delta=0, we get that α∗​(ϵ→∞,0)=α1​(ϵ→∞,0)=α2​(ϵ→∞,0)=0superscript𝛼→italic-ϵ0subscript𝛼1→italic-ϵ0subscript𝛼2→italic-ϵ00\\alpha^{*}(\\epsilon\\to\\infty,0)=\\alpha_{1}(\\epsilon\\to\\infty,0)=\\alpha_{2}(\\epsilon\\to\\infty,0)=0, i.e., no shared randomness is needed.\nSubstituting the ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon and δ𝛿\\delta values in the download cost bounds (17) and (20), we get DUB​(ϵ→∞,δ=0)=DLB​(ϵ→∞,δ=0)=1superscript𝐷UBformulae-sequence→italic-ϵ𝛿0superscript𝐷LBformulae-sequence→italic-ϵ𝛿01D^{\\text{UB}}(\\epsilon\\to\\infty,\\delta=0)=D^{\\text{LB}}(\\epsilon\\to\\infty,\\delta=0)=1, meaning that\nthe upper and lower bounds are matching and give an optimal download cost of D∗​(ϵ→∞,δ=0)=1superscript𝐷formulae-sequence→italic-ϵ𝛿01D^{*}(\\epsilon\\to\\infty,\\delta=0)=1.
