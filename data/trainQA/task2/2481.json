      "content": "Paper Title: Reinforcement Learning with Formal Performance Metrics for Quadcopter Attitude Control under Non-nominal Contexts\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis paper is based on, and compared with, the following work: Reinforcement learning in control has been advertised, since\n, for the possibility to be more adaptative than classical methods in control such as PIDs. RL’s close relationship with optimal control (the reward function is dual to the objective function) also makes it particularly appealing for applications to control, see e.g. [ref]1. Recently model-based reinforcement learning has been successfully used to train controllers without any initial knowledge of the dynamics and in a data-efficient way. For instance, in , a learning-based model predictive control algorithm has been used to synthesize a low level controller. In , a hybrid approach is proposed, combining the model based algorithm PILCO  and a classic controller like a PD or a LQR controller. In this paper, we focus on model-free algorithms because of their generality and because we have high fidelity models available for quadrotors, such as the crazyflie 2.0 . More specifically we concentrate on actor-critic learning which has undergone massive improvements over the last few years with DDPG , SAC , TD3 , and compare it with the popular PPO method . The high dimensionality of the full Markovian observation space is a challenge for training, prompting for a study of different choices for the sets of states observed by RL: we consider sub-spaces of the full Markovian observation space, where we leave out the states which have the least effect on the dynamics of the quadcopter. This is linked to partially observed Markov Decision Processes and Non Markovian learning, see e.g. . We also study the robustness of our neural nets, as well as the specific training of the neural net controller to be able to handle disturbances (wind gusts, partial motor failures). These issues may be linked to robust MDPs , but we have stuck to the classical (PO)MDP approach here, for which we have a wealth of tools and techniques available. Most papers have been focusing on higher-level control loops, with the notable exception of [ref]15, which serves as the basis of our work.\nWe improve the results of [ref]15 by considering more recent training algorithms (SAC and TD3), finer performance measures, and refined physical models (in particular perturbations due to partial motor failures and wind gusts).\nThe closest other works related to attitude control for quadcopter are , ,  and [ref]19. In , the goal is to stabilize a quadcopter in hover mode, from various initial conditions (including initial angular rates). The authors also consider perturbations to the dynamics, which are more predictable than ours: motor lag and noise on sensors. In , the objective is to control a quadcopter under cyber-attacks targeting its localization sensors (gyroscope and GPS) and motors. The authors consider (partial) motor failure (a limit on its maximal power, just like we do), but not wind gusts. Contrarily to most approaches including ours, their controller combines a classical controller and a neural net. In  the authors discuss the training of a neural net controller for both attitude and position. They observe that it is difficult to train both aspects at the same time, whereas separating control in hover mode (acting mostly on the attitude) and control in position seems to work better. The learning process is based on a full state observation plus the difference with the target state. We extend this work first in discussing the simplification of the observed states, then in more rigorously defining observation metrics for offsets and overshoots. In [ref]19, the author considers neural nets for controlling roll, pitch, yaw rate and thrust, which is similar to the problem we are studying here, and attempts to train the controller such that it can accommodate motor and mass uncertainties within given bounds. In contrast, we deal with uncertainties such as wind gusts and motor failures, following known parametric models. The study of reinforcement learning under temporal logic\nspecifications has gained a lot of interest in recent years.\nIn a discrete and finite state setting, in  a linear-time temporal logics (LTL) property observer automaton\nis composed with the system MDP to allow blocking unsafe actions\nduring training. In   rewards are modulated depending on\nthe observer state, and a model-free approach is proposed\nin  using Limit Deterministic Büchi\nAutomata. Shielding  simultaneously trains an\noptimal controller and a shield that corrects the\nLTL-formula violating actions. The method requires a fully explicit model\nof the environment MDP and builds the product of the orignal MDP with the\nproperty monitor. Later works extend shielding to the continuous\n  and online\n cases, assuming an embeddable\npredictive environment model is available, but only handle simple state invariants. Temporal logics with quantitative\nsemantics such as\nMetric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL)\n, Signal Temporal Logic (STL)\n …, have been studied in relation with\nreinforcement learning. Robust interpretation yields a real number\nindicative of the distance to the falsification boundary. STL has\nseen numerous extensions improving expressiveness and signal classes\n    as\nwell as smooth differentiable semantics   .\nSolutions to well known dimension and magnitude\nmismatch in robust STL interpretation were proposed recently in\n but have not yet been used in a RL\nsetting.\nSTL usages are varied:\nIn\n, Q-learning is used to train a policy maximizing both\nthe probability of satisfaction and the expected robustness of a given STL specification;\nThe approach requires storing previously\nvisited states in the MDP in addition to the original MDP state,\nyielding a high dimensional system and limiting learning\nefficiency.\nIn  the authors derive barrier functions\nfrom robust temporal logic specifications, either to modulate\nrewards during training\nor to control the switch from an optimal and potentially unsafe\ncontroller to a safe backup controller\n0. In summary, existing methods focused on the training phase either suffer\nfrom dimensionality and combinatorial explosion, require expected\nrobustness approximations, or are strongly tied to the\nQ-learning algorithms. Considering our goal is to study a large hyper-parameter space for\ntraining controllers and we need to quantify controller performance rigorously, we used an expressive yet tractable variant of\nSTL  to specify properties and assess trained controllers offline, separately after training. The next steps will be to start\nusing STL-derived reward signals during training on the most promising\narchitectures.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: control such as PIDs. RL’s close relationship with optimal control (the reward function is dual to the objective function) also makes it particularly appealing for applications to control, see e.g. [ref]1.
