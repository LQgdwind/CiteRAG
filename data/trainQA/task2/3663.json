      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Hardware Acceleration of Sparsely Active Convolutional Spiking Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis chapter provides the basis for the hardware implementation of the SNN. The deployment of SNNs is a multi-objective hardware-software co-design effort: the SNN should provide a satisfactory classification result while allowing for fast and energy-efficient processing. An important factor determining the computational performance of SNNs is the neural code. Since recent research suggests\nTTFS-coding to be the most efficient coding scheme [ref]16 , it will be used in this work.\nTo implement TTFS-coding, Rueckauer et al. propose a neuron model where each neuron\ncan fire only a single spike . This is implemented such that a neuron that has already fired cannot fire again. Note that inference on a single\nsample requires multiple forward passes of the SNN. After inference on a sample is is done, the\nentire SNN is reset so that all neurons are able to fire again. This only-spike-once scheme\nrequires a new neuron model since a single spike has to be enough to push a neurons membrane potential above firing threshold. The main modification is the introduction of the membrane potential slope μmsubscript𝜇𝑚\\mu_{m}. This results in a the following system, illustrated in Fig. 2: A neuron output activation x𝑥x evaluates to 1 if the threshold Vtsubscript𝑉𝑡V_{t} is crossed and the last time step that a spike as been fired tspikesubscript𝑡spiket_{\\text{spike}} is at 0 indicating that no spike has been emitted so far. While this only-spike-once methodology results in a very high spike sparsity, it has two inherent\ndownsides: The real-valued membrane potential slope has to be stored for each neuron,\neffectively doubling the memory requirements of the SNN. While μmsubscript𝜇𝑚\\mu_{m} must only be updated when spikes occur, Vmsubscript𝑉𝑚V_{m} of every neuron that has\nreceived a spike must be updated every algorithmic time step as a function of μmsubscript𝜇𝑚\\mu_{m}. These downsides eliminate a lot of advantages of TTFS encoding. To mitigate this, Han and Roy  propose a modified TTFS scheme (further referred to as m-TTFS) that gets rid of μmsubscript𝜇𝑚\\mu_{m} at the cost of a few more spikes. The idea of m-TTFS is that once a neuron has exceeded Vtsubscript𝑉𝑡V_{t} , it emits a spike every algorithmic time step. After a sample has been processed for T𝑇T time steps, the entire SNN is reset and all neurons can fire again. The m-TTFS code leads to the same number of addition operation as the standard TTFS code, but has the advantage that μmsubscript𝜇𝑚\\mu_{m} is not required anymore .\nWhile this m-TTFS encoding reduces spike sparsity compared to standard TTFS-encoding, it is still much more efficient than rate coding\nbecause it reduces the number of forward passes that are required for a single inference by\norders of magnitude . Spikes are inherently discontinuous and non-differentiable. This renders the well established gradient-based backpropagation learning approach used for standard NNs impossible. The training of SNNs is still a very active research are with no established “best practice”. Three major approaches can be identified: Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity: STDP describes a large set of bio-inspired learning rules that share one property: the synaptic weights are adapted depending on the firing time difference between neurons in layer l𝑙l and its preceding layer l−1𝑙1l-1. The basic principle is that the connection strength (=weight) of neurons is increased when they fire together, and that the connection strength is decreased when the time difference between spikes is large . The standard STDP algorithm is unsupervised, i.e. no labeled training data is required. Backpropagation: this class of approaches try to overcome the non-differentiable nature of SNNs in order to enable spike-based backpropagation. Most approaches (a) try to approximate the derivatives to make gradient learning possible , (b) employ differentiable surrogate activations to replace the non-differentiable threshold operation [ref]31 or (c) use a tandem approach where a SNN is performing the prediction and an equivalent standard NN is adapting the weights using backpropagation . Conversion: here the idea is to circumvent the backpropagation problem by training a standard ANN and reusing the trained weights for the SNN. This has the major advantage that the already very mature techniques and toolchains established for standard NNs can be used for training. Deep SNNs trained with conversion methods show the best classification accuracy of all methods discussed here  [ref]24. Here, we use a conversion approach to train the CSNN (see Section VII for details).\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: processing.
