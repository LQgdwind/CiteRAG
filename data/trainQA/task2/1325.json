      "content": "Paper Title: A Comprehensive Study of Deep Video Action Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne of the most important tasks in video understanding is to understand human actions. It has many real-world applications, including behavior analysis, video retrieval, human-robot interaction, gaming, and entertainment. Human action understanding involves recognizing, localizing, and predicting human behaviors. The task to recognize human actions in a video is called video action recognition. In Figure 1, we visualize several video frames with the associated action labels, which are typical human daily activities such as shaking hands and riding a bike. Over the last decade, there has been growing research interest in video action recognition with the emergence of high-quality large-scale action recognition datasets. We summarize the statistics of popular action recognition datasets in Figure 2. We see that both the number of videos and classes increase rapidly, e.g, from 7K videos over 515151 classes in HMDB51 [ref]109 to 8M videos over 3,86238623,862 classes in YouTube8M [ref]1. Also, the rate at which new datasets are released is increasing: 3 datasets were released from 2011 to 2015 compared to 13 released from 2016 to 2020. Thanks to both the availability of large-scale datasets and the rapid progress in deep learning, there is also a rapid growth in deep learning based models to recognize video actions. In Figure 3, we present a chronological overview of recent representative work. DeepVideo [ref]99 is one of the earliest attempts to apply convolutional neural networks to videos. We observed three trends here. The first trend started by the seminal paper on Two-Stream Networks , adds a second path to learn the temporal information in a video by training a convolutional neural network on the optical flow stream. Its great success inspired a large number of follow-up papers, such as TDD , LRCN , Fusion , TSN , etc. The second trend was the use of 3D convolutional kernels to model video temporal information, such as I3D , R3D , S3D , Non-local , SlowFast , etc. Finally, the third trend focused on computational efficiency to scale to even larger datasets so that they could be adopted in real applications. Examples include Hidden TSN , TSM , X3D , TVN , etc. Despite the large number of deep learning based models for video action recognition, there is no comprehensive survey dedicated to these models. Previous survey papers either put more efforts into hand-crafted features   or focus on broader topics such as video captioning , video prediction , video action detection  and zero-shot video action recognition . In this paper: We comprehensively review over 200 papers on deep learning for video action recognition. We walk the readers through the recent advancements chronologically and systematically, with popular papers explained in detail. We benchmark widely adopted methods on the same set of datasets in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. We also release our implementations for full reproducibility111Model zoo in both PyTorch and MXNet: https://cv.gluon.ai/model_zoo/action_recognition.html. We elaborate on challenges, open problems, and opportunities in this field to facilitate future research. The rest of the survey is organized as following. We first describe popular datasets used for benchmarking and existing challenges in section 2. Then we present recent advancements using deep learning for video action recognition in section 3, which is the major contribution of this survey. In section 4, we evaluate widely adopted approaches on standard benchmark datasets, and provide discussions and future research opportunities in section 5.\n\nReference markers found: [109]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]109: We summarize the statistics of popular action recognition datasets in Figure 2.
