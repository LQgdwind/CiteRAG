      "content": "Paper Title: Natural Language Processing Advancements By Deep Learning: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNumerous deep learning architectures have been developed in different research areas, e.g., in NLP applications employing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [ref]30, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) , and more recently, recursive neural networks .\nWe focus our discussion on a review of the essential models, explained in relevant seminal publications. Multi Layer Perceptron:\nA multilayer perceptron (MLP) has at least three layers (input, hidden, and output layers).\nA layer is simply a collection of neurons operating to transform information from the previous layer to the next layer.\nIn the MLP architecture, the neurons in a layer do not communicate with each other.\nAn MLP employs nonlinear activation functions.\nEvery node in a layer connects to all nodes in the next layer, creating a fully connected network (Fig. 1).\nMLPs are the simplest type of Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNNs).\nFNNs represent a general category of neural networks in which the connections between the nodes do not create any cycle, i.e., in a FNN there is no cycle of information flow. Convolutional Neural Networks: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), whose architecture is inspired by the human visual cortex, are a subclass of feed-forward neural networks.\nCNNs are named after the underlying mathematical operation, convolution, which yields a measure of the interoperability of its input functions. Convolutional neural networks are usually employed in situations where data is or needs to be represented with a 2D or 3D data map. In the data map representation, the proximity of data points usually corresponds to their information correlation. In convolutional neural networks where the input is an image, the data map indicates that image pixels are highly correlated to their neighboring pixels. Consequently, the convolutional layers have 3 dimensions: width, height, and depth. That assumption possibly explains why the majority of research efforts dedicated to CNNs are conducted in the Computer Vision field . A CNN takes an image represented as an array of numeric values.\nAfter performing specific mathematical operations, it represents the image in a new output space.\nThis operation is also called feature extraction, and helps to capture and represent key image content.\nThe extracted features can be used for further analysis, for different tasks.\nOne example is image classification, which aims to categorize images according to some predefined classes.\nOther examples include determining which objects are present in an image and where they are located.\nSee Fig. 2. In the case of utilizing CNNs for NLP, the inputs are sentences or documents represented as matrices. Each row of the matrix is associated with a language element such as a word or a character. The majority of CNN architectures learn word or sentence representations in their training phase. A variety of CNN architectures were used in various classification tasks such as Sentiment Analysis and Topic Categorization   [ref]35 .\nCNNs were employed for Relation Extraction and Relation Classification as well  . Recurrent Neural Network: If we line up a sequence of FNNs and feed the output of each FNN as an input to the next one, a recurrent neural network (RNN) will be constructed.\nLike FNNs, layers in an RNN can be categorized into input, hidden, and output layers.\nIn discrete time frames, sequences of input vectors are fed as the input, one vector at a time, e.g., after inputting each batch of vectors, conducting some operations and updating the network weights, the next input batch will be fed to the network.\nThus, as shown in Fig. 3, at each time step we make predictions and use parameters of the current hidden layer as input to the next time step. Hidden layers in recurrent neural networks can carry information from the past, in other words, memory.\nThis characteristic makes them specifically useful for applications that deal with a sequence of inputs such as language modeling , i.e., representing language in a way that the machine understands.\nThis concept will be described later in detail. RNNs can carry rich information from the past.\nConsider the sentence: “Michael Jackson was a singer; some people consider him King of Pop.”\nIt’s easy for a human to identify him as referring to Michael Jackson.\nThe pronoun him happens seven words after Michael Jackson; capturing this dependency is one of the benefits of RNNs, where the hidden layers in an RNN act as memory units.\nLong Short Term Memory Network (LSTM)  is one of the most widely used classes of RNNs.\nLSTMs try to capture even long time dependencies between inputs from different time steps.\nModern Machine Translation and Speech Recognition often rely on LSTMs. Autoencoders: Autoencoders implement unsupervised methods in deep learning.\nThey are widely used in dimensionality reduction333Dimensionality reduction is an unsupervised learning approach which is the process of reducing the number of variables that were used to represent the data by identifying the most crucial information. or NLP applications which consist of sequence to sequence modeling (see Section III-B .\nFig. 4 illustrates the schematic of an Autoencoder.\nSince autoencoders are unsupervised, there is no label corresponding to each input.\nThey aim to learn a code representation for each input.\nThe encoder is like a feed-forward neural network in which the input gets encoded into a vector (code).\nThe decoder operates similarly to the encoder, but in reverse, i.e., constructing an output based on the encoded input.\nIn data compression applications, we want the created output to be as close as possible to the original input.\nAutoencoders are lossy, meaning the output is an approximate reconstruction of the input. Generative Adversarial Networks: Goodfellow [ref]41 introduced Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).\nAs shown in Fig. 5, a GAN is a combination of two neural networks, a discriminator and a generator.\nThe whole network is trained in an iterative process.\nFirst, the generator network generates a fake sample.\nThen the discriminator network tries to determine whether this sample (ex.: an input image) is real or fake, i.e., whether it came from the real training data (data used for building the model) or not.\nThe goal of the generator is to fool the discriminator in a way that the discriminator believes the artificial (i.e., generated) samples synthesized by the generator are real. This iterative process continues until the generator produces samples that are indistinguishable by the discriminator.\nIn other words, the probability of classifying a sample as fake or real becomes like flipping a fair coin for the discriminator.\nThe goal of the generative model is to capture the distribution of real data while the discriminator tries to identify the fake data.\nOne of the interesting features of GANs (regarding being generative) is: once the training phase is finished, there is no need for the discrimination network, so we solely can work with the generation network.\nIn other words, having access to the trained generative model is sufficient. Different forms of GANs has been introduced, e.g., Sim GAN , Wasserstein GAN , info GAN , and DC GAN .\nIn one of the most elegant GAN implementations , entirely artificial, yet almost perfect, celebrity faces are generated; the pictures are not real, but fake photos produced by the network. GAN’s have since received significant attention in various applications and have generated astonishing result .\nIn the NLP domain, GANs often are used for text generation  .\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: Numerous deep learning architectures have been developed in different research areas, e.g., in NLP applications employing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [ref]30, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) , and more recently, recursive neural networks .\nWe focus our discussion on a review of the essential models, explained in relevant seminal publications.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
