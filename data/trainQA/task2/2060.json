      "content": "Paper Title: A Novel Automatic Modulation Classification Scheme Based on Multi-Scale Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe AMC schemes can be classified into two categories, namely, model-driven AMC and data-driven AMC. Specifically, model-driven AMC is to classify the modulation types based on a hypothesis testing or defining specific features while data-driven AMC is to learn features from the data and make the decision. Most of the model-driven classifiers for AMC can be mainly classified into two categories, namely, likelihood-based (LB) classifiers and feature-based (FB) classifiers . The LB classifier treats AMC as a hypothesis testing problem. It calculates the likelihood function under the modulation hypothesis by using the received signal symbols and compares these functions to make the final decision. The FB classifier aims to find better features of the received signals. These two kinds of classifiers have taken the leading positions of AMC over decades since the LB can achieve the optimal solution from the Bayes’ sense while FB can obtain a high reliability for recognizing simple modulation types, such as BPSK and QPSK . However, the LB classifiers have a high computation complexity for estimating unknown parameters  while the performance of the FB classifier is significantly subjected to the quality of the features. Those disadvantages have limited their further applications into more areas. Moreover, model-driven AMC schemes can be only applied to those scenarios where the noise intensity and channel condition are deterministic. However, in practice, noise and channel conditions can be dynamic. Thus, model-driven AMC schemes may not perform very well . In order to overcome those problems, data-driven AMC schemes were proposed . The idea of the data-driven schemes is to use features of the received signals to train the classifiers. The machine learning (ML) based classifiers are first trained well with the collected signals under different modulation schemes, and then are used for the modulation classification of the received signal symbols at the test mode. The ML classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM) , K-nearest neighbor (KNN) , and logistic regression  can be readily applied to unknown scenes after being well-trained. However, these ML-based schemes can only classify the features generated by other methods such as feature engineering in the FB schemes, thus the performance is significantly influenced by the feature generation . With the advancement of computing technologies and the integrated circuits, deep learning with deep layers can “learn” features from the original data and automatically perform classifications by using the classifier layers. The past few years have witnessed the unprecedented success of deep learning represented by convolutional neural network (CNN) in the field of computer vision  and , nature language processing, et al. Compared with the traditional ML-based schemes, deep learning (DL) based schemes, such as CNN  and recurrent neural network (RNN) [ref]17, incorporate feature extraction and classification as an end-to-end pipeline. For AMC, DL-based schemes can be mainly categorized into two classes, namely, CNN models and RNN models. CNN models identify the signal frames as images and extract features by convolutional operations. RNN and its variants such as long short­ term memory (LSTM) have also been utilized to perform AMC for its ability of capturing “memory” information when dealing with time series data, such as sentences and signals. The details for the related existing research works are presented as follows.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: field of computer vision  and , nature language processing, et al.
