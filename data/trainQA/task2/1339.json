      "content": "Paper Title: Event Data Quality: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDechter et al.  introduce temporal constraint satisfaction problem (TCSP),\nwhere variables represent time points and temporal information is represented by a set of unary or binary constraints, each specifying a set of permitting intervals. A temporal constraint can be presented by a set of intervals: According to the different types of the constraint, it represents different meanings:\na unary constraint Tisubscript𝑇𝑖\\mathit{T}_{i} restricting the domain of variable Xisubscript𝑋𝑖\\mathit{X}_{i} represents the disjunction while a binary constraint Ti​jsubscript𝑇𝑖𝑗\\mathit{T}_{ij} constraints the value for distance Xi−Xjsubscript𝑋𝑖subscript𝑋𝑗\\mathit{X}_{i}-\\mathit{X}_{j}, which represents the disjunction A temporal constraint satisfaction problem involves a set of variables, X1,…,Xnsubscript𝑋1…subscript𝑋𝑛\\mathit{X}_{1},\\dots,\\mathit{X}_{n},\nhaving continuous domains, and each variable represents a time point.\nA special time point X0subscript𝑋0\\mathit{X}_{0} represents the beginning of the world, and all times are relative to X0subscript𝑋0\\mathit{X}_{0}.\nTherefore, a unary constraint Xisubscript𝑋𝑖\\mathit{X}_{i} could be treated as a binary constraint X0​isubscript𝑋0𝑖\\mathit{X}_{0i}.\nThe solution of the problem is a tuple X=(x1,…,xn)𝑋subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛\\mathit{X}=(\\mathit{x}_{1},\\dots,\\mathit{x}_{n}) satisfying all the constraints. Figure 3 presents an example temporal constraint network from .\nIt denotes the steps (a.k.a. events, denoted by nodes) that are required in every part design process of a train manufacturer.\nThe temporal network (abstracted from workflow specifications) specifies the constraints on occurring timestamps of events.\nFor instance, the temporal constraint [ref]1 [ref]1  from event 1 (submit) to event 3 (proofread) indicates the minimum and maximum restrictions on the distance (delay) of these two events’ timestamps.\nThat is, event 3 (proofread) should be processed within 30 minutes after event 1 (submit).\nMultiple intervals may also be declared between two events.\nFor instance, [ref]1 , [ref]1 ,  on edge 4→5→454\\rightarrow 5 denote that event 5 (authorize) can be processed after event 4 (examine) either by the department head in 1-10 minutes or by the division head in 30-40 minutes. Consider a corresponding example instance of event trace in Table 3.\nIt records one instance of five steps (events) for processing a part design work, including submit, normalize, proofread, etc.\nEach event is associated with a timestamp on when this event occurred.\nEvents 3 and 1 in t3subscript𝑡3t_{3} and t1subscript𝑡1t_{1} satisfy the temporal constraint, since their timestamp distance 09:25−09:05=20:092509:052009{:}25-09{:}05=20 is in the range of [ref]1 [ref]1 .\nNote that the events are collected from various external sources.\nImprecise timestamps are prevalent, e.g., 23:53 of event 2 (normalize) in t5subscript𝑡5t_{5}, which is delayed until just before midnight owing to latency.\nThe imprecise timestamps are identified as violations of the temporal constraints, such as events 2 and 1 with timestamp distance 23:53−09:05=888>30:235309:058883023{:}53-09{:}05=888>30. Based on temporal constraints, Dechter et al.  present algorithms for performing the following reasoning tasks:\n(1) finding all feasible times that a given event can occur;\n(2) finding all possible relationships between two given events;\n(3) generating one or more scenarios consistent with the information provided.\nSong et al. \nutilize the temporal constraints to repair the erroneous timestamps.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: process of a train manufacturer.\nThe temporal network (abstracted from workflow specifications) specifies the constraints on occurring timestamps of events.\nFor instance, the temporal constraint [ref]1 [ref]1  from event 1 (submit) to event 3 (proofread) indicates the minimum and maximum restrictions on the distance (delay) of these two events’ timestamps.\nThat is, event 3 (proofread) should\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
