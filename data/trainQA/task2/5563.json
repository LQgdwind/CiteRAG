      "content": "Paper Title: Catch Me If You Can: Semi-supervised Graph Learning for Spotting Money Laundering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince ML classifiers do typically expect their input as fixed-length vectors, we employ different unsupervised graph representation learning techniques to generate node embeddings using the Word2vec, Node2vec, Attri2Vec, GraphSAGE, and DGT models that represent the neighbourhood of a node and their relations to the neighbouring nodes. Using Word2vec and Node2Vec, a corpus of text 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is generated by performing uniform random walks starting from each entity in the graph . Then, 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} of edge-labelled random walks are used as the input for learning embeddings of each node using the skip-gram (SG) Word2vec [ref]32 model. From a given a sequence of facts (w1,w2,…,wn)∈𝒞subscript𝑤1subscript𝑤2…subscript𝑤𝑛𝒞(w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{n})\\in\\mathcal{C}, the SG model aims to maximize the average log probability Lpsubscript𝐿𝑝L_{p} according to the context within the fixed-size window [ref]32: where c𝑐c represents a context. To define p​(wn+j|wn)𝑝conditionalsubscript𝑤𝑛𝑗subscript𝑤𝑛p\\left(w_{n+j}|w_{n}\\right), we use negative sampling by replacing log⁡p​(wO|wI)𝑝conditionalsubscript𝑤𝑂subscript𝑤𝐼\\log p\\left(w_{O}|w_{I}\\right) with a function to discriminate target words (wo)subscript𝑤𝑜(w_{o}) from a noise distribution Pn​(w)subscript𝑃𝑛𝑤P_{n}(w) drawing k𝑘k words from Pn​(w)subscript𝑃𝑛𝑤P_{n}(w) : The embedding of a concept c𝑐c occurring in corpus 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is the vector v→ssubscript→𝑣𝑠\\vec{v}_{s} in eq. 3 derived by maximizing eq. 2. Technically both Word2vec and Node2Vec algorithms follow is a 2-step representation learning algorithm: i) using second-order random walks to generate sentences from a graph101010A sentence is a list of node ids. A corpus is the set of all sentences., ii) the corpus is then used to learn an embedding vector for each node in the graph. Each node id is considered a unique word/token in a dictionary that has a size equal to the number of nodes N𝑁N in our graph 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G}. The Attri2Vec model  is trained to learn node representations by performing linear/non-linear mapping on node content attributes. To make the learned node representations respect structural similarity, DeepWalk/Node2Vec learning mechanism is employed to make nodes sharing similar random walk context nodes represented closely in the subspace. For each (target, context) node pair (vi,vj)subscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝑣𝑗\\left(v_{i},v_{j}\\right) from random walks, Attri2Vec learns the representation v→isubscript→𝑣𝑖\\vec{v}_{i} for the target node visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} by using it to predict the existence of context node vjsubscript𝑣𝑗v_{j} based on a three-layer neural network . The representation of a node vi→→subscript𝑣𝑖\\vec{v_{i}} in the hidden layer is then obtained by multiplying its raw content feature vector in the input layer with the input-to-hidden weight matrix Wi​nsubscript𝑊𝑖𝑛W_{in}, followed by an activation function . For a given large set of “positive” (target, context) node pairs generated from random walks and an equally large set of “negative” node pairs that are randomly selected from graph 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} according to a certain distribution, GraphSAGE learns a binary classifier that predicts whether arbitrary node pairs are likely to co-occur in a random walk performed on the graph [ref]14. The GE models we train so far take into consideration only spatial/structural information, thereby not considering temporal information. Therefore, we learn knowledge from such a dynamic graph, with the hypothesis that the anti-money laundering could be benefited from it since DGT is able to couple both spatial- and temporal information capturing simultaneously . Taking into consideration the dynamic nature of the transaction graph, let node v1tsuperscriptsubscript𝑣1𝑡v_{1}^{t} and v2tsuperscriptsubscript𝑣2𝑡v_{2}^{t} be involved in a transfer at time t𝑡t, where their common connections have had several transactions in the previous timestamps. Then, this temporal relation can be represented as u1t−1−u2t−1superscriptsubscript𝑢1𝑡1superscriptsubscript𝑢2𝑡1u_{1}^{t-1}-u_{2}^{t-1} and u1t−2−u2t−2superscriptsubscript𝑢1𝑡2superscriptsubscript𝑢2𝑡2u_{1}^{t-2}-u_{2}^{t-2} . To extract spatial-temporal knowledge, encodings of the nodes are aggregated within a substructure node set into node embeddings. Attention layers are utilized to exchange the information of different nodes, where a single attention layer is represented as follows : where 𝐇(l)superscript𝐇𝑙\\mathbf{H}^{(l)} and 𝐇(l−1)superscript𝐇𝑙1\\mathbf{H}^{(l-1)} is the output embedding for the l𝑙l and (l−1)t​hsuperscript𝑙1𝑡ℎ(l-1)^{th} layer, respectively; d𝑑d is the dimension of node embedding, a​t​t𝑎𝑡𝑡att signifies the self-attention operation; 𝐐(l),𝐊(l),𝐕(l)∈ℝ(τ​(k+2))×dsuperscript𝐐𝑙superscript𝐊𝑙superscript𝐕𝑙superscriptℝ𝜏𝑘2𝑑\\mathbf{Q}^{(l)},\\mathbf{K}^{(l)},\\mathbf{V}^{(l)}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{(\\tau(k+2))\\times d} are the query-, key-, and value matrices for feature transformation and information exchange, respectively that can be represented as : where 𝐖Q(l),𝐖K(l),𝐖V(l)∈ℝd×dsuperscriptsubscript𝐖𝑄𝑙superscriptsubscript𝐖𝐾𝑙superscriptsubscript𝐖𝑉𝑙superscriptℝ𝑑𝑑\\mathbf{W}_{Q}^{(l)},\\mathbf{W}_{K}^{(l)},\\mathbf{W}_{V}^{(l)}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times d} are the learnable parameter matrices of the l𝑙l-th attention layer. In an attention layer, 𝐐(l)superscript𝐐𝑙\\mathbf{Q}^{(l)} and 𝐊(l)superscript𝐊𝑙\\mathbf{K}^{(l)} calculate the contributions of different nodes’ embeddings, while 𝐕(l)superscript𝐕𝑙\\mathbf{V}^{(l)} projects the input into a new feature space that is combined as of eq. 4 to acquire the output embedding of each node by aggregating the information of all nodes adaptively . The input of the transformer module 𝐇(0)superscript𝐇0\\mathbf{H}^{(0)} represents the encoding matrix of the target edge 𝐗​(etgtt)𝐗superscriptsubscript𝑒tgt𝑡\\mathbf{X}\\left(e_{\\mathrm{tgt}}^{t}\\right) by setting d=de​n​c𝑑subscript𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑐d=d_{{enc}} to align the dimension. The output of the final attention layer 𝐇(L)superscript𝐇𝐿\\mathbf{H}^{(L)} is extracted as the output node embedding matrix 𝐙→→𝐙\\mathbf{\\vec{Z}} of the transformer module, where each row represents an embedding vector of a node .\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: random walks starting from each entity in the graph .
