      "content": "Paper Title: Algorithm-assisted discovery of an intrinsic order among mathematical constants\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAt the core of our algorithm lies a novel observation about the greatest common divisors (GCDs) gnsubscript𝑔𝑛g_{n} of the numerators pnsubscript𝑝𝑛p_{n} and denominators qnsubscript𝑞𝑛q_{n} of the convergents of polynomial continued fractions. The convergents are the rational numbers pn/qnsubscript𝑝𝑛subscript𝑞𝑛p_{n}/q_{n} found by truncating an infinite continued fraction. More precisely, if ansubscript𝑎𝑛a_{n} and bnsubscript𝑏𝑛b_{n} are the partial denominators and numerators of a continued fraction respectively (as in the rightmost term of Eq. 2), then These pnsubscript𝑝𝑛p_{n} and qnsubscript𝑞𝑛q_{n} are defined by the recursion un=an​un−1+bn​un−2subscript𝑢𝑛subscript𝑎𝑛subscript𝑢𝑛1subscript𝑏𝑛subscript𝑢𝑛2u_{n}=a_{n}u_{n-1}+b_{n}u_{n-2} with initial conditions p−1=1,p0=a0formulae-sequencesubscript𝑝11subscript𝑝0subscript𝑎0p_{-1}=1,p_{0}=a_{0} and q−1=0,q0=1formulae-sequencesubscript𝑞10subscript𝑞01q_{-1}=0,q_{0}=1.\nThe growth rate of the resulting convergent numerator pnsubscript𝑝𝑛p_{n} and denominator qnsubscript𝑞𝑛q_{n} is a power of a factorial, i.e. pn,qn∼(n!)dsimilar-tosubscript𝑝𝑛subscript𝑞𝑛superscript𝑛𝑑p_{n},q_{n}\\sim(n!)^{d} for some positive integer d𝑑d. See     for additional background on continued fractions. Our algorithm relies on the observation that polynomial continued fractions that converge to mathematical constants exhibit a peculiar behavior: Denoting gn=G​C​D​(pn,qn)subscript𝑔𝑛𝐺𝐶𝐷subscript𝑝𝑛subscript𝑞𝑛g_{n}=GCD(p_{n},q_{n}) as the greatest common divisor of the convergents, the reduced numerator and denominator grow exponentially at most,\ni.e. instead of the much faster factorial growth rate of pnsubscript𝑝𝑛p_{n} and qnsubscript𝑞𝑛q_{n} before reduction. We name this observed property factorial reduction. See our complementary work [ref]34 for additional details about this concept. Factorial reduction is found to be extremely rare: a wide search hints that the space of continued fractions with factorial reduction is a “lower-dimensional” subspace inside the space of all polynomial continued fractions.\nHowever, surprisingly, we observed factorial reduction in every polynomial continued fraction formula found by the Ramanujan Machine using previous algorithms (see Appendix A) for a wide range of constants, including π𝜋\\pi, ζ​(3)𝜁3\\zeta(3), and Catalan’s constant.\nIn fact, we examined formulas converging to these constants in literature spanning over hundreds of years (e.g.,        0  [ref]36).\nInterestingly, all the continued fractions and infinite sums  we checked displayed the property of factorial reduction. The algorithm presented in this work relies on this unexpected, albeit simple property. Concretely, the algorithm numerically tests the growth rate of reduced convergents of polynomial continued fractions,\nsaving the ones that have exponential rates (rather than factorial rates).\nThis approach alleviates the need to identify a limit constant in advance.\nThus, the property of factorial reduction enables efficient identification of continued fractions that converge to mathematical constants.\nFig. 2 displays the test for several polynomial continued fractions, showcasing the efficacy of our algorithm. The concept of factorial reduction not only provides a useful identification tool for formulas of\nconstants but is also a mathematical curiosity on its own [ref]34. This concept is relevant to Apéry-like irrationality proofs , and can help prove the irrationality of other constants (see also the notion of “integer-ating factor” in ).\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: instead of the much faster factorial growth rate of pnsubscript𝑝𝑛p_{n} and qnsubscript𝑞𝑛q_{n} before reduction.
