      "content": "Paper Title: AIM 2024 Challenge on Efficient Video Super-Resolution for AV1 Compressed Content\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRongkang Dong,\nCuixin Yang,\nZongqi He,\nJun Xiao,\nZhe Xiao,\nYushen Zuo,\nZihang Lyu,\nKin-Man Lam\nThe Hong Kong Polytechnic University (POLYU-AISP) The POLYU-AISP team employs a lightweight and efficient method for video super-resolution, named Fast Sequential Motion Diffusion (FSMD). FSMD accelerates the previous recurrent neural network, TMP model , for video super-resolution. The method incorporates Pixel-unshuffle [ref]15 operation to preprocess the input videos, reducing the spatial resolution of the input videos while increasing the channel dimension. This strategy enables FSMD to lower the computational load and reduce the per-frame super-resolution time, thereby achieving real-time video super-resolution. The architecture of FSMD is depicted in Fig. 6. The model processes the video frames recurrently. To reduce the computational cost, we first reduce the spatial resolution of the tùë°t-th low-resolution (LR) frame through the pixel unshuffle operation [ref]15. The tùë°t-th unshuffled frame is then input into the TMP model  for processing. In addition to the LR frame, the network receives the estimated motion field Mt‚àí1subscriptùëÄùë°1M_{t-1} and two hidden states, Ht‚àí10superscriptsubscriptùêªùë°10H_{t-1}^{0} and Ht‚àí11superscriptsubscriptùêªùë°11H_{t-1}^{1}, from the previous (t‚àí1)ùë°1(t-1)-th frame. Here, Ht‚àí10superscriptsubscriptùêªùë°10H_{t-1}^{0} refines the newly diffused motion field, while Ht‚àí11superscriptsubscriptùêªùë°11H_{t-1}^{1} retains the texture information. The network ultimately generates a high-resolution (HR) frame, along with the updated estimated motion field MtsubscriptùëÄùë°M_{t} and the new hidden states, Ht0superscriptsubscriptùêªùë°0H_{t}^{0} and Ht1superscriptsubscriptùêªùë°1H_{t}^{1}. For the Mobile Track (√ó3absent3\\times 3), which upscales videos from 360p to 1080p, we utilize three residual blocks for feature extraction and ten for reconstruction. This configuration allows the model to restore a frame in 13.14 ms with 93.69 GFLOPs. For the Efficient Track (√ó4absent4\\times 4), which scales videos from 540p to 4K, two residual blocks are used for feature extraction and ten for reconstruction. The model requires 32.33 ms and 207.50 GFLOPs to restore a frame. We trained the FSMD model on the LDV3 dataset and the Inter4K dataset. For the LDV3 dataset, HR videos were directly downsampled with the √ó3absent3\\times 3 and √ó4absent4\\times 4 downscaling factors to obtain the LR videos.\nFor the Inter4K dataset, we downsampled and then randomly compressed the HR videos with various compression levels, i.e., CRF=31, 39, 47, 55, 63, to obtain the LR compressed videos.\nSubsequently, we extracted the HR frames and LR frames from the original HR videos and the compressed LR videos, respectively.\nFor each HR frame, we uniformly partitioned it into eight patches, and then applied a center crop to each patch. The resolution of the HR cropped patches is 480√ó480480480480\\times 480. The corresponding LR cropped patches were obtained using the same method, whose resolution is 160√ó160160160160\\times 160 for √ó3absent3\\times 3 or 120√ó120120120120\\times 120 for √ó4absent4\\times 4. This approach ensures a more balanced sampling of different regions within the frames for training.\nFor √ó3absent3\\times 3, the patch size of the HR training sequence was 252√ó252252252252\\times 252. For √ó4absent4\\times 4, the patch size of the HR training sequence was 256√ó256256256256\\times 256.\nEach training sequence contained 15 frames. The batch size was set to 32, and the network was optimized using the Charbonier loss [ref]24 and the Adam optimizer [ref]23 with an initial learning rate of 10‚àí4superscript10410^{-4}, gradually decreasing to 10‚àí6superscript10610^{-6} using the cosine annealing scheme . The total training involved 600,000 iterations. Other experimental settings followed previous work . Table 2 details the training time, the ensemble, the use of extra data, the number of parameters, MACs per frame, and the GPU used for training the FSMD model. Results. A total of 19 videos were used, each downsampled at five different compression levels, resulting in 95 evaluation videos. We calculated the average VMAF, PSNR-Y, and Float-SSIM for all frames within a video and then averaged these metrics across 19 videos with different CRF values and across 95 videos. Table 4 presents the results for both tracks.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: named Fast Sequential Motion Diffusion (FSMD).
