      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Homography Estimation for Dynamic Scenes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHomography estimation is one of the basic computer vision problems . According to multi-view geometry theory,\ntwo images of a planar scene or taken by a rotational\ncamera can be related by a 3×3333\\times 3 homography matrix H: where x^^x\\hat{\\textbf{x}} and x are the homogeneous coordinates of two corresponding points in the two images. Note, the above equation is only valid for corresponding points on static objects. Below we first briefly describe two categories of off-the-shelf algorithms for homography estimation and then discuss the recent deep neural network based approaches. Pixel-based approaches directly search for an optimal homography matrix that minimizes the alignment error between two input images. Various error metrics between two images and parameter searching algorithms, such as hierarchical estimation and Fourier alignment, have been developed to make direct approaches robust and efficient. These direct methods\nare robust to images lacking in texture, but often have difficulty in dealing with large motion. Feature-based approaches are now popular for homography estimation. They\nfirst estimate local feature points using algorithms, such as\nSIFT  and SURF , and then match feature points\nbetween two images. For a video, corner points are often detected and then tracked\nacross two consecutive frames for efficiency [ref]29. Given the set of\ncorresponding feature pairs, an optimal homography matrix\ncan be obtained by solving a least squares problem\nbased on Eq. 1. In practice, errors can occur during\nfeature matching and feature points can come from moving\nobjects. Therefore, a robust estimation algorithm like\nRANSAC  and Magsac  is often used to remove the outliers. The\nperformance of feature-based approaches depends on local\nfeature detection and matching. For images suffering from\nblurriness or lacking in texture, they often cannot work well. Our work is more related to the recent deep learning approaches to homography estimation. In their seminal work, DeTone et al. developed VGG-style deep convolutional\nneural networks for homography estimation. They showed that a deep neural network can effectively compute the homography between two images . Nguyen et al. extended\nthis work by training the neural network using a photometric loss that measures the pixel error between a warped input image and the other one. This photometric loss allows for the unsupervised training of the neural network without ground-truth homographies [ref]26. To deal with the large motion between two images, Nowruzi et al. developed a hierarchical neural network that iteratively refines homography estimation . Chang et al. designed a Lucas-Kanade\nlayer that is able to regress the homography between two\nimages from their corresponding feature maps extracted by\na shared convolutional neural network [ref]8. This Lucas-Kanade network can be cascaded to progressively refine the estimated homography. Zeng et al. developed a perspective field neural network to model the pixel-to-pixel bijection between two images and used that for homography estimation 2. These deep homography estimation approaches are shown successful on images of a static scene; however, they do not consider dynamic scenes. Our multi-scale neural network extends the multi-stage\napproaches discussed above. Compared to Nowruzi et al. , our method starts from low-resolution versions of\nthe input images and gradually increases the input image\nsizes, instead of taking the original input images as input at\neach stage. This makes our method more robust to large motion.\nCompared to Chang et al. [ref]8, our method pre-aligns\nthe input images to the next stage using the homography\nestimated in the previous stage to minimize the global motion.\nThis helps the late-stage network to account for the\nglobal motion. More importantly, we further enhance our\nmulti-scale neural network with a dynamics mask network to handle\ndynamic scenes, which was not considered in the previous\nneural network-based methods.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: algorithms, such as\nSIFT  and SURF , and then match feature points\nbetween two images.
