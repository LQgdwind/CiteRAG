Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

To analyze the resulting strategies produced by the layer-wise relevance propagation method (LRP), the authors of [ref]3 revert to using spectral clustering on the resulting heatmaps in a pipeline they termed ‚ÄôSpRAy‚Äô. This clustering served to receive an overview of the extent of the model‚Äôs decision strategies.\nWe apply SpRAy in a similar way, however, rather than using the raw grad-Cam heatmaps, we perform a discrete Fourier transformation on these beforehand to better differentiate different strategies which we had previously identified from single samples. In detail, the pipeline is as follows Perform a discrete Fourier transform on downsized grad-Cam heatmaps. Using the Euclidean distance for the RGB data and the Cityblock distance for the HS data compute a k-nearest neighbor graph of the Fourier transformed heatmaps, represented as an adjacency matrix, Cùê∂C. Compute the affinity matrix as suggested in  as A=m‚Äãa‚Äãx‚Äã(C,CT)ùê¥ùëöùëéùë•ùê∂superscriptùê∂ùëáA=max(C,C^{T}). Perform an eigengap analysis  to estimate the number of clusters, k, within the dataset. Perform spectral clustering on the affinity matrix, given k from the previous step Perform a t-SNE analysis  on the similarity matrix, estimated from the affinity matrix as in [ref]3 as S=1A+œµùëÜ1ùê¥italic-œµS=\\frac{1}{A+\\epsilon}, whereby œµ‚àà[ref]0 [ref]1italic-œµ01\\epsilon\\in[ref]0 [ref]1, here we used œµ=0.05italic-œµ0.05\\epsilon=0.05.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: model‚Äôs explanations using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (grad-Cam).

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1.
