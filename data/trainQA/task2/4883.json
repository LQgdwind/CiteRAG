Model-free counterparts include:\n(1) SAC , the state-of-the-art in terms of asymptotic performance.\n(2) PPO  that explores monotonic improvement as well.\nModel-based baselines include:\n(3) PETS , which employs models directly for planning, different from the Dyna-style.\n(4) SLBO , that explores monotonicity under the discrepancy bound scheme.\n(5) MBPO , that employs a similar design of model ensemble technique (ensemble of probabilistic dynamics networks) and policy optimization oracle (SAC) as we do.\n(6) AutoMBPO , a variant of MBPO, that uses an automatic hyperparameter controller to tune the model-training frequency but suffers from high pre-training cost and lacks theoretical analysis on parameters rationality. We evaluate CMLO and these baselines on six continuous control tasks in OpenAI Gym [ref]6 with the MuJoCo  physics simulator, including HalfCheetah, Hopper, Walker2d, Swimmer, Ant, Humanoid. For fair comparison, we adopt the standard full-length version of these tasks and align the same environment settings. Figure 1 shows the learning curves of all compared methods, along with the asymptotic performance. These results show that our algorithm is far ahead of the model-free method in terms of sample efficiency, coupled with an asymptotic performance comparable to that of the state-of-the-art model-free counterparts SAC.\nCompared to model-based baselines, our method gains faster convergence speed and better eventual performance. Notably, credit to the event-triggered mechanism, our method enjoys a more stable training curve. The better monotonic property of the learning curve agrees with our previous analyses.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: frequency but suffers from high pre-training cost and lacks theoretical analysis on parameters rationality.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
