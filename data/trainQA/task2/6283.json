      "content": "Paper Title: Permutation Equivariant Graph Framelets for Heterophilous Graph Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNode Classification on Heterophilous Graphs. Early work on node classification includes   , which are some of the earliest examples of spectral and spatial GNNs.\n (GEOM-GCN) is the first article that aims at heterophilous graphs.  proposes a topology augmentation graph convolutional network (TA-GCN) framework under the guidance of an NCC (neighborhood class consistency) metric.  proposes a GNN model called conv-agnostic GNN (CAGNN) to enhance the performance of GNNs on the heterophily datasets by learning the neighbor effect for each node.  proposes a relation-based frequency adaptive GNN (RFA-GNN) that can adaptively pick up signals of different frequencies in each corresponding relation space in the message-passing process. 2 identifies a set of key designs that boost learning under heterophily.  proposes to convert the input graph into a computation graph with proximity and structural information so as to counter the limit imposed by node-level assortativity (homophily).  introduces a new generalized PageRank to jointly optimize node feature and topological information extraction, regardless of homophily or heterophily.  proposes two novel fully differentiable and inductive rewiring layers to mitigate the problems of over-smoothing, over-squashing, and under-reaching on both homophilous and heterophilous graphs.  adopts a homophily-oriented deep heterogeneous graph rewiring method to increase the meta-paths subgraph homophily ratio, which helps improve the performance of heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) on heterophilous graphs. In , a random-edge dropping mechanism for increasing heterophily of graphs is proposed, aiming at enhancing fairness in GNNs’ predictions. We refer to  for a comprehensive review of graph neural networks for graphs with heterophily. Multi-hop Aggregation in GNNs. Papers of   2  are GNNs that adopt hidden layer concatenation and multi-hop aggregation and involve the powers of adjacency matrices. Thus, they resemble each other in terms of neural network architecture. The difference is that   mainly deal with homophilous datasets. On the other hand, with emphasis on the heterophilous setting, 2 theoretically shows the importance of concatenation of aggregation beyond the 1-hop neighborhood, with an addition on the importance of ego- and neighbor-embedding separation. Such a non-local neighborhood aggregation is also emphasized in  . The current state-of-the-art model FSGNN, i.e., Feature Selection GNN , is different from the previous ones by, in our interpretation, viewing the semi-supervised setting as a supervised setting in which multi-hop aggregation is regarded as input of different feature channels from different hops and were not applied in the following layers. As a result, its network architecture basically consists of a mix-hop  layer and fully-connected layers with attention weights for different channels being applied before the concatenation. It is worth mentioning that a recent work  on large-scale heterophilous node classification is very similar to , in which input channels were limited to the 00-hop and the 111-hop. Graph Wavelets/Framelets. Papers of   6 7 8 [ref]24   are work of graph wavelets/framelets in which 6 8 are spectral-type and the rest are Haar-type. A framelet system differs from the classical (orthogonal) wavelet system by being a frame in a Hilbert space and offering redundant representation. The Haar-type wavelet system in  is defined for different nodes as centers.  7 [ref]24   define graph wavelets/framelets under a given tree and they differ in the interpretation and generation of the tree.  applies to trees from graphs. In 7, the tree is represented as a filtration on [ref]0 01[ref]0 , and the wavelet system is equivalent to an orthogonal basis of tree polynomials. Similar to 7, the trees are further generalized to hierarchical partitions of [ref]0 2superscript012[ref]0 ^{2} in [ref]24 and apply to directed graphs, and a Haar-type wavelet system for directed graphs is thus constructed.  further generalizes the work in [ref]24  by considering the constructions of Haar-type framelet systems on any compact set in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} under a given hierarchical partition and adapt the construction of directed graph framelets to such cases.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: a recent work  on large-scale heterophilous node classification is very similar to , in which input channels were limited to the 00-hop and the 111-hop.
