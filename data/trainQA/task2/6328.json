      "content": "Paper Title: Fast Diffusion Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDiffusion Models (DMs) [ref]3  [ref]5 show impressive generative capability in modeling complex data distribution such as the synthesis of image  , speech   , and video   .\nHowever, their slow and costly training and sampling pose significant challenges in broadening their applications. Thus, existing remedies such as loss reweighting   and neural network refinement  5 focus on reducing the training cost, while distilled training 6 7 and efficient samplers 8 9 target at fewer sampling steps. Despite their efficacy, they are essentially post-hoc modifications and do not delve into the inherent mechanism of DMs: diffusion process, which can accelerate both training and sampling fundamentally. Our first contribution is a novel perspective on the diffusion process of DMs through the lens of stochastic optimization. We find that the forward diffusion process 𝐱t+1=αt​𝐱t+βt​ϵtsubscript𝐱𝑡1subscript𝛼𝑡subscript𝐱𝑡subscript𝛽𝑡subscriptitalic-ϵ𝑡\\mathbf{x}_{t+1}=\\alpha_{t}\\mathbf{x}_{t}+\\beta_{t}\\epsilon_{t} (ϵt∼𝒩​(0,𝐈)similar-tosubscriptitalic-ϵ𝑡𝒩0𝐈\\epsilon_{t}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\mathbf{I})) coincides with stochastic gradient descent (SGD)  in optimizing a stochastic time-variant function f​(𝐱)=12​𝔼ζ∼𝒩​(0,b​𝐈)​∥𝐱−βt1−αt​ζ∥22𝑓𝐱12subscript𝔼similar-to𝜁𝒩0𝑏𝐈superscriptsubscriptdelimited-∥∥𝐱subscript𝛽𝑡1subscript𝛼𝑡𝜁22f(\\mathbf{x})=\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{E}_{\\zeta\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,b\\mathbf{I})}\\lVert\\mathbf{x}-\\frac{\\beta_{t}}{1-\\alpha_{t}}\\zeta\\rVert_{2}^{2}.

We will detail the connection in Section 4.1. Our second contribution is the development of a novel Fast Diffusion Model (FDM), which accelerates DMs by incorporating momentum SGD  into the diffusion process. At the t𝑡t-th update, momentum SGD not only utilizes a gradient but also an additional momentum (𝐱t−𝐱t−1)subscript𝐱𝑡subscript𝐱𝑡1(\\mathbf{x}_{t}-\\mathbf{x}_{t-1}). This momentum accumulates all previous gradients, providing a more stable descent direction compared to the single gradient 𝐠tsubscript𝐠𝑡\\mathbf{g}_{t} used in SGD. Consequently, it effectively reduces solution oscillation, resulting in faster convergence than traditional SGD in both theory and practice   . Thanks to the equivalence in Eq. (1), in Section 4.2, we are motivated to add the momentum to the forward diffusion process of DMs for faster convergence to the target distribution: where γ>0𝛾0\\gamma>0 is a constant that controls the weight of momentum. Adding the momentum also accelerates the reverse process, i.e., DM sampling, since the reverse process is determined by the forward process and thus gains the same acceleration. Therefore, adding the momentum can accelerate both training and sampling. However, as we will discuss in Section 4, the crucial perturbation kernel p​(𝐱t|𝐱0)𝑝conditionalsubscript𝐱𝑡subscript𝐱0p(\\mathbf{x}_{t}|\\mathbf{x}_{0}) that is required for efficient training and sampling cannot be easily derived by the momentum-based diffusion process in Eq. (2). To this end, we leverage recent advances in DMs to convert this discrete diffusion process to its continuous form [ref]2, thereby deriving an analytical solution for the perturbation kernel (Section 4.2).\nSo far, we can plug the momentum diffusion process of Eq. (2) into several popular and effective diffusion models, including VP , VE , and EDM [ref]2, and build our corresponding FDM (Section 4.3). Extensive experimental results in Section 5 show that for representative and popular DMs, including EDM, VP and VE, our FDM greatly accelerates their training process by about 2×2\\times, and improves their sample generation process by about 3×3\\times. For example, as shown in Figure 1(a), on three datasets, our EDM-FDM uses about half the training cost (million training samples, Mimg) to achieve similar image synthesis performance of EDM. Moreover, for the sample generation process, EDM-FDM achieves similar performance as EDM by using about 1/3131/3 inference cost in Figure 1(b).\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Diffusion Models (DMs) [ref]3  [ref]5 show impressive generative capability in modeling complex data distribution such as the synthesis of image  , speech   , and video   .\nHowever, their slow and costly training and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
