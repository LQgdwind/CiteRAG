Driven by similar motivation of robust revenue maximization, however in a different setting of contract (rather than auction) design, Duetting et al.  study the worst-case optimal contract in a principal-agent setting where only the expected rewards from the agent’s actions to the principal are known (rather than the full reward distributions). Their identification of linear contracts as optimal in this sense once again features the same properties of simplicity, computational efficiency, and agnosticism to the hidden information.555Earlier work of  gives a different sense in which linear contracts are max-min optimal, one that does not share this property of being agnostic to the unknown component. These works on robust mechanism design fit within a broader research agenda of robust optimization, which has been studied in Operations Research tracing back to the classic paper of Scarf . This approach has been applied to mechanism design, among other domains . Within computer science, robust design ties in to “beyond worst-case” analysis approaches 4, and in particular to semi-random models .\nFrom this perspective, we study a semi-random model in which one aspect of the model (the item values) is randomly\ndrawn, whereas another (the correlation among values) is adversarially chosen.\nHybrid models such as these are gaining traction in recent years, in part due to their power to explain why certain algorithmic methods work better than expected. Most of the work on mechanism design for a unit-demand buyer has been in the standard Bayesian model.\nIf there is only a single item for sale, Myerson 2 characterizes the revenue-optimal mechanism, which for a single buyer (see also 3) amounts to simply setting the monopoly price for the item (the price that maximizes the expected revenue given the item’s value distribution). For the case of a single unit-demand buyer with a product distribution over item values,\nChen et al. [ref]16 show that computing a revenue-optimal pricing is NP-hard, even for identical distributions with support size 333 (but can be solved in polynomial time for distributions of support size 222).\nChawla et al.   give a constant factor approximation for the optimal pricing, which applies also with respect to the optimal randomized mechanism (i.e., pricing lotteries) by the observation that pricing lotteries cannot increase revenue by more than a factor of 444 in the case of product distributions .\nCai and Daskalakis   give an additive PTAS for the case of bounded distributions, and also derive structural properties of the optimal solution for special cases.\nAmong other properties, they show that if the buyer’s values are independently distributed according to MHR distributions, then constant approximation can be obtained with a single price (which can be efficiently computed). Moreover, if values are also identically distributed, then a single price yields near-optimal revenue. For the case of correlated distributions, Briest and Krysta  show that the optimal pricing problem does not even admit a polynomial-time constant approximation.\nIt has been also shown that, unlike product distributions, pricing lotteries over items can increase the revenue (beyond item pricing) by a factor of log⁡(n)𝑛\\log(n) [37; 7]. Finally, another popular fairly recent line of research that builds upon the Bayesian setting by having the seller only have partial information about the underlying distribution (but keeping the optimal auction for the underlying distribution as the benchmark) is that of revenue maximization from samples, where the seller is shown samples from the underlying distribution rather than the whole distribution . Within this context, for pricing for a unit-demand buyer see 1, and for revenue maximization for a unit-demand buyer see .\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: for the item (the price that maximizes the expected revenue given the item’s value distribution).
