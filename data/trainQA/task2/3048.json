      "content": "Paper Title: UET-Headpose: A sensor-based top-view head pose dataset\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this chapter, we will present in detail the approach to solving the above problem. First, in section 3.1, we will introduce the new approach for the face orientation data acquisition, the overall architecture of the new approach in Fig. 1, we have seven main phases, with the beginning is the process of wearing sensor for humans, and we have annotated data in the final phase. Then, section 3.2 will analyze the new dataset and present a baseline model for head pose estimation 360∘superscript360360^{\\circ} for security cameras. A new model is called FSANet-Wide, and using this model with a new dataset UET-Headpose-train and two other datasets. Structure Design\nWe propose a new dataset called UET-Headpose with the advantages of background richness, overcoming the disadvantages of the head pose dataset extracted from the CMU Panoptic dataset [ref]7 while ensuring the distribution of yaw angle is uniform in the range [−179,179]179179[-179,179] degrees. Moreover, our proposed setup is very efficient for carrying in real life. The UET-Headpose dataset was created to capture the head pose of annotated people in many conditions with a wide yaw range and top view security cameras. The system includes a head-mounted sensor module, an arduino aboard, a surveillance camera, a chin rest for fixing the head, and a server to control, store and process data. In this paper, the surveillance camera used is HIK Vision 4 MP ColorVu Fixed Bullet Network Camera (DS-2CD2T47G1-L). The surveillance camera is placed high with an inclination angle as zero-point compared to the fixed face 62.45862.45862.458, −35.60135.601-35.601 and −8.0968.096-8.096 for roll, pitch, yaw angle, respectively. This result is found by experimentally measuring the deflection angle between the plane parallel to a chin rest and the surveillance camera through the sensor. Firstly, the sensor is fixed to a plane of the rectangular box and is guaranteed to be perpendicular to the four surrounding planes. Then, the rectangular box is placed on a plane parallel to the support in the yaw, pitch, roll direction. The chin rest is attached directly to the edge of the table. The design of the chin rest [ref]21 includes 02 table legs, 02 fixed pivot bars, 01 adjustable height forehead support bar, 01 adjustable height chin rest bar, 01 adjustable depth chin rest, and 02 fixed bars sensor. Notably, the two fixed axles use 3030 aluminum profiles. The rest of the parts are 3D printed in 105 hours. The phase “Fixed face on the head” in Fig. 1 shows the chin rest and the way to locating the head of people on that. The head-mounted sensor module equipment for recording the head’s angle value includes the 9-axis smart sensor MCU-055, the Arduino board WeMos D1 R2, a 10000 mAh battery, an ear hook, and wires. The device is designed to ensure optimal speed and increase certainty to limit sensor slippage and signal loss. The system also includes one management computer for storage and processing data. Transmit angle data from board to server The sensor is connected to the Arduino board Wemos D1 R2 with the I2C protocol. The advantages of the I2C protocol simplicity and high reliability. The I2C protocol uses a clock line (SCL) transmitted at 100kHz and 400kHz, two wires GND and VCC, are responsible for stabilizing and supplying current to the sensor.\nThe Arduino board Wemos D1 R2 is used due to the built-in 2.4 GHz Wifi router. The data from the sensor will be transmitted to the Arduino board continuously with a maximum frequency of 100 Mhz. The Arduino board captures data and transmits it to the computer via the MQTT  protocol. The Arduino circuit has been directly integrated with the wifi router so that sensor information will be transmitted to the management computer via wifi to the MQTT  broker built on the management computer. The Arduino circuit receives the signal from the sensor through 4 wires SCL, SDA, GND, and VCC. This information has been completely processed at the sensor, so the Arduino board will only receive and read yaw angles, pitch angles, and roll angles from the sensor and send it to the MQTT  broker. Every 0.040.040.04s, the Arduino board will send data to the computer once in a JSON file, including information fields: time, x, y, z, where time is the time to record data from the sensor, obtained directly through the server pool.ntp.org. Three values x, y, z correspond to 3 information yaw, pitch, roll returned by the sensor. The computer that stores and processes the data will continuously receive information from the sensor but selectively record it when the manager chooses. Based on the uploaded JSON file timer, the computer will request the camera the corresponding frame. We use this camera to provide images with a resolution of 268826882688 × 152015201520, 60Hz: 252525fps, 4mm focal length. These frames will be manually labeled before being fed into the final training model. The labeling tool that we use is called “Eva.” [ref]20 The advantage of this tool is that it is light, simple to deploy, and use because it is packaged into a complete docker. Sensors We use an angle sensor to record poses. Many types of sensors are used on the market that can be combined with an Arduino board, such as GY-50, MPU-6050, MPU-9250, MCU-055, …\nSensor MCU-055 is a sensor developed by Bosch. In addition to integrating nine axes like the MPU-9250 sensor, sensor MCU-055 integrates a microprocessor responsible for combining parameters from the sensor, gyro, accelerometer, and magnetic field direction sensor. It returns absolute angular direction (Eulerian vector, 100Hz sampling frequency) as triaxial data based on the 360-degree sphere through a 32-bit microcontroller running BSX3.0 FusionLib software developed by Bosch. The raw data has been wholly preprocessed with algorithms and gives the final stable angular direction result. Design board for wearing on head The extended board consists of main parts: a sensor, an ear hook, an Arduino board, a battery, and all kinds of wires. The sensor will be fixed through the face hook through a soft steel wire to align the sensor to each face, but still, make sure to keep the sensor fixed after alignment without tilting or deviating. After experimenting with many different types of wire, the soft steel wire used to fix the face hook is 1mm non-steel wire. Larger steel wires will be, but adjusting the sensor angle will be difficult, and conversely with smaller wires will not guarantee to hold the sensor firmly. However, the face hook version no. 1 using steel wire has the disadvantage of fine-tuning the sensor due to the elastic force of the steel wire. So the second version is made by 3D printing method was developed with the advantages: possible to adjust the directions through 3 rotating axes, no elastic phenomenon like steel wire. The face hook version no. 1 includes a soft steel wire responsible for fixing the sensor and ear hook. The sensor will be fixed to align the sensor to each face, but still, keep the sensor fixed after alignment without tilting or deviating. The image in block “Secure the sensor device” of Fig.1 shows the way the sensor is attached on the head of a person. The ear hook is responsible for attaching tightly to the ear and keeping it fixed to the sensor. The first version of the hook is made entirely of soft silicone imported from abroad, it has the advantage of being soft and light. However, the ear attachment is not fixed because it has not yet adhered to the ear. Therefore, a 2mm steel thread was used by parallelizing the ear hooks through the soft black adhesive tape to overcome this shortcoming. With this additional steel wire, each time the sensor is attached, it can be easily adjusted to suit each person’s ears. When adding a steel wire, the ear hook was firmly attached around the ear, but it was still slightly shaken when tested. This vibration error is identified because the upper end of the ear hook is not firmly attached to the fulcrum in the ear. So a foam cotton pad using PE Foam material was used. This sponge will tightly cushion the inside of the ear combined with the previously existing thin rim to form a solid structure, minimizing the vibration of the sensor. Server The management computer is used for annotating data will have the following tasks: Create an MQTT  broker to act as an intermediary between the sensor and the Arduino board, a system for receiving and storing, and processing data, an Eva labeling tool. The pipeline head pose and image data synchronization for the server is illustrated in Fig.2 The data receiving and processing system is responsible for storing the packets that the MQTT  broker requires the manager. The frames corresponding to the timestamps in the packet returned by the server and storing the data included raw images, head pose labels, and face position labels. The data acquisition system is coded using python language, including two separate processing threads for collecting data from sensors and managing received data. The receiver stream will run continuously 24/24242424/24 as soon as the system is turned on. The received data management flow will be displayed as a terminal, switching between two data recording modes and non-data recording. When the system receives information from the MQTT  broker as a sensor result (JSON file containing time, yaw, pitch, roll fields) by default, the information will not be stored. However, when the data storage computer administrator switches to information storage mode, the system records information from the sensor to a log file. Each line corresponds to the information from the JSON file. After having a log file containing information about the face orientation of the labeled person, the system will automatically retrieve the corresponding frames through the camera’s API. Since the surveillance camera only provides an API to playback saved video, view live video, and get the live snapshot, the method used to retrieve frames is to get a datum of the video start frame ( corresponding to the first frame in the log file), get the video from that point. Then, the time of the following frames will be calculated based on the FPS and the sequence number of that frame. The camera used has an FPS frequency of 252525 frames per second, so the number of packets sent by the sensor per second is chosen to be 252525, so there will be a difference between the frame time and the packet time. Therefore, the message is a maximum interval of 0.040.040.04 seconds. Cost advantage The method of collecting BIWI dataset and CMU panoptic dataset requires investment in at least one 3D camera , or ten 3D cameras, 480 VGA videos, 31 HD videos [ref]7, so the cost of implementing this data acquisition system can be very expensive. It can be up to US$5000 accompanied by a complicated installation and deployment process. Our face-to-face receivers are designed for simplicity and ease of deployment, including components: one sensor, one small 3d-printed system, the ear hook, and a 2D camera. These are very available components and easily obtainable for less than US$150. Easy to deploy and install anywhere with a variety of environments. In Fig.4, we describe differences between our proposed dataset and available dataset.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Design\nWe propose a new dataset called UET-Headpose with the advantages of background richness, overcoming the disadvantages of the head pose dataset extracted from the CMU Panoptic dataset [ref]7 while ensuring the distribution of yaw angle is uniform in the range [−179,179]179179[-179,179] degrees.
