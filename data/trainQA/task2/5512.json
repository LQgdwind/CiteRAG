      "content": "Paper Title: One Transformer for All Time Series: Representing and Training with Time-Dependent Heterogeneous Tabular Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDespite the success of Deep Learning methods in different areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as, for instance, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Audio Processing, Robotics, etc., the use of deep networks to represent tabular data is so far largely under explored.\nHowever, tabular data have a large application interest, since many public institutions or commercial/industrial companies represent their knowledge using datasets of “tables” . For instance, bank data, clinical data, commercial data, etc., are often provided as a list of attributes (field names) and corresponding values (field values) for each represented entity (sample).\nAs reported in [ref]2,\nover 65%percent6565\\% of the datasets in the Google Dataset Search platform contain tabular files in either CSV or XLS formats.\nParticularly interesting is the case of financial transactions, which, for instance, describe the sequence of (time dependent) transactions of a given bank client on her/his bank account.\nHowever, most of the Machine Learning approaches for predictive tasks in these scenarios are usually still based on pre-Deep Learning techniques, such as Gradient Boosted Decision Trees  [ref]4 . One of the reasons why Deep Learning is still under explored with tabular data\nis the lack of large scale publicly available datasets, often due\nto commercial or privacy constraints (e.g., in the financial domain).\nHowever, another important reason is the heterogeneity of these data, which are different from, e.g., texts or images and make their uniform representation and training challenging.\nIn fact, while an image is composed of a set of (numerical) pixel values and a textual sentence is a list of (categorical) words, tabular data are usually composed of heterogeneous attributes, in which numerical features (e.g., the transaction amount) are mixed with categorical features (e.g., the category of the transaction receiver or the transaction type).\nThus, it is not clear how different types of features should be jointly represented, and what kind of objective function should be optimized during training to cover all the data types.\nMoreover, a second source of heterogeneity comes from the necessity to represent\ntime sequences composed of rows with a variable internal structure. For instance, a “Point Of Sale” (POS) transaction includes a field describing the locality of the payment, which is not included in other transaction types made from the same bank account and included in the same time series. In this paper, we propose a unified architecture based on modern Transformers [ref]5 to simultaneously and uniformly deal with all these representation problems. Specifically, inspired from TabBERT , we use a hierarchical architecture to represent the time series dynamics. The hierarchy is composed of two levels, the first of which represents a single tabular row (e.g., a specific transaction), while the second represents a sequence of temporally dependent rows. This two-level hierarchy is a common solutions in, e.g., video processing, where each single frame is independently embedded using a still image Transformer and the sequence of frames is then passed to a second Transformer .\nWe empirically show that this solution makes it possible to represent\ntime series of more than one hundred rows.\nHowever, differently from TabBERT and other similar hierarchical approaches, we introduce the following methodological novelties. First, we modify the hierarchical network proposed in  to uniformly and efficiently represent tabular rows with different types. Taking the financial transaction case as an example, a POS transaction corresponds to a table row with a set of fields different from an ATM transaction. We introduce a type-dependent embedding interface between the two levels of the hierarchy which projects each row type into a fixed-dimension vector fed to the second level. This interface extends the common look-up table of initial token embeddings used in Transformer networks [ref]5 and it faces a problem not yet considered in the literature, i.e., how to deal with time series composed of structurally different types of consecutive rows. Second, inspired by the numerical representation adopted, for instance, in NeRFs  for 3D synthesis, we represent each numerical value as a feature vector obtained by the concatenation of a battery of different frequency functions. The motivation behind this choice comes from the observation that deep networks are biased towards learning low frequency functions , while the scalar value of a specific tabular field undergoes to a high frequency variation. Thus, similarly to the coordinate embedding adopted in NeRFs, we transform each numerical value using a set of frequency functions.\nNote that this encoding is used to represent a specific field value and not to represent the field position as with the Positional Encoding used in Transformers [ref]5. Third, we adopt a unified objective function\nfor all the feature types based on the standard Masked Token pretext task 0, which avoids the need to tune loss specific weights.\nHowever, since, in our framework, the numerical features are not represented as discrete tokens,\nin order to use a Masked Token task for a numerical input, we propose to decouple the numerical feature representation from the target used during the self-supervised training of the network. Specifically, inspired by BEiT 1, where\na discrete VAE 2 is used to quantize image patches and extract a discrete token for each of them, we similarly quantize the numerical features using a predifined set of bins, and then we use this quantization as the target token.\nNote that the discretized value is the target label associated with a numerical value, but it is not used as input to the network. Finally, we use a standard label smoothing 3 for the categorical feature tokens and we propose Neighborhood label smoothing for the numerical feature targets. The latter is based on the intuitive idea that numerical feature values, once discretized, still preserve a total order relation over the elements of the quantized vocabulary, thus, differently from pure categorical features, a small neighborhood of the original value can be computed and used to focus the label smoothing on the most informative part of the value range of that feature. We call our network Unified Transformer for Time-Dependent Heterogeneous Tabular Data (UniTTab), and we show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches based on both Deep Learning and more standard Machine Learning techniques for time series of tabular data, often with a large margin. In our experiments, we use different common benchmarks and we additionally use a private dataset we collected in collaboration with a private financial institute.\nIt is a dataset composed of millions of real\nbank account transactions spanning over 2 years, and it\nrepresents a real life scenario, in which\nthe transaction history of a given account is highly variable and with an heterogeneous internal structure.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: bank data, clinical data, commercial data, etc., are often provided as a list of attributes (field names) and corresponding values (field values) for each represented entity (sample).\nAs reported in [ref]2,\nover 65%percent6565\\% of the datasets in the Google Dataset Search platform contain tabular files in either CSV or XLS formats.\nParticularly interesting is the case of financial transactions,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
