One popular choice is Medial Axis Transformation (MAT). The MAT skeleton is defined as the locus of the centers of all maximally inscribed circles (in the 2D domain) or spheres (in the 3D domain). Plenty of MAT literature exist for different geometric\nentities: the 2D/3D binary ones , the planar curve , the point clouds , and the mesh [ref]6. These methods are computationally intensive, numerically unstable excepting the work for planar curve , and are sensitive to boundary perturbations. In addition to the distance transformation property, rotation traits are used in . The curve skeleton is discovered by finding a rotational symmetry axis (ROSA) for an oriented point cloud. They propose an iterative planar cuts method to find the optimal ROSA plane. This method is extended by  to the mesh. They use the ROSA method to find a general cylinder decomposition and partial curve skeleton given a polygon mesh. However, these methods are also time-consuming, and the extracted curve skeleton is not ready for animation.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: circles (in the 2D domain) or spheres (in the 3D domain).

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
