      "content": "Paper Title: Brain-Inspired Computational Intelligence via Predictive Coding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn computational neuroscience, early formulations of active inference were based on equipping PC with reflexes in order to simulate a variety of behaviors; ranging from handwriting and its observation , through oculomotor control   to communication  . This application of PC rests on the simple observation that perception and action are in the service of minimizing variational free energy, and action can be cast as minimizing (proprioceptive) prediction errors by changing (sensory) data. Machine learning implementations of PC are now starting to move beyond classification and generative modeling of static images to address dynamic control and reinforcement learning  [ref]135 [ref]136. Active NGC (ANGC) [ref]136 and active PC (ActPC)  formulate active inference in terms of predictive processing, much in contrast to machine learning implementations with deep neural networks trained via backprop. ANGC focused on a simple modular agent design, implementing a policy circuit and a generative transition dynamics that learned from sparse reward feedback by using the transition dynamics to produce a dynamically normalized epistemic signal that promoted intelligent exploration. ActPC builds on ANGC by implementing a policy circuit, an actor circuit, a generative transition dynamics circuit, and a prior preference circuit, further exploring how the temporal processing ability of each NGC component could be improved by integrating a simple form of working memory into the neural dynamics. ActPC and ANGC have been empirically shown to work well on standard reinforcement learning control problems and, more importantly, in the context of (simulated) robotic control , of which results for general PC also exist [ref]138  . Parallel (independently developed) and homonym frameworks include active PC (APC)  and active PC networks (APCNs) , developed to learn part-whole hierarchies from natural images (tackling the difficult part-whole and reference frames learning problems), resulting in an interesting model of active, internally directed perception, i.e, the neural circuitry actively samples the natural image space to extract information for crafting internal representations. Notably, the more general APC model of  further offered a potential means of tackling the integrated state-action hierarchy learning problem, conducting a form of hierarchical reinforcement learning. The APC model was applied to a multi-room grid-world and was shown to work well. However, APC/APCNs utilize backprop in portions of their underlying architectures, having to train/adapt locally deep MLPs and recurrent networks (and deep hyper-networks) in order to obtain a desirable performance. ActPC, in contrast, rigidly commits to the principle of locality in terms of both inference and learning. Beyond control agent design, a cognitive architecture known as the COGnitive Neural GENerative system (CogNGen)  , built on the ideas inherent to ActPC, has been proposed for tackling reinforcement learning problems. CogNGen instantiates elements of the Common Model of Cognition  and combines NGC with hyperdimensional / vector-symbolic models of human memory, implementing a module for the motor cortex, procedural memory, working memory neural buffers, and episodic declarative memory. CogNGen has been shown to perform well on maze-like exploration tasks  , including those that require maintaining memory within and across episodes.\n\nReference markers found: [135]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]135: (sensory) data.
