      "content": "Paper Title: Optimizing Foundation Model Inference on a Many-tiny-core Open-source RISC-V Platform\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the last few years, the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has seen a paradigm shift towards transformer-based models such as Large Language Models [ref]1, Vision Transformers , and, more in general, Foundation Models [ref]3.\nTransformer-based FMs are large-scale models based on the so-called attention mechanism , trained on enormous generic datasets in a self-supervised fashion. FMs can then be fine-tuned to perform specialized downstream tasks [ref]5.\nThe big breakthrough in FMs came with the Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT), which exploited the transformer architecture for question-answering problems with natural language.\nAfter the immense success of GPT-3 , transformer-based FMs have then been adapted to all aforementioned domains, with models such as ViTs  for computer vision or Whispers  for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). The broad adoption of FMs makes their efficient execution a high-priority target.\nHowever, the computational patterns at the core of attention layers, i.e., the fundamental building blocks of FMs, exhibit several key bottlenecks.\nFor each input element, these layers compute an attention score with respect to every other input obtained through a Softmax-normalized dot-product operation . Attention complexity scales quadratically with the input sequence length, limiting both the practical size of the models and the length of the inputs they can handle.\nMoreover, the internal Softmax is crucial for normalizing the attention scores to a pseudo-probabilistic distribution, but it introduces significant computational challenges. Namely, the computation of exponentials for each attention score prior to normalization can be expensive and susceptible to numerical stability issues, particularly under large-scale or low-precision arithmetic conditions. At the algorithmic level, these bottlenecks can be addressed with innovations such as sparse and linearized attention mechanisms  , as well as approximations and alternatives to the Softmax function . All these approaches aim to mitigate the computational overhead and enhance the model’s capacity to handle longer sequences more effectively, thereby extending the practical applications of FMs without compromising their performance. On the HW side, a variety of platforms have been engineered from scratch or enhanced to provide the computational power and memory requirements essential for supporting this new class of models.\nThe most commonly used hardware platforms to train and run FMs are graphics processing units (GPUs), such as NVIDIA’s A100 and H100  , coupled with efficient software libraries to limit memory transfers and efficiently distribute the workload.\nIn a quest to surpass the efficiency of GPUs and primarily address the inference workloads, many new companies have focused on designing specialized AI accelerators, such as Cerebras  and Groq , which employ highly parallel architectures and fully specialized processing elements (typically large arrays of multiply-accumulate units), together with tailored closed-source kernel libraries.\nHowever, accelerators often lack flexibility and cannot compete with GPUs in rapidly adapting to new workloads. This work presents the first end-to-end FM deployment flow based entirely on an open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), open hardware and open-source software. We target a many-tiny-core general-purpose RISC-V architecture with specialized RISC-V extensions and advanced direct memory access (DMA) engines, allowing for a highly flexible AI-oriented dataflow.\nThis platform adopts a scalable, hierarchical structure that organizes cores into groups of parallel compute clusters. Advanced DMA engines facilitate high bandwidth heterogeneous memory movements, including core-to-core, cluster-to-cluster, and cluster-to-High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) communications, both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D), effectively hiding the latency of costly memory operations . Each cluster  comprises eight compute cores with custom ISA extensions for SIMD-capable floating-point (FP) operand streaming and instruction repetition, as well as one DMA core. Compute cores are coupled to a 64-bit wide SIMD-capable floating-point unit (FPU) supporting FP64FP64\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{6}\\mathrm{4}, FP32FP32\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{3}\\mathrm{2}, FP16FP16\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{1}\\mathrm{6}, BrainFloat16 (BF16BF16\\mathrm{B}\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{1}\\mathrm{6}) , FP8FP8\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{8} (E5M2), and FP8ALTFP8ALT\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{8}\\mathrm{A}\\mathrm{L}\\mathrm{T} (E4M3)  formats. At the software level, we exploit these hardware capabilities to implement an optimized kernel library for FMs, including advanced attention implementations such as FlashAttention-2, fused layers combining head concatenation and input space projection in a logarithmic tree fashion distributed over compute clusters, and low-precision SIMD-based kernels. We benchmark our work on five different FMs, including decoder-only LLMs and encoder-only ViT models, to demonstrate the flexibility of our HW platform and our SW kernels. Furthermore, we compare against both commercial and academic SoA architectures.\nWe focus on the conventional (quadratic) attention, since algorithmic optimizations (such as linearized attention) are not accuracy-neutral at scale. Furthermore, quadratic attention allows direct comparisons with other state-of-the-art architectures. The key contributions of this work are the following: We provide a comprehensive open-source FM library that supports encoder- and decoder-only models, leveraging the HW features and ISA extensions of a scalable RISC-V-based open-source multi-core platform. To improve the performance of our kernels, we leverage advanced DMA engines and demonstrate the benefits of using cluster-to-cluster data transfers, enabling layer fusion and reduction in main memory accesses. We provide a detailed ablation study showing how specialized RISC-V ISA extensions for latency-tolerant operand streaming and instruction repetition boost the performance by a factor of up to 35.6×\\times on GPT AR mode, 16.1×\\times on the GPT NAR mode and 12.8×\\times for the ViT model class, respectively, compared to the base instruction set architecture (ISA), achieving FPU utilization above 79% in NAR mode. We explore the scalability of attention kernels among data precision and the number of available clusters on our HW target. We benchmark our FM library at FP64FP64\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{6}\\mathrm{4}, FP32FP32\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{3}\\mathrm{2}, FP16FP16\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{1}\\mathrm{6}, and FP8FP8\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{8}. We also show how different attention block hyperparameters scale compared to the number of cores in terms of throughput (images/s) on all ViT models. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first fully open-source software deployment of ViT and LLM models on an open-source RISC-V hardware architecture. Through comprehensive benchmarking, we demonstrate that our end-to-end inference engine outperforms SoA platforms regarding HW utilization while maintaining the full flexibility of a many-core RISC-V architecture. We outperform SoA accelerators by up to 8×\\times in terms of FPU utilization, with a minimum speedup of 1.81×\\times compared to the best competitor. The remainder of the manuscript is organized as follows. Sections  II and  III provide background and review of related work in full-stack FM deployment flows. Section IV offers an in-depth description of our target hardware platform and Section V details our software library. Section VII presents comprehensive findings and the results of our benchmarking experiments. Finally, Section VIII summarizes our study with concluding remarks.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: In the last few years, the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has seen a paradigm shift towards transformer-based models such as Large Language Models [ref]1, Vision Transformers , and, more in general, Foundation Models [ref]3.\nTransformer-based FMs are large-scale models based on the so-called attention mechanism , trained on enormous generic\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
