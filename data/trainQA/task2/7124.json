      "content": "Paper Title: IRWE: Inductive Random Walk for Joint Inference of Identity and Position Network Embedding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets.\nWe used seven datasets commonly used by related research to validate the effectiveness of IRWE. Statistics of these datasets are depicted in Table III, where N𝑁N, E𝐸E, and K𝐾K are the number of nodes, edges, and classes, respectively. PPI, Wiki, BlogCatalog are the first type of datasets [ref]15  providing the ground-truth of node positions for multi-label classification, which are extracted from (i) social relationships of the BlogCatalog website, (ii) protein-protein interactions of a biology network, and (iii) word cooccurrence of a Wikipedia dump.\nUSA, Europe, and Brazil are the second type of datasets [ref]14  with node identity ground-truth for multi-class classification, which describe the commercial flights of three air-traffic networks in different places. In summary, PPI, Wiki, and BlogCatalog are widely used to evaluate the quality of position embedding while USA, Europe, and Brazil are well-known datasets for the evaluation of identity embedding. Moreover, PPIs is a widely used dataset for the inductive inference across graphs  , which includes a set of protein-protein interaction graphs (in terms of connected components) with each graph corresponding to a human tissue. In addition to graph topology, the original PPIs dataset also provides node features and ground-truth for node classification. As stated in Section III, we do not consider graph attributes due to the complicated correlations between topology and attributes. It is also unclear whether the classification ground-truth is dominated by topology or attributes. Therefore, we only used the graph topology of PPIs in our experiments. Downstream Tasks. We followed the experiment settings of prior work [ref]15 [ref]14  to adopt multi-label and multi-class node classification for the evaluation of position and identity embeddings on the first and second types of datasets, respectively. In particular, each node may belong to multiple classes in multi-label classification while each node can only belong to one class in multi-class classification. We used F1-score as the quality metric for the two classification tasks. In addition to node classification, we also adopted unsupervised node clustering to evaluate the quality of identity and position embeddings.\nInspired by spectral clustering [ref]43 and Hypothesis 1, we can construct an auxiliary similarity graph 𝒢Dsubscript𝒢𝐷{\\mathcal{G}}_{D} based on the high-order degree features {δ′​(v)∈ℝ(l+1)​e}superscript𝛿′𝑣superscriptℝ𝑙1𝑒\\{{\\delta}^{\\prime}(v)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{(l+1)e}\\} derived via a procedure similar to Algorithm 2. The only difference between {δ′​(v)}superscript𝛿′𝑣\\{{\\delta}^{\\prime}(v)\\} (used for evaluation) and {δ​(v)}𝛿𝑣\\{\\delta(v)\\} (used in IRWE) is that δ′​(v)superscript𝛿′𝑣{\\delta}^{\\prime}(v) is directly derived from the rooted subgraph 𝒢s​(v,l′)subscript𝒢𝑠𝑣superscript𝑙′{\\mathcal{G}}_{s}(v,l^{\\prime}) but not the sampled RWs 𝒲(v)superscript𝒲𝑣{\\mathcal{W}}^{(v)}. We let 𝒢Dsubscript𝒢𝐷{\\mathcal{G}}_{D} be the top-101010 similarity graph based on the inner product δ′​(vi)​δ′T​(vj)/(|δ′​(vi)|​|δ′​(vj)|)superscript𝛿′subscript𝑣𝑖superscriptsuperscript𝛿′𝑇subscript𝑣𝑗superscript𝛿′subscript𝑣𝑖superscript𝛿′subscript𝑣𝑗\\delta^{\\prime}({v_{i}}){{\\delta^{\\prime}}^{T}}({v_{j}})/(|\\delta^{\\prime}({v_{i}})||\\delta^{\\prime}({v_{j}})|). To obtain {δ′​(v)}superscript𝛿′𝑣\\{{\\delta}^{\\prime}(v)\\}, we set l′=5superscript𝑙′5l^{\\prime}=5 (i.e., the order of neighbors) and e=500𝑒500e=500 (i.e., the dimensionality of the one-hot degree encoding) for the first type of datasets while we let l=3𝑙3l=3 and e=200𝑒200e=200 for PPIs.\nSince the high-order degree features are expected to capture node identities, we expect that the node clustering evaluated on 𝒢Dsubscript𝒢𝐷\\mathcal{G}_{D} can measure the quality of identity embeddings and define it as the node identity clustering task. In this task, we applied a clustering algorithm to embeddings learned on the original graph 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} but evaluated the clustering result on 𝒢Dsubscript𝒢𝐷\\mathcal{G}_{D}. We also treated the node clustering evaluated on the original graph 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} as community detection , a typical task commonly used for the evaluation of position embeddings. Normalized cut (NCut) [ref]43 and modularity  can be used as quality metrics for node identity clustering and community detection. Given a clustering result 𝒞={𝒞1,⋯,𝒞K}𝒞subscript𝒞1⋯subscript𝒞𝐾\\mathcal{C}=\\{\\mathcal{C}_{1},\\cdots,\\mathcal{C}_{K}\\}, we define NCut w.r.t. the auxiliary similarity graph 𝒢Dsubscript𝒢𝐷\\mathcal{G}_{D} as where 𝒞¯r=𝒱−𝒞rsubscript¯𝒞𝑟𝒱subscript𝒞𝑟{\\mathcal{{\\bar{C}}}_{r}}=\\mathcal{V}-{\\mathcal{C}_{r}}, cut(𝒞r,𝒞¯r)=∑vi∈𝒞r,vj∈𝒞¯r(𝐀D)i​jcutsubscript𝒞𝑟subscript¯𝒞𝑟subscriptformulae-sequencesubscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝒞𝑟subscript𝑣𝑗subscript¯𝒞𝑟subscriptsubscript𝐀𝐷𝑖𝑗{\\mathop{\\rm cut}\\nolimits}({\\mathcal{C}_{r}},{\\mathcal{{\\bar{C}}}_{r}})=\\sum\\nolimits_{{v_{i}}\\in{\\mathcal{C}_{r}},{v_{j}}\\in{\\mathcal{{\\bar{C}}}_{r}}}{{({\\bf{A}}_{D})_{ij}}}, and vol(𝒞r)=∑vi∈𝒞r,vj∈𝒱(𝐀D)i​jvolsubscript𝒞𝑟subscriptformulae-sequencesubscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝒞𝑟subscript𝑣𝑗𝒱subscriptsubscript𝐀𝐷𝑖𝑗{\\mathop{\\rm vol}\\nolimits}({\\mathcal{C}_{r}})=\\sum\\nolimits_{{v_{i}}\\in{\\mathcal{C}_{r}},{v_{j}}\\in\\mathcal{V}}{{({\\bf{A}}_{D})_{ij}}}, with 𝐀Dsubscript𝐀𝐷{\\bf{A}}_{D} as the adjacency matrix of 𝒢Dsubscript𝒢𝐷\\mathcal{G}_{D}.\nFor a clustering result 𝒞={𝒞1,⋯,𝒞K}𝒞subscript𝒞1⋯subscript𝒞𝐾\\mathcal{C}=\\{\\mathcal{C}_{1},\\cdots,\\mathcal{C}_{K}\\}, modularity w.r.t. the original graph 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is defined as where e=∑ideg⁡(vi)/2𝑒subscript𝑖degreesubscript𝑣𝑖2e=\\sum\\nolimits_{i}{\\deg({v_{i}})}/2 is the number of edges. Logistic regression and K𝐾KMeans were used as downstream algorithms for node classification and clustering, respectively. In general, larger F1-score and modularity as well as smaller NCut implies better performance of downstream tasks, thus indicating better embedding quality. In summary, we adopted (i) node identity clustering and (ii) multi-label node classification as downstream tasks to respectively evaluate identity and position embeddings on the first type of datasets. For the second type of datasets, (i) multi-label node classification and (ii) community detection were used to measure the quality of identity and position embeddings. Moreover, we only applied the unsupervised (i) node identity clustering and (ii) community detection to evaluate the two types of embeddings for PPIs, since we did not consider its ground-truth. Baselines. We compared IRWE with 171717 unsupervised baselines, covering identity and position embedding as well as transductive and inductive approaches. Table IV summarizes all the methods to be evaluated, where ‘-’ denotes that it is unclear for a baseline which type of property (i.e., node identities or positions) it can capture. PhUSION has multiple variants using different proximities for different types of embeddings. We adopted two variants with (i) positive point-wise mutual information and (ii) heat kernel, which are recommended proximities for position and identity embedding, as two baselines denoted as PhN-PPMI and PhN-HK. Each variant of PhUSION can only derive one type of embedding. For each transductive baseline, we can clearly distinguish that it captures node identities or positions. For inductive baselines, GraLSP, SPINE, GAS, and role2vec are claimed to be identity embedding methods while P-GNN and CSGCL can preserve node positions. Similar to our method, GraLSP and SPINE use RWs and induced statistics to enhance the embedding quality. SANNE applies the transformer encoder to handle RWs. However, all the inductive baselines (except role2vec) rely on the availability of node attributes. We used the bucket one-hot encodings of node degrees as their attribute inputs, which is a widely-used strategy for inductive methods when attributes are unavailable. Moreover, the transductive methods learn their embeddings only based on graph topology. All the aforementioned baselines can only generate one set of embeddings. Therefore, we have to use this unique set of embeddings to support two different tasks on each dataset. In contrast, our IRWE method can support the inductive inference of identity and position embeddings, simultaneously generating two sets of embeddings. Therefore, we used the two sets of embeddings to support different tasks, respectively. To further validate the challenge of simultaneously capturing node identities and positions in one embedding space, we introduced an additional baseline (denoted as [n2v||||s2v]) by concatenating node2vec and struc2vec. Note that we consider the unsupervised network embedding as stated in Section III. There exist several supervised inductive methods (e.g., GAT , GIN , ID-GNN , DE-GNN , DEMO-Net , and SAT ) that do not provide unsupervised training objectives in their original designs. To ensure the fairness of comparison, these supervised baselines are not included in our experiments. All the experiments were conducted on a server with AMD EPYC 7742 64-Core CPU, 512512512GB main memory, and one NVIDIA A100 GPU (808080GB memory). We used the official code or public implementations of all the baselines and tuned parameters to report their best performance. On each dataset, we set the same embedding dimensionality for all the methods. Due to space limits, we leave details of layer configurations and parameter settings in the supplementary material.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: IRWE.
