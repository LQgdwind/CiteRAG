Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Semantic Communications: Deep Learning-Based Image Semantic Coding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare the proposed RL-ASC with the engineered codecs BPG [ref]1, JPEG2000 6, JPEG , as well as the deep learning-based codecs DSSLIC  and HiFIC 2. Moreover, we finetuned the DSSLIC with the semantic loss in the semantic segmentation task for fair comparison, and the finetuned model is denoted as DSSLIC-finetuned. The bitrate of the engineered codecs [ref]1 6  is controlled by the quantization parameters (QP), where a larger QP means a higher compression ratio. We adopt the officially released version of these codecs and evaluate the performance in the range of bitrates 0 to 0.5 bpp. Particularly, BPG [ref]1 is the current state-of-the-art engineered image compression codec in terms of PSNR. DSSLIC  is a layered image compression, where the semantic label of the input image is encoded as the base layer of the bitstream, and the compact representation as well as the residual are encoded as the enhancement layer. The compression ratio of DSSLIC and DSSLIC-finetuned is adjusted by the QP of the enhancement layer. HiFIC 2 combines the GANs with learned compression to achieve high fidelity generative lossy compression, and thus is able to obtain visually pleasing reconstructions that are perceptually similar to the input and operate in a broad range of bitrates. We evaluate the performance of 2 by leveraging the pre-trained models at low bitrate (0.18bpp) and medium bitrate (0.33bpp).\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: We compare the proposed RL-ASC with the engineered codecs BPG [ref]1, JPEG2000 6, JPEG , as well as the deep learning-based codecs DSSLIC  and HiFIC 2.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
