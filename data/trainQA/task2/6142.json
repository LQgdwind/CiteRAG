      "content": "Paper Title: Information Design in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor information design, the core insight is to send messages to change the posterior beliefs of the receiver, which persuades it to take actions that benefit the sender  .\nThe canonical formulation considers a task that a sender wants to persuade a myopic receiver for one step .\nThe sender and the receiver share a prior distribution P​(s)𝑃𝑠P(s) over the state s𝑠s, which affects both the payoffs of the sender ri​(s,a)superscript𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑎r^{i}(s,a) and the receiver rj​(s,a)superscript𝑟𝑗𝑠𝑎r^{j}(s,a) (some recent work lifts this assumption ).\nThe sender needs to honestly commit its signaling scheme, which is\na policy that determines the distribution of signals, to the receiver before the interaction. This is referred to as the commitment assumption. The flow of the persuasion process is as follows:\n(1) The sender commits a signaling scheme to the receiver;\n(2) The environment generates a state s𝑠s. The sender observes the state s𝑠s and then samples a message according to the distribution of the committed signaling scheme;\nand (3) The receiver receives the message, and then calculates a posterior and chooses an optimal action for itself. Given the current state and the receiver’s chosen action, the sender and the receiver get rewards from the environment. Based on an analysis similar to the revelation principle  , there is an optimal signaling scheme that does not require more signals than the number of actions available to the receiver. Thus it is without loss of generality for the sender to recommend an action directly to the receiver rather than sending a message. From the self-interested receiver’s perspective, as long as it believes that the recommended actions are optimal in its posterior belief, it will follow the sender’s advice. This kind of constraints of the sender’s signaling scheme is called obedience constraints. When such constraints are satisfied, the signaling scheme will be incentive compatible, meaning that the receiver will follow the sender’s advice. In this way, the process of information design can be modeled as a constrained optimization problem where wi​(s,a)superscript𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑎w^{i}(s,a) and wj​(s,a)superscript𝑤𝑗𝑠𝑎w^{j}(s,a) are the utility functions of the sender and the receiver respectively, φ​(a|s)𝜑conditional𝑎𝑠\\varphi(a\\>|\\>s) is the sender’s signaling scheme, and the problem is formulated as a linear program. Information design is applicable to a vast array of real-world scenarios, including voter coalition formation , law enforcement deployment [ref]21, price discrimination [ref]4, etc. See  for a summary. Communication learning is a significant subarea of MARL.\nExisting research primarily focus on fully cooperative settings 6  .\nAmong the proposed methods in MARL with communication, DIAL 6 is the closest work to ours.\nIt highlights the importance of the receiver’s feedback to the sender, where the receiver updates its critic network and passes the gradient back to the sender’s network.\nThis also implies that the sender is assisting the receiver in evaluating the environment.\nThe altruistic design of the sender is appropriate in fully cooperative scenarios, but might not extend to mixed-motive scenarios. MARL communication under mixed-motive settings was attempted in . The work uses social influence, which is defined via the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the receiver’s policy update, to measure how persuasive is the sender’s message. It is a pioneer attempt and demonstrates efficacy in several contexts, but the authors observed that “The listener agent is not compelled to listen to any given speaker. Listeners selectively listen to a speaker only when it is beneficial, and influence cannot occur all the time.” This describes a lack of the obedience constraints, and motivates us to propose algorithms that are more effective and more general. Related works on mechanism design, sequential information design, and emergent communication are deferred to Appendix A.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: scheme, and the problem is formulated as a linear program.
