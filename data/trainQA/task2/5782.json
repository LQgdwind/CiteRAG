      "content": "Paper Title: Better Understanding Differences in Attribution Methods via Systematic Evaluations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep neural networks (DNNs) are highly successful on many computer vision tasks.\nHowever, their black box nature makes it hard to interpret and thus trust their decisions.\nTo shed light on the models’ decision-making process, several methods have been proposed that aim to attribute importance values to individual input features (see Sec. 2).\nHowever, given the lack of ground truth importance values, it has proven difficult to compare and evaluate these attribution methods in a holistic and systematic manner. In this work that extends [ref]1, we take a three-pronged approach towards addressing this issue. In particular, we focus on three important components for such evaluations: reliably measuring the methods’ model-faithfulness, ensuring a fair comparison between methods, and providing a framework that allows for systematic visual inspections of their attributions. First, we propose an evaluation scheme (DiFull), which allows distinguishing possible from impossible importance attributions. This effectively provides ground truth annotations for whether or not an input feature can possibly have influenced the model output. As such, it can highlight distinct failure modes of attribution methods (Fig. 1, left). Second, a fair evaluation requires attribution methods to be compared on equal footing. However, we observe that different methods explain DNNs to different depths (e.g., full network or classification head only).\nThus, some methods in fact solve a much easier problem (i.e., explain a much shallower network). To even the playing field, we propose a multi-layer evaluation scheme for attributions (ML-Att) and\nthoroughly evaluate\ncommonly used methods across multiple layers and models (Fig. 1, left).\nWhen compared on the same level, we find that performance differences between some methods essentially vanish. Third, relying on individual examples for a qualitative comparison is prone to skew the comparison and cannot fully represent the evaluated attribution methods. To overcome this, we propose a qualitative evaluation scheme for which we aggregate attribution maps (AggAtt) across many input samples. This allows us to observe trends in the performance of attribution methods across complete datasets, in addition to looking at individual examples (Fig. 1, right). Contributions.\n(1) We propose a novel evaluation setting, DiFull,\nin which we control which regions cannot possibly influence a model’s output, which allows us to highlight definite failure modes of attribution methods.\n(2)\nWe argue that methods can only be compared fairly when evaluated on the same layer. To do this, we introduce ML-Att and evaluate all attribution methods at multiple layers.\nWe show that, when compared fairly, apparent performance differences between some methods effectively vanish.\n(3) We propose a novel aggregation method, AggAtt, to qualitatively evaluate attribution methods across all images in a dataset. This allows to qualitatively assess a method’s performance across many samples (Fig. 1, right), which complements the evaluation on individual samples.\n(4) We propose a post-processing smoothing step that significantly improves localization performance on some attribution methods.\nWe observe significant differences when evaluating these smoothed attributions on different architectures, which highlights how architectural design choices can influence an attribution method’s applicability. In this extended version of [ref]1, we additionally provide the following:\n(1) We evaluate on a wider variety of network architectures, in particular deeper networks with higher classification accuracies, including VGG19 [ref]2, ResNet152 [ref]3, ResNeXt , Wide ResNet , and GoogLeNet . We show that the results and trends discussed in [ref]1 generalize well to diverse CNN architectures.\n(2) We evaluate our settings on multiple configurations of the layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP)  family of attribution methods, that modify the gradient flow during backpropagation to identify regions in the image important to the model. We show that while LRP can outperform all other methods, achieving good localization requires carefully choosing propagation rules and their parameters, and is sensitive to the model formulation and architecture.\n(3) We show that the trends in performance of attribution methods at multiple layers (ML-Att), which was visualized at a subset of layers (input, middle, and final) in [ref]1, generalizes across layers and architectures for each method.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/sukrutrao/Attribution-Evaluation.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: given the lack of ground truth importance values, it has proven difficult to compare and evaluate these attribution methods in a holistic and systematic manner.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
