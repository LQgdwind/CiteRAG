      "content": "Paper Title: Boosted ab initio Cryo-EM 3D Reconstruction with ACE-EM\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTwo protein molecules are selected as the targets:\nthe pre-catalytic spliceosome (PDB ID: 5NRL) and\nthe SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain structure (PDB ID: 6VYB).\nFor comparing the performances of methods with different noise levels,\nwe synthesized each dataset with Gaussian noises of different SNRs,\n200 dB, -10 dB or even -20 dB(Figure 7).\nWith high SNR at 200 dB, images can be regarded as noise-free.\n-10 dB is the most common SNR in experimental projection image datasets,\nthus, the model performance of this condition is a focus.\nWith -20 dB, the images become indistinguishable from human eyes\nand reconstruction becomes more challenging.\nAn additional dataset spliceosome at the SNR of -20 dB\nis applied to test the noise tolerance of our method. We benchmarked against CryoPoseNet  ,\nCryoSPARC   (traditional method), cryoDRGN2  [ref]20,\nand cryoAI  [ref]7 in terms of pose estimation\nand 3D reconstruction accuracy.\nFor simulated datasets, FSC resolution at a threshold of 0.5 between the ground-truth and predicted volumes is the evaluation criterion. The result of the simulated datasets can be seen in Table 1.\nResults for CryoPoseNet were taken from previously reported data  [ref]7,\ncryoDRGN2’s results were from  [ref]20, while the cryoSPARC and cryoAI’s results were obtained by re-running these methods.\nWe found that cryoAI failed frequently due to the spurious structural\nsymmetries even with symmetry loss applied, while ACE-EM rarely failed in reconstructions.\nThe pose estimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality\nare comparable or better than these baseline methods using either VoxelGridRsubscriptVoxelGridR\\mathrm{VoxelGrid_{R}} or FourierNetFourierNet\\mathrm{FourierNet} decoder.\nIn terms of reconstruction resolution,\nACE-EM with FourierNetFourierNet\\mathrm{FourierNet} outperformed all the baseline methods.\nIt reached 2 pixels,\nthe Nyquist resolution,\nusing an FSC threshold of 0.5 in all datasets with SNR 200 dB and -10 dB.\nVisualization of 3D reconstruction results can be found in Figure 5 and Figure 6. Our reconstructed volumes have more details compared to the result of cryoAI.\nBased on the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem  [ref]30,\nthe highest measurable resolution of the dispersed volume representation is 2 pixels.\nThe resolution of ACE-EM with FourierNetFourierNet\\mathrm{FourierNet} reached the theoretical upper limit,\nwhich is not reachable by other methods.\nTo be specific,\nthe FSC correlation coefficient at spatial resolution 2.00 pixels is still very high (0.86) for the spliceosome (200 dB) dataset,\nwell above the standard threshold (0.5).\nWe also benchmarked ACE-EM on an even more challenging dataset\n(SNR -20 dB; without image shifts).\nThe FSC resolution of the output 3D object reached 2.1 pixels,\nwhich is even higher than the results of -10 dB provided by other ML-based baselines.\nAlso, the performance of -20 dB SNR proves the potential of ACE-EM with FourierNetFourierNet\\mathrm{FourierNet}\nfor working in really low SNR situations. When using VoxelGridRsubscriptVoxelGridR\\mathrm{VoxelGrid_{R}} as the decoder,\nACE-EM reached a similar or better FSC resolution\namong other baselines.\nIn detail, on the similar SNR -10dB with the experimental environment,\nit provided higher resolutions on the spliceosome dataset compared to other baselines (except ACE-EM with FourierNetFourierNet\\mathrm{FourierNet}).\nWith VoxelGridRsubscriptVoxelGridR\\mathrm{VoxelGrid_{R}}, CryoPoseNet failed in the spike datasets,\nindicating that our method recovered VoxelGridRsubscriptVoxelGridR\\mathrm{VoxelGrid_{R}}’s competitiveness for cryo-EM 3D reconstructions. For rotation errors and translation errors, our methods get comparable or better results with other baselines.\nACE-EM generated fairly accurate pose estimations on noise-free datasets as most baselines.\nMoreover, ACE-EM performed better on noisy datasets compared to other ML-based methods, especially in terms of the mean rotation error metric.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: additional dataset spliceosome at the SNR of -20 dB\nis applied to test the noise tolerance of our method. We benchmarked against CryoPoseNet  ,\nCryoSPARC   (traditional method), cryoDRGN2  [ref]20,\nand cryoAI  [ref]7 in terms of pose estimation\nand 3D reconstruction accuracy.\nFor simulated datasets, FSC resolution at a threshold of 0.5 between the ground-truth and predicted volumes is\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
