      "content": "Paper Title: Probabilistic Constraint for Safety-Critical Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this work, we consider the problem of finding optimal policies for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) under probabilistic safety guarantees. In particular, we are interested in situations where the state transition distributions are unknown, and thus the policies need to be computed from system samples. An MDP  is defined by a tuple (𝒮,𝒜,r,ℙ,μ,T𝒮𝒜𝑟ℙ𝜇𝑇\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{A},r,\\mathbb{P},\\mu,T), where 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} is the state space, 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} is the action space, r:𝒮×𝒜→ℝ:𝑟→𝒮𝒜ℝr:\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\to\\mathbb{R} is the reward function describing the quality of the decision.

The state and action at time t∈{0,1,…,T}𝑡01…𝑇t\\in\\left\\{0,1,\\ldots,T\\right\\} are random variables denoted respectively by Stsubscript𝑆𝑡S_{t} and Atsubscript𝐴𝑡A_{t}. A policy is a conditional distribution πθ​(a|s)subscript𝜋𝜃conditional𝑎𝑠\\pi_{\\theta}(a|s) parameterized by θ∈ℝd𝜃superscriptℝ𝑑\\theta\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d} (for instance the weights and biases of neural networks), from which the agent draws action a∈𝒜𝑎𝒜a\\in\\mathcal{A} when in the corresponding state s∈𝒮𝑠𝒮s\\in\\mathcal{S}. In the context of MDPs the objective is to find a policy that maximizes the value function which is defined as where 𝐚𝐚\\mathbf{a} and 𝐬𝐬\\mathbf{s} denote the sequences of actions and states for the whole episode, this is, from time t=0𝑡0t=0 to t=T𝑡𝑇t=T. Subscripts of the expectation are omitted in the remainder of this paper for notation simplicity. By attempting to maximize a single objective, policies may be unsafe or result in risky behaviors. Thus, we impose requirements in terms of probabilistic safety to overcome this limitation. We formally define this notion next. A policy πθsubscript𝜋𝜃\\pi_{\\theta} is (1−δ)1𝛿(1-\\delta)-safe for the set 𝒮safe⊂𝒮subscript𝒮safe𝒮\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{safe}}\\subset\\mathcal{S} if and only if ℙ​(∩t=0T{St∈𝒮safe}|πθ)≥1−δℙsuperscriptsubscript𝑡0𝑇conditionalsubscript𝑆𝑡subscript𝒮safesubscript𝜋𝜃1𝛿\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\cap_{t=0}^{T}\\{S_{t}\\in\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{safe}}\\}|\\pi_{\\theta}\\right)\\geq 1-\\delta. From the previous definition, a safe policy is such that the state remains within the safe set 𝒮safesubscript𝒮safe\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{safe}} for the whole episode with probability at least 1−δ1𝛿1-\\delta. Under this definition, we formulate the probabilistic safe RL problem as the following constrained optimization problem To solve problem (II), it is conceivable to employ gradient-based methods e.g., regularization [ref]35 and primal-dual  to achieve local optimal solutions. For instance, consider the regularization method with a fixed penalty. This is, for λ>0𝜆0\\lambda>0 we formulate the following unconstrained problem as an approximation to the constrained problem (II)\n It is important to point out that, in general, there is no guarantee that a fixed coefficient λ𝜆\\lambda achieves the same solution as (II) (an exception is, for instance, in cases where (II) is convex ). However, λ𝜆\\lambda trades-off optimality and safety. Indeed, for large values of λ𝜆\\lambda solutions to (3) will prioritize safe behaviors, whereas for small values of λ𝜆\\lambda the solutions will focus on maximizing the value function. Alternatively, one approach to automatically search appropriate values of λ𝜆\\lambda is to use iterative methods such as the primal-dual algorithm (See Section V). To solve problem (3) locally gradient ascent [ref]47 or its stochastic versions can be used. Note that the gradient of V​(θ)𝑉𝜃V(\\theta) in (3) can be computed using the Policy Gradient Theorem . Nevertheless, the lack of an expression for the gradient of the probabilistic safety, i.e., ∇θℙ​(∩t=0T{St∈𝒮safe}|πθ)subscript∇𝜃ℙsuperscriptsubscript𝑡0𝑇conditionalsubscript𝑆𝑡subscript𝒮safesubscript𝜋𝜃\\nabla_{\\theta}\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\cap_{t=0}^{T}\\{S_{t}\\in\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{safe}}\\}|\\pi_{\\theta}\\right) prevents us from applying this family of methods to solve (3). It is worth pointing out that other state-of-the-art algorithms that are developed to solve constrained RL problems, e.g., CPO [ref]29, RCPO , PCPO , FOCOPS  also rely on computing the gradients of objective functions and constraints. As such, it is not surprising that when considering safe RL formulations, instead of dealing with problems of the form (II) they consider cumulative constraints. In these problems, an auxiliary reward function rc:𝒮×𝒜→ℝ:subscript𝑟𝑐→𝒮𝒜ℝr_{c}:{\\mathcal{S}}\\times{\\mathcal{A}}\\to\\mathbb{R} is defined, and the following problem is formulated where ξ𝜉\\xi is a hyper-parameter that induces different levels of safety. Problems of the form (II) are known as CMDPs  and they can be tackled through classic policy gradient, e.g., . When formulating safe RL as a CMDP, the function rcsubscript𝑟𝑐r_{c} is designed so that it induces safe behaviors when attaining large values. This results in a problem-dependent design and in general, it necessitates a time-consuming process of hyper-parameter tuning. Moreover, the probabilistic safety as in Definition 1 is not guaranteed by formulation (II). Both of these limitations are avoided under formulation (II), which we focus on in this work. While problems (II) and (II) may appear distinct, they share a significant connection. The next section delves into this relationship in terms of objective optimality. Specifically, we draw insights from   to establish explicit bounds on safety guarantees and optimal values for problems (II) and (II).\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: we formulate the probabilistic safe RL problem as the following constrained optimization problem To solve problem (II), it is conceivable to employ gradient-based methods e.g., regularization [ref]35 and primal-dual  to achieve local optimal solutions.
