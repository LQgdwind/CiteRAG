      "content": "Paper Title: Enumeration for MSO-Queries on Compressed Trees\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLet us briefly discuss more complex tree updates that were considered in \nin the context of query enumeration on uncompressed trees.\nIn this paper, the authors consider in addition to relabeling updates also certain insertion\nand deletion updates, where nodes are inserted (resp., deleted) at certain specified positions in the current tree.\nThe authors in  achieve time 𝒪​(log⁡|T|)𝒪𝑇\\mathcal{O}(\\log|T|) for these updates.\nFor this, they represent the input tree T𝑇T by a forest algebra expression Tesubscript𝑇𝑒T_{e}\nof height 𝒪​(log⁡|T|)𝒪𝑇\\mathcal{O}(\\log|T|). It is tempting to extend the approach from  to an FSLP D𝐷D, i.e., to\na forest algebra expression Tesubscript𝑇𝑒T_{e} that is represented by a DAG. We conjecture\nthat this is indeed possible, but the technical difficulties are considerable. In \nthe authors maintain a certain balancing property for the forest algebra expression Tesubscript𝑇𝑒T_{e} that is motivated\nfrom strongly balanced SLPs but is much more technical.\nThe problem is that the AVL-rotations that are used to construct strongly balanced SLPs require associativity\nfor all combinations of the underlying algebra operations. For SLPs, there is only one operation, namely string\nconcatenation, which is of course associative.\nFor the two binary forest algebra operations,\nassociativity no longer holds: F1⦶(F2⊖F3)⦶subscript𝐹1⊖subscript𝐹2subscript𝐹3F_{1}\\mathbin{\\varobar}(F_{2}\\mathbin{\\varominus}F_{3}) is in general not the same as\n(F1⦶F2)⊖F3⊖⦶subscript𝐹1subscript𝐹2subscript𝐹3(F_{1}\\mathbin{\\varobar}F_{2})\\mathbin{\\varominus}F_{3}.\nIn  the authors found a quite technical workaround for this problem in the uncompressed setting.\nIt is not obvious that the same workaround can be also used in the situation, where the forest algebra expression\nis represented by a DAG. For string SLPs (which are a special case of FSLPs) all these problems do not arise. Therefore, our approach can\nbe used to recover the main result of [ref]34, which is an enumeration algorithm for MSO-queries on\nSLP-compressed strings with the following characteristics: (i) linear preprocessing, (ii) output-linear delay, and (iii)\nCDE-updates in time 𝒪​(log⁡N)𝒪𝑁\\mathcal{O}(\\log N).\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: algebra expression\nis represented by a DAG. For string SLPs (which are a special case of FSLPs) all these problems do not arise. Therefore, our approach can\nbe used to recover the main result of [ref]34, which is an enumeration algorithm for MSO-queries on\nSLP-compressed strings with the following characteristics: (i) linear preprocessing, (ii) output-linear delay, and (iii)\nCDE-updates in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
