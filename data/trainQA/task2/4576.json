Early works of CL heavily rely on the quality of heuristical prior knowledge to select samples while ignoring feedback from the learner, which triggers a discrepancy between the fixed curriculum and the model. To address this shortcoming,  propose self-paced learning (SPL), which implements sample selection with a weight variable and no longer requires human intervention.\nThe weight variable and model parameters are optimized alternatively.\nRecently, several studies have been proposed to further refine weighting strategies of SPL    [ref]48. However, they mainly depend on the auxiliary model framework or are limited by specific tasks. Like SPL, DiscrimLoss is also a method of learning a curriculum dynamically without the limitation of inconsistency. Moreover, as an all-purpose CL-based method, DiscrimLoss is suitable for many tasks without modifying model architecture. Learning on noisy samples.\nTo alleviate the influence of incorrect samples, most previous works focus on devising sample reweighting strategy to suppress the weight of incorrect samples\n  [ref]18.\nFor example, Co-teaching  and Co-teaching++  cross-train two DNNs, which have different learning abilities, to filter the noise.\nDivideMix  models the per-sample loss distribution with a mixture model for correct and incorrect samples’ division. [ref]18 propose CurriculumLoss,\nwhich can be deemed as a curriculum sample selection strategy.\nSuperLoss  learns a curriculum by reweighting samples according to sample difficulty. On the other hand, both hard samples and incorrect samples are pervasive but challenging for the model to tell one from the other. However, previous studies simply model incorrect samples as general hard ones, which is not strictly distinguished from the concept: hard samples.\nIn this paper, DiscrimLoss tries to discriminate between hard samples and incorrect samples as much as possible, which benefits the model to learn hard examples but avoid memorizing from incorrect ones.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: Curriculum learning.\nAs a generic learning paradigm, CL benefits the learning process by presenting training examples in a meaningful order and has been widely applied in NLP  [ref]42 , CV  , and many other fields   [ref]48.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
