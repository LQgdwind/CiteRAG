Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

In particular, we provide the default value of the privacy hyperparameters below. \n DP-Merf  \n333https://github.com/frhrdr/dp-merf For ε=1𝜀1\\varepsilon=1 we use as the default hyperparameters setting provided in the official implementation: DP noise scale σ=5.0𝜎5.0\\sigma=5.0, training epoch =5absent5=5, while for ε=10𝜀10\\varepsilon=10, the DP noise scale is σ=0.568𝜎0.568\\sigma=0.568. DP-CGAN [ref]34\n444https://github.com/reihaneh-torkzadehmahani/DP-CGAN We set the default hyper-parameters as follows: gradient clipping bound C=1.1𝐶1.1C=1.1, noise scale σ=2.1𝜎2.1\\sigma=2.1, batch size=600absent600=600 and total number of training iterations=30​Kabsent30𝐾=30K. We exclude this model from evaluation at ε=1𝜀1\\varepsilon=1 as the required noise scale is too large for the training to make progress, which is consistent with the results in literature  [ref]6. GS-WGAN [ref]6\n 555https://github.com/DingfanChen/GS-WGAN We adopt the default configuration provided by the official implementation (ε=10𝜀10\\varepsilon=10): the subsampling rate =1/1000absent11000=1/1000, DP noise scale σ=1.07𝜎1.07\\sigma=1.07, batch size =32absent32=32. Following [ref]6, we\npretrain (warm-start) the model for 2​K2𝐾2K iterations, and subsequently train for 20K iterations. Similar to the case for DP-CGAN, we exclude this model from evaluation at ε=1𝜀1\\varepsilon=1 as the required noise scale is too large for the training to be stable. For G-PATE , DataLens [ref]39 and DP-Sinkhorn , we present the same results as reported in the original papers (in Table 1 of the main paper) as reference, as they are either not directly comparable to ours or not open-sourced.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: provided in the official implementation: DP noise scale σ=5.0𝜎5.0\\sigma=5.0, training epoch =5absent5=5, while for ε=10𝜀10\\varepsilon=10, the DP noise scale is σ=0.568𝜎0.568\\sigma=0.568.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
