      "content": "Paper Title: A Graph is Worth 1-bit Spikes: When Graph Contrastive Learning Meets Spiking Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets. \nWe evaluate SpikeGCL on several graph benchmarks with different scales and properties. Following prior works  [ref]36 , we adopt 9 common benchmark graphs, including two co-purchase graphs, i.e., Amazon-Photo, Amazon-Computer [ref]33, two co-author graphs, i.e., Coauthor-CS and Coauthor-Physics [ref]33, three citation graphs, i.e., Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed , as well as two large-scale datasets ogbn-arXiv and ogbn-MAG from Open Graph Benchmark .\nDataset statistics are listed in Table 3.\nFor three citation datasets, we evaluate the models on the public full splits introduced in  .\nwe adopt the random 1:1:8 split for Amazon-Computer, Amazon-Photo, Coauthor-CS, and Coauthor-Physics. We use stratified sampling to ensure that the class distribution remains the same across splits. Baselines. \nWe compare our proposed methods to a wide range of baselines that fall into four categories: Full-precision (supervised) GNNs: GCN  and GAT . 1-bit quantization-based GNNs: Bi-GCN [ref]39, BinaryGNN  and BANE . Bi-GCN and BinaryGNN are both supervised methods while BANE is an unsupervised one. Full-precision contrastive methods: DGI , GRACE , CCA-SSG , BGRL [ref]36, SUGRL 6, and GGD . DGI, GRACE, SUGRL, and GGD are negative-sampling-based methods, whereas BGRL and CCA-SSG are negative-sample-free ones. Graph SNNs: SpikingGCN , SpikeNet 1, GC-SNN and GA-SNN . Note that SpikeNet is initially designed for dynamic graphs, we adapt the author’s implementation to static graphs following the practice in  . Although these methods are also based on the combination of SNNs and GNNs, they do not fully utilize the binary nature of SNNs to learn binaried representations in an unsupervised fashion. The hyperparameters of all the baselines were configured according to the experimental settings officially reported by the authors and were then carefully tuned in our experiments to achieve their best results. Implementation details. \nWe present implementation details for our experiments for reproducibility.\nWe implement our model as well as the baselines with PyTorch 7 and PyTorch Geometric , which are open-source software released under BSD-style 333https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/LICENSE and MIT444https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/blob/master/LICENSE license, respectively. All datasets used throughout experiments are publicly available in PyTorch Geometric library. All experiments are conducted on an NVIDIA RTX 3090 Ti GPU with 24 GB memory unless specified. Code is available at https://github.com/EdisonLeeeee/SpikeGCLfor reproducibility. Hyperparameter settings. \nThe embedding dimension for each time step is searched in {4, 8, 16, 32, 64}.\nWe carefully tune the time step T𝑇T from 8 to 64 to better approximate the full-precision performance. The firing threshold is tuned within {5e-4, 5e-3, 5e-2, 5e-1, 1.0}.\nThe margin m𝑚m is tuned in {0,0.5,1.0,1.5,2.0}00.51.01.52.0\\{0,0.5,1.0,1.5,2.0\\}.\nWe initialize and optimize all models with default normal initializer and AdamW optimizer 4.\nFor all datasets, we follow the practice in 1 and increase the sparsity of the network using PLIF  units, a bio-inspired neuron model that adopts a learnable τm=1subscript𝜏𝑚1\\tau_{m}=1 to activate sparsely in time solely when crossing a threshold.\nWe adopt Sigmoid as the surrogate function during backpropagation, with a smooth factor α=2.0𝛼2.0\\alpha=2.0.\nExploration on parameters of SpikeGCL including time step T𝑇T, encoder architecture, spiking neurons, and threshold Vthsubscript𝑉thV_{\\text{th}} are elaborated in Appendix F. Evaluation protocol. \nFor unsupervised or self-supervised methods, including SpikeGCL, we follow the linear evaluation scheme as described in literature  [ref]36: (i) we first train the model on all the nodes in a graph with self-defined supervision to learn node representations; (ii) we then train a linear classifier (e.g., a logistic regression model) on top with the learned representations under the supervised setting to evaluate the performance. We report averaged accuracy with standard deviation across 10 different trials with random seeds. Computation of theoretical energy consumption. \nDifferent from common ANNs implemented on GPUs, SNNs are designed for neuromorphic chips that adopt synaptic operations (SOPs) to run neural networks in a low power consumption manner. However, training SNNs directly on neuromorphic chips has been rarely explored in the literature.\nTo investigate the energy consumption of SNN-based methods on neuromorphic chips, we follow previous works   and adopt an alternative estimation approach, which involves counting the total number of spikes generated during the embedding generation process.\nThe computation of energy consumption involves two parts. The first one comes from the spike encoding process, which converts the full-precision node representations into discrete spikes to run on neuromorphic chips (e.g., Bernoulli encoding). It is estimated by multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations. The second one is the spiking process, which receives the resultant current and accumulates the membrane potential to generate the spikes. Therefore, the theoretical energy consumption can be estimated as follows: where 𝐒tlsuperscriptsubscript𝐒𝑡𝑙\\mathbf{S}_{t}^{l} denotes the output spikes at time step t𝑡t and layer l𝑙l. Note that SpikeGCL has only one spiking neuron, so we count the number of spikes at the last layer. According to  , E​M​A​C𝐸𝑀𝐴𝐶E{MAC} and ESOPsubscript𝐸SOPE_{\\text{SOP}} are set to 4.6​p​J4.6𝑝𝐽4.6pJ and 3.7​p​J3.7𝑝𝐽3.7pJ, respectively.\nWe also detail how to calculate the theoretical energy consumption of methods other than graph SNNs. For 1-bit GNNs, the processing time required to execute a single cycle operation, encompassing one multiplication and one addition, can be utilized to perform 64 binary operations effectively 8. Therefore, we use the following formula derived from [ref]39 to calculate the theoretical energy consumption of 1-bit GNNs (specifically GCN): where di​nlsuperscriptsubscript𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑙d_{in}^{l} and do​u​tlsuperscriptsubscript𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑙d_{out}^{l} are the input and output dimensions of the representation at the l𝑙l-th layer. We assume di​nl=do​u​tl=dsuperscriptsubscript𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑙superscriptsubscript𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑙𝑑d_{in}^{l}=d_{out}^{l}=d in this paper.\nFor the other full-precision models deployed on GPUs, we count the number of MAC operations to calculate the theoretical energy consumption. In practice, we split the message passing into two steps: embedding generation and aggregation. In the embedding generation step, the vanilla GNN projects features into a low-dimensional embedding space. For example, given the node features 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} and a weight matrix 𝐖∈ℝdi​n×do​u​t𝐖superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑖𝑛subscript𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡\\mathbf{W}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{in}\\times d_{out}}, it executes N​di​n​do​u​t𝑁subscript𝑑𝑖𝑛subscript𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡Nd_{in}d_{out} multiplication and N​di​n​do​u​t𝑁subscript𝑑𝑖𝑛subscript𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡Nd_{in}d_{out} addition operations. In the aggregation step, the number of multiplication and addition operations can be simply considered as |E|​di​n𝐸subscript𝑑𝑖𝑛|E|d_{in} and |E|​do​u​t𝐸subscript𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡|E|d_{out}.\nFor a fair comparison, we only consider the energy consumption of the encoder in GCL, as it is often the main bottleneck.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: Datasets. \nWe evaluate SpikeGCL on several graph benchmarks with different scales and properties.
