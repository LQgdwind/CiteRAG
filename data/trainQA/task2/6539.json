      "content": "Paper Title: Physically Realizable Natural-Looking Clothing Textures Evade Person Detectors via 3D Modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEarly works     found that adversarial examples crafted by adding small digital adversarial perturbations on the clean inputs can mislead the DNNs. Some adversarial examples can also be crafted in the physical world to attack different DNN models, including image classification models [ref]34   4  and detection models         8 . Among these works, patch-based and texture-based attacks are typical ways to craft physical adversarial examples. Patch-based attacks     8 [ref]34  4   0 3  usually optimize patches and put them on the target objects, and therefore can only work at a narrow range of viewing angles. These works produce different adversarial objects, including glasses frames [ref]34, road signs 4 5, cars  0  and clothes     8 9 . Among them, hiding persons from object detectors is especially challenging since the adversarial patches on the clothes can be heavily deformed due to their non-rigidity  . On the other hand, these adversarial patches are usually conspicuous to humans. To this end, Duan et al. 2 and Wang et al.  introduce additional losses to make the adversarial patches less conspicuous. Hu et al. 8 propose to produce more natural-looking patches with GANs  . Texture-based attacks  9  0 7, on the other hand, optimize the textures on the surface of the target objects to craft physical adversarial examples. Covered with adversarial textures, the object usually can deceive DNNs at multiple viewing angles. These works mainly use 3D modeling or clone networks to optimize textures for rigid objects. Athalye et al.  introduce the Expectation over Transformation (EoT) method and produce an adversarial 3D-printed turtle. Zhang et al.  and Wang et al. 0 design vehicle camouflage for multi-view adversarial attacks. Hu et al. 9 propose adversarial textures with repetitive structures for non-rigid clothes.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: perturbations on the clean inputs can mislead the DNNs.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
