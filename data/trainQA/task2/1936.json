      "content": "Paper Title: Secure and Efficient Federated Learning Through Layering and Sharding Blockchain\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the advent of the Internet of Everything era, the enormous volume of data generated by various connected devices, such as mobile phones, vehicles, and smart sensors, has become an invaluable resource for societal advancement.\nMachine Learning (ML), widely recognized for its potency and effectiveness, plays a pivotal role in utilizing this data resource, driving a variety of smart Internet of Things (IoT) applications, such as smart grids, intelligent transportation systems, and smart industries .\nHowever, the common centralized ML methodologies, which involve collecting data from IoT devices at a central location for training, present some drawbacks.\nThis centralized approach not only leads to increased transmission delays and extended learning convergence times but also poses serious concerns regarding privacy breaches and the potential for data misuse, highlighting the need for more secure and efficient data processing methods in IoT networks. To this end, Federated Learning (FL) [ref]3 as a promising training paradigm has been proposed to allow devices to collaborate and train a shared ML model in a distributed manner while keeping training data local.\nThe main benefit of FL is that only local models without any raw data need to be shared during the entire learning process [ref]3.\nThis allows FL to take full advantage of the resources and data of IoT devices to implement intelligence endogenous IoT services, such as predictive maintenance of industrial devices, traffic prediction in Internet-of-vehicle networks, and disease diagnosis based on wearable devices.\nHowever, despite the potential benefits of traditional FL, there are several security and efficiency issues in a trustless edge computing environment that have yet to be fully addressed in practical applications, which can be summarized as follows. Security Issues:\nTraditional FL systems depend on a central aggregator for training orchestration, but this centralization presents security risks, including a Single Point of Failure (SPOF) and vulnerability to targeted attacks, potentially causing service disruption and paralysis .\nIn addition, the potential bias from the central aggregator in selecting IoT devices each round can adversely affect global model accuracy .\nMoreover, traditional FL lacks mechanisms to address trust issues in the transmission and learning process of models, such as the poisonous models generated by malicious IoT devices [ref]6. Efficiency Issues:\nMost FL systems operate in a synchronous manner, wherein the central server waits for all participating IoT devices to submit their local models before updating the global model.\nThis approach is slowed down by stragglers, devices that take longer to complete training iterations, which affect overall convergence speed [ref]7.\nIn contrast, asynchronous training approaches  update the global model with potentially outdated local models, known as stale models, which can lead to instability of the global model during the updating process. To address the aforementioned issues, a series of works have introduced blockchain  into FL to exploit the advanced features of blockchain, such as tamper-resistant, decentralized, and traceability, in the trustless edge computing environment  .\nIn , BlockFL is proposed to carry out synchronous FL training in a decentralized manner.\nThen, the SPOF and targeted attacks can be overcome, and all local model updates are verified by blockchain nodes on the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus .\nTo alleviate the computation consumption during the consensus, a collaborative system for industrial IoT is proposed in  to integrate the federated training into the consensus process.\nBesides, some works also introduced differential privacy into blockchain-based FL to further enhance the data privacy of IoT devices .\nHowever, these studies fail to account for the constraint imposed by blockchain throughput, a pivotal determinant of training process efficiency. Despite some enhancements to distributed training from blockchain-enabled systems, integrating blockchain with FL still faces notable challenges, which can be summarized as follows: High Computation Cost.\nThe use of PoW or PoW-based consensus mechanisms entails solving computational puzzles to establish the right to generate blocks, ensuring blockchain stability and security.\nHowever, this computational requirement introduces a significant computation cost .\nMoreover, the time spent on solving these puzzles unavoidably slows down the convergence of the training task. Limited Scalability.\nAs we all know, most consensus hardly handles high scalability and decentralization at the same time due to the cost of computation, communication, and time .\nFor example, PoW consensus suffers from low transaction throughput due to intensive hash computation and cannot scale out its transaction processing efficiency with the increase of blockchain nodes.\nBesides, Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)  faces limitations imposed by network bandwidth due to the frequent communication exchanges it requires. Huge Storage Requirement.\nBlockchain operates as a distributed ledger, which necessitates each blockchain node to maintain a record of verified blocks in its local ledger.\nConsequently, the limited storage capacity of nodes significantly hinders information exchange speed within the network, thereby impacting the delivery of services supported by the blockchain. Stragglers.\nMost of the blockchain-enabled FL systems, such as BlockFL , PIRATE , and DeepChain  are processed in a synchronous manner.\nHence, the presence of stragglers hampers training efficiency, similar to traditional FL scenarios.\nCurrently, there is limited research on asynchronous training based on blockchain, let alone the detection of stale models. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical blockchain-driven FL system, named ChainFL, to enhance the scalability and security of decentralized FL.\nBy splitting the large-scale IoT network into multiple shards, the majority of information exchange and storage is limited in the same shard which significantly reduces the communication rounds and storage requirements.\nBesides, the model trained from each shard can be obtained and validated by other shards efficiently with the help of the Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) consensus-based mainchain. Overall, the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: We propose ChainFL, a novel FL system driven by the hierarchical blockchain, with the aim to provide a secure and effective FL solution for large-scale IoT networks.\nWe design a Raft-based blockchain sharding architecture to improve scalability and an adapted DAG-based mainchain to achieve cross-shard interactions.\nTo our knowledge, ChainFL is the first system to leverage a DAG for coordinating multiple shard blockchain networks, thereby improving the security and scalability of FL systems. We define the operation process and interaction rules for ChainFL to perform the FL tasks.\nTo improve learning efficiency, synchronous and asynchronous training are combined in ChainFL to alleviate the negative impact of stragglers.\nMoreover, a virtual pruning mechanism is designed based on the adapted DAG consensus to eliminate the impact of abnormal models. We devise a sharding network prototype leveraging Hyperledger Fabric to instantiate the subchain layer of ChainFL, while developing a DAG-based blockchain to implement the mainchain layer, thereby fulfilling cross-layer interactions.\nThe off-chain storage scheme is adopted in the prototype to reduce the storage requirements of blockchain nodes in both layers.\nThe extensive evaluation results show that ChainFL provides acceptable and sometimes better convergence rates (by up to 14%) compared to FedAvg [ref]3 and AsynFL  for CNNs and RNNs, and enhances the robustness (by up to 3 times) of FL system. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.\nThe related works are reviewed in Section 2.\nSection 3 introduces the architecture of ChainFL, with Section 4 detailing its workflow and consensus.\nImplementation and evaluations are in Section 5 and Section 6, respectively.\nFinally, conclusions and future work are presented in Section 7.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: regarding privacy breaches and the potential for data misuse, highlighting the need for more secure and efficient data processing methods in IoT networks.
