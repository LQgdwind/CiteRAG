      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey of Generative AI for de novo Drug Design: New Frontiers in Molecule and Protein Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAntibody structure prediction extends general protein structure prediction methods, with the key difference lying in the reliance on multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of homologous proteins mapping evolutionary relationships between genetically related sequences. Because the relevant evolutionary histories for CDR-H3 loop sequences are lacking, MSAs in antibodies are not always available. This makes models like AlphaFold [ref]130, designed for general protein structure prediction, highly inefficient and slow. Thus, antibody-specific structural prediction methods seek to predict antibody structure without the need for an input MSA . Models in this field all train on the Structural Antibody Database (SAbDab), with the Rosetta Antibody Benchmark (RAB), used as a validation set in some cases  . Note that “canonical conformations” do not exist for the highly variable H3 region due to high variability, which remains a challenge to structurally model. SAbDab  - Structural Antibody Database, a collection of all antibody structures in PDB . Structures are annotated with antibody-specific structural data like canonical conformations for complementarity determining regions (CDR), orientation between the variable domains on the light and heavy chains, and the presence of constant domains in the structure. RAB  - Rosetta Antibody Benchmark, a hand-selected set of 60 antibody-antigen complexes, chosen to be as diverse in CDR lengths and clusters as possible. Given an antibody amino acid sequence (organized into heavy chain, light chain, and linker sequences), generate a set of 3D point coordinates for each amino acid residue. For benchmarking, models compare similarities between the predicted and ground truth structures through the following metrics: RMSD - Root-mean-square deviation, measures distances between ground truth and generated residue coordinates. Also used in protein structure prediction (see page 4.2.3) OCD  - Orientational coordinate distance, measures similarity between light-heavy orientational coordinates (LHOC) of ground truth and generated residues. LHOC is defined by Marze et al. , consisting of four metrics to measure orientation between light and heavy chains. used root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) to measure the discrepancy between predicted and ground truth 3D structures, while some models , ,  also used orientational coordinate distance (OCD) to measure the accuracy of predicted relative position between heavy and light chains in some cases. tFold-Ab , xTrimoABFold , and ABodyBuilder2  all apply similar methods to AlphaFold, replacing the unnecessary MSA searching component. AbLooper  uses five EGNNS to each individually predict CDR structures, outputting the positional average of the five structures— this allows for the evaluation of confidence as the deviation between these predicted structures. Some models do not predict structures directly: DeepH3 [ref]183 uses a deep residual neural network to first predict structural restraints, using Rosetta to then output atomic structures. SimpleDH3  adds ELMo embeddings to DeepH3, and DeepAb , the most recent version, adds interpretable attention layers to enhance output from the neural network. Igfold  takes advantage of AntiBERTy’s  sequence embeddings to predict antibody structures using invariant point attention. While some other models, such as tFold-Ab , xTrimoABFold , and ABodyBuilder2 , demonstrate more accurate structures, IgFold produces structures at a superior speed, making it the established state-of-the-art model. Igfold’s downside is its reliance on PyRosetta to produce side-chain conformations, as the model Igfold itself only outputs backbone atoms. This adds significant time to the full process, as it takes around 0.46 seconds for Igfold to produce backbone atoms, but an additional 21.86 seconds, on average, for PyRosetta to convert these into full-atom structures . By contrast, tFold-Ab  generates full-atom structures in less time than the Igfold + PyRosetta pipeline (2.23 seconds compared to 22.32 seconds). Notably, in the training process, ImmuneBuilder and xTrimoABFold choose to include antibodies with identical sequences to expose models to antibodies with multiple conformations (identical sequences with different structures). On the other hand, DeepAB includes an entirely non-redundant set of sequences, seeking to expose its model only to unique items. Table 10 presents detailed results for the performance of the discussed models. While IgFold does not have the absolute highest performance in terms of RMSD and OCD when compared to other methods, its speed makes it the state-of-the-art model. This speed advantage is contested only by tFold-Ab, which generates full-atom structures in less time than IgFold, as it circumvents IgFold’s reliance on computationally expensive Rosetta energy functions for side-chain prediction. Note that discrepancies in time results may result from varying benchmarking methods— time results from tFold-ab were reported on their own SAbDab-22H1-Ab/Nano dataset, while time results from IgFold were reported using their IgFold-Ab benchmark.\n\nReference markers found: [130]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]130: genetically related sequences.
