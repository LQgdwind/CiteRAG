      "content": "Paper Title: Distributed and Democratized Learning: Philosophy and Research Challenges\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe generalization mechanism aims to collectively construct the hierarchical generalized knowledge from all existing specialized groups or learning agents, as illustrated in Fig. 6(b). Accordingly, the generalized knowledge extends the generalization capability of the Dem-AI system to learn new tasks or deal with environment changes more efficiently.\nFor this purpose, we propose four strategies that are suitable for different levels: direct knowledge sharing, indirect knowledge sharing, election, and union, which can be fixed or can be realized from a categorical distribution of these strategies.\nAt the lowest-level specialized groups, the direct knowledge sharing of learning agents is possible due to the similarity in the learning task to be performed. At the higher-level specialized groups, the indirect knowledge sharing among subgroups (i.e., transferred knowledge, meta-knowledge) becomes more probable due to the huge differences among specialized groups and the characteristics of learning tasks. Throughout the learning process, the groups become more and more specialized to efficiently solve different complex learning tasks. Consequently, the generalized knowledge of the specialized groups becomes very different at a higher level. Thus, an election mechanism based on voting can help in reaching consensus among specialized groups. To this end, a union mechanism is designed as an ensemble of the collection of highly-specialized groups. This is a possible way to maintain the diversity of potential groups for the entire learning system. Basically, the diversity of potential groups plays a vital role in the learning system. It allows the preservation of ineffective specialized groups who have fewer members or those who show low performance in the training setting, but are potentially able to deal with the changes in the training environment or new tasks. Therefore, the union and election mechanisms of Dem-AI are related to the diversity maintenance of the biological species through natural selection and non-competitive processes (i.e., symbiosis) in the evolution process or the robustness of decentralized systems . In addition to the measurement of efficiency, the robustness or diversity of the Dem-AI system can be measured and controlled throughout the training time following a validation procedure. Hierarchical learning model parameters averaging for knowledge sharing:\nIn the case of a shared generalized model among all group members, the direct knowledge sharing can be designed with the hierarchical averaging of the generalized model parameters (GMP) at each level kùëòk as follows: where ùíÆùíÆ\\mathcal{S} is the set of subgroups of a specialized group, Ng,i(k‚àí1)superscriptsubscriptùëÅùëîùëñùëò1N_{g,i}^{(k-1)} is the number of agents in subgroup iùëñi, and Ng(k)superscriptsubscriptùëÅùëîùëòN_{g}^{(k)} is the total number of agents in the current specialized group at level kùëòk. The model averaging implementation is a typical aggregation mechanism adopted in several FL algorithms [ref]13 . Parameter Œ≥tsuperscriptùõæùë°\\gamma^{t} controls the update frequency of the generalized knowledge whose value decreases over time as the members become well-specialized in their learning knowledge. Accordingly, the model parameters of the subgroups which have more numbers of agents become more important in the generalized model. Knowledge distillation and knowledge transfer:\nFor multiple complex tasks, the Dem-AI framework allows knowledge transfer across tasks in different domains by leveraging collaboration amongst learning agents in the hierarchical structure. In this regard, multi-task learning enables generalization by solving multiple relevant tasks simultaneously [ref]20  . The work in  studied the relationship between jointly trained tasks and proposed a framework for task grouping in MTL setting. Accordingly, the authors have analyzed learning task compatibility in computer vision systems by evaluating task cooperation and competition. For example, a shared encoder and representation is learned through training highly-correlated tasks together such as in Semantic Segmentation, Depth Estimation, and Surface Normal Prediction. However, this framework is limited to analyzing multiple learning tasks for a single agent. Whereas, in Dem-AI systems, a group of agents can train similar tasks in the low-level groups. Meanwhile, highly related tasks can be jointly trained together in the high-level groups. Furthermore, the latent representations across different devices or groups are supported by adopting existing techniques of knowledge distillation, transfer learning, meta-knowledge construction, and specialized knowledge transfer.\nKnowledge distillation  and knowledge transfer among multiple tasks [ref]10  are important techniques to extend the capabilities of knowledge sharing. For example, in , knowledge distillation mechanisms such as exchanging model parameters, model outputs, and surrogate data are incorporated in distributed machine learning frameworks. Meanwhile, knowledge transfer has been recently studied in the federated MTL setting using different types of MTL regularization such as cluster structure, probabilistic priors, and graphical models [ref]10. Moreover, the work  forms a Bayesian network and uses variational inference methods with the lateral connections design between the server and client models to transfer knowledge among tasks. Different from the recent works, the conventional organizational knowledge creation theory  introduced a promising paradigm in which the new knowledge of an organization is articulated from the knowledge of individuals and self-organized in a hierarchical structure. Thus, the shared knowledge can be in an abstract form or an explicit combination of the individual‚Äôs knowledge through the conceptualization and crystallization process. In doing so, together with the hierarchical learning model parameters averaging, we can develop suitable knowledge sharing approaches for the generalization mechanism in our Dem-AI systems.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: is the total number of agents in the current specialized group at level kùëòk.
