      "content": "Paper Title: ALGAN: Time Series Anomaly Detection with Adjusted-LSTM GAN\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA)  and Partial Least Squares (PLS)  are two widely used linear model-based methods for unsupervised anomaly detection that aim to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional data and extract latent features. However, these methods have the limitation of requiring Gaussian distribution and high correlation in the data , which may not be suitable for complex real-world scenarios. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is a widely used method for unsupervised anomaly detection that relies on distance measures .\nHowever, a limitation of distance-based methods is that they require prior knowledge of the duration and the number of anomalies in the data. Angle-Based Outlier Detection (ABOD)  and Feature Bagging (FB)  are probabilistic models based on density estimation that show better performance than distance-based methods. However, a drawback of these methods is that they are unsuitable for time series data as they ignore the temporal correlations [ref]6. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)  , Isolation Forest (IsoF) , and One Class Support Vector Machine (OcSVM)  are widely used methods for anomaly detection in univariate time series data. In this paper, we present experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of GMM over IsoF and OcSVM, and the superiority of neural network-based models over GMM. A brief overview of these methods is provided in Section 5.3. Deep learning-based unsupervised anomaly detection methods such as Auto-Encoder , Encoder-Decoder  and LSTM  [ref]31 have attracted attention in recent years due to their high performance. A recent development in this field is using the GAN framework to build anomaly detection models but mostly for the image domain only. GANs can perform distribution fitting by learning the underlying distribution of the data. The ability of GANs to generate data can help alleviate the problem of insufficient abnormal samples. By training with a dataset that contains only normal samples and learning the feature representations in latent space, the abnormal samples, which are poorly reconstructed, can be detected. However, the time-series domain brings additional challenges due to the requirement to include time dependencies. For example, A GAN-based method enables the learning of generative models that can produce realistic images   .\nAnoGan, a GAN-based unsupervised learning framework, performs anomaly detection in medical imaging data . AnoGan leverages an adversarial network to capture the normal anatomical variability in the data and employs an anomaly scoring scheme that maps images to a latent space and reconstructs them. The reconstruction error is used as an anomaly score, which reflects the deviation of an image from the learned data distribution and can identify anomalous images. Since AnoGan utilises CNNs in its generator and discriminator to effectively handle image data, it lacks any mechanism to account for temporal dependencies in the generator and is not found suitable for time series data. In contrast, [ref]14 developed RGAN, a GAN-based model, that incorporates LSTM units in its generator and discriminator to generate realistic time series data in the medical domain. However, it does not address the problem of anomaly detection.  presents TadGAN for unsupervised anomaly detection in time series data based on GANs. Similar to RGAN, it employs LSTM networks as the base models for both the Generators and the Critics (or discriminator). Another similar model is Heterogeneous Temporal Anomaly-reconstruction GAN (HTA-GAN) proposed in  where Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) is used. Recently, TGAN-AD, a transformer-based GAN  is proposed for anomaly detection. TGAN-AD uses a similar setting as that of RGAN. However, unlike RGAN, it uses transformers in generator and discriminator. Another transformer-based model is proposed by  called Anomaly Transformer. However, Anomaly Transformer uses self-attention weights of each time point as a measure of its association with the whole series, and then computes the association discrepancy between the prior and serial associations. The association discrepancy is based on the observation that anomalies tend to have weak associations with the whole series, and thus concentrate on their adjacent time points. However, the experimental results in  show that the self-attention mechanism is permutation-invariant and anti-ordering, which means that it does not preserve the order and continuity of time series data effectively. \nargues that transformers are not suitable for modelling the temporal relations and dynamics of time series data.\nThere are several advantages to using LSTM for time series data over transformer; (a) LSTM can handle variable-length inputs and outputs more naturally without requiring padding or truncating the sequences to a fixed length, (b) LSTM can explicitly preserve the sequential order of inputs and outputs without relying on positional embeddings, (c) LSTM can be more robust to noise and outliers in the data, and\n(d) LSTM can be easier to interpret and debug. This allows the ALGAN to identify subtle and complex patterns in the data that may be difficult to capture using other networks. The GAN models in  [ref]6 [ref]14 were proposed for anomaly detection in time series datasets. They uses simple LSTM units in generator and discriminator network. However, simple LSTM units are prone to the problem of vanishing gradients, which means that they may have difficulty in learning long-term dependencies in the data. Different from these works, our paper introduces a novel GAN-based framework for anomaly detection in time series data called ALGAN which employs adjusted LSTM units as the generator and discriminator models to handle the long-term temporal dependencies in the data. We benchmark the performance of our ALstm-based GAN model with neural network-based models such as Auto-Encoder , Encoder-Decoder  and LSTM  [ref]31 to illustrate the benefit of ALstm and adversarial training over LSTM and traditional training. Moreover, we show that this architecture can detect anomalies in both small and large datasets, as well as, for both univariate and multivariate data. Neural network-based models typically require a large amount of data to adjust their parameters  [ref]6.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: estimation that show better performance than distance-based methods.
