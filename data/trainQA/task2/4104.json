Herein, the Gaussian process regression module GPy  was used for the construction of the Gaussian process surrogates. The sequential Monte Carlo algorithm based on Algorithm 1 is also implemented in QUEENS. For processing of forward model results the Python package vtk for ”The Visualization Toolkit” was used . Some of the following visualizations were generated with Seaborn  and Matplotlib . Parallel axis plots are generated with plotly [ref]48. We furthermore use PyTorch  for the generation of the Sobol sequences.\nThe forward models were solved with the in-house C++ research code BACI .\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: the Python package vtk for ”The Visualization Toolkit” was used .
