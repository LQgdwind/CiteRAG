      "content": "Paper Title: Hierarchical Symbolic Reasoning in Hyperbolic Space for Deep Discriminative Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExplainable AI (XAI) aims to improve the transparency and trustworthiness of deep learning models  ; XAI can help with identifying biases, which is important for the safe and fair use of prediction models .\nXAI approaches can be broadly categorized into ante-hoc and post-hoc methods .\nAnte-hoc explainability focuses on developing inherently transparent models. For example,  introduces a symbolic reasoning block to promote transparency during training while\n uses natural language descriptions that complement model predictions.\n develops intrinsically aligned models via a debating game with a human judge. Post-hoc explanations are the most commonly explored approaches, including explanations via feature-attribution [ref]8  0, saliency maps 1 2 3 counterfactuals 4 or concept extraction 5 6 7. Feature attribution methods [ref]8  focus on assigning importance weighting to each and every feature in an input space, indicating their contribution towards the classifier’s decision; these methods are also considered shallow example-based explanations as they do not provide any further feedback on the model.\nSaliency-based methods 1\ngenerate attention maps in an input space indicating regions responsible for deriving the classifier’s decision. These methods also provide\nexample-based explanations. However, both feature-attribution and saliency-based explanations do not highlight the model’s perceived feature interactions as they only work on input data, which makes explanations a function of the data as well as of the model. This makes it difficult to assess the faithfulness of explanations towards the model’s reasoning.\nCounterfactual explanation methods 8 9 0 1 help in analysing a classifier by creating several carefully constructed what-if scenarios by perturbing specific features, but are also example-based. These methods overall provide single stage explanations but do not consider concept-based reasoning as perceived by humans 2 3. Concept-based explanations 5 6 7 go beyond feature-attribution and saliency-based methods by constructing higher-level concepts indicating their influence on the classifier’s decision.\n7 6 focus on developing traces, which indicate the flow of reasoning to make certain predictions, thereby considering feature interaction. These approaches are closely related to a popular\nwave of AI termed neuro-symbolic learning 4 5 6 7, where a data-driven deep learning method\nis used to learn sub-symbolic representations to denote concepts while exploiting symbolic methods to capture reasoning.\nIn fact, studies in computational neuroscience have claimed that concept representation in the brain can be in a finite discrete form rather than using continuous and infinitely many representations 8. The notion of hierarchical concept-based reasoning is the most commonly posited learning principle in systems neuroscience 3 9 0 1.\nThis form of reasoning has already been employed in neuro-symbolic AI 2 3 to develop hierarchical representations in the form of knowledge/abstractions graphs and induce hierarchical rules as explanations. However these approaches are limited in developing hierarchical visual reasoning for classification tasks due to a continuous latent space. They do not also consider the natural geometry of the space upon which to develop hierarchical or neuro-symbolic models. Inspired by hierarchical reasoning, we tackle the aforementioned issues to develop hierarchical symbolic explanations for deep discriminative models trained on imaging data. Our approach distills the knowledge from a trained classifier into a discrete surrogate model. We consider the natural geometry in which to develop our discrete surrogate model and form a hierarchical symbolic representation in hyperbolic space of the visual world with the learned interactions between symbols forming an abstraction tree 4.\nThis method makes generated explanations faithful to the classifier rather than the data. It also addresses the issue of non-monotonic behavior of features, by considering discrete symbols which can either be sampled or not.\nOur main contributions in this work include: Symbol formation (Sections 3.2, 3.3): A method to discretise the continuous latent space of a given classifier model into a hierarchy of discrete vectors denoted as symbols. We exploit the natural structure of hyperbolic geometry to more efficiently model this hierarchy. Symbol abstraction and hyperbolic reasoning module (Section 3.3): An effective way of learning symbol conjunction using binary weight layers to form an abstraction tree, which can\nprovide both local image-level and global class-level hierarchical rules. Explanations (Section 3.4): A way of obtaining visual semantics for any given symbol in a hierarchy.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: develops intrinsically aligned models via a debating game with a human judge.
