      "content": "Paper Title: Optimal Testing of Generalized Reed-Muller Codes in Fewer Queries\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe proof of Theorem¬†1.1 is very different from the proofs of¬†   (which proceed by induction on nùëõn) as well as from the proof of¬† (which\nproceeds by presenting a local characterization of the generalized Reed-Muller code and appealing to a general and powerful\nresult due to¬†, that converts local characterizations to local tester). Instead, our proof is inspired by a new approach\nfor establishing such results via global hypercontractivity¬†. Global hypercontractivity is a recently introduced tool that is often useful when working\nwith non small set expander graphs. One corollary of global hypercontractivity (which is\nmorally equivalent) is a useful characterization of all small sets in a graph that have edge expansion bounded away from 111. The study of global hypercontractivity has its roots\nin the proof of the 2-to-2 Games Theorem    [ref]30, however by now it is known to be useful in the study a host of different problems (see for example¬†    [ref]5   ). Below, we explain the global hypercontractivity approach to proving local testability results.\nIn Section¬†1.6 we explain how we extend this\napproach to the realm of generalized Reed-Muller codes in order to analyze the sparse tùë°t-flat tester and prove Theorems¬†1.1,¬†1.2.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: useful characterization of all small sets in a graph that have edge expansion bounded away from 111.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
