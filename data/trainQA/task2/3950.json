      "content": "Paper Title: Computable Artificial General Intelligence\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo measure performance objectively, we would need to remove the interpreting interface between the agent and reality.\nFortunately, this is a new incarnation of an old problem. Cartesian dualism  is the philosophical notion that mind and body are separate. AIXI seems to formalise Cartesian dualism, in that the mind f1subscriptùëì1f_{1} is only connected to reality f3subscriptùëì3f_{3} via a UTM f2subscriptùëì2f_{2}.\nIn other fields, dualism has fallen out of favour because there is far more evidence to support the idea that cognition is embodied, extends into the environment and is enacted by organisms within a purely physical world . For example, if someone uses pen and paper to compute the solution to a math problem, then their cognition is extending into and enacted within the environment . Cognition occurs within the reality that determines what is true and what behaviour will be successful. Because of this, a scenario where intelligence is measured with respect to one reality while cognition takes place in another cannot arise. Formalising enactive cognition [ref]18 would allow us to eliminate the unnecessary distinction between thoughts and actions in favour of general sensorimotor activity. What matters is whether sensorimotor activity satisfies goals , not the distinction between computation and actuation. Notions like mind, body and environment can be discarded ‚Äì what we have instead is a system of sensiromotor circuitry through which sensorimotor activity is enacted.\nTo reconcile enactivism with computation, it would need to be integrated with pancomputationalism (the notion that everything is a computing system) . This would make the universe the UTM, and all of reality (mind, body and environment) the software. The consequence is that where AIXI formalises f3‚Äã(f2‚Äã(f1))subscriptùëì3subscriptùëì2subscriptùëì1f_{3}(f_{2}(f_{1})), enactivism would formalise f2‚Äã(f3‚Äã(f1))subscriptùëì2subscriptùëì3subscriptùëì1f_{2}(f_{3}(f_{1})) which would allow us to maximise performance in terms of f3‚Äã(f1)subscriptùëì3subscriptùëì1f_{3}(f_{1}) without worrying about f2subscriptùëì2f_{2}.\nThe unavoidable downside is that we must formalise cognition in a way that deviates from convention.\nThere can be no interpreting interface between f3subscriptùëì3f_{3} and f1subscriptùëì1f_{1}, so we must formalise reality and then cognition directly within it.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: will be successful. Because of this, a scenario where intelligence is measured with respect to one reality while cognition takes place in another cannot arise. Formalising enactive cognition [ref]18 would allow us to eliminate the unnecessary distinction between thoughts and actions in favour of general sensorimotor activity.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
