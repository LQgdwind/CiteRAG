      "content": "Paper Title: Universal approximation results for neural networks with non-polynomial activation function over non-compact domains\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInspired by the functionality of human brains, (artificial) neural networks have been discovered in the seminal work of McCulloch and Pitts (see ). Fundamentally, a neural network consists of nodes arranged in hierarchical layers, where the connections between adjacent layers transmit the data through the network and the nodes transform this information. In mathematical terms, a neural network can therefore be described as a concatenation of affine and non-affine functions. Nowadays, neural networks are successfully applied in the fields of image classification (see e.g.¬†), speech recognition (see e.g.¬†) and computer games (see e.g.¬†), and provide as a supervised machine learning technique an algorithmic approach for the quest of artificial intelligence (see 3 ). The universal approximation property of neural networks was first proven by Cybenko and Hornik et al.¬†in their seminal works   , which establishes in universal approximation theorems (UATs) the denseness of the set of neural networks within a given function space. For example,   showed an UAT for neural networks with sigmoidal activation function within the space of continuous function over a compact subset of a Euclidean space, which was extended in  to bounded and non-constant activation functions, and in  [ref]9  to non-polynomial activation functions. Moreover,  proved an UAT for neural networks with sigmoidal activation within LpsuperscriptùêøùëùL^{p}-spaces whose measure is compactly supported, which was generalized in  to bounded and non-constant activation function, and in [31, Proposition¬†2] to non-polynomial activation functions. In addition,   included the approximation of the derivatives and showed UATs within Cksuperscriptùê∂ùëòC^{k}-spaces and Sobolev spaces over compact domains. In this paper, we extend these universal approximation theorems (UATs) to more general activation functions and more general function spaces over non-compact domains. More precisely, we show UATs for neural networks with non-polynomial activation function within function spaces that are obtained as completions of the space of bounded and kùëòk-times differentiable functions with bounded derivatives over a possibly non-compact domain with respect to a weighted norm. This allows us to obtain UATs for weighted spaces, LpsuperscriptùêøùëùL^{p}-spaces, and (weighted) Sobolev spaces over unbounded domains, where the latter includes the approximation of the (weak) derivatives. To this end, we combine the Hahn-Banach separation argument with a Riesz representation theorem (see [11, Theorem¬†1] and [14, Theorem¬†2.4]) and follow Korevaar‚Äôs distributional extension (see ) of Wiener‚Äôs Tauberian theorem (see ). This approach also generalizes the UATs in   for neural networks within (weighted) function spaces over non-compact domains by including the approximation of the derivatives. Furthermore, we prove dimension-independent rates to approximate a given function by a single-hidden-layer neural network in a (weighted) Sobolev space. To this end, we apply the reconstruction formula in  (see also ) and use the concept of Rademacher averages. This extends the approximation rates for neural networks with sigmoidal activation in LpsuperscriptùêøùëùL^{p}-spaces (see    ), with periodic activation function in C0superscriptùê∂0C^{0}-spaces and LpsuperscriptùêøùëùL^{p}-spaces (see  ), and with linear combination of polynomially decaying activation functions in Wk,2superscriptùëäùëò2W^{k,2}-Sobolev spaces (see 0) to more general weighted Sobolev spaces and more general activation functions. For a more detailed review of the literature, we refer to   0.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: sigmoidal activation function within the space of continuous function over a compact subset of a Euclidean space, which was extended in  to bounded and non-constant activation functions, and in  [ref]9  to non-polynomial activation functions.
