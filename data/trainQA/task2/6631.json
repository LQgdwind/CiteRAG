      "content": "Paper Title: Landscape Surrogate: Learning Decision Losses for Mathematical Optimization Under Partial Information\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe shortest path (SP) and multidimensional knapsack (MKS) are both classic problems in combinatorial optimization with broad practical applications. In this setting, we consider a scenario where problem parameters 𝐳𝐳\\mathbf{z}, such as graph edge weights and item prices, cannot be directly observed during test time, and instead need to be estimated from 𝐲𝐲\\mathbf{y} via learnable mapping 𝐳=𝐜𝜽​(𝐲)𝐳subscript𝐜𝜽𝐲\\mathbf{z}=\\mathbf{c}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{y}). That is, we consider smart P+O setting. We use standard linear program (LP) formulation for SP and mixed integer linear program (MILP) formulation for MKS. Observed features 𝐲𝐲\\mathbf{y} and the corresponding ground truth problem descriptions 𝐳𝐳\\mathbf{z} for SP are generated using the same procedure as in [ref]38: grid size of 5×5555\\times 5, feature dimension of 𝐲∈ℝ5𝐲superscriptℝ5\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{5} (obtained using a random linear mapping from 𝐳𝐳\\mathbf{z}), 1000 instances for both train and test. For MKS, we increased the knapsack dimension to 5 and capacity to 45, and we set the number of items to 100. Moreover, we use randomly initialized MLP (1 ReLu hidden layer) to generate features of dimension 𝐲∈ℝ256𝐲superscriptℝ256\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{256}. As for the baselines, apart from the naive 2-stage approach, we have SPO+  and DBB , both implemented in PyEPO [ref]38 library. Furthermore, we added LODLs, a novel method from Shah et al. [ref]37. We explored as best as we could all important hyperparameters for all methods on a fixed cross-validation set. Regarding the LANCER, we utilize MLP with 2 tanh hidden layers of size 200 for surrogate model ℳℳ\\mathcal{M}. We set T=10𝑇10T=10 and the number of updates for ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} and 𝐜𝜽subscript𝐜𝜽\\mathbf{c}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} is at most 10. We use SCIP  to solve LP for the shortest path and MILP for knapsack. Further details can be found in Appendix C.1.1. The results are summarized in fig. 2. We report the normalized regret as described in [ref]38. The findings indicate that LANCER and SPO+ consistently outperform the two-stage baseline, particularly when considering the warm start. As SPO+ is specifically designed for linear programs, it provides informative gradients, making it a robust baseline. Even in MKS, where theorems proposed in  are no longer applicable, SPO+ performs decently with minimal tuning effort. The DBB approach, however, demonstrates unsatisfactory default performance but can yield favorable outcomes with proper initialization and tuning (see the right plot). Interestingly, the other P+O baselines, initialized randomly, were unable to outperform a naive 2stg in both benchmarks. LANCER achieves superior performance in both tasks, with a noticeable advantage in MKS. This may be attributed to the high dimension of the MKS problem and the large feature space (𝐲𝐲\\mathbf{y}). One possible explanation is that the sparse gradients of the derivative-based method make the learning problem harder, whereas LANCER models the landscape of f∘g𝑓𝑔f\\circ g, providing informative gradients for 𝐜𝜽subscript𝐜𝜽\\mathbf{c}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: linear program (MILP) formulation for MKS.
