      "content": "Paper Title: MeshDiffusion: Score-based Generative 3D Mesh Modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n3D Shape Generation. 3D shape generation is commonly done by using generative models on voxels  and point clouds , due to their simplicity and accessibility. These resulted (often noisy) voxels or point clouds, however, do not explicitly encode surface information and therefore has to be processed with surface reconstruction methods in order to be used in applications like relighting and simulation. Recent advances in implicit representations  lead to a series of generative models on neural fields  [ref]42 [ref]6 . Based on these representations, one can learn 3D shapes directly from 2D images [ref]42 [ref]6  with differentiable rendering in the generator. Most of these implicit representations, despite representing shapes in a more photorealistic way, require additional post-processing steps to extract explicit meshes, and are often more time-consuming to render images. If the underlying topology is known, one may directly generate the vertices of a mesh  .  extends this approach to the topology-varying case with autoregressive models, sequentially generating vertices and edges, but it is hardly scalable and yields unsatisfactory results on complex geometry. A batch of concurrent work propose similar solutions to mesh generation, including: GET3D  which uses StyleGAN  with a differentiable renderer on tetrahedral grid representations and learns to generate 3D meshes from 2D RGB images, TetGAN  which trains generative adversarial networks (GANs) on tetrahedral grids and LION 4 which uses a trained Shape-As-Points  network to build meshes from diffusion-model-generated latent point clouds. Mesh Reconstruction.\nReconstructing 3D meshes of generic objects is challenging and often ill-posed due to its highly complex structures 2  0  . One often resorts to some non-mesh intermediate representations that are easy to process, and then transforms them back to meshes with mesh reconstruction methods. One of the most popular methods is marching cubes  which assumes that a surface is represented by the zero level set of some continuous field, and this continuous field can be well approximated by linear interpolation of discrete grid points. It is possible to avoid implicit representations and directly construct meshes. For instance, by assuming the points lie on a surface, one can build triangular meshes by connecting these points, a process known as Delaunay triangulation    . It is relatively rare because of its strong assumption on data. With known mesh topology, one can deform a mesh template to fit a given representation. This approach can be easily used to fit multiview images of shapes with known topology (e.g., human faces) using a differentiable renderer . It is recently shown that we are able to parametrize meshes of varying topology 8  and optimize them using differentiable renderers 2, which our work leverages. Score-based Generative Models. Recent years have witnessed a surge in modeling data distributions with score-based models   [ref]16, which parameterizes the logarithm of the gradient of the probability, known as the score function, rather than the probability directly. Different from energy-based models, the often intractable normalization constant can be avoided and therefore training can be performed by simply matching the score function. It has been shown that, by using multi-scale models [ref]16, U-Net architectures  and denoising score matching , score-based models can perform high-fidelity image generation and inpainting [ref]16  .\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: reconstruction methods in order to be used in applications like relighting and simulation.
