Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: CLIPN for Zero-Shot OOD Detection: Teaching CLIP to Say No\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne key research topic in artificial intelligence is studying the relationship between vision and language. Previously, many attention-based methods like BAN , Intra-Inter [ref]11, and MCAN  dominate the visual-language tasks. Then, inspired by BERT [ref]4, many mthods   [ref]34 further contribute to the area via exploiting more advanced transformer architectures and prompt strategies. As transformer-based networks   are successfully deployed into computer vision tasks, CLIP  is proposed to learn informative features from the vision-language pairs on top of the large-size model and datasets via contrastive learning . Further,   demonstrate its impressive generalization to downstream tasks .\nIn addition, following the same lines as [ref]34, there are also many works focusing on improving visual-language models via prompt engineering in computer vision.\nCoOp 0 and CoCoOp  work on changing the manual prompt to the learnable one for the purpose of better matching texts and images in a specific supervised task.\nUnlike these methods that provide more precise text descriptions or supervised guidance, this paper empowers the “no” logic within CLIP by adding learnable “no” prompts and text encoders during the unsupervised pre-trained period.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: One key research topic in artificial intelligence is studying the relationship between vision and language.

Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
