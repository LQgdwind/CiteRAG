Since the network uses the original data and noise to create synthetic data, it can be considered a transformation approach where generated data points mimic the real data distribution. GANs are very popular with image processing applications. Very recently, GANs have been applied in cybersecurity ,  which is a source of heterogeneous data in structured and unstructured form. In the paper , the authors used generative adversarial networks in intrusion detection. Lee and Park  proposed a method for detecting intrusion using GAN and random forest algorithm. The model was built to solve overfitting. The experiments show that the model achieved its goal and performed well in imbalanced datasets. The authors have proposed a conditional GAN  for insider threat detection, which proved to be effective for multiple attack detection with many minority classes. Most of the existing GAN research concentrates on unstructured, continuous data such as images. However, real-world datasets used for classification purposes are mostly tabular and include numerical and categorical attributes. GAN-based augmentation methods are gaining popularity ,\n[ref]26, . GAN-based approaches for modeling tabular data have recently been developed, whereas GAN-based approaches for numeric data are still in the budding stage. Tabular data synthesis comprises a variety of methodologies based on the types of data. It models a joint probability distribution of columns in a table to create a realistic synthetic table. However, due to the limitations of several of these models, such as distributions and processing issues, high-fidelity data synthesis has proven to be challenging. Several GAN-based data generation algorithms for generating synthetic tabular data, notably for healthcare records, have been developed in recent years. These methods can be applied on the numeric feature vectors to generate more samples in various application domains. In the paper [ref]28, the authors mention the various research directions possible in GAN-based analysis; the use of regularization and the need for modified architectures are a few among them.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: as images.
