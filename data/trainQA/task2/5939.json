      "content": "Paper Title: GraphGANFed: A Federated Generative Framework for Graph-Structured Molecules Towards Efficient Drug Discovery\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe discovery of new organic and inorganic molecules remains a challenge in medicine, chemistry, and materials sciences. Traditional approaches to molecular discovery involve mathematical frameworks derived from related properties calculated from chemical structures with different physical or biological reactions  . However, these mathematical frameworks may not fully capture the properties of the chemical structures, limiting the ability to fully explore novel molecules. To address this challenge, computer-aided solutions have been developed that utilize deep learning methods to learn highly complex representations of chemical structures, extract features from existing molecules, and generate new molecules based on the learned features. These approaches have shown promise in facilitating molecular generation [ref]3  [ref]5  and de novo drug design . Deep generative models, one of the deep learning models widely applied in molecular discovery, generate molecules based on features/patterns learned from the existing molecule sets with desired chemical properties. There are two common types of input data for generative models: Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) representations  and molecular graphs . SMILES is a string-based representation, has been applied as the input data type for Natural Language Processing (NLP) deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) 0 and Auto-Encoders 1 2 3 4 5. Recent works have explored the use of RNN-based generative models to learn the properties of the existing molecules represented as SMILES, and then generate novel molecules with the same properties. Auto-Encoder based models consist of an encoder and a decoder, where the encoder encodes the molecules into a latent vector representation and the decoder transforms the latent vectors back to molecules. In contrast to SMILES, molecular graphs use graphs in terms of edges and nodes to represent the structures of molecules. Molecular graphs can represent more detailed structures of molecules than SMILES, thus attracting much attention 1. Fig. 1 shows different molecular representations for generative modeling. Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) is a typical deep learning model that can learn molecular graph representations and analyze the related properties  6 7 8. For example, 9 applies GCN to estimate a specific metric (e.g., novelty, validity, or uniqueness) of a molecule by analyzing the structure of the molecule represented as a molecular graph. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as another popular approach for molecular discovery  [ref]3 . A GAN model consists of a generator and a discriminator that compete with each other. The generator generates realistic new samples that preserve the features of the existing samples to deceive the discriminator, while the discriminator tries to differentiate between the generated and existing samples. The generator and discriminator are trained iteratively, and the generator becomes better at generating realistic samples that deceive the discriminator over time. GANs have been widely used in various image generation tasks and have demonstrated outstanding performance 0 1 2.\nThe performance of GANs for molecular generation can be further improved by integrating GCNs since GCNs can learn more detailed properties of molecules represented as molecular graphs. Hence, the integration of GCN and GAN in drug discovery is worth investigation. To derive an accurate deep learning model for generating new molecules, it is essential to train the model on a large and diverse data set. However, it is not realistic to obtain this data set because the sharing of different pharmaceutical companies’ molecular databases is not always feasible due to the compound intellectual property and strict data regulation 3. One of the existing solutions is that pharmaceutical companies encrypt their data samples and share the encrypted data samples with a third party, which trains the model over the encrypted data samples by using Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) 4. The encryption method, however, cannot fully ensure data privacy, thus hindering collaborative drug discovery.\nRecently, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution to train deep learning models in a distributed and privacy-preserving manner 5. In FL, a centralized FL server broadcasts a global model to all the clients in terms of pharmaceutical companies. Each client trains its received global model over its local data set for several epochs and then uploads its trained local model to the FL server. After that, the FL server aggregates the received local models from the clients to generate a new global model, and then broadcasts the new global model to the clients to start the next global round. This process continues until the global model is converged. The clients only share their local models and do not share their local data sets, which ensures data privacy. Hence, FL can enable pharmaceutical companies to collaborate and train accurate deep learning models on their collective data while preserving data privacy, which is important to accelerate the drug discovery process. In this work, we propose the Graph convolutional network in Generative Adversarial Networks via Federated learning (GraphGANFed) framework for molecular discovery, which leverages FL to train a GAN model that uses GCNs to represent molecules as graphs. In this framework, the discriminator is implemented by a GCN that learns the features/properties of the existing molecules, while the generator is implemented by a multilayer perceptron (MLP) or a multilayer neural network that generates new molecules while preserving the properties of the existing molecules to deceive the discriminator. The discriminator and generator are trained based on FL, which ensures data privacy as each client keeps its data locally. In GraphGANFed, the discriminator evaluates the molecules generated by the generator. This evaluation guides the generator to generate new molecules that preserve features of existing molecules but have different structures, so that the generator can deceive the discriminator later on. Hence, it is critical to design a good discriminator model that can perform an accurate evaluation to guide the generator in generating more realistic new molecules.\nTherefore, we investigate how different discriminator model structures affect the performance metrics (e.g., Validity, Novelty, Diversity, etc.) in our framework GraphGANFed. We also analyze how different dropout ratios affect the evaluation metrics. The main contributions of our work are summarized as follows. We propose a GraphGANFed framework that combines GCN, GAN, and FL to generate novel and effective molecules while preserving data privacy. We implement our GraphGANFed framework and demonstrate its performance based on three benchmark datasets. The results indicate that GraphGANFed generates molecules with high novelty (≈100)absent100\\left(\\approx 100\\right) and diversity (>0.9)absent0.9\\left(>0.9\\right). We investigate the impact of various factors on the performance of GraphGANFed, including the complexity of the discriminator, number of clients, and dropout ratios via extensive simulations. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II presents a brief background and related works regarding molecular discovery, GAN, and GCN. Section III introduces the design of the GraphGANFed architecture, and the metrics to evaluate generated molecules. Section IV discusses the simulation setups and results. Finally, Section V concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: of chemical structures, extract features from existing molecules, and generate new molecules based on the learned features.
