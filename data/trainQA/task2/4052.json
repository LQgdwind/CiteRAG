      "content": "Paper Title: Fast and Accurate Error Simulation for CNNs against Soft Errors\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA large effort has been devoted to the reliability analysis of CNNs as surveyed in . To mention the most relevant works, several papers (e.g.  ) analyzed the effects of faults corrupting the weights of the convolutional layers on the final output to measure the overall resiliency of different CNN models.   presented approaches tracing the error propagation through the layers to analyze application-level error masking and final effects on the final output, and to identify the most critical parts of the CNN. In these works, faults corrupting both the memory storing the weights and the internal registers (causing effects on the final computation) have been considered. The conclusions are that different CNN models exhibit different vulnerabilities depending on the adopted data types and number of layers.\nIn  several metrics are defined to measure the vulnerability of the layers and kernels composing a CNN model; then selective replication is applied to the most vulnerable parts to improve reliability while limiting overhead. A similar approach is proposed in  where an Algorithm-Based Fault Tolerance technique is used to reduce the hardening costs. In , selective Triple Modular Redundancy is used; an interesting aspect of this solution is the idea of considering as critical only those faults that cause the overall application to perform a misclassification.\nFinally, in  an application-aware classification is performed by considering precision and recall on the obtained object detection outputs; selective duplication is also used to harden the most critical portions of the code.\nIn conclusion, due to the variety of possible internal structures and parameters of the CNNs and devices to accelerate such applications, the challenge is still open . As far as FI facilities are concerned, radiation test offers the most adherent solution to cause soft errors, however, apart from the highly expensive equipment and the complex setup, there is little to no controllability on the injection process, and the observability is only on the primary outputs. As a result, it is suitable for final validation and black-box campaigns, not for in-depth analysis and investigations  .\nTo allow for controllability/observability in the campaigns, the most commonly adopted approach is emulating fault effects in the hardware platform running application, that is in the GPU executing the CNN in the present application scenario. GPU-Qin  exploits the CUDA-GDB debugger for NVIDIA devices to inject single bit-flips in the registers exposed by the  Instruction Set Architecture (ISA); the solution is quite sophisticated and presents a 100x slowdown w.r.t. nominal execution. A similar debugging-based approach is used by CAROL-FI , which acts at the source code-level to inject both bit-flips and random values. The introduced performance degradation is below 5x, having both fault injection and error propagation analysis at source code-level. The limitation consists in the limited fault location sites, the used variables, introducing a significant gap between the injected errors and the reality of soft errors affecting the hardware platform. SASSIFI  and LLFI-GPU [ref]16 adopt a different strategy, by instrumenting the source code to support error injection, before executing it on the GPU. SASSIFI, proposed by NVIDIA, can corrupt all ISA registers through several injection modes, with a reported 5x slowdown . LLFI-GPU uses a similar approach, acting at the source code abstraction level, claiming a speedup of about 42x w.r.t. GPU-Qin, with similar benefits as CAROL-FI in terms of the analysis of the propagation of the errors. All these tools rely on complex modification and recompilation mechanisms to enable error emulation thus leading to a considerable performance degradation.\nSome of these tools, such as GPU-Qin , require a long profiling activity; moreover, as commented in , SASSIFI is the only tool working with the NVIDIA proprietary libraries generally employed when implementing CNNs. Indeed, library requirements of the employed FI tool, on the one hand, and of the considered application, on the other hand, may often conflict. As an example, CNNs implemented with the TensorFlow framework cannot be compiled for SASSIFI because they require different CUDA versions. Finally, the code instrumentation mechanism prevents the execution of complex applications; in our tests, a single run of YOLO V3 implemented in the Caffe framework and run in SASSIFI required more than 15 minutes, due to the large amount of data to be transmitted to the GPU. Based on these considerations faster and more accurate tools are required, as it has also been stated in .\nThe work in , contemporary to our work, proposes a new tool for NVIDIA GPUs called NVBitFI. The tool overcomes all limitations of previous solutions by performing a dynamic and selective code instrumentation to enable fault injection. NVBitFI does not require access to the source code, therefore improves both performance and usability. On the other hand, implementation issues still persist when working with external libraries. Working at a higher abstraction level would be beneficial for two reasons: to dominate the complexity of CNN applications, and to accelerate and facilitate experiments set-up and execution. To this end, simulation approaches have been proposed, injecting errors directly in the execution state of the running CNN application.\nThe most representative example is TensorFI ; it is an error simulator specifically tailored for CNNs integrated in the TensorFlow framework. The tool acts at the abstraction level of the application dataflow and injects errors by means of saboteurs that manipulate the output tensor. The tool so emulates the effects of faults affecting the CNN operators execution. A similar strategy developed for other frameworks is the one presented in   , integrated in the Keras, Pytorch and Caffe frameworks, respectively.   introduce two tools developed in Keras and Darknet, supporting only the corruption of the operator weights in the CNN. Finally, the work in  is implemented in PyTorch and is based on a cross-layer approach executing the CNN model in software and switching down to the  Hardware Description Language (HDL) description of the processing unit for the actual injection. This very last approach has not been applied to GPUs due to the high complexity of the corresponding HDL model, when available. The considerable advantage of FES is that it can be easily integrated within the ML frameworks used in the design phase. Therefore, the CNN reliability analysis and hardening can be performed from the early phases and in the same environment of its design and training.\nMoreover, this high-level approach decouples the reliability analysis from the actual execution on the final device (CPU or GPU or custom hardware accelerator), thus sensibly easing the activity.\nOn the other hand, the main criticality when working at such high abstraction level, is the need of sound and complete error models, able to reproduce all and only the effects of physical faults occurring in the underlying hardware.\nIn   only bit-flips in the weights are considered, neglecting the effects of faults affecting the processing unit, while in   single or multiple bit-flips on the outputs of the CNN operators are also considered.\nPyTorchFI  allows to inject random values, single bit-flips or zero values both in the weights and in the operator outputs; indeed, the paper explicitly states the necessity of defining more advanced error models describing the effects of faults affecting the underlying hardware. Finally, TensorFI adopts more advanced multiple-value corruptions, which sometimes poses problems to correlate the corruption effect to a real physical fault able to induce such an error, as we will discuss later in the paper.\nSince the goal of the reliability analysis is to explore how a well designed and trained CNN behaves when an unexpected problem in the underlying hardware occurs, it is fundamental to use error models that correspond to the effects caused by faults. In particular two risks are associated with error simulation: considering errors that cannot be the result of a real fault or ignoring effects of statistically relevant faults. As a consequence, the overall analysis might lead to inaccurate conclusions and tailoring hardening solutions that do not fit real needs.\nTherefore, validated error models are vital to enable the adoption of error simulation. Fidelity  and BinFi  are the most recent works similar to our proposal. The former defines suitable error models adherent to what is observed through FI and analyses the effects of the faults in terms of the  Architectural Vulnerability Factor (AVF). The latter focuses on identifying the safety-critical bits in ML applications, relying on TensorFI for the injection of bit-flips in the operators. The effects of the faults on the outputs are analyzed with respect to the application, to determine the actual impact in the case of safety-critical contexts. Our framework integrates and merges both strategies, extracting different but comparable error models w.r.t. Fidelity, and performing a classification of the effects similar to the one in BinFI, yet based on a different error injection solution with the limitations of the existing FES based on TensorFI. In doing so, our proposal fills the gap between FI, FES and an application-related resiliency classification. As future work, we will investigate how Fidelity’s error models can be used in CLASSES, and how CLASSES’s final output can be re-formulated in terms of the metric adopted by BinFI. Figure 3 shows a graphical summary of the reviewed literature and positions our cross-layer proposed approach. It exploits FES, integrating the facility in the most popular ML framework and adopting sound error models opportunely extracted by means of accurate low-level FI campaigns on the target hardware platform.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: the limited fault location sites, the used variables, introducing a significant gap between the injected errors and the reality of soft errors affecting the hardware platform.
