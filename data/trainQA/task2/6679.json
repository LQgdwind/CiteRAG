      "content": "Paper Title: Training-Based Model Refinement and Representation Disagreement for Semi-Supervised Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA systematic ablation analysis of the proposed approach, integrated into the Unbiased-Teacher-v1 [ref]15 and Unbiased-Teacher-v2 [ref]16, has been conducted using a 5% labeled COCO-standard and Pascal VOC datasets. The analysis includes 121212 configurations (see Table¬†4 & Table¬†5), including:\ni) baseline [ref]15 with the Faster-RCNN and classical EMA (A1),\nii) A1 equipped with TMR stage (A11),\niii) A11 equipped with RD strategy (A12),\niv) baseline [ref]16 with the Faster-RCNN and classical EMA (A2),\nv) A2 equipped with TMR stage (A21),\nvi) A21 equipped with RD strategy (A22),\nvii) baseline [ref]15 equipped with cascade regression and classical EMA (A3),\nviii) A3 equipped with TMR stage (A31),\nix) A31 equipped with RD strategy (A32),\nx) baseline [ref]16 equipped with cascade regression and classical EMA (A4),\nxi) A4 equipped with TMR stage (A41), and\nxii) A41 equipped with RD strategy (A42).\nThese analyses validate the effectiveness of our TMR stage and RD strategy. Effect of TMR stage:\nWe first ablate the impact of the proposed TMR stage integrated into both baselines with or without cascade regression. According to the results of A11, A21, A31, and A41 in Table¬†4 and Table¬†5, the baselines of [ref]16 and [ref]15 with the Faster-RCNN are notably outperformed by the proposed TMR stage, with average mAP improvements of 2.12 and 2.03, respectively. Moreover, incorporating our TMR stage considerably enhances the performance of these baselines by 2.69 and 2.47 mAP, respectively, when employing the base detector with cascade regression.\nThese results further demonstrate the versatility of our method and its ability to improve overall performance and generalization of existing methods.\nWe also validated the efficacy of the TMR stage by visually analyzing the mAP improvement of baseline [ref]16 in Fig.¬†3(a).\nWhile our model (shown in green) was trained with fewer SSL steps (For comparability purposes considering our cyclic SSL and TMR stages), our method effectively refines the models to transfer reliable knowledge while preventing them from misleading information and converging too early (unlike the baseline [ref]16 shown in red). Effect of RD Strategy:\nThe results of experiments A12, A22, A32, and A42 provide compelling support for the usefulness of the proposed RD strategy. These results demonstrate that the performance of [ref]16 and [ref]15 baselines utilizing the Faster-RCNN detector are surpassed by employing the proposed RD strategy with average mAP improvements of 0.82 and 0.77, respectively. Notably, the integration of this strategy led to satisfactory effects in the performance of the baseline [ref]16 as shown in Fig.¬†3(a). It validates the complementary effect of this strategy and demonstrates how it promotes the mutual learning of Teacher-Student models by reinforcing model distinctiveness. Effect of SSL and TMR iterations: We conducted additional ablations, as illustrated in Fig.¬†3(b), to analyze the impacts of various SSL and TMR iterations on model performance using baseline [ref]15.\nThe best result (blue curve) was achieved when employing cyclic SSL and TMR stages with N=4ùëÅ4N=4k and N‚Ä≤=2superscriptùëÅ‚Ä≤2N^{\\prime}=2k iterations.\nThe red curve highlights the necessity for models to undergo sufficient evolution during the SSL stage before each subsequent TMR refinement while increasing the SSL stage (green curve) can result in a delay in model refinement and slight performance degradation, as the teacher model is expected to generate more accurate predictions than the student model [ref]24. Also, increasing the number of TMR iterations with partially labeled data can impede the subsequent joint evolution of models using unlabeled data (orange curve).\n (a) (b)\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: A systematic ablation analysis of the proposed approach, integrated into the Unbiased-Teacher-v1 [ref]15 and Unbiased-Teacher-v2 [ref]16, has been conducted using a 5% labeled COCO-standard and Pascal VOC datasets.
