      "content": "Paper Title: Meta-Adaptive Nonlinear Control: Theory and Algorithms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMeta-learning and representation learning. Empirically, representation learning and meta-learning have shown great success in various domains [ref]7. In terms of control, meta-reinforcement learning is able to solve challenging mult-task RL problems [ref]8 [ref]9 . We remark that learning representation for control also refers to learn state representation from rich observations   , but we consider dynamics representation in this paper. On the theoretic side,    have shown representation learning reduces sample complexity on new tasks, and “task diversity” is critical. Consistently, we show OMAC enjoys better convergence theoretically (Corollary 4) and empirically, and Theorem 6 also implies the importance of environment diversity. Another relevant line of theoretical work 5 6 7 uses tools from online convex optimization to show guarantees for gradient-based meta-learning, by assuming closeness of all tasks to\na single fixed point in parameter space. We eliminate this assumption by considering a hierarchical or nested online optimization procedure. Adaptive control and online control. There is a rich body of literature studying Lyapunov stability and asymptotic convergence in adaptive control theory  . Recently, there has been increased interest in studying online adaptive control with non-asymptotic metrics (e.g., regret) from learning theory, largely for settings with linear systems such as online LQR or LQG with unknown dynamics     8. The most relevant work  gives the first regret bound of adaptive nonlinear control with unknown nonlinear dynamics and stochastic noise. Another relevant work studies online robust control of nonlinear systems with a mistake guarantee on the number of robustness failures 9. However, all these results focus on the single-task case. To our knowledge, we show the first non-asymptotic convergence result for multi-task adaptive control. On the empirical side,   combine adaptive nonlinear control with meta-learning, yielding encouraging experimental results. Online matrix factorization. Our work bears affinity to online matrix factorization, particularly the bandit collaborative filtering setting  0 . In this setting, one typically posits a linear low-rank projection as the target representation (e.g., a low-rank factorization of the user-item matrix), which is similar to our bilinear case. Setting aside the significant complexity introduced by nonlinear control, a key similarity comes from viewing different users as “tasks” and recommended items as “actions”. Prior work in this area has by and large not been able to establish strong regret bounds, in part due to the non-identifiability issue inherent in matrix factorization. In contrast, in our setting, one set of latent variables (e.g., the wind condition) has a concrete physical meaning that we are allowed to measure (ObserveEnv in Algorithm 1), thus side-stepping this non-identifiability issue.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Meta-learning and representation learning.
