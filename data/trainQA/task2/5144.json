      "content": "Paper Title: Structural Knowledge Distillation for Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSeveral methods have been proposed that use KD for object detectors, where it has been found that typically guidance at the intermediate feature level rather than the output is critical due to the complex nature of the output space in detection models     [ref]15 [ref]25 3 5.\nAs the detection task requires the identification of multiple objects at different locations, a major complexity introduced is the imbalance between foreground and background, which manifests itself in the intermediate features.\nTypically, the assumption is made that object regions are \"knowledge-dense\", and background regions less so. As a result, recent work has implicitly focused on designing mechanisms which sample object-relevant features to distill knowledge from   [ref]15 [ref]25 5. Li et al. [ref]15 (2017) mimic the features sampled from the region proposals in a two stage detector.\nWang et al. [ref]25 (2019) propose imitation masks which locate knowledge dense feature locations based on the annotated boxes. Dai et al.  (2021) propose a module which distills based on distance between classification scores.\nSimilarly, Zhixing et al. 5 (2021) use output class probability to determine feature object probability.\nRecently Kang et al.  (2021) proposed a method in which they encode instance annotations in an attention mechanism  to locate \"knowledge-dense\" regions. Contrary to aforementioned methods, Zhang and Ma 3 (2021) propose a purely feature-based method in which they aim to both mimic the attention maps 6 as a sampling mechanism, and furthermore distill through non-local modules .\nRegardless of the sampling technique, it has been demonstrated by Guo et al.  (2021) that it is not necessarily the case that background features are less important for distillation.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: detectors, where it has been found that typically guidance at the intermediate feature level rather than the output is critical due to the complex nature of the output space in detection models     [ref]15 [ref]25 3 5.\nAs the detection task requires the identification of multiple objects at different locations, a major complexity introduced is the imbalance between foreground and background,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
