      "content": "Paper Title: Learning in Audio-visual Context: A Review, Analysis, and New Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHumans have the ability to predict information of one modality with the guidance of others. For example, even only having the visual information of lip motion, we can infer what the person is speaking. The rich audio-visual consistency makes it possible for machines to mimic human-like cross-modal generation ability. Mono Sound Generation. The correlation between motion and produced sound provides the possibility to reconstruct the audio signal based on silent videos. The scenes of mono sound generation cover speech reconstruction, music generation as well as natural sound generation. Under the speech scenarios, the speech content can be revealed by visual information, including the movement of lips and tongue. This fact inspires the speech reconstruction task which aims to generate the audio signal from silent videos.\nEarly studies of this task proposed to estimate the spectral envelope from the hand-crafted visual feature, then the spectral envelope is used to synthetic corresponding audio signal  . Since it is time-consuming and hard to construct suitable hand-crafted visual features, the subsequent works learnt to extract visual features from raw data   .\nTo avoid the burden of learning audio-related intermediate representation, the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) based model is proposed to directly synthesize audio waveform from silent videos  .\nMoreover, considering video of one single view is hard to capture complete information, multi-view videos (e.g., frontal and profile views) are used to improve generation quality  . Musical scene is another typical audio-visual scenario. To generate high-quality music, intermediate representations, like musical instrument digital interface, are utilized to bridge the visual changes of playing instruments and generated audio.\nEarly studies of music generation focused on relatively simple musical scenes, especially the piano case, using traditional computer vision techniques to capture the changes of instrument . More recently, deep learning-based models, including Variational Autoencoder and GANs, have emerged to capture the playing motion in terms of body keypoints   and movements  in general instrument scenes.\nThe above methods aim to produce determined music based on strict audio-visual correspondence, while Di et al.  leveraged the rhythmic relations between video and music at the semantic level to generate non-determined background music, matching the given video. Further, the sound generation of natural scenes is more challenging since the audio-visual correspondence in realistic scenes is hard to be captured, compared with the limited speech or musical scenes. Owens et al.  pioneered the natural sound generation task via collecting the Greatest Hits dataset and presented a model that generates sound based on visual changes of hitting or scratching objects. Subsequently, Zhou et al.  employed the SampleRNN model to generate raw waveform samples given the visual appearance and optical flow, covering ambient sounds and sounds of animals or peoples. Chen et al.  took the object-irrelevant background sound into consideration, achieving high-quality results. Recently, Iashin et al.  presented an efficient visual-driven generation method via a codebook representation that is trained by a variant of GANs. Generally, mono sound generation has been a flourishing field, covering multiple audio-visual scenarios. Spatial Sound Generation. Humans’ audition system can determine the location of hearing sounds, which is called the binaural effect. The recorded binaural audio is then expected to recover the stereo sound sensation. However, recording such a spatial sound requires special equipment that is not easily accessible. Hence, the audio-visual spatial consistency inspires researchers to generate spatial sound with the guidance of visual information. Li et al.  proposed to generate the stereo sound of a specific room via integrating synthesised early reverberation and measured late reverberation tail, while Morgado et al.  adopted an end-to-end deep neural framework for ambisonic sound generation using 360∘superscript360360^{\\circ} videos. However, 360∘superscript360360^{\\circ} videos are limited in amounts and scenarios, making these methods cannot generalize to other environments well.\nSubsequently, some studies are proposed to use the Normal Field of View (NFOV) videos for reconstructing binaural audio from mono sound, driven by the visual location of the sounding source   .\nThese methods are built in a data-driven way, relying on the ground truth stereo sound as the supervision. Although they achieve promising performance, the supervised manner narrows their application to the specific scenes. Thus, Zhou et al.  formulated the spatial sound generation task into an extreme case of sound separation, combining stereo sound and mono sound as training data to improve model performance and generalization. To further alleviate the dependence on the insufficient and expensive stereo sound, Xu et al.  utilized the head-related impulse response and spherical harmonic decomposition to build pseudo visual-stereo pairs from mono sound data. Instead, Lin et al.  exploited the association between each audio component and the spatial regions of interest to explore the audio-visual spatial consistency. As stated, spatial sound generation methods gradually alleviate reliance on ground truth stereo videos, expanding their application scenarios. Video Generation. Besides video-to-sound generation, sound-to-video generation is also a research field with much attention, which contains speech-based cases and music-based cases. The speech-based generation mainly includes talking face/head generation and gesture generation.\nThe former task aims to produce determined videos based on the input speech, and the latter focuses on predicting plausible content-related gestures.\nThe early talking face generation methods are speaker-dependent and rely on a large video corpus of the target person  [ref]147. For example, Suwajanakorn et al. [ref]147 proposed to generate the talking image via retrieving the appropriate lip region in the video footage of the target person. Subsequently, speaker-independent face generation methods in an audio-driven manner are presented  . These methods only focus on the generation of face or lip region, while when a person is speaking, other parts (e.g., facial expression and head pose) besides lips are also variable. Hence, researchers introduced structural information, such as landmark    and 3D model   , to model the correlation between speech and more general facial parts.\nZhou et al.  further proposed an implicit low-dimension pose code to generate the pose-controllable talking face without the assistance of structural information. Such strategy could avoid the performance degradation caused by inaccuracy estimated structural representation.\nRecently, the emotion information is disentangled from the speech to drive more fine-grained talking face generation . Talking alongside gestures is common for humans, which is helpful to emphasize specific information during communication. The alignment between gesture and speech is implicit and ambiguous, bringing difficulty to its modelling. In the early stage, the gesture generation methods are mostly rule-based, resulting in the produced gesture being limited to a selected discrete set  . With the advance of deep learning, more methods begin to use the data-driven scheme to fully model the speech-gesture alignment pattern of different speakers, utilizing 2D  [ref]161 or 3D pose model  . The early methods formulated this task as a classification problem , while more recent works consider it as the regression problem to generate continuous gesture  . Since each speaker often owns a specific speech-gesture alignment style, Ginosar et al.  proposed to model this speaker-specific style during generation. Ahuja et al.  further transferred the learnt style of one speaker to another via disentangling the style and content of gestures. Recently, Liang et al. [ref]161 decoupled speech information into semantic-relevant cues and semantic-irrelevant cues to explicitly learn and produce semantic-aware gestures. Dancing to music is another sound-to-video generation scenario. The exploration of the alignment between dance and music characteristics (e.g., beat, rhythm and tempo) has attracted much attention for a long time. The early works of dance generation tackle this task as a retrieval problem that mainly consider the motion-music similarity, limiting the diversity of dance   . Later, models, like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), were widely used to predict motion and pose given a music . Recently, the dance generation task has been formulated from a generative perspective and achieved promising performance [ref]169  . For example, Lee et al. [ref]169 adopted the decomposition-to-composition learning framework to temporally align and synthesize dance with accompanying music. Further, Huang et al.  took the music genre into consideration, beyond the alignment in terms of beat and rhythm.\nBesides dancing to music, Shlizerman et al.  focused on the scenario of playing instruments. They proposed to generate plausible motion of playing given music.\nApart from these video generation tasks spanning various scenarios, several related methods are also proposed to manipulate the image content according to audio information  . In a nutshell, the sound-to-video generation has produced many extraordinary works, which have the potential to facilitate a wide range of applications in practice. Depth Estimation. Apart from the spatial sound generation based on visual input, it is feasible to use spatial sound to estimate the spatial information of visual scene, especially in low-light or no-light conditions. The spatial consistency between audio and visual modalities makes this task achievable.\nChristensen et al.  proposed the BatVision system that predicts depth maps purely based on binaural echo information. Meanwhile,\nGao et al.  offered a new training fashion that interacts with the environment in an audio-visual way. They fused the monocular image features and binaural echo features to improve the depth estimation quality.\nBeyond simply fusing audio-visual features, Parida et al.  explicitly took the material properties of various objects within a scene into consideration, significantly enhancing the depth estimation performance. The above methods tend to use a single audio feature, typically spectrogram, and other audio features are seldom been paid attention to. Hence, Irie et al.  introduced angular spectrum, which is useful in geometric prediction tasks, achieving impressive estimation results. Overall, audio-visual depth estimation is a developing field that promises to expand into more realistic scenarios of application.\n\nReference markers found: [147]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]147: and the latter focuses on predicting plausible content-related gestures.\nThe early talking face generation methods are speaker-dependent and rely on a large video corpus of the target person  [ref]147. For example, Suwajanakorn et al. [ref]147 proposed to generate the talking image via retrieving the appropriate lip region in the video footage of the target person. Subsequently,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
