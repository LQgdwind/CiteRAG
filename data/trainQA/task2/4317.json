      "content": "Paper Title: Bridging the Gap between Object and Image-level Representations for Open-Vocabulary Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe conduct COCO experiments using Faster R-CNN  with ResNet-50 backbone. We train the supervised-base model on 48 base classes (𝒞Bsubscript𝒞B\\mathcal{C}_{\\text{B}}) for 1x schedule (∼similar-to\\sim12 COCO epochs)\nand report box AP50. For RKD, we finetune this model for another 1x schedule using box labels from 𝒞Bsubscript𝒞B\\mathcal{C}_{\\text{B}} and class-agnostic proposals from the pretrained MViT [ref]8. This model is further finetuned for 1x schedule with ILS and the associated weight transfer function using class labels from COCO captions and corresponding class-specific proposals from MViT. This sums to an overall 3x training schedule. For LVIS experiments, we use Mask R-CNN  with federated loss [ref]46 and sigmoid cross-entropy, and report mask AP. For RKD and weight transfer, we use the same training schedules as of COCO and report the average over three runs. For comparison with Detic , we apply our proposed method on their strong CenterNetV2 [ref]46 baseline under the same settings. It uses ImangeNet21K pretrained backbone with 4x schedule using large scale jittering (LSJ) [ref]47 augmentations. All of our models are trained using 8 A100 GPUs with an approximate training time of 9 and 6 hours for 1x schedule of COCO and LVIS respectively. In our experiments, we use SGD optimizer with a weight decay of 1​e−41superscript𝑒41e^{-4} and a momentum of 0.9. We train for 1x schedule with batch size of 16 and an initial learning rate of 0.02 which drops by a factor of 10 at the 8th and 11th epoch. We set temperature τ𝜏\\tau to 50. Our longer schedules experiments use 100-1280 LSJ [ref]47. We use α𝛼\\alpha of 0.1 to weight ℒp​m​ssubscriptℒ𝑝𝑚𝑠\\mathcal{L}_{pms}. For computing CLIP embeddings we use the CLIP model ViT-B/32 , with input size of 224×\\times224. We use the query ‘a photo of a {category}’ for to compute the text embeddings for the classifier. For distillation, we use top 5 proposals from the pretrained MViT [ref]8 evaluated with generic query, ‘all objects’, generating class-agnostic proposals. We refer to Appendix D for additional details on the approach we use to generate class-agnostic and class-specific proposals from MViT. In COCO experiments, we set weights β1subscript𝛽1\\beta_{1} and β2subscript𝛽2\\beta_{2} to 0.15. In LVIS, we set β1subscript𝛽1\\beta_{1} to 0.15 and β2subscript𝛽2\\beta_{2} to 0.25. We choose these values using a randomized hyper-parameter search on the corresponding held-out datasets. The 2-layer MLP in our weight transfer function has a hidden dim of 512, and a hidden dim of 1024 is used in the MLP skip connection across WPsubscript𝑊𝑃W_{P} in Fig. 1 (refer to Appendix C for more details).\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: epochs)\nand report box AP50.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
