      "content": "Paper Title: Seeing your sleep stage: cross-modal distillation from EEG to infrared video\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare our SACD with the only infrared video baseline models without any distillation, and six state-of-the-art other distillation methods (Fitnet [ref]42, PKT [ref]43, CRD , IFD , CMC [ref]29, CCL). For the fairness and comprehensiveness of the experiments, we train each model on the same experimental setup but replace the distillation objective based on their open-source implementation. As shown in Table II, our method achieves state-of-art in the accuracy (ACC), macro-averaged F1-score (MF1), Cohen Kappa (Œ∫ùúÖ\\kappa) and per-class accuracy. By comparison, we found that CRD  and CCL  are the two most powerful opponents. Both methods apply contrastive learning, which indirectly shows that contrastive learning can significantly improve the cross-modal tasks. However, we are using a new contrastive learning method which has enabled us to achieve an overall lead in all evaluation metrics. Specifically, our method SACD is 11.9% (52.5%-64.4%) higher than the baseline in terms of accuracy, and there is also a 12.3% (46.6%-58.9%) and 0.13 (0.47-0.60) increase in both MF1 and Œ∫ùúÖ\\kappa, respectively. Compared to our next closest rival CCL, we are also 2.1% (62.3%-64.4%), 1.9% (57.0%-58.9%) and 0.04 (0.56-0.60) higher in ACC, MF1 and Œ∫ùúÖ\\kappa, respectively; and our method is also higher than the CCL in all five separate sleep stages, as shown in the TABLE II. The above results show that our method SACD has superior performance on our dataset S3‚ÄãV‚ÄãEsuperscriptùëÜ3ùëâùê∏S^{3}VE and outperforms other SOTA methods under various evaluation metrics. To demonstrate that our cross-modal distillation method works not only under a single EEG modality baseline (AttnSleep), we also performed experiments similar to the previous section under more SOTA EEG baselines. Therefore, we chose DeepSleepNet  and a single-channel version of SEN-DAL  (no EOG signal is input, only a single-channel EEG signal is input, and the two output heads of Label Prediction and Domain Classification are still retained) as the EEG modality baseline, and the experimental results are shown in TABLE II. When DeepSleepNet is selected as the EEG modality‚Äôs baseline, our SACD exceeds other cross-modal distillation methods, including CRD and CCL, in the S3‚ÄãV‚ÄãEsuperscriptùëÜ3ùëâùê∏S^{3}VE dataset. Specifically, compared to the IR video modality baseline, SACD outperforms ACC, MF1 and Œ∫ùúÖ\\kappa by 6.1% (54.6%-60.7%), 6.8% (47.8%-54.6%) and 0.08 (0.46-0.54), respectively. In addition to this, SACD is superior to existing SOTA methods in per-class accuracy. When a single-channel version of SEN-DAL (Modified-SEN) is chosen as the baseline for our EEG modality, our SACD outperforms the baseline by 7.7% (54.9%-62.6%), 6.7% (48.9%-55.6%) and 0.08 (0.48-0.56) for ACC, MF1 and kappa, respectively. Furthermore, compared to our most competitive rival CCL, our SACD improves by 2% (60.6%-62.6%), 1.4% (54.2%-55.6%) and 0.03 (0.53-0.56) for ACC, MF1 and Œ∫ùúÖ\\kappa, respectively. In terms of per-class accuracy, our methodology is significantly better than the current one, except for the N‚Äã1ùëÅ1N1 stage, where our SACD is slightly lower than the CCL. To illustrate that our proposed distillation method is not only applicable to our S3‚ÄãV‚ÄãEsuperscriptùëÜ3ùëâùê∏S^{3}VE dataset, we also conduct experiments on the UCF51  public dataset. UCF51 is a subset of UCF101 that contains audio in videos, including 6,845 videos from 51 action classes. We use the public split 1 for evaluation. We choose the pre-trained audio encoder 1D-CNN14  trained on AudioSet  as the teacher and freeze its parameters. The experimental results are shown in TABLE III and our SACD also obtains the state-of-the-art consistently and improves over the prior methods. Specifically, in terms of ACC, our SACD improved by 8.5% (57.5%-66.0%) over the baseline method and by 1.1% (64.9%-66.0%) over CCL. The results show that our method can also achieve superior distillation results on other datasets. In general, the above-mentioned mainstream distillation methods we compare include single-modal distillation and cross-modal distillation, and the latter three methods also apply contrastive learning. Compared with them, we first introduce structural similarity across modalities, aiming to improve the ability to deal with weak inter-class gaps while narrowing the semantic gap. Secondly, we apply two KùêæK-hard negative samples to train highly transferable sample visual representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves cross-modal distillation on the S3‚ÄãV‚ÄãEsuperscriptùëÜ3ùëâùê∏S^{3}VE dataset. It also indicates that it can do sleep stage classification with reasonable accuracy from IR sleep videos alone.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: We compare our SACD with the only infrared video baseline models without any distillation, and six state-of-the-art other distillation methods (Fitnet [ref]42, PKT [ref]43, CRD , IFD , CMC [ref]29, CCL).
