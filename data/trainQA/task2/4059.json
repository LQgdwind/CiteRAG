Specifically, IML user studies can differ in the independent variable that is changed (e.g., the explanation method used   or the visualization of the explanation ) and the dependent variable(s) being measured (e.g., the user’s performance on a use case    8  4, time taken to complete the use case , or trust in the ML model ). We focus on the set of user studies that measure how different explanation methods (independent variable) affect how accurately users can complete a use case (dependent variable). We group existing user studies on explanations that measure the accuracy of users on a use case into two categories. The first category studies the utility of explanations in use cases where the predictiveness of the explanation method is already known to researchers. For example,   8  ask users to answer simple comprehension questions about a decision set explanation, where these explanations contain the information necessary to complete the use case with perfect accuracy. Thus, these studies measure humans’ ability to comprehend and interpret the explanations without error. In contrast, the second category includes studies where the predictiveness of the explanation method is not known to researchers in advance of their study   . Our framework was developed to aid researchers in this second setting to quickly validate whether or not an explanation method is predictive for their use case. Algorithmic frameworks for evaluating explanations:\nOne line of evaluation frameworks focuses on automating the ability to measure desirable properties relating to the faithfulness of the explanation to the model 2  , which does not account for any downstream use cases for the explanation. In contrast, our algorithmic evaluation framework allows researchers to customize and perform a use case grounded evaluation of explanation methods. We were able to identify one-off examples that use algorithmic agents to perform use case grounded evaluations in prior work   3 . All of these examples propose evaluations designed around one specific use case. Our framework is more general, and can be applied to a wide variety of use cases for explanations. Our work is the first to propose a learning-based agent to identify which explanation methods may be predictive for a downstream use case. We provide a more in-depth discussion of how these examples can be contextualized in our general framework in Appendix A.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: Types of User Studies on Explanations: Many prior works run user studies to evaluate IML methods, covering a diverse set of goals [ref]30.
