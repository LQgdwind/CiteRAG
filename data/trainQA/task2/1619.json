An NNF is decomposable if for each conjunction\nnode ⋀i=1nϕisuperscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖\\bigwedge_{i=1}^{n}\\phi_{i}, no two children ϕisubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖\\phi_{i} and ϕjsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑗\\phi_{j}\nshare any variable. An NNF is deterministic if for each disjunction\nnode ⋁i=1nϕisuperscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖\\bigvee_{i=1}^{n}\\phi_{i}, each pair of different\nchildren ϕisubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖\\phi_{i} and ϕjsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑗\\phi_{j} is logically contradictory, that is ϕi∧ϕj⊧⊥modelssubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑗bottom\\phi_{i}\\land\\phi_{j}\\models\\bot for i≠j𝑖𝑗i\\neq j. In other terms, only one child can be true at any time.222In the case ϕisubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖\\phi_{i} and ϕjsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑗\\phi_{j} are seen as events in a sample space, the determinism can be equivalently rewritten as ϕi∩ϕj=∅subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑗\\phi_{i}\\cap\\phi_{j}=\\emptyset and hence P​(ϕi∩ϕj)=0𝑃subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑗0P(\\phi_{i}\\cap\\phi_{j})=0.

In particular, [37, Theorem 4] shows that\nevaluating a d-DNNF representation of the propositional theory T𝑇T\nfor a semiring and labelling function with neutral (⊕,ρ)direct-sum𝜌(\\oplus,\\rho)\nis a sound AMC computation. A semiring addition and labelling function pair (⊕,ρ)direct-sum𝜌(\\oplus,\\rho) is\nneutral iff ∀v∈𝒱:ρ​(v)⊕ρ​(¬v)=e⊗:for-all𝑣𝒱direct-sum𝜌𝑣𝜌𝑣superscript𝑒tensor-product\\forall v\\in\\mathcal{V}:\\rho(v)\\oplus\\rho(\\neg v)=e^{\\otimes}. Unless specified otherwise, in the following we will refer to d-DNNF circuits labelled with probabilities or distributions of probability simply as circuits, and any addition and labelling function pair (⊕,ρ)direct-sum𝜌(\\oplus,\\rho) are neutral. Also, we extend the definition of the labelling function such that it also operates on {⊥,⊤}bottomtop\\{\\bot,\\top\\}, i.e. ρ​(⊥)=e⊕𝜌bottomsuperscript𝑒direct-sum\\rho(\\bot)=e^{\\oplus} and ρ​(⊤)=e⊗𝜌topsuperscript𝑒tensor-product\\rho(\\top)=e^{\\otimes}. Let us now introduce a graphical notation for circuits in this paper: Figure 1 illustrates a d-DNNF circuit where each node has a unique integer (positive or negative) identifier. Moreover, circled nodes are labelled either with ⊕direct-sum\\oplus for disjunction (a.k.a. ⊕direct-sum\\oplus-gates) or with ⊗tensor-product\\otimes for conjunction (a.k.a. ⊗tensor-product\\otimes-gates). Leaves nodes are marked with a squared box and they are labelled with the literal, ⊤top\\top, or ⊥bottom\\bot, as well as its label via the labelling function ρ𝜌\\rho. Unless specified otherwise, in the following we will slightly abuse the notation by defining an ⋅¯¯⋅\\overline{\\cdot} operator both for variables and ⊤top\\top, ⊥bottom\\bot, i.e. for x∈𝒱∪{⊥,⊤}𝑥𝒱bottomtopx\\in\\mathcal{V}\\cup\\{\\bot,\\top\\}, and for elements of the set 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} of labels, s.t. ρ​(x)¯=ρ​(x¯)¯𝜌𝑥𝜌¯𝑥\\overline{\\rho(x)}=\\rho(~{}\\overline{x}~{}). Finally, each leaf node presents an additional parameter λ𝜆\\lambda—i.e. the indicator variable cf. [ref]21—that assumes values 0 or 1, and we will be using it for reusing the same circuit for different purposes. In the following, we will make use of a running example based upon the burglary example as presented in [21, Example 6]. In this way, we hope to convey better to the reader the value of our approach as the circuit derived from it using  will have a clear, intuitive meaning behind. However, our approach is independent from the system that employs circuit compilation for its reasoning process, as long as it can make use of d-DNNFs circuits. The d-DNNF circuit for our running example is depicted in Figure 1 and has been derived by compiling  in a d-DNNF  the ProbLog [ref]21 code listed in Listing 1 [21, Example 6]. For compactness, in the graph each literal of the program is represented only by the initials, i.e. burglary becomes b, hears_alarm(john) becomes h(j). ProbLog is an approach to augment333We refer readers interested in probabilistic augmentation of logical theories in general to . prolog programs   annotating facts444Albeit ProbLog allows for rules to be annotated with probabilities: rules of the form p::h :- b are translated into h :- b,t with t a new fact of the form p::t. with probabilities: see Appendix A for an introduction. As discussed in [ref]21, the prolog language admits a propositional representation of its semantics. For the example the propositional representation of Listing 1 is: Figure 1 thus shows the result of the compilation of (7) in a circuit, annotated with a unique id that is either a number x𝑥x or x¯¯𝑥\\overline{x} to indicate the node that represent the negation of the variable represented by node x𝑥x; and with weights (probabilities) as per Listing 1. To enforce that we know calls(john) is true (see line 7 of Listing 1). This translates in having λ=1𝜆1\\lambda=1 for the double boxed node with index 222 in Figure 1—that indeed is labelled with the shorthand for calls(john), i.e. c(j)—while λ=0𝜆0\\lambda=0 for the double boxed node with index 2¯¯2\\overline{2} that is instead labelled with the shorthand for calls(john)¯¯calls(john)\\overline{\\texttt{calls(john)}}, i.e. c(j)¯¯c(j)\\overline{\\texttt{c(j)}}. The λ𝜆\\lambda indicators modify the execution of the function Eval (Alg. 1) in the way illustrated by Algorithm 2: note that Algorithm 2 is analogous to Algorithm 1 when all λ=1𝜆1\\lambda=1. Hence, in the following, when considering the function Eval, we will be referring to the one defined in Algorithm 2. Finally, the ProbLog program in Listing 1 queries the value of burglary, hence we need to compute the probability of burglary given calls(john), While the denominator of (8) is given by Eval of the circuit in Figure 1, we need to modify it in order to obtain the numerator p​(burglary∧calls(john))𝑝burglarycalls(john)p(\\texttt{burglary}\\land\\texttt{calls(john)}) as depicted in Figure 2, where λ=0𝜆0\\lambda=0 for the node labelled with burglary¯¯burglary\\overline{\\texttt{burglary}}. Eval on the circuit in Figure 2 will thus return the value of the denominator in (8). It is worth highlighting that computing p​(q​u​e​r​y∣e​v​i​d​e​n​c​e​s)𝑝conditional𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑟𝑦𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠p(query\\mid evidences) for an arbirtrary q​u​e​r​y𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑟𝑦query and arbirtrary set of e​v​i​d​e​n​c​e​s𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠evidences requires Eval to be executed at least twice on slightly modified circuits. In this paper, similarly to , we are interested in learning the parameters of our circuit, i.e. the ρ𝜌\\rho function for each of the leaves nodes, or 𝝆𝝆\\bm{\\rho} in the following, thus representing it as a vector. We will learn 𝝆𝝆\\bm{\\rho} from a set of examples, where each example is an instantiation of all propositional variables: for n𝑛n propositional variables, there are 2nsuperscript2𝑛2^{n} of such instantiations. In the case the circuit is derived from a logic program, an example is a complete interpretation of all the ground atoms. A complete dataset 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} is then a sequence (allowing for repetitions) of examples, each of those is a vector of instantiations of independent Bernoulli distributions with true but unknown parameter 𝒑𝒙subscript𝒑𝒙\\bm{p_{x}}. From this, the likelihood is thus: where 𝒙isubscript𝒙𝑖\\bm{x}_{i} represents the i𝑖i-th example in the dataset 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}.\nDifferently, however, from , we do not search for a maximum likelihood solution of this problem, rather we provide a Bayesian analysis of it in Section 3. The following analysis provides the distribution of the probabilities (second-order probabilities) for each propositional variables. For complete datasets, these distributions factor meaning that the second-order probabilities for the propositional variables are statistically independent (see Appendix C). Nevertheless, it is shown that second-order probabilities of a variable and its negation are correlated because the first-order probabilities (i.e. the expected values of the distributions) sum up to one. The inference process proposed in this paper does not assume independent second-order probabilities as it encompasses dependencies between the random variables associated to the proposition in the form of a covariance matrix. For complete datasets, the covariances at the leaves are only non-zero between a variable and its negation. More generally, when the training dataset 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} is not complete (i.e., variable values cannot always be observed for various instantiations), the second-order probabilities become correlated. The derivations of these correlations during the learning process with partial observations is left for future work. Nevertheless, the proposed inference method can accommodate such correlations without any modifications. This is one of our main contributions, that separates our approach from the literature. Indeed, ours is clearly not the only Bayesian approach to learning parameters in circuits, see for instance  [ref]62    . In addition, similarly to   we also apply the idea of moment matching instead of using sampling.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: set 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} of labels, s.t. ρ​(x)¯=ρ​(x¯)¯𝜌𝑥𝜌¯𝑥\\overline{\\rho(x)}=\\rho(~{}\\overline{x}~{}).
