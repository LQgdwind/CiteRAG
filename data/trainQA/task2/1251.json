      "content": "Paper Title: General Characterization of Agents by States they Visit\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe consider a setup with N𝑁N policies πi,i∈{1​…​N}subscript𝜋𝑖𝑖1…𝑁\\pi_{i},\\;i\\in\\{1\\ldots N\\} which we want to compare. For each policy, we play M𝑀M episodes and store all encountered states 𝒔𝒔\\bm{s} to a per-policy dataset 𝑩i=(𝒔{i,1},𝒔{i,2},…)subscript𝑩𝑖subscript𝒔𝑖1subscript𝒔𝑖2…\\bm{B}_{i}=(\\bm{s}_{\\{i,1\\}},\\bm{s}_{\\{i,2\\}},\\ldots). Note that the stored states may differ from states the policy acts upon; stored states can be a separate piece of information believed to describe the behaviour, such as x-y coordinates of a maze robot . In the case of high-dimensional environments, one can train an encoder to turn images into more compact latent codes  or to preprocess them into low-dimensional representations [ref]9. Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) 3 can be used to model multi-modal data, and with enough components they can model almost any continuous distribution to an arbitrary accuracy . However, measuring KL-divergence requires expensive sampling. While approximations exist, they come with different assumptions and drawbacks . Instead, we draw inspiration from the field of speaker verification where GMMs have been used to model speaker characteristics . Instead of training one GMM per speaker, Reynolds et al. 4 presented universal background models (GMM-UBMs, later UBMs) to model a distribution of speaker-independent features by fitting a large GMM on a large pool of speaker data. Speaker-specific model can then be adapted with Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) adaptation of GMM components  using individual speaker’s data. The acquired parameters can then be concatenated into a long vector, called a supervector [ref]7, describing the speaker with a fixed-length vector. We apply this method to policies instead of speakers. We first fit a GMM on state datasets from all policies and then MAP-adapt a supervector for each policy, which we call a policy supervector. Under the Bayesian view, the UBM represents an informative prior while the adapted GMM is a point estimate of the posterior, where we use the same data as part of the prior and adapting the posterior. We treat UBM as a common feature extractor, and by including data from all policies we ensure the prior covers all states visited by all of the policies. This process is illustrated in Figure 2. Formally, policies’ datasets are pooled together into an UBM-training set 𝑩ubm=(𝑩1,…,𝑩N)subscript𝑩ubmsubscript𝑩1…subscript𝑩𝑁\\bm{B}_{\\text{ubm}}=(\\bm{B}_{1},\\ldots,\\bm{B}_{N}). This set is then used to fit an UBM with K𝐾K components and parameters 𝝁ubm∈ℝK×dsubscript𝝁ubmsuperscriptℝ𝐾𝑑\\bm{\\mu}_{\\text{ubm}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{K\\times d}, 𝚺ubm∈ℝK×d×dsubscript𝚺ubmsuperscriptℝ𝐾𝑑𝑑\\bm{\\Sigma}_{\\text{ubm}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{K\\times d\\times d} and 𝒘ubm∈ℝK,wk≥0,∑kwk=1formulae-sequencesubscript𝒘ubmsuperscriptℝ𝐾formulae-sequencesubscript𝑤𝑘0subscript𝑘subscript𝑤𝑘1\\bm{w}_{\\text{ubm}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{K},w_{k}\\geq 0,\\sum_{k}w_{k}=1 with EM-algorithm until convergence. We can then perform MAP-adaptation on a per-policy dataset 𝑩𝑩\\bm{B} to obtain adapted mean 𝝁^ksubscriptbold-^𝝁𝑘\\bm{\\hat{\\mu}}_{k} of k𝑘kth component with 4 where r𝑟r, known as a relevance factor, is a control parameter that impacts how much new data can affect the adapted mean. To measure the distance between two policy supervectors, Campbell et al. [ref]7 show that an upper-bound for KL-divergence of means of two adapted GMMs 𝝁isubscript𝝁𝑖\\bm{\\mu}_{i} and 𝝁jsubscript𝝁𝑗\\bm{\\mu}_{j} is Unlike KL-divergence, this upper-bound is symmetric [ref]7. In this work, we will only adapt the means of the UBM to allow the use of the above metric, but this method can be extended by adapting covariances and weights (see 4 equations (11)-(13)). We use this upper bound as a distance metric for policies. Limitations. Policy supervectors require each policy to sample data from the environment which can be expensive in slow environments. In highly stochastic environments we need more samples to accurately describe policies, which will make the training phase of these methods more demanding. Policy supervectors also require the environment to be the same for all policies, which can be difficult for real-world robotics, for example.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: of a maze robot .
