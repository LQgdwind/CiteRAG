      "content": "Paper Title: Incomplete Knowledge Graph Alignment\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKnowledge Graph Alignment.\nTraditional cross-lingual KG alignment approaches often rely on various domain-independent features to discover cross-lingual links . Modern cross-lingual KGs entity aligners exploit the emergence of graph embedding techniques and show promising results  [ref]24. From the two input monolingual KGs, these techniques first embed the entities into low-dimensional vector spaces. The identical entities are then retrieved based on the similarity of the learned representations. The earlier techniques of this paradigm, including MTransE , JAPE , ITransE , and BootEA , often employ shallow embedding techniques to embed the entities and the relations using the translation constraint [ref]28, which assumes that the embedding distance between two any entities is equal to the connecting relation. Due to the lack of information integration of shallow models, recent embedding based alignment techniques employ graph convolutional network (GCN)  [ref]9 to exploit the complex nature of KGs better. GCN-Align  employs GCNs to capture at the same time the relational and the individual entity footprint. RDGCN  introduces a two-layers GCN with highway gates to extract attentive interactions between each KG and its dual relation. MUGNN  preprocesses the input KGs with grounding rules before forwarding them to a dual-channel GCNs model. KDcoE  leverages co-training of a KG embedding and a literal description embedding to enhance the semi-supervised learning of multilingual KG embeddings. MultiKE  unifies multiple views of entities to learn embeddings for entity alignment. KG-matching  constructs a relation network namely topic entity graph to encode the entities’ name by a word-based LSTM. REA  proposes a two-component model to enhance the noise robustness of the aligner. AliNet  employs entities’ distant neighbours to expand their neighbour overlapping . Our work goes beyond the state-of-the-art by enhancing the GNN properties with attention mechanism and entity-relation composition to capture the relational correlation effectively. We also combine the GNN with a translation-based channel to guarantee the knowledge transfer between the input KGs and thus mitigate the incompleteness issue. Similar to our work are GCN-Align and MultiKE, which also use a multi-view scheme, but our GNN channel leverages relation embeddings that better capture relational information. Also, unlike the existing models such as RDGCN and GCN-Align that stacks GNN models, our framework utilizes a non-GNN channel to cover the GNN-based channel and overcome the GNN weaknesses, such as information dilution and noise amplification issue. Knowledge Graph Completion. The Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) techniques aim to predict the missing triples in the KGs automatically. Existing KGC techniques often embed entities and relations into low-dimensional vectors, then design a score function to check the candidate triplets’ plausibility. The earlier methods often employ shallow embedding models with translation-based scoring function [ref]28 . Recently, KGC techniques using deep embedding model and complex score have been proposed, including CNNs based model  , RNNs based models , and GCNs based model . However, they are surprisingly found to be unstable across different datasets due to the overloading of unrelated objectives . Thus, we choose the simple yet powerful translation-based model to supply the main GNN-based channel in our framework. Our work also goes beyond the existing KGC framework by answering at the same time two questions: (i) given any two entities, whether there is a triple connecting them and (ii) which is the relation type of the triple between the two entities; while the existing frameworks often answer only the latter question. It is worth noting that the former question is challenging, as the number of disjoint entities outweighs that of connecting ones and thus might cause low recall in detecting the missing triples. We tackle this challenge by exchanging the useful patterns of high-confidence entities retrieved from the alignment of the two input KGs, thus making the information of the KGs complete for each other.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: rely on various domain-independent features to discover cross-lingual links .
