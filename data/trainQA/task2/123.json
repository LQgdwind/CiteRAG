      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Dynamic Belief Graphs to Generalize on Text-Based Games\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nText-based games are complex, interactive simulations in which the game state is described with text and players act using simple text commands (e.g., light torch with match).\nThey serve as a proxy for studying how agents can exploit language to comprehend and interact with the environment.\nText-based games are a useful challenge in the pursuit of intelligent agents that communicate with humans (e.g., in customer service systems). Solving text-based games requires a combination of reinforcement learning (RL) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.\nHowever, inherent challenges like partial observability, long-term dependencies, sparse rewards, and combinatorial action spaces make these games very difficult.111We challenge readers to solve this representative game: https://aka.ms/textworld-tryit.\nFor instance, Hausknecht et al., 6 show that a state-of-the-art model achieves a mere 2.56%percent2.562.56\\% of the total possible score on a curated set of text-based games for human players .\nOn the other hand, while text-based games exhibit many of the same difficulties as linguistic tasks like open-ended dialogue, they are more structured and constrained. To design successful agents for text-based games, previous works have relied largely on heuristics that exploit games’ inherent structure.\nFor example, several works have proposed rule-based components that prune the action space or shape the rewards according to a priori knowledge of the game dynamics 0 [ref]24  .\nMore recent approaches take advantage of the graph-like structure of text-based games by building knowledge graph (KG) representations of the game state:\nAmmanabrolu and Riedl, , Ammanabrolu and Hausknecht, , for example, use hand-crafted heuristics to populate a KG that feeds into a deep neural agent to inform its policy.\nDespite progress along this line, we expect more general, effective representations for text-based games to arise in agents that learn and scale more automatically, which replace heuristics with learning 7. This work investigates how we can learn graph-structured state representations for text-based games in an entirely data-driven manner.\nWe propose the graph aided transformer agent (GATA)222Code and dataset used: https://github.com/xingdi-eric-yuan/GATA-public that, in lieu of heuristics, learns to construct and update graph-structured beliefs333Text-based games are partially observable environments. and use them to further optimize rewards.\nWe introduce two self-supervised learning strategies—based on text reconstruction and mutual information maximization—which enable our agent to learn latent graph representations without direct supervision or hand-crafted heuristics.\n We benchmark GATA on 500+ unique games generated by TextWorld , evaluating performance in a setting that requires generalization across different game configurations.\nWe show that GATA outperforms strong baselines, including text-based models with recurrent policies. In addition, we compare GATA to agents with access to ground-truth graph representations of the game state. We show that GATA achieves competitive performance against these baselines even though it receives only partial text observations of the state.\nOur findings suggest, promisingly, that graph-structured representations provide a useful inductive bias for learning and generalizing in text-based games, and act as a memory\nenabling agents to optimize rewards in a partially observed setting.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: games’ inherent structure.\nFor example, several works have proposed rule-based components that prune the action space or shape the rewards according to a priori knowledge of the game dynamics 0 [ref]24  .\nMore recent approaches take advantage of the graph-like structure of text-based games by building knowledge graph (KG) representations of the game state:\nAmmanabrolu and Riedl, ,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
