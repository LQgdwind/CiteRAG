      "content": "Paper Title: Sense: Model-Hardware Co-design for Accelerating Sparse CNNs on Systolic Array\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNowadays, neural network has been widely applied in numerous domains, such as image recognition, speech recognition[ref]2, object detection[ref]3, computer vision, etc. Especially, CNNs ,,,,[ref]3 have outstood in image recognition and object detection. As higher precision and complication demands come up, the workloads of network computing are still growing. Therefore, researchers have been bending their efforts for exploration of neural network hardware accelerators to catch up with software development. \nAlthough CNNs bring intensive computations, there exists monotonous operations; thus, many hardware architects attempt to reduce runtime by improving computation parallelism. Meanwhile, weights and IFMs can be massively reused across operations. Since data movement consumes much more energy than computation, especially with DRAM, many sophisticated dataflow strategies were designed to improve data reuse rate. For example, Eyeriss applies row stationary dataflow to minimize movement consumption; TPU0 revives systolic array to realize high energy efficiency and throughput with structured dataflow and low bandwidth; Thinker1 supports bit-width adaptive computing and on-demand array partitioning and reconfiguration, to maximize resource utilization. These works mainly actualize acceleration through parallelism improvement and dataflow optimization, without consideration of sparsity processing on IFMs and weights, causing redundant storage and computation. \nFurthermore, sparsity is an intrinsic property of CNNs. For IFMs, approximately half of their elements are zeros because of the widely used nonlinear function ReLU; for weights, the fault tolerance of CNN allows of a large number of redundant zeros, which inspires researchers to develop pruning and quantization methods2,3, 4,5,6,7,8. Therefore, various sparsity-aware CNN accelerators were designed. EIE9 supports both sparse weight and IFM processing, but only focused on fully-connected(FC) layers. Cambricon-X and Cnvlutin, respectively, take advantage of sparse weights and IFMs to eliminate operations induced by zero. SCNN can support arbitrary sparse patterns, but it fails to fully leverage the benefits provided by sparse IFMs and weights due to imbalanced workload and access contention across independent PEs. Lu e‚Äãtùëíùë°et a‚Äãlùëéùëôal proposed an FPGA architecture to deal with the irregular connection in sparse convolution(CONV) layers, but huge LUT resource was consumed to match the indexes between weights and IFMs and increases linearly with PE array scaling, which becomes the bottleneck of performance. Zhu e‚Äãtùëíùë°et a‚Äãlùëéùëôal designed an FPGA accelerator to avoid extra coordinate computation for connection reconstructing or output locating with a sparsewise dataflow. However, since this accelerator consumes large BRAM resource for output feature map(OFM) storage in each PE, the performance is bounded by the number of BRAM on FPGA. Therefore, these architectures suffer from one-side sparsity exploration, access contention or inefficient resource utilization. \nSince systolic array is widely applied to accelerate CNNs0,1,, for higher energy efficiency and reource efficiency compared with other architectures as shown in Tab.I. Thus, researchers try to process sparsity with systolic architecture to improve the overall benefits. Swallow overcomes the inability to exploit the sparsity of weights and IFMs, CONV layers and FC layers of CNNs with limited resource in a systolic array, and introduce a sparse-aware dataflow to boost PE utilization, achieving higher bandwidth saving and energy efficiency compared with previous sparse accelerators. However, the structured systolic dataflow essentially contradicts with the irregularity of sparsity, causing imbalanced PE loads. Considering that, FESA pruned the kernels to 222~777 formalized zero distribution patterns and left IFM unprocessed to regularize dataflow as the dense systolic tempo, achieving lower sparsity processing overhead. But this pruning method is only implemented on Cifar-10 and Cifar-100 currently. Thus, to balance workload with higher versatility in systolic array, SPOTS[ref]31 designed a group-wise pruning method to divide weights into groups and prune some elements of the same position in each group, which achieves similar versatility with shape-wise pruning method and improves compatibility with systolic array. Accordingly, SPOTS applied Image to Column (Im2Col) transformation of IFMs coupled with general matrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM) to better fit its pruning scheme into systolic array by skipping the weight rows and IFM columns with all zeros. However, since its pruning method is too fine-grained, the sparsity of weights after pruning is bounded by accuracy. Besides, SPOTS fails to exploit the sparsity in those rows and columns with some zeros, causing inefficient acceleration. Additionally, memory access occupies a huge proportion of system energy consumption, making it critical to further reduce memory access through dataflow. But sparse IFMs and weights can be irregular and fragmented, which leads to lower memory access efficiency. SCNN employed a novel dataflow to eliminate unnecessary data transfers, but access contentions occurred when routing the products to accumulator buffer due to irregular sparse patterns. Lu e‚Äãtùëíùë°et a‚Äãlùëéùëôal proposed a weight layout to enable efficient memory access without conflicts, but huge LUT consumption blocked the performance. Swallow harnesses a sparsity-aware dataflow with matrix multiplication tiling to promote data reuse within each channel, reducing DRAM access with little overhead. However, Swallow always preferentially reuse IFMs, while DRAM access can be variable if we choose different reuse strategies. Thus, there is still room to further lower DRAM access by choosing dataflow according to the storage ratio of IFMs and weights in each layer. \nThese previous sparse systolic accelerators suffered from imbalanced workload, lacking versatility or low sparsity of weight pruning. Besides, the dataflow is inflexible for the variable ratio of IFM and weight in each layer. Thus, this paper aims to balance workload to fit with sparse systolic array, while maintaining the sparsity and versatility of weight pruning with reasonable overhead, and further optimize DRAM access. A model-hardware co-design of sparse CNN accelerator based on systolic array is proposed to improve system performance and energy efficiency. Our main contributions are as follows: \n1). We proposed a systolic-array-based accelerator for both sparse IFM and weight processing with reasonable overhead. It supports the whole kernel and IFM block compression and eliminates zero element operations to accelerate computing.\n2). We applied channel clustering to gather IFMs with approximate sparsity to compute in the PE array by sorting channel indexes according to the numbers of nonzero elements(NZEs) in IFMs, and co-designed a load-balancing weight pruning method to keep the sparsity ratio of each kernel at a certain value with little accuracy loss, which can balance PE loads across systolic array and greatly improve performance. \n3). We proposed an Adaptive Dataflow Configuration to optimize data reuse rate and further reduce DRAM access. The reuse strategy of our dataflow can be flexibly configured according to the storage ratio of IFMs and weights. \nComparing with sparse systolic accelerator, Swallow, we balance the workload of sparse IFMs and weights in systolic array and achieve 1√ó1\\times~2.25√ó2.25\\times speedup, and 0.97√ó0.97\\times~2.2√ó2.2\\times energy efficiency with 1.6% LUT, 7%BRAM and 3% power overhead. Based on the Adaptive Dataflow Configuration, we reduce 1.17√ó1.17\\times~1.8√ó1.8\\times DRAM access. Besides, comparing with the pruning method of FESA, we achieve 1.2√ó1.2\\times~1.3√ó1.3\\times speedup in terms of weights and implements on more complicated dataset, such as ImageNet, with higher versatility; by exploiting sparsity of both IFMs and weights, we achieve 1.95√ó1.95\\times~2.5√ó2.5\\times performance improvement with 1.5√ó1.5\\times power. Further, compared with SPOTS[ref]31, our pruning method obtain 1√ó1\\times~2.02√ó2.02\\times sparsity of weights, achieving 1.17√ó1.17\\times~2.37√ó2.37\\times speedup with 1.3√ó1.3\\times power.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Nowadays, neural network has been widely applied in numerous domains, such as image recognition, speech recognition[ref]2, object detection[ref]3, computer vision, etc. Especially, CNNs ,,,,[ref]3 have outstood in image recognition and object detection.
