      "content": "Paper Title: Structure-Aware Image Segmentation with Homotopy Warping\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep Image Segmentation. Deep learning methods (CNNs) have achieved satisfying performances for image segmentation    [ref]9  . By replacing fully connected layer with fully convolutional layers, FCN  transforms a classification CNNs (e.g., AlexNet , VGG , or ResNet ) to fully-convolutional neural networks. In this way, FCN successfully transfers the success of image classification    to dense prediction/image segmentation. Instead of using Conditional Random Field (CRF) as post-processing, Deeplab (v1-v2)   methods add another fully connected CRF after the last CNN layer to make use of global information. Moreover, Deeplab v3 [ref]9 introduces dilated/atrous convolution to increase the receptive field and make better use of context information to achieve better performance. Besides the methods mentioned above, UNet  has also been one of the most popular methods for image segmentation, especially for images with fine structures. UNet architecture is based on FCN with two major modifications: 1) Similar to encoder-decoder, UNet is symmetric. The output is with the same size as input images, thus suitable for dense prediction/image segmentation, and 2) Skip connections between downsampling and upsampling paths.\nThe skip connections of UNet are able to combine low level/local information with high level/global information, resulting in better segmentation performance.\n Though obtaining satisfying pixel performances, these methods are still prone to structural/topological errors, as they are usually optimized via pixel-wise loss functions, such as mean-square-error loss (MSE) and cross-entropy loss. As illustrated in Fig.1, a small amount of pixel errors will affect or even damage the downstream tasks. Topology-Aware Segmentation.\nTopology-aware segmentation methods have been proposed to segment with correct structure/topology. By identifying critical points of the predicted likelihood maps, persistent-homology-based losses 5  penalize topologically critical pixels. However, the identified critical points can be very noisy and often are not relevant to the topological errors.\nIllustrations are included in Sec. A.1.\nMoreover, the computation of persistent homology is expensive, making it difficult to evaluate the loss and gradient at every training iteration. Other methods indirectly preserve topology by enhancing the curvilinear structures.\nVGG-UNet  uses the response of pretrained filters to enhance structures locally. But it does not truly preserve the topology, and cannot generalize to higher dimensional topological structures, such as voids.\nSeveral methods extract skeletons of the masks and penalize heavily on pixels of the skeletons. This ensures the prediction to be correct along the skeletons, and thus are likely correct in topology.\nclDice [ref]44 extracts the skeleton through min/max-pooling operations over the likelihood map.\nDMT Loss  uses the Morse complex of the likelihood map as the skeleton.\nHowever, these skeletons are not necessarily topologically critical. The penalization on them may not be relevant to topology. We also note that many deep learning techniques have been proposed to ensure the segmentation output preserves details, and thus preserves topology implicitly      9.\nOne may also use topological constraints as postprocessing steps once we have the predicted likelihood maps 1     0        7. Compared to end-to-end methods, postprocessing methods usually contain self-defined parameters or hand-crafted features, making it difficult to generalize to different situations. Instead of relying on the noisy likelihood maps 5  [ref]44 , we propose to use the warping of binary masks to identify the topologically critical pixels. The identified locations are more likely to be relevant to topological errors. Penalizing on these locations ensures the training efficiency and segmentation quality of our method. Another difference from previous methods is that our method rely on purely local topological computation (i.e., checking whether a pixel is simple within a local patch), whereas previous methods are mostly relying on global topological computation.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: Deep Image Segmentation.
