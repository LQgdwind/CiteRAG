      "content": "Paper Title: Toward Multiple Specialty Learners for Explaining GNNs via Online Knowledge Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs graph neural networks (GNN)   have become increasingly ubiquitous in real-world applications and large-scale systems, understanding the causes behind predictions is essential for assessing trust, especially regarding critical decisions. However, generating explanations for GNN is challenging due to the following reasons. Unlike tabular data, text, and grid-like data, graphs consist of multiple components, such as graph structures, node features, and edge features. Therefore, influential factors of a certain prediction can be complicated interactions among these factors. Furthermore, graph datasets are diverse, wherein each may contain a different set of components, thus making it hard to measure exact contributions. Moreover, it is not easy to use general explainable AI (XAI) tools   for explaining GNNs due to the complexity of graphs. Lately, several approaches have been proposed for explaining GNNs [ref]6, as there is no one-size-fits-all solution in XAI. These methods look at the problem from different angles and provide multiple ways to explain GNNs. Most existing approaches fall under the post-hoc explanation category and focus on instance-level explanations [ref]6. Among them, perturbation methods such as GNNExplainer [ref]7 and PGExplainer [ref]8 have been widely adopted since they introduced benchmark datasets for explanation tasks and achieved outstanding results. However, these methods need to train explanation models for target instances after training black-box GNNs resulting in additional computational resources and execution time. Unlike post-hoc methods, intrinsically interpretable (self-explainable) models such as GAT  can provide explanations for predictions instantly. Several novel self-explainable GNN architectures 0 1 have been proposed based on distance-based objective functions. However, they usually evaluate their proposed methods using citation graphs 2, which lack generalization to other datasets. Moreover, similarity functions can be a computational burden in many scenarios when graphs are complex. Besides, existing methods mostly concentrate on structural explanations while overlooking feature attributions. A promising but challenging research problem is training explainers with a black-box GNN, wherein each explainer learns to analyze a subset of interactions within an input graph. This approach enables explainers to be as general as post-hoc explanation methods and as quick as self-explainable models when making explanations. However, designing an effective training paradigm, which allows explainable models to achieve equivalent performance as the black box, is not a straightforward problem. It is because explainable models’ performances can be inferior in a standalone training mode resulting in untrustworthy explanations. One solution for this problem is online knowledge distillation , wherein a black-box GNN is regarded as a teacher, while explainable models are considered students. The teacher guides the learning processes of students via distillation losses. We propose SCALE, the first explanation framework training multiple SpeCiAlty Learners to Explain GNNs. As depicted in Figure 1a, SCALE combines the advantages of post-hoc explanation methods, intrinsically interpretable models, and online knowledge distillation. Following [ref]7 [ref]8, our explanation framework concentrates on finding important factors from graph structures, node features, and edge features that affect predictions the most. Here, we relax the complexity of the problem by discarding edge features. Since numerous interactions exist among these components, creating a single explainer to examine attributions is complicated. Therefore, SCALE trains multiple specialty learners to explain predictions in different aspects. A learner is a model that learns from a black-box GNN to capture a subset of interactions. As shown in Figure 2a, structural importance and feature transformation learners are trained simultaneously with the black-box GNN based on an online knowledge distillation paradigm. This paradigm enables the black-box GNN model to guide learners to achieve approximate predictive performance. In the explanation phase, instant explainers output predictions with explanations in different aspects and levels based on special procedures. First, an edge selection procedure eliminates unimportant edges and nodes for a graph-level prediction using learnable masks of a structural importance learner. Second, a customized version of the random walk with restart (RWR) algorithm, which has been widely applied to recommender systems and search engines 3 4 5 6, is employed to provide structural explanations for node-level predictions.\nIn our scenario, a target node that needs an explanation is considered a query vertex. A random walker includes neighboring nodes and edges in the explanation as it jumps through these elements. Moreover, we execute DeepLIFT 7 8 on top of a trained multilayer perceptron (MLP) learner in the feature attribution module to provide instance-level feature attributions and overall attribution summaries. This library is selected since it is an effective and fast feature attribution method for deep neural networks. Evaluating the efficiency of explanation methods is difficult since ground-truth explanations do not exist in most graph datasets. Therefore, we follow [ref]7 [ref]8 to formulate structural explanations as binary classification tasks, wherein influential nodes and edges of predictions are included in explanations. Then, we make quantitative and qualitative comparisons between SCALE and baselines on the correctness of structural explanations and execution performance. Moreover, we evaluate the efficiency of the feature attribution module using a real-world dataset with intelligible features. Since no ground-truth information exists, we compare our observations with findings from a state-of-the-art method 9 for evaluation purposes. Finally, a series of ablation studies are conducted to understand algorithms in SCALE better. Through extensive experiments and analyses, we conclude that SCALE is effective in providing explaining GNNs in both explanation capability and execution performance. Our contributions are summarized as follows: We propose a novel explanation framework that utilizes multiple specialty learners to provide accurate explanations instantly for GNNs. Our proposed framework is general and can explain any message-passing-based GNN architectures. Moreover, it provides instant explanations for input graphs. We are the first to use RWR for explaining node-level predictions, which can specify different contributions of neighbors to a target node. We conduct extensive experiments and a series of ablation studies to demonstrate SCALE’s superiority in explanation capability and execution performance. Here is the structure of the paper. Section II describes related work. Section III presents background concepts. We describe the methodology in Section IV. Experiments are presented in Sections V and VI. We discuss detailed limitations, improvements, and possible applications in Section VII. Finally, we conclude our work in Section VIII.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: Moreover, it is not easy to use general explainable AI (XAI) tools   for explaining GNNs due to the complexity of graphs.
