      "content": "Paper Title: Quickest Change Detection of Time Inconsistent Anticipatory Agents. Human-Sensor and Cyber-Physical Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo give additional perspective on the main results discussed above, we now briefly discuss important insights regarding anticipative decision makers in a quickest detection framework. 1. Social Learning.\nThe anticipatory model used in this paper is from\n; see also 4 . This\ngeneralizes classical social learning models that have been studied extensively in sociology, economics and signal processing   [ref]24 . Classical social learning assumes that agents make one-shot (myopic) decisions to maximize their expected utility. The behavioral economics models considered here are useful generalizations of social learning since they involve multi-stage planning; as mentioned earlier, even simple human decisions involve multi-stage planning with time-inconsistency. Our sequential framework of multiple decision makers is similar to\nteam decision theory  ; the key difference being time inconsistency. This paper differs from  where quickest detection was considered with myopic social learning based local decisions. Motivated by behavioral economics , we consider\na 2-stage decision framework for each local decision maker that is more general than myopic social learning. This 2-stage framework captures several salient features of human decision-making including anticipation, time inconsistency and deliberate avoidance of information.\nAlso, in our quickest detection formulation, the jump change affects both the rewards of the agents and the transition kernel of the physical state (in the myopic case , there is no transition mechanism).\nOur constructed model ensures that\nwe can seamlessly use the behavioral anticipatory model of  without modification. 2. How un-informed local decision makers affect global decision making?\nIn order to optimize its change detection policy, the global decision maker must interpret decisions of the local decision makers, knowing that the local decision makers are anticipatory and that they use decisions from previous agents. A well known characteristic of this sequential multi-agent framework is that agents herd  - they ignore their own observations and parrot decisions of previous agents. The multi-threshold structure of the global decision makerâ€™s optimal policy (Figure 2(b)) can be interpreted as saying that the global decision maker acts in a non-trivial manner to compensate for the poorly informed local decision makers. In comparison, the classical threshold policy (Figure 2(a)) results when the local decision makers are well informed (exchange their posterior distributions rather than anticipatory actions); see  for discussion in terms of Bayesian social learning. 3. Change Blindness.\nThe multi-threshold change detection policy in Fig.2(b) can be interpreted as a form of change blindness, namely, people fail to detect surprisingly\nlarge changes to scenes . Even though the posterior probability of a change is higher than a change threshold, the optimal behavior indicated is to detect no change. 4. Deliberate Avoidance of Information. Theorem 1 in Sec.III shows that the subgame Nash equilibrium at time 1 has a bang-bang structure. It justifies the observation  that agents with anticipatory emotions may choose to deliberately avoid information. As mentioned earlier,  reports that giving some patients more information before a stressful medical procedure raised their anxiety.  shows that\nhumans\nselectively treat the opportunity to gain knowledge\nabout future favorable outcomes, but not unfavorable outcomes. Finally, we emphasize that humans likely do not solve\ntime inconsistent decision processes to make decisions.\nThe time inconsistent\nbehavioral economics models in  4  are widely used because they provide generative models for the peculiarities of anticipatory human decision making.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: anticipatory model used in this paper is from\n; see also 4 .
