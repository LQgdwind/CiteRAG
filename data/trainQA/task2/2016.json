      "content": "Paper Title: On the pathwidth of hyperbolic 3-manifoldsThis paper is based on previously unpublished parts of the author’s PhD thesis [24].\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur roadmap to establish Theorem 1 is similar to that in . In particular, our construction of a triangulation of ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} with dual graph of pathwidth bounded in terms of vol⁡(ℳ)volℳ\\operatorname{vol}(\\mathcal{M}) also starts with a thick-thin decomposition 𝒟𝒟\\mathscr{D} of ℳℳ\\mathcal{M}. The two proofs, however, diverge at this point. Maria and Purcell proceed by triangulating the thick part of 𝒟𝒟\\mathscr{D} using the work of Jørgensen–Thurston [60, §5.11] and Kobayashi–Rieck . This partial triangulation is then simplified [ref]9  and completed into the desired triangulation of ℳℳ\\mathcal{M}. The novelty in our work is, that we proceed by first turning the decomposition 𝒟𝒟\\mathscr{D} into a generalized Heegaard splitting of ℳℳ\\mathcal{M}  , where we rely on the aforementioned results to control the genera of the splitting surfaces. Next, we amalgamate this generalized Heegaard splitting into a classical one . Finally, we appeal to our earlier work  to turn this Heegaard splitting into a triangulation of ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} with dual graph of pathwidth O​(vol⁡(ℳ))𝑂volℳO(\\operatorname{vol}(\\mathcal{M})). The proof of Theorem 1 provides a template for an algorithm777We refer to the discussion in [36, Section 5.1] for the description of a possible computational model. to triangulate any closed hyperbolic 3-manifold ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} in such a way, that the dual graph of the resulting triangulation has pathwidth O​(vol⁡(ℳ))𝑂volℳO(\\operatorname{vol}(\\mathcal{M})). Using such triangulations—that have a dual graph not only of small treewidth, but also pathwidth—as input for FPT-algorithms may significantly reduce their running time. This is because such triangulations lend themselves to nice tree decompositions (the data structure underlying many algorithms FPT in the treewidth) without join bags (those parts of a nice tree decomposition that often account for the computational bottleneck, cf. [ref]13).\nThe upshot of Theorem 1 is that, in case of hyperbolic 3-manifolds with bounded volume working with such triangulations is (in theory) always possible.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: point.
