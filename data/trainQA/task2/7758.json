They target non-DNN algorithms with much inferior accuracy as compared to the state of art DNN-based algorithms.\nI-flatcam  and EyeCoD  design accelerators for an eye tracking algorithm targeting lensless cameras while leaving the sensor front-end un-optimized.\nBlissCam shows that reducing sensor readout and sensor-host communication leads to significant overall energy reduction. Prior studies have explored lightweight eye segmentation algorithms    .\nFor instance, EdGaze  predicts the ROI of an image before segmentation.\nPrevious work has also explored ROI-based machine vision systems  [ref]50 [ref]74.\nBuilt on top of the ROI prediction idea, we show that pseudo-random sampling within the ROI can further reduce energy consumption with minimal hardware support.\nWe also co-design a ViT-based segmentation DNN to be robust against sparse inputs, as the accuracy of previous eye segmentation algorithms tends to drop under sparse inputs. \n\nEvent Cameras.\n\nReaders familiar with event cameras [ref]52 might recognize that our eventification algorithm (Eqn. 1) is an emulation of an event camera.\nIndeed, our idea is inspired by event cameras\n— with one crucial difference: classic event cameras normalize pixel difference with respect to the previous value.\nWe simplify the design to remove the normalization operation, which only complicates the sensor hardware design without providing noticeable accuracy benefits for eye tracking as we empirically find.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: have explored lightweight eye segmentation algorithms    .\nFor instance, EdGaze  predicts the ROI of an image before segmentation.\nPrevious work has also explored ROI-based machine vision systems  [ref]50 [ref]74.\nBuilt on top of the ROI prediction idea, we show that pseudo-random sampling within the ROI can further reduce energy consumption with minimal hardware support.\nWe also co-design a\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
