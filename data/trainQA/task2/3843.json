      "content": "Paper Title: Model Selection, Adaptation, and Combination for Transfer Learning in Wind and Photovoltaic Power Forecasts\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the following section, we overview recent developments for TL and, more specifically for ITL in computer vision that has been not considered for renewable power forecasts.\nThis review determines relevant techniques that we consider for renewable power forecasts.\nAfterward, we summarize related work for ITL on deterministic renewable power forecasts. There are two crucial dimensions in ITL.\nThe first is the model selection and the second is the adaptation strategy.\nThe authors of [ref]4  provide a study on selection strategies for the field of computer vision.\nThey utilize a BLR replacing the final layer of a source model and train it through empirical Bayes, also referred to as evidence approximation, on the target data.\nThe authors repeat this approach for each available model from the model hub.\nFinally, they determine the similarity through the evidence of a source model on the target.\nAs an adaptation strategy, they proposed Bayesian tuning, which regularizes the fine-tuning process by predictions from multiple sources.\nThese proposed selections and adaptations need to be considered and extended for renewable energies.\nFor instance, we can directly forecast through the BLR and compare it with fine-tuning of the final layer.\nOften, the adaptation through fine-tuning is regularized by a weight decay regarding zero .\nHowever, this regularizer does not consider parameters originating from the source model.\nTherefore, in  a deviation from a source model is penalized by weight decay considering the source model parameters. Compared to research areas like computer vision, there is limited research on ITL for renewable power forecasts, compare .\nThere has been some work to learn a transferable representation of the input utilizing autoencoders    .\nWhile the principle approach of transferring an autoencoder for a target is combinable with our approach, we argue that considering the conditional distribution of the power forecast is more relevant for model selection and combination.\nThe data driven TL approaches presented in  and  are outside the scope of this article. Also, most of the current research on TL in renewable power forecasts focuses on meteorological measurements as input features, see          .\nThese articles consider forecast horizons between ten seconds and two hours.\nAt the same time, larger forecast horizons, such as day-ahead forecasts, are inherently more difficult as they utilize NWP as input features and forecast errors increase with an increasing forecast horizon . Most of the previously mentioned related work for TL in renewable energies is treating power forecast not as a time series approach.\nInstead, the authors treat it as a regression.\nAt the same time, periodic influences from, e.g., the diurnal cycle, are well known.\nTherefore, the authors of  consider recurrent networks and fine-tuning to achieve good results for an ultra-short-term forecast horizon of PV.\nAdditionally, the article [ref]3 considers time series methods in a multi-task learning (MTL) architecture. The authors of  achieve improvements in day-ahead PV forecasts through multi-target models.\nThe idea of model combination is similar to our ensemble approach.\nHowever, the authors of this article do not evaluate it in the context of ITL.\nThe study of  proposes an MTL strategy for Gaussian processes to forecast PV targets.\nBy clustering wind parks, a weighting scheme provides predictions for a new park in .\nIn this article, no actual historical power measurements are used for evaluation; instead, the authors used synthetic data. A number of articles apply MTL architectures for TL [ref]3 [ref]28  in day-ahead forecasts.\nThe proposed task embedding in [ref]3 and [ref]28 for MLPs and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), encodes task-specific information through an embedding to learn latent similarities between tasks.\nThe article [ref]3 is especially interesting as we have a similar experimental set-up. However, the authors look at errors per season and results can be misleading as an ITL approach should avoid catastrophic forgetting for all seasons.\nAlso, MTL architectures are due to their additional training complexity not common in the industry, e.g., due to data pre-processing and training complexity.\nTherefore, for the extension of renewable energies making the best use of existing single-task models for ITL is essential. Furthermore, none of the related work studies different model selection and model adaptation strategies for neural network architectures.\nWhile there has been some work on combining knowledge from multiple sites for PV through ensemble-like strategies, the studies are insufficient as they do not consider the amount of available data.\nAlso, the expected power is solely based on a characteristic curve, or authors consider solely PV or wind data.\nWe close these research gaps by providing an extensive study that overcomes those limitations for day-ahead forecasts.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: related work for ITL on deterministic renewable power forecasts. There are two crucial dimensions in ITL.\nThe first is the model selection and the second is the adaptation strategy.\nThe authors of [ref]4  provide a study on selection strategies for the field of computer vision.\nThey utilize a BLR replacing the final layer of a source model and train it through empirical Bayes, also referred to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1.
