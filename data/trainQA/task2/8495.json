      "content": "Paper Title: Tracking the Persistence of Harmonic Chains: Barcode and Stability\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs reviewed in Sec. 3.2, by directly taking the homology functor, an increasing filtration of simplicial complexes leads to an ordinary persistence module consisting of homology groups  . These homology groups are connected by forward maps of the form H​(Ki)→H​(Ki+1)absent→𝐻subscript𝐾𝑖𝐻subscript𝐾𝑖1H(K_{i})\\xrightarrow{}H(K_{i+1}). The ordinary persistence module then decomposes into interval modules, which define the ordinary persistence barcode.\nIn this section, we show that the harmonic chain groups of all the complexes in a filtration constitute an abstract zigzag persistence module (see Sec. 3.3).\nThe main idea is that we take the harmonic chain groups along the filtration, where the groups could grow or shrink, resulting in a zigzag module.\nMoreover, the maps in this zigzag module are inclusions.\nLike any zigzag module , the module of harmonic chain groups decomposes into interval modules. These intervals form the harmonic chain barcode, the main object of interest in this paper. Throughout the section,\nconsider a simplex-wise filtration where each Ki+1subscript𝐾𝑖1K_{i+1} differs from Kisubscript𝐾𝑖K_{i}\nby the addition of a simplex σisubscript𝜎𝑖\\sigma_{i}.\nRecall that Ki:=Ktiassignsubscript𝐾𝑖subscript𝐾subscript𝑡𝑖K_{i}:=K_{t_{i}} for ti∈ℝsubscript𝑡𝑖ℝt_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R} where Ktisubscript𝐾subscript𝑡𝑖K_{t_{i}}\nis a complex from a continuous filtration indexed over ℝℝ\\mathbb{R}; see Sec. 3.2. For each inclusion Ki↪σiKi+1subscript𝜎𝑖↪subscript𝐾𝑖subscript𝐾𝑖1K_{i}\\xhookrightarrow{\\;\\sigma_{i}\\;}K_{i+1} in F𝐹F: This follows from Lemma 2 and some well-known facts in persistence (see  ).\n∎ A simplex σisubscript𝜎𝑖\\sigma_{i} inserted in F𝐹F is called positive\nif dim(ℍ​(Ki+1))=dim(ℍ​(Ki))+1,dimensionℍsubscript𝐾𝑖1dimensionℍsubscript𝐾𝑖1\\dim({\\mathbb{H}}(K_{i+1}))=\\dim({\\mathbb{H}}(K_{i}))+1, and negative\nif dim(ℍ​(Ki+1))=dim(ℍ​(Ki))−1dimensionℍsubscript𝐾𝑖1dimensionℍsubscript𝐾𝑖1\\dim({\\mathbb{H}}(K_{i+1}))=\\dim({\\mathbb{H}}(K_{i}))-1. We describe how we connect the harmonic chain groups of complexes in F𝐹F by inclusions.\nFor each Kisubscript𝐾𝑖K_{i} and each chain c=∑j=0i−1αj​σj𝑐superscriptsubscript𝑗0𝑖1subscript𝛼𝑗subscript𝜎𝑗c=\\sum_{j=0}^{i-1}\\alpha_{j}\\sigma_{j} in Cp​(Ki)subscript𝐶𝑝subscript𝐾𝑖C_{p}(K_{i}),\nwe identify c𝑐c as a chain c=∑j=0m−1αj​σj𝑐superscriptsubscript𝑗0𝑚1subscript𝛼𝑗subscript𝜎𝑗c=\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}\\alpha_{j}\\sigma_{j} in Cp​(K)subscript𝐶𝑝𝐾C_{p}(K),\nwhere αj=0subscript𝛼𝑗0\\alpha_{j}=0 for j≥i𝑗𝑖j\\geq i.\nThis makes\nboth\nCp​(Ki)subscript𝐶𝑝subscript𝐾𝑖C_{p}(K_{i}) and Cp​(Ki+1)subscript𝐶𝑝subscript𝐾𝑖1C_{p}(K_{i+1}) a subspace of Cp​(K)subscript𝐶𝑝𝐾C_{p}(K).\nWe then have the following inclusion: Recall that ℍp​(Ki):=Zp​(Ki)∩Zp​(Ki)assignsubscriptℍ𝑝subscript𝐾𝑖subscript𝑍𝑝subscript𝐾𝑖superscript𝑍𝑝subscript𝐾𝑖{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(K_{i}):=Z_{p}(K_{i})\\cap Z^{p}(K_{i}), which means that\nℍp​(Ki)⊆Zp​(Ki)⊆Cp​(K)subscriptℍ𝑝subscript𝐾𝑖subscript𝑍𝑝subscript𝐾𝑖subscript𝐶𝑝𝐾{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(K_{i})\\subseteq Z_{p}(K_{i})\\subseteq C_{p}(K).\nHence, we also identify each harmonic cycle in ℍp​(Ki)subscriptℍ𝑝subscript𝐾𝑖{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(K_{i}) as a chain in Cp​(K)subscript𝐶𝑝𝐾C_{p}(K).\nWe then observe in theorem 7\na similar inclusion as in Eq. 3 between any harmonic chain groups ℍp​(Ki)subscriptℍ𝑝subscript𝐾𝑖{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(K_{i}) and ℍp​(Ki+1)subscriptℍ𝑝subscript𝐾𝑖1{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(K_{i+1}),\nwith a possible flip on the direction. For each arrow Ki↪σiKi+1subscript𝜎𝑖↪subscript𝐾𝑖subscript𝐾𝑖1K_{i}\\xhookrightarrow{\\;\\sigma_{i}\\;}K_{i+1} in F𝐹F, where σisubscript𝜎𝑖\\sigma_{i} is\na p𝑝p-simplex: There is an inclusion ℍp​(Ki)↪ℍp​(Ki+1)↪subscriptℍ𝑝subscript𝐾𝑖subscriptℍ𝑝subscript𝐾𝑖1{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(K_{i})\\hookrightarrow{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(K_{i+1})\nif σisubscript𝜎𝑖\\sigma_{i} is positive; And there is an inclusion ℍp−1​(Ki)↩ℍp−1​(Ki+1)↩subscriptℍ𝑝1subscript𝐾𝑖subscriptℍ𝑝1subscript𝐾𝑖1{\\mathbb{H}}_{p-1}(K_{i})\\hookleftarrow{\\mathbb{H}}_{p-1}(K_{i+1}) if σisubscript𝜎𝑖\\sigma_{i} is negative. In addition, in each case the harmonic chain groups in other dimensions remain unchanged, i.e., ℍq​(Ki)=ℍq​(Ki+1)subscriptℍ𝑞subscript𝐾𝑖subscriptℍ𝑞subscript𝐾𝑖1{\\mathbb{H}}_{q}(K_{i})={\\mathbb{H}}_{q}(K_{i+1}) for any other q∉{p,p−1}𝑞𝑝𝑝1q\\notin\\{p,p-1\\}. The only harmonic chain groups that might change from Kisubscript𝐾𝑖K_{i} to Ki+1subscript𝐾𝑖1K_{i+1} are\nthose in dimension p𝑝p because cycle and cocycle groups in other dimensions do not change. First consider Case I that σisubscript𝜎𝑖\\sigma_{i} is positive.\nLet ι:Ki↪Ki+1:𝜄↪subscript𝐾𝑖subscript𝐾𝑖1\\iota:K_{i}\\hookrightarrow K_{i+1} be the inclusion map. As noted above, we identify any c∈C∗​(Ki)=C∗​(Ki)𝑐subscript𝐶subscript𝐾𝑖superscript𝐶subscript𝐾𝑖c\\in C_{*}(K_{i})=C^{*}(K_{i}) with ι♯​(c)∈C∗​(Ki+1)=C∗​(Ki+1)subscript𝜄♯𝑐subscript𝐶subscript𝐾𝑖1superscript𝐶subscript𝐾𝑖1\\iota_{\\sharp}(c)\\in C_{*}(K_{i+1})=C^{*}(K_{i+1}). Take z∈ℍp​(Ki)𝑧subscriptℍ𝑝subscript𝐾𝑖z\\in{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(K_{i}).\nObviously, ι♯​(z)subscript𝜄♯𝑧\\iota_{\\sharp}(z) is a cycle in Ki+1subscript𝐾𝑖1K_{i+1}.\nMoreover, for any c∈Cp+1​(Ki+1)𝑐subscript𝐶𝑝1subscript𝐾𝑖1c\\in C_{p+1}(K_{i+1}), δ​(ι♯​(z))​(c)=ι♯​(z)​(∂c)𝛿subscript𝜄♯𝑧𝑐subscript𝜄♯𝑧𝑐\\delta(\\iota_{\\sharp}(z))(c)=\\iota_{\\sharp}(z)(\\partial c). Since Cp+1​(Ki)=Cp+1​(Ki+1)subscript𝐶𝑝1subscript𝐾𝑖subscript𝐶𝑝1subscript𝐾𝑖1C_{p+1}(K_{i})=C_{p+1}(K_{i+1}), c𝑐c and hence ∂c𝑐\\partial c exist in Kisubscript𝐾𝑖K_{i}, meaning that ι♯​(z)​(∂c)=z​(∂c)=(δ​z)​(c)=0subscript𝜄♯𝑧𝑐𝑧𝑐𝛿𝑧𝑐0\\iota_{\\sharp}(z)(\\partial c)=z(\\partial c)=(\\delta z)(c)=0. It follows that ι♯​(z)subscript𝜄♯𝑧\\iota_{\\sharp}(z) is a cocycle in Ki+1subscript𝐾𝑖1K_{i+1}. Therefore, ℍp​(Ki)⊆ℍp​(Ki+1)subscriptℍ𝑝subscript𝐾𝑖subscriptℍ𝑝subscript𝐾𝑖1{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(K_{i})\\subseteq{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(K_{i+1}). Take z∈ℍp−1​(Ki+1)𝑧subscriptℍ𝑝1subscript𝐾𝑖1z\\in{\\mathbb{H}}_{p-1}(K_{i+1}).\nSince σisubscript𝜎𝑖\\sigma_{i} is a positive p𝑝p-simplex,\nwe have Zp−1​(Ki+1)=Zp−1​(Ki)subscript𝑍𝑝1subscript𝐾𝑖1subscript𝑍𝑝1subscript𝐾𝑖Z_{p-1}(K_{i+1})=Z_{p-1}(K_{i})\nand Bp−1​(Ki)=Bp−1​(Ki+1)subscript𝐵𝑝1subscript𝐾𝑖subscript𝐵𝑝1subscript𝐾𝑖1B_{p-1}(K_{i})=B_{p-1}(K_{i+1}).\nSo z∈Zp−1​(Ki)𝑧subscript𝑍𝑝1subscript𝐾𝑖z\\in Z_{p-1}(K_{i})\nand we consider z𝑧z as a cochain in Kisubscript𝐾𝑖K_{i}.\nThen, for any c∈Cp​(Ki)𝑐subscript𝐶𝑝subscript𝐾𝑖c\\in C_{p}(K_{i}), δ​(z)​(c)=z​(∂c)=0𝛿𝑧𝑐𝑧𝑐0\\delta(z)(c)=z(\\partial c)=0, with the last equality due to\n∂c∈Bp−1​(Ki)=Bp−1​(Ki+1)𝑐subscript𝐵𝑝1subscript𝐾𝑖subscript𝐵𝑝1subscript𝐾𝑖1\\partial c\\in B_{p-1}(K_{i})=B_{p-1}(K_{i+1}).\nTherefore, ℍp​(Ki+1)⊆ℍp​(Ki)subscriptℍ𝑝subscript𝐾𝑖1subscriptℍ𝑝subscript𝐾𝑖{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(K_{i+1})\\subseteq{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(K_{i}).\nTake z∈ℍp−1​(Ki)𝑧subscriptℍ𝑝1subscript𝐾𝑖z\\in{\\mathbb{H}}_{p-1}(K_{i}). For any c∈Cp​(Ki+1)𝑐subscript𝐶𝑝subscript𝐾𝑖1c\\in C_{p}(K_{i+1}), δ​(ι♯​z)​(c)=(ι♯​z)​(∂c)=0𝛿subscript𝜄♯𝑧𝑐subscript𝜄♯𝑧𝑐0\\delta(\\iota_{\\sharp}z)(c)=(\\iota_{\\sharp}z)(\\partial c)=0,\nwith the last equality due to\n∂c∈Bp−1​(Ki+1)=Bp−1​(Ki)𝑐subscript𝐵𝑝1subscript𝐾𝑖1subscript𝐵𝑝1subscript𝐾𝑖\\partial c\\in B_{p-1}(K_{i+1})=B_{p-1}(K_{i}).\nTherefore, ℍp−1​(Ki)=ℍp−1​(Ki+1)subscriptℍ𝑝1subscript𝐾𝑖subscriptℍ𝑝1subscript𝐾𝑖1{\\mathbb{H}}_{p-1}(K_{i})={\\mathbb{H}}_{p-1}(K_{i+1}). Now consider Case II that σisubscript𝜎𝑖\\sigma_{i} is negative. Since σisubscript𝜎𝑖\\sigma_{i} is negative, Zp​(Ki+1)=Zp​(Ki)subscript𝑍𝑝subscript𝐾𝑖1subscript𝑍𝑝subscript𝐾𝑖Z_{p}(K_{i+1})=Z_{p}(K_{i})\nand Bp​(Ki+1)=Bp​(Ki)subscript𝐵𝑝subscript𝐾𝑖1subscript𝐵𝑝subscript𝐾𝑖B_{p}(K_{i+1})=B_{p}(K_{i}).\nThe verification for this case is then the same as the verification\nfor Case I.2 with a shift on the homology degree. Take z∈ℍp−1​(Ki+1)𝑧subscriptℍ𝑝1subscript𝐾𝑖1z\\in{\\mathbb{H}}_{p-1}(K_{i+1}). We have Zp−1​(Ki+1)=Zp−1​(Ki)subscript𝑍𝑝1subscript𝐾𝑖1subscript𝑍𝑝1subscript𝐾𝑖Z_{p-1}(K_{i+1})=Z_{p-1}(K_{i}).\nTherefore, z∈Zp−1​(Ki)𝑧subscript𝑍𝑝1subscript𝐾𝑖z\\in Z_{p-1}(K_{i})\nand we consider z𝑧z as a cochain in Kisubscript𝐾𝑖K_{i}.\nFor any c∈Cp​(Ki)𝑐subscript𝐶𝑝subscript𝐾𝑖c\\in C_{p}(K_{i}), δ​(z)​(c)=z​(∂c)=0𝛿𝑧𝑐𝑧𝑐0\\delta(z)(c)=z(\\partial c)=0,\nwith the last equality due to ∂c∈Bp−1​(Ki)⊆Bp−1​(Ki+1)𝑐subscript𝐵𝑝1subscript𝐾𝑖subscript𝐵𝑝1subscript𝐾𝑖1\\partial c\\in B_{p-1}(K_{i})\\subseteq B_{p-1}(K_{i+1}).\nTherefore, ℍp−1​(Ki+1)⊆ℍp−1​(Ki)subscriptℍ𝑝1subscript𝐾𝑖1subscriptℍ𝑝1subscript𝐾𝑖{\\mathbb{H}}_{p-1}(K_{i+1})\\subseteq{\\mathbb{H}}_{p-1}(K_{i}).∎ Consider the following harmonic zigzag module where the harmonic chain groups are connected by either forward inclusions (e.g., ℍ​(Ki)→ℍ​(Ki+1)→ℍsubscript𝐾𝑖ℍsubscript𝐾𝑖1{\\mathbb{H}}(K_{i})\\to{\\mathbb{H}}(K_{i+1})) or backward inclusions (e.g., ℍ​(Ki)←ℍ​(Ki+1)←ℍsubscript𝐾𝑖ℍsubscript𝐾𝑖1{\\mathbb{H}}(K_{i})\\leftarrow{\\mathbb{H}}(K_{i+1}));\nsee Theorem 7.\nDefine the harmonic chain barcode 𝖡ℍ​(F)superscript𝖡ℍ𝐹\\mathsf{B}^{\\mathbb{H}}(F) of F𝐹F\nas the barcode of the zigzag module ℍ​(F)ℍ𝐹{\\mathbb{H}}(F),\nthat is, In general, the harmonic chain barcode is different from the ordinary persistence barcode for a filtration; see Fig. 2.\nIn this paper, we also consider the zigzag module ℍp​(F)subscriptℍ𝑝𝐹{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(F) derived by taking ℍp​(Ki)subscriptℍ𝑝subscript𝐾𝑖{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(K_{i}) on each Kisubscript𝐾𝑖K_{i} in F𝐹F.\nWhile the p𝑝p-th harmonic chain groups in ℍp​(F)subscriptℍ𝑝𝐹{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(F) are still connected by forward or backward inclusions, we may have ℍp​(Ki)=ℍp​(Ki+1)subscriptℍ𝑝subscript𝐾𝑖subscriptℍ𝑝subscript𝐾𝑖1{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(K_{i})={\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(K_{i+1}) for two consecutive groups in ℍp​(F)subscriptℍ𝑝𝐹{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(F).\nWe therefore define the p𝑝p-th harmonic chain barcode 𝖡pℍ​(F)subscriptsuperscript𝖡ℍ𝑝𝐹\\mathsf{B}^{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(F) of F𝐹F\nas the barcode of ℍp​(F)subscriptℍ𝑝𝐹{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(F),\ni.e., 𝖡pℍ​(F):=𝖡​(ℍp​(F))assignsubscriptsuperscript𝖡ℍ𝑝𝐹𝖡subscriptℍ𝑝𝐹\\mathsf{B}^{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(F):=\\mathsf{B}({\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(F)).\nSince ℍ​(F)=⨁pℍp​(F)ℍ𝐹subscriptdirect-sum𝑝subscriptℍ𝑝𝐹{\\mathbb{H}}(F)=\\bigoplus_{p}{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(F) (following from Theorem 7),\nwe have 𝖡ℍ​(F)=⨆p𝖡pℍ​(F)superscript𝖡ℍ𝐹subscriptsquare-union𝑝subscriptsuperscript𝖡ℍ𝑝𝐹\\mathsf{B}^{\\mathbb{H}}(F)=\\bigsqcup_{p}\\mathsf{B}^{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(F). Harmonic Representatives.  \nIn the rest of the section, we define harmonic representatives. Let [b,d]𝑏𝑑[b,d] be an interval in 𝖡ℍ​(F)superscript𝖡ℍ𝐹\\mathsf{B}^{\\mathbb{H}}(F).\nThe inclusion ℍ​(Kb−1)↪ℍ​(Kb)↪ℍsubscript𝐾𝑏1ℍsubscript𝐾𝑏{\\mathbb{H}}(K_{b-1})\\hookrightarrow{\\mathbb{H}}(K_{b}) in ℍ​(F)ℍ𝐹{\\mathbb{H}}(F)\nis forward.\nMoreover, if d<m𝑑𝑚d<m,\nthen the inclusion ℍ​(Kd)↩ℍ​(Kd+1)↩ℍsubscript𝐾𝑑ℍsubscript𝐾𝑑1{\\mathbb{H}}(K_{d})\\hookleftarrow{\\mathbb{H}}(K_{d+1}) is backward. This follows from Theorem 7 and the fact that\ndim(ℍ​(Kb))=dim(ℍ​(Kb−1))+1dimensionℍsubscript𝐾𝑏dimensionℍsubscript𝐾𝑏11\\dim({\\mathbb{H}}(K_{b}))=\\dim({\\mathbb{H}}(K_{b-1}))+1\nand\ndim(ℍ​(Kd+1))=dim(ℍ​(Kd))−1dimensionℍsubscript𝐾𝑑1dimensionℍsubscript𝐾𝑑1\\dim({\\mathbb{H}}(K_{d+1}))=\\dim({\\mathbb{H}}(K_{d}))-1.\n∎ Representatives for general zigzag modules were introduced in [ref]4 [ref]46 (see also ),\nwhich consist of a sequence of cycles\nfor each interval.\nHowever, since the harmonic chain groups are connected by inclusion maps in ℍ​(F)ℍ𝐹{\\mathbb{H}}(F),\nwe have: Each representative for an interval in 𝖡ℍ​(F)superscript𝖡ℍ𝐹\\mathsf{B}^{\\mathbb{H}}(F)\ncontains a single harmonic cycle. We then adapt the definition of representatives for\ngeneral zigzag modules  [ref]46 and\ndefine\nharmonic representatives as follows: A harmonic p𝑝p-representative\n(or simply p𝑝p-representative)\nfor an interval [b,d]∈𝖡pℍ​(F)𝑏𝑑subscriptsuperscript𝖡ℍ𝑝𝐹[b,d]\\in\\mathsf{B}^{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(F) is a p𝑝p-cycle\nz∈ℍp​(Ki)𝑧subscriptℍ𝑝subscript𝐾𝑖z\\in{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(K_{i}) for i∈[b,d]𝑖𝑏𝑑i\\in[b,d] satisfying: z𝑧z is born in ℍp​(Kb)subscriptℍ𝑝subscript𝐾𝑏{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(K_{b}), i.e., z∈ℍp​(Kb)∖ℍp​(Kb−1)𝑧subscriptℍ𝑝subscript𝐾𝑏subscriptℍ𝑝subscript𝐾𝑏1z\\in{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(K_{b})\\setminus{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(K_{b-1}) (notice that b>0𝑏0b>0); z𝑧z dies leaving ℍp​(Kd)subscriptℍ𝑝subscript𝐾𝑑{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(K_{d}), i.e., z∈ℍp​(Kd)∖ℍp​(Kd+1)𝑧subscriptℍ𝑝subscript𝐾𝑑subscriptℍ𝑝subscript𝐾𝑑1z\\in{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(K_{d})\\setminus{\\mathbb{H}}_{p}(K_{d+1}) if d<m𝑑𝑚d<m.
