      "content": "Paper Title: Factored Adaptation for Non-stationary Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNon-stationary RL.\nEarly works in non-stationary RL    only detect changes that have already happened instead of anticipating them.\nIf the evolution of non-stationary environments is a (Semi)-Markov chain, one can deal with non-stationarity with HM-MDPs  or HS3MDPs [ref]30.\nSeveral methods learn to anticipate changes in non-stationary deep RL. Chandak et al.  propose to maximize future rewards without explicitly modeling non-stationary environments. MBCD [ref]32 uses change-point detection to decide if the agent should learn a novel policy or reuse previously trained policies.\nAl-Shedivat et al. [ref]4 extend\nMAML \nfor the non-stationary setting, but do not explicitly model the temporal changes.\nTRIO  tracks the non-stationarity by inferring the evolution of latent parameters, which captures the temporal change factors during the meta-testing phase. ReBAL and GrBAL  meta-train the dynamic prior, which adapts to the local contexts efficiently. However, these methods have to meta-train the model on a set of non-stationary tasks, which may not be accessible in real-world applications.\nAnother line of research directly learns the latent representation to capture the non-stationary components. In particular, LILAC  and ZeUS  leverage latent variable models to directly model the change factors in environments, and Guo et al.  estimate latent vectors that describe the non-stationary or variable part of the dynamics.\nOur approach fits in this line of work; however, as opposed to these methods, which model all temporal changes using a shared embedding space or a mixture models of dynamics, we use a factored representation. Factored MDPs.\nAmong works on factored representations in stationary settings, Hallak et al.  learn factored MDPs     to improve sample efficiency in model-based off-policy RL. Balaji et al.  employ known factored MDP to improve both model-free and model-based RL algorithms. Working memory graphs  learn the factored observation space using Transformers. NeverNet  factorizes the state-action space through graph neural networks.\nZholus et al.  factorize the visual states into actor-related, object of manipulation, and the latent\ninfluence factor between these two states to achieve sparse interaction in robotic control tasks.\nDifferently from methods modeling the factored dynamics and rewards only, Zhou et al.  and Tang et al.  explore factored entities and actions, respectively.\nZhou et al.  extend the factored MDP to the multi-entity environments, learning the compositional structure in tasks with multiple entities involved. Tang et al.  leverage the factored action space to improve the sample efficiency in healthcare applications. However, the factored structures in these two works are derived from inductive bias or domain experts. Factored MDPs, causality and multiple environments. Several works leverage factored MDPs to improve the sample efficiency and generalization of RL. Most of these works focus on learning an invariant (e.g. causal) representation that fits all environments and do not support learning latent change factors.\nFor example, AFaR  learns factored value functions via attention modules to improve sample efficiency and generalization across tasks.\nMutti et al.  learn a causal structure that can generalize across a family of MDPs under different environments, assuming that there are no latent causal factors. Similarly, Wang et al.  propose to learn the factored and causal dynamics in model-based RL, in which the learned causal structure is assumed to generalize to unseen states. By deriving the state abstraction based on the causal graph, it can improve both the sample efficiency and generalizability of policy learning of MBRL. While most of the previous works focus on learning a causal structure that is time-invariant, Pitis et al.  learn a locally causal dynamics that can vary at each timestep and use it to generate counterfactual dynamics transitions in RL.\nWhile the previously described methods focus on a domain or time-invariant representations, in our work we also focus on modelling domain or time-specific factors in the form of latent change factors. A related work, AdaRL  learns the factored representation and the model change factors under heterogeneous domains with varying dynamics or reward functions. However, AdaRL is designed only for the domain adaptation setting and constant change factors without considering non-stationarity. Independent causal mechanisms.\nAnother related line of work is based on independent causal mechanisms  . Recurrent independent mechanisms (RIMs)  learn the independent transition dynamics in RL with sparse communication among the latent states. Meta-RIMs  leverage meta-learning and soft attention to learn a set of RIMs with competition and communication.\nAs opposed to these works, we do not assume that the mechanisms are independent and we learn the factored structure among all components in MDPs with a DBN.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: changes that have already happened instead of anticipating them.\nIf the evolution of non-stationary environments is a (Semi)-Markov chain, one can deal with non-stationarity with HM-MDPs  or HS3MDPs [ref]30.\nSeveral methods learn to anticipate changes in non-stationary deep RL. Chandak et al.  propose to maximize future rewards without explicitly modeling non-stationary environments.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
