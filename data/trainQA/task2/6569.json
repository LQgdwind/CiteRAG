      "content": "Paper Title: Digital Modeling for Everyone: Exploring How Novices Approach Voice-Based 3D Modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo mitigate the issues of traditional GUI-based  Computer-Aided Design (CAD) systems, researchers explored natural interaction paradigms like eye tracking  , brain-computer interface  , gestures  , virtual/augmented reality   and their combination    as a multimodal approach for 3D modeling. The goal of natural interactions with CAD systems is to increase their usability for both expert users and, especially, novice users. Specifically, they aim to: \n\ni) reduce the learning curve of the system;\n\nii) allow a more intuitive interaction process;\n\niii) enhance the design abilities of the designers\n\n\n. An example of a multimodal system is “3D Palette” by Billinghurst et al.: a mix of tablet and pen inputs, electromagnetic sensors and voice commands are used to support the digital design process . Similarly, Nanjundaswamy et al. explored a mix of gesture-based interaction, speech recognition, and brain-computer interfaces to reduce the initial learning curve of the design system . A complete overview of the multimodal solutions for CAD is reported by Niu et al. . Despite these potential benefits, such multimodal techniques require the adoption of specialized hardware (e.g., depth-sensing cameras for gesture recognition, headsets to recognize brain signals), which use can be limited by their prices, sizes, weight, and complexity of use . Thus, it is still hard for novice users to really adopt them in real and daily contexts . To overcome these limitations, researchers also investigated voice-based interaction because of its intuitive nature and the simplicity of the required hardware, i.e., a microphone, which nowadays is embedded in any laptop, tablet, or webcam . Furthermore, considering the ubiquity of smartphones and the rise of AR and VR glasses, voice-based interaction can be generalized to technologies where other interaction modalities are not available options. Attempts of integrating voice-based interaction to CAD systems date as back as 1985 . A more recent work suggests the use of voice commands to allow users to either quickly search commands by simply stating their intention  [ref]47, or to annotate 3D models . Systems, where the entire modeling process is carried out by voice commands, have also been explored. An example is the solution presented by Kou and Tan, where voice commands related to a CAD-specific lexicon and grammar are understood by a context-aware algorithm . A similar example was proposed by Xue et al., which improves the previous solution by allowing free-form sentences in . Another example of a fully-working system is the one presented by Grigor et al.: it follows the same ideas as the previous ones but uses  Artificial Intelligence (AI) to understand the users’ inputs, thus allowing for more freedom in the commands, 4. Similarly, Kou et al. proposed a flexible voice-enabled CAD system, where users are no longer constrained by predefined commands by exploiting a knowledge-guided approach to infer the semantics of voice input . Among all the previous examples, it must be highlighted that the design of their paradigm was made without any kind of involvement of the final users   [ref]47  or by solely involving experts in the final testing phase 4. For example, the study by Nanjundaswamy et al. evaluates a multimodal system using gestures, speech and a brain-computer interface by involving a group of five skilled people . Similarly, Khan et al. involve a total of 41 skilled users from an architecture or engineering background to elicit the requirements of a CAD system based on gestures and speech commands . As another example, Vyas et al. test the usability of a speech-based CAD system involving 6 students with backgrounds in engineering, architecture and visualization . The work proposed by Cuadra et al. investigated how novices use voice assistants to design 3D objects . They performed a WoZ study to compare voice assistants with and without the use of a video channel showing the design in progress, investigating how the two approaches impact users’ accuracy and satisfaction. Cuadra et al. validate the idea of using voice assistants, as participants are more satisfied with their objects and suffer less from cognitive overload when the design process is supported by video, but it does not provide any insight on the mental model of novices approaching the digital modeling task .\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: interaction to CAD systems date as back as 1985 .
