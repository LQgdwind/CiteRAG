      "content": "Paper Title: Parameterized MDPs and Reinforcement Learning Problems - A Maximum Entropy Principle Based Framework\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMarkov Decision Processes (MDPs) model sequential decision making problems which arise in many application areas such as robotics, sensor networks, economics, and manufacturing. These models are characterized by the state-evolution dynamics st+1=f​(st,at)subscript𝑠𝑡1𝑓subscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝑎𝑡s_{t+1}=f(s_{t},a_{t}), a control policy μ​(at|st)𝜇conditionalsubscript𝑎𝑡subscript𝑠𝑡\\mu(a_{t}|s_{t}) that allocates an action atsubscript𝑎𝑡a_{t} from a control set to each state stsubscript𝑠𝑡s_{t}, and a cost c​(st,at,st+1)𝑐subscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝑎𝑡subscript𝑠𝑡1c(s_{t},a_{t},s_{t+1}) associated with the transition from stsubscript𝑠𝑡s_{t} to st+1subscript𝑠𝑡1s_{t+1}. The goal in these applications is to determine the optimal control policy that results in a path, a sequence of actions and states, with minimum cumulative cost. There are many variants of this problem , where the dynamics can be defined over finite or infinite horizons; where the state-dynamics f𝑓f can be stochastic; where the models for the state dynamics may be partially or completely unknown, and the cost function is not known a priori, albeit the cost at each step is revealed at the end of each transition. Some of the most common methodologies that address MDPs include dynamic programming, value and policy iterations , linear programming [ref]3 , and Q-learning . In this article, we view MDPs and their variants as combinatorial optimization problems, and develop a framework based on maximum entropy principle (MEP)  to address them. MEP has proved successful in addressing a variety of combinatorial optimization problems such as facility location problems , combinatorial drug discovery , traveling salesman problem and its variants , image processing , graph and markov chain aggregation 0, and protein structure alignment 1.\nMDPs, too, can be viewed as combinatorial optimization problems - due to the combinatorially large number of paths (sequence of consecutive states and actions) that it may take based on the control policy and its inherent stochasticity. In our MEP framework, we determine a probability distribution defined on the space of paths 2, such that (a) it is the fairest distribution - the one with the maximum Shannon Entropy H𝐻H, and (b) it satisfies the constraint that the expected cumulative cost J𝐽J attains a prespecified feasible value J0subscript𝐽0J_{0}. The framework results in an iterative scheme, an annealing scheme, where probability distributions are improved upon by successively lowering the prespecified values J0subscript𝐽0J_{0}. In fact, the lagrange multiplier β𝛽\\beta corresponding to the cost constraint (J=J0𝐽subscript𝐽0J=J_{0}) in the unconstrained lagrangian is increased from small values (near 0) to large values to effect annealing. Higher values of multipliers correspond to lower values of the expected cost. We show that as multiplier value increases, the corresponding probability distributions become more localized, finally converging to a deterministic policy. This framework is applicable to all the classes of MDPs and its variants described above. Our MEP based approach inherits the flexibility of algorithms such as deterministic annealing  developed in the context of combinatorial resource allocation, which include adding capacity, communication, and dynamic constraints. The added advantage of our approach is that we can draw close parallels to existing algorithms for MDPs and RL (e.g. Q-Learning) – thus enabling us to exploit their algorithmic insights. Below we highlight main contributions and advantages of our approach. Exploration and Unbiased Policy:  In the context of model-free RL setting, the algorithms interact with the environment via agents and rely upon the instantaneous cost (or reward) generated by the environment to learn the optimal policy. Some of the popular algorithms include Q-learning , Double Q-learning 3, Soft Q-learning (entropy regularized Q-learning) 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 in discrete state and action spaces, and Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) 1, and Soft Actor Critic (SAC) 2 in continuous spaces. It is commonly known that for the above algorithms to perform well, all relevant states and actions should be explored. In fact, under the assumption that each state-action pair is visited multiple times during the learning process it is guaranteed that the above discrete space algorithms  3 4 5 will converge to the optimal policy. Thus, the adequate exploration of the state and action spaces becomes incumbent to the success of these algorithms in determining the optimal policy. Often the instantaneous cost is noisy 4 which hinders with the learning process and demands for an enhanced quality exploration. In our MEP based approach, the Shannon Entropy of the probability distribution over the paths in the MDP explicitly characterizes the exploration. The framework results in a distribution over the paths that is as unbiased as possible under the given cost constraint. The corresponding stochastic policy is maximally noncommittal to any particular path in the MDP that achieves the constraint; this results in better (unbiased) exploration. The policy starts from being entirely explorative, when multiplier value is small (β≈0𝛽0\\beta\\approx 0), and becomes increasingly exploitative as the multiplier value increases. Parameterized MDPs and RL:  These class of optimization problems are not even necessarily MDPs which contributes significantly to their inherent complexities. However, we model them in a specific way to retain the Markov property without any loss of generality, thereby making these problems tractable. Scenarios such as self organizing networks 3, 5G small cell network design 4 5, supply chain networks, and last mile delivery problems 6 pose a parameterized MDP with a two-fold objective of determining simultaneously (a) the optimal control policy for the underlying stochastic process, and (b) the unknown parameters that the state and action variables depend upon such that the cumulative cost is minimized. The latter objective is akin to facility location problem 7 8 9, that is shown to be NP-hard 7, and where the associated cost function (non-convex) is riddled with multiple poor local minima. For instance, Figure 1 illustrates a 5G small cell network, where the objective is to simultaneously determine the locations of the small cells {fj}subscript𝑓𝑗\\{f_{j}\\} and design the communication paths (control policy) between the user nodes {ni}subscript𝑛𝑖\\{n_{i}\\} and base station δ𝛿\\delta via network of small cells. Here, the state space 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} of the underlying MDP is parameterized by the locations {yj}subscript𝑦𝑗\\{y_{j}\\} of small cells {fj}subscript𝑓𝑗\\{f_{j}\\}. Algebraic structure and Sensitivity Analysis: In our framework, maximization of Shannon entropy of the distribution over the paths under constraint on the cost function value results in an unconstrained Lagrangian - the free-energy function. This function is a smooth approximation of the cumulative cost function of the MDP, which enables the use of calculus. We exploit this distinctive feature of our framework to determine the unknown state and action parameters in case of parameterized MDPs and perform sensitivity analysis for various problem parameters. Also, the framework easily accommodates stochastic models that describe uncertainties in the instantaneous cost and parameter values. Algorithmic Guarantees and Innovation: For the classes of MDPs that we consider, our MEP-based framework results into non-trivial derivations of the recursive Bellman equation for the associated Lagrangian. We show that these Bellman operators are contraction maps and use their several properties to guarantee the convergence to the optimal policy and as well as to a local minima in the case of parameterized MDPs. In the context of model-free RL, we provide comparisons with the benchmark algorithms Q, Double Q, and entropy regularized G-learning 4 (also referred to as Soft Q-learning). Our algorithms converge at a faster rate (as fast as 1.51.51.5 times) than the benchmark algorithms across various values of discount factor, and even in the case of noisy environments. In the context of parameterized MDPs and RL, we address the small-cell network design problem in 5G communication. Here the parameters are the unknown locations of the small-cells and the control policy determines the routing of the communication packet. Upon comparison with the sequential method of first determining the unknown parameters (small cell locations) and then the control policy (equivalently, the communication paths), we show that our algorithms result into costs that are as low as 65%percent6565\\% of the former. The efficacy of our algorithms can be assessed from the fact that the solutions in the model-based and model-free cases are nearly the same. We also demonstrate sensitivity analysis, benefits of annealing and considering entropy of distribution over the paths in our simulations on parameterized MDPs and RL. This paper is organized as follows. We briefly review the related work and MEP  in the Section II. In Section III and IV we develop MEP-based framework for MDPs. Section V builds upon the Section III to address the case of parameterized MDPs and RL problems. Simulations on a variety of scenarios are presented in Section VI. We discuss the generality of our framework, its capabilities, and future directions of the work in Section VII.
