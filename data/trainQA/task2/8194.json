[ref]27 have studied the homomorphism counting power of some variants of Weisfeiler-Leman algorithms. Dell et¬†al.  shows that indistinguishability of two graphs Gùê∫G and HùêªH by kùëòk-FWL is equivalent to Hom‚Äã(F,G)=Hom‚Äã(F,H)Homùêπùê∫Homùêπùêª\\mathrm{Hom}(F,G)=\\mathrm{Hom}(F,H) for all graphs FùêπF with tree-width at most kùëòk. Zhang et¬†al. [ref]27 further extends the result of  to three other variants of WL algorithms, namely subgraph kùëòk-WL, local kùëòk-WL and local 2-FWL, using the language of nested ear decompositions. However, even [ref]27 has not completely determined the homomorphism counting power of local kùëò\\bm{k}-FWL, for the case of k>ùüêùëò2\\bm{k>2}; [ref]27 also leaves the question open whether the so-called homomorphism expressivity exists for any algorithms that adopt a color-refinement paradigm. Our work fills the gap in [ref]27 regarding the homomorphism counting power of local kùëòk-FWL with k>2ùëò2k>2, and provides an affirmative answer to the latter question for the case of GFWL algorithms. Our work is also methodologically very different from  and [ref]27. The proof of our result no longer depends on concepts such as tree decompositions or nested ear decompositions, and is fully stated in the language of pebble games. Despite its relative conceptual simplicity, our result is much more general than those in  and [ref]27, indicating that our approach (using pebble games) represents a better perspective to tackle the homomorphism counting problem.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: Prior to our work, Dell et¬†al.  and Zhang et¬†al.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
