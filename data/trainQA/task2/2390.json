      "content": "Paper Title: An Energy-Efficient Edge Computing Paradigm for Convolution-based Image Upsampling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany solutions to important computer vision and image processing applications require increasing the number of pixels per unit area (or resolution) by inferring values in high dimensional spaces from low dimensional representations - e.g. scene segmentation , pose estimation 5, image generation , or super resolution .\nThis process, commonly referred to as upsampling, is a one-to-many mapping to predict, generate, or recover information to increase dimensionality  .\nIn contrast, downsampling is a many-to-one mapping used to encode features and reduce dimensionality .\nDeep learning upsampling frameworks typically rely on convolution-based and/or interpolation-based algorithms to increase resolution: Interpolation-based algorithms infer the value of pixels for which there are no sample points using only local information such as nearest pixel value.\nThis class of techniques includes algorithms such as nearest neighbor and bilinear interpolation. Convolution-based upsampling algorithms also infer the value of pixels for which there are no sample points but predict, generate, or recover high frequency information by learning spatial correlations through training strategies .\nThis class of techniques includes algorithms such as deconvolution, sub-pixel convolution, and resize convolution, which are commonly used in end-to-end deep learning solutions  [ref]10   0 . The majority of state-of-the-art deep learning solutions for image upsampling rely on either sub-pixel or resize convolution   [ref]10 0  .\nHowever, these algorithms require memory-intensive feature map transformations at each inference pass.\nIn Section 4, we introduce kernel transformations that exploit the functional equivalence of sub-pixel and resize convolution to deconvolution.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: strategies .\nThis class of techniques includes algorithms such as deconvolution, sub-pixel convolution, and resize convolution, which are commonly used in end-to-end deep learning solutions  [ref]10   0 . The majority of state-of-the-art deep learning solutions for image upsampling rely on either sub-pixel or resize convolution   [ref]10 0  .\nHowever, these algorithms require\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
