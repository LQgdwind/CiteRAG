      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey on Structure-Preserving Graph Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRegarding graph learning, preserving graph structure is crucial for many applications, especially in the bioinformatic area.\nFor example, although two molecules, ethanol and dimethyl ether, have the same formula and node features but minor structure differences, they have different chemical properties and characteristics, as shown in Figure 1.\nThus, it is a requirement for graph representation learning methods to learn not only the similarity between graph features (nodes/edges features) but also preserve graph structures. Over the years, message-passing graph neural networks (MP GNNs) have been widely used to learn graph data and achieved successful results [ref]1.\nHowever, several crucial limitations and challenges are associated with this class of models, such as over-smoothing and over-squashing problems [ref]2.\nTo address the problems, recent graph transformer networks have been proposed and achieved competitive performance against GNNs [ref]1 [ref]3.\nUnlike GNNs, rather than only recursively aggregating neighborhood information through message-passing, graph transformers could learn interactions between pairs of nodes via each single layer.\nHowever, self-attention is equivariant to permutations, resulting in the transformers always yielding the same vector representations for nodes with the same node features regardless of their structures .\nIt is indicated that vanilla graph transformers, i.e., GT¬†, perform poorly when the model overlooks capturing graph structures.\nThis could become severe in graph learning, where self-attention could perform inadequately and fail to detect the structures of the graph, even simple graphs, such as distinguishing non-isomorphic graph pairs .\nTherefore, exploring and preserving graph structures is crucial for graph transformers to learn representations.\n Incorporating graph structure information into the graph transformers has thus achieved increasing attention in graph learning.\nThis survey provides an overview of the recent research progress on structure-preserving graph transformers.\nWe categorize the approaches of those models into mainly four strategies.\n(i) Node feature modulation.\nIn case the node features are not unique, integrating structural features into the original node features could assist graph transformers as expressive as 111-dimensional WL .\nThe strategies could be categorized into two groups: positional encoding and structural distance.\nThe structural information could be extracted using graph theory-based features, such as Laplacian eigenvectors and random walk transition probability.\n(ii) Context node sampling .\nMost of the existing graph transformers sample context nodes within kùëòk-hop distance, indicating their ability to preserve node connectivity up to kùëòk-hop radius     .\nBesides, several recent graph transformers could learn the global structures based on node feature similarity or structural similarity, showing the power to capture long-range dependencies.\n(iii) Graph rewriting.\nReal-world graphs tend to be sparse and scale-free, and this makes low-degree nodes under-represented.\nBesides, nodes with structural similarity are not always located within kùëòk-hop observation.\nThus, graph rewriting methods adjust edges in graphs to propagate rich information and reduce noisy signals, which then benefits self-attention modules to learn correlations between pairs of nodes, such as UGT  and Coarformer .\n(iv) Transformer architecture improvements.\nRecent methods directly improve the transformer architecture, which we mainly group into two categories: leveraging GNNs as extra modules and improving the self-attention module.\nAs the transformer only learns the interaction between pairs of nodes, the use of GNNs could provide structural information to transformers via the aggregation mechanism.\nOther methods, e.g., EGT , modify self-attention modules to encode structural information directly into attention scores.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: (nodes/edges features) but also preserve graph structures.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
