      "content": "Paper Title: Understanding Time Variations of DNN Inference in Autonomous Driving\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAutonomous vehicles are proposed to understand the environment and drive without human intervention [ref]33. DNNs play an essential role in the sensing, perception, decision, and control tasks in autonomous driving. Generally, the research on DNNs for autonomous driving can be divided into two categories: training DNN models with higher accuracy and improving the runtime performance of trained DNN models. Many DNN-based algorithms are deployed in autonomous vehicles for object detection, lane detection, semantic segmentation, localization, etc. . The object detection algorithms can be divided into two types: one-stage based algorithms like YOLO and SSD  ; two-stage based algorithms like Fast R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, etc.  . The key difference is whether there is a proposal bounding box stage. Semantic segmentation is used to detect driving segments. The fully convolutional neural network has been applied and achieves good performance . LaneNet is a lane detection algorithm that uses an instance segmentation problem and applies image semantic segmentation algorithms . Another approach called PINet adds key points estimation with the instance segmentation . After the DNN models get trained, optimizing the model inference in latency, energy consumption, and memory utilization becomes a big challenge. In 2015, Han et al. [ref]24 proposed pruning redundant connections and retraining the deep learning models to fine-tune the weights effectively, reducing computing complexity. Reducing the precision of operations and operands is another direction for the runtime optimization of DNN inference. Reducing precision is usually achieved by reducing the number of bits/levels representing the data, decreasing the computation requirements and storage costs [ref]47. Besides, the profiling of the DNN inference also gets more attention . MLPerf targets a uniformed profiling benchmark for the machine learning algorithms at the edge .\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: Autonomous vehicles are proposed to understand the environment and drive without human intervention [ref]33.
