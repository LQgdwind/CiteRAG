      "content": "Paper Title: Statistical Modeling of Soft Error Influence on Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFault simulation is key to understand the influence of hardware faults on the neural network processing and is the basis for fault-tolerant neural network model and accelerator designs  [ref]12    in various application scenarios. For instance, fault simulations in   are utilized to investigate the vulnerability of neural networks and accelerators, which enables selectively hardware protection against various hardware faults with minimum overhead. Fault simulations in    are applied to investigate the design trade-offs between model accuracy loss and computing errors, which can be leveraged for energy-efficient neural network accelerator design through approximate computing and voltage scaling. Hence, a variety of fault simulation work have been developed in the past few years       [ref]17  [ref]3 . They can generally be divided into two categories depending on the fault simulation abstraction layers. First, neuron-wise fault simulation that injects faults to neurons or weights are mostly widely adopted in prior works [ref]17           and have been verified according to . Although faults are originated from the underlying computing engines, these simulation frameworks typically adopt abstract bit-flip or stuck-at faults and include little hardware architecture details. To further improve the fault analysis precision, Xinghua Xue et al. developed an operation-level fault analysis framework such that hardware faults are injected to basic operations such as multiplication and accumulation, which is utilized to explore the influence of winograd convolution on resilience of neural network processing. Yi He et al. [ref]12 had neural network accelerator architectural parameters combined with high-level simulation of neural network processing with transient faults to achieve both high-fidelity and high-speed resilience study of general neural network accelerators. In summary, the above fault simulation work are mostly built on existing deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow and are flexible for various fault simulations while the parallel processing capability can be negatively affected by the low-level fault injection substantially. The other category is circuit-layer fault simulation that typically conducts fault simulation on circuit designs at either gate level or RTL level. It is already well-supported by commercial EDA tools like TetraMAX and can achieve high simulation precision, but it can be extremely slow for neural network accelerators that include a larger number of transistors. An alternative approach is fault emulation that conducts fault simulation on FPGAs    . Similarly, NVIDIA SASSIFI developed a fault injection mechanism for GPU and can be utilized for rapid fault analysis of neural networks on GPUs. Basically, these fault simulation frameworks greatly improve the fault simulation speed but rely on specific hardware prototypes and architectures which are usually difficult to scale and modify. Despite the efforts, simulation-based fault analysis is mainly applicable to specific setups in terms of neural network models, target hardware architectures, and fault configurations. A comprehensive fault analysis requires a huge number of fault simulations as discussed in Section I which is prohibitively expensive. As a result, the fault analysis generality is usually limited. In fact, because of the limited fault simulation setups, some of the simulation based fault analysis even produces inconsistent results. For instance, Brandon Reagen et al.  concluded that the resilience of different layers of the neural network may vary up to 2781Ã—\\times. Nevertheless, Subho S. Banerjee et al.  revealed a different conclusion based on the Bayesis fault injection and analysis. The problem poses significant demands for more general and faster fault analysis.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Fault simulation is key to understand the influence of hardware faults on the neural network processing and is the basis for fault-tolerant neural network model and accelerator designs  [ref]12    in various application scenarios.
