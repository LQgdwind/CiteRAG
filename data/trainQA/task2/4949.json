      "content": "Paper Title: No-Box Attacks on 3D Point Cloud Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPoint clouds are defined by the 3D coordinates of points making up the cloud. Thus, adversarial attacks can be performed by adding, dropping, or shifting points in the input cloud. An adversarial attack can be created by examining all points in the input cloud, or just critical points as potential targets.\nLiu et al. [ref]10 were inspired by the success of gradient-guided attack methods, such as Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)  and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) , on 2D images. They applied a similar methodology to develop adversarial attacks on 3D point clouds. Similarly, the Carlini and Wagner (C&W) [ref]8 optimization for finding adversarial examples has also been transplanted to 3D data. For example, Tsai et al.  use the C&W optimization formulation with an additional perturbation-bound regularization to construct adversarial attacks. To generate an attack with a minimum number of points, Kim et al.  extend the C&W formulation by adding a term to constrain the number of perturbed points. The adversarial points found in  were almost identical to the PointNet critical points. Xiang et al.  demonstrated that PointNet can be fooled by shifting or adding synthetic points or adding clusters and objects to the point cloud. To find such adversarial examples, they applied the C&W strategy to the critical points, rather than all points. Constraining the search space around critical points is sometimes necessary because an exhaustive search through an unconstrained 3D space is infeasible.\nAn attack method that uses the critical-point property for PointNet is proposed by Yang et al. [ref]22. By recalculating the class-dependent importance for each remaining point, they iteratively remove the most crucial point for the true class. The authors noted that the critical points exist in different models and that a universal point-dropping method should be developed for all models.\nWicker et al.  proposed randomly and iteratively determining the critical points and then generating adversarial examples by dropping these points. Arya et al.  identify critical points by calculating the largest magnitudes of the loss gradient with respect to the points. After finding those points, the authors propose a minimal set of adversarial points among critical points and perturb them slightly to create adversarial examples. Zheng et al.  developed a more flexible method that extends finding critical points to other deep models besides PointNet. They introduced a saliency score defined as where risubscript𝑟𝑖r_{i} is the distance of the i𝑖i-th point to the cloud center, γ𝛾\\gamma is a hyperparameter, and ∂ℒ∂riℒsubscript𝑟𝑖\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial r_{i}} is the gradient of the loss ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} with respect to the amount of shifting the point towards the center. Adversarial examples are created by shifting the points with high saliency scores towards the center, so that they will not affect the surfaces much. In addition to the methods for creating adversarial attacks on point clouds, a number of methods for defending against these attacks have been developed . For 3D point cloud classification, adversarial training and point removal as a pre-processing step in training have been extensively studied . Some of the methods proposed for point removal to improve robustness against adversarial attacks include simple random sampling (SRS) [ref]22, statistical outlier removal (SOR) , Denoiser and UPsampler Network (DUP-Net) , high-frequency removal , and salient point removal [ref]10.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: by adding, dropping, or shifting points in the input cloud.
