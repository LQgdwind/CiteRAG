      "content": "Paper Title: SPRINT: Scalable Policy Pre-Training via Language Instruction Relabeling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLanguage in RL.\nThere is a large body of work at the intersection of natural language processing and behavior learning for robotics, and the field has been further accelerated by the recent successes in training large, general-purpose language models. Language has been used to structure agents’ representations [ref]12 , learn reward functions , guide task learning via recipes   and perform long-horizon planning    . Another line of work has used language to define a wide range of tasks for pre-training policies, resulting in impressive generalization capabilities   . Yet, these works require collecting hundreds of thousands of costly human language instructions. Our approach SPRINT builds on this line of work but introduces two novel objectives for automatic relabeling of training task instructions, thereby substantially reducing the amount of human labeling required for successful pre-training. Prior works have also investigated automated language instruction generation  [ref]22 , but they focus on online learning and make assumptions that are hard to scale, e.g., hand-defined grammars  or privileged state information  [ref]22. In contrast, we perform offline pre-training and use large language models for scalable task generation. Pre-training Policies for RL.\nDeveloping policy pre-training approaches for faster downstream learning has been investigated for many years   . Recent advances in offline RL   enabled approaches that can pre-train agents offline and effectively finetune them on online tasks    . However, these approaches require target-task reward annotations on the pre-training data and the resulting policies are only pre-trained to solve the target task. Meta-RL approaches, on the other hand, pre-train on a range of tasks and thus allow fast adaptation to unseen downstream tasks    , yet require the tedious manual definition of pre-training tasks by experts. To avoid manual task design, other works have explored unsupervised pre-training approaches based on behavior diversification   , extraction of behavior priors from offline agent experience    or goal state reaching  [ref]42.\nClosest to ours, [ref]42 proposes an objective that randomly selects states to chain together existing trajectories, while we propose a language skill chaining objective that allows SPRINT to\nexecute new, composite language instructions.\nSuch unsupervised pre-training approaches [ref]42 learn skill repertoires without clear meaning, which, as we demonstrate in Section IV, lead to worse downstream task transfer. Pre-trained Models for Data Augmentation.\nObtaining robot (pre-)training data at scale is costly. Thus, recent works have explored using world knowledge captured in large pre-trained models for enriching robot learning datasets, e.g., by increasing the visual diversity of trajectories    or annotating unlabeled data . Our approach similarly leverages pre-trained (language) models for automated data augmentation. By investigating an orthogonal augmentation direction, aggregation and chaining of natural language instructions, SPRINT is complementary to these methods.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: for robotics, and the field has been further accelerated by the recent successes in training large, general-purpose language models.
