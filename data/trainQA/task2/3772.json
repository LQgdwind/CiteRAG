      "content": "Paper Title: Mitigating Bias in Facial Analysis Systems by Incorporating Label Diversity\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been incorporated into a large number of real-world applications.\nBy integrating automated algorithm-based decision-making systems one might expect that the decisions will be more objective and fair.\nUnfortunately, as several approaches have shown [ref]1 [ref]2, this is not always the case.\nGiven that AI algorithms are trained with historical data, these prediction engines may inherently learn, preserve and even amplify biases [ref]3.\nSpecial attention has been devoted to facial analysis applications since in the biometric modality performance differentials mostly fall across points of sensitivity (e.g. race and gender) . Particularly, the human face is a very important research topic as it transmits plenty of information to other humans, and thus possibly to computer systems , such as identity, emotional state, attractiveness, age, gender, and personality traits.\nAdditionally, the human face has also been of considerable interest to researchers due to the inherent and extraordinarily well-developed ability of humans to process, recognize, and extract information from others’ faces .\nFaces dominate our daily situations since we are born, and our sensitivity to them is strengthened every time we see a face under different conditions . With the vast adoption of those systems in high-impact domains, it is important to take fairness issues into consideration and ensure sensitive attributes will not be used for discriminative purposes.\nIn this work, we focus our attention on two main aspects of facial analysis, attractiveness and facial expression, both of which have a powerful impact on our lives.\nFor instance, the pursuit for beauty has encouraged trillion-dollar cosmetics, aesthetics, and fitness industries, each one promising a more attractive, youthful, and physically fitter version for each individual .\nBeauty also seems to be an important aspect of human social interactions and matching behaviors, in which more attractive people appear to benefit from higher long-term socioeconomic status and are even perceived by peers as “better” people . Simultaneously, facial expression is one of the most powerful, instinctive and universal signals for human beings to convey their emotional state and intentions .\nOften the face express an emotion before people can even understand or verbalize it.\nMehrabian et al.  shows that 55% of messages regarding feelings and attitudes are conveyed through facial expression, 7% of which are in the words that are spoken, and the rest of which are paralinguistic. In part because of its importance and potential uses as well as its inherent challenges, automated attractiveness rating and facial expression recognition have been of keen interest in the computer vision and machine learning communities.\nSeveral approaches have proposed methods for automatically assessing face attractiveness and expressions through computer analysis  .\nHowever, as already shown in previous work   [ref]1, models that are trained to automatically analyze facial traits\nmight exhibit algorithmic discrimination behavior with respect to protected groups, potentially posing negative impacts on individuals and society. Despite several advances towards understanding and mitigating the effect of bias in model prediction, limited research focused on\naugmenting the label diversity of the annotations.\nThus, in this work, we introduce a novel learning method to mitigate such fairness issues.\nWe propose a method to generate and combine different types of label annotations, such as the subjective human-based labels, and the objective labels based on geometrical definitions of attractiveness and facial expression.\nWe hypothesize that introducing diversity into the decision-making model by adding mathematical and possibly unbiased notions in the label dimension should reduce the biases.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a pre-processing debiasing method combines “objective” (mathematical) labels and “subjective” (human-based) annotations.\n To summarize, our key contributions are as follows:\n\n\n(1) We generate new annotations based on specific traits of the human face.\n\n(2) We propose a novel method that aims to mitigate biases by incorporating diversity into the training data for two tasks: attractiveness classification and facial expression recognition.\nHowever, we note that our approach extends to any tasks that has objective measures as well as subjective human labeling;\n\n(3) We show that our approach is not dependent upon the data distribution of the novel annotations.\nMoreover, we show that the models trained on mathematical notions achieve a better fairness metric\ncompared to the models trained on only the human-based labels;\n\n(4) Finally, using our method, we are able to achieve improvements in the fairness metrics over the baselines, while maintaining comparable accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: applications.\nBy integrating automated algorithm-based decision-making systems one might expect that the decisions will be more objective and fair.\nUnfortunately, as several approaches have shown [ref]1 [ref]2, this is not always the case.\nGiven that AI algorithms are trained with historical data, these prediction engines may inherently learn, preserve and even amplify biases [ref]3.\nSpecial\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
