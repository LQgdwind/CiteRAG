      "content": "Paper Title: RangeUDF: Semantic Surface Reconstruction from 3D Point Clouds\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nShape reconstruction has been studied for decades. Classical approaches to recover 3D structures from images mainly include SfM [ref]36 and SLAM  systems such as Colmap 1 and ORB-SLAM . Surface reconstruction of 3D point clouds mainly relies on global or local smoothness priors such as Poisson reconstruction , radial basis functions [ref]6 and moving least-squares surfaces . A comprehensive survey of classical methods can be found in . Recent learning based approaches for 3D shape representation and semantic segmentation are outlined below. Explicit 3D Representations:\nTo model explicit 3D geometry of objects and scenes, impressive progress has come from recent advances in recovering voxel grids , octree 7, point clouds , triangle meshes  and shape primitives 7 from either images or point clouds. Although they have shown great performance in shape reconstruction 3 6, completion 3, shape generation , and scene understanding 0 , the quality of such discrete shape representations are inherently limited by the spatial resolution and memory footprint. As a consequence, they are hard to scale up to complex 3D scenes. Implicit 3D Representations:\nTo overcome the discretization issue of explicit representations, MLPs have been recently used to learn implicit functions to represent continuous 3D shapes. Such implicit representations can be generally classified as: 1) occupancy fields  , 2) signed distance fields 2, 3) unsigned distance fields  , 4) radiance fields , and 5) hybrid fields 2. Among them, both occupancy fields and signed distance fields can only recover closed 3D shapes, while radiance fields focus on neural rendering instead of surface reconstruction. In the past two years, these representations have been extensively studied for shape reconstruction  0  9 6, neural rendering and novel view synthesis , shape generation 8, and understanding 4 5. Although achieving impressive results, almost all of these works focus on single objects or small-scale scenes. In this paper, we scale up the implicit representation to the next level, where our RangeUDF can jointly estimate precise 3D surfaces with semantics from real-world complex point clouds where existing methods cannot. 3D Semantic Segmentation:\nTo learn per-point semantics for point clouds, existing methods generally include 1) projection and voxel based methods  and 2) point based methods . Given fully-annotated point cloud datasets, the existing approaches have achieved excellent semantic segmentation accuracy. However, these methods are designed to classify the discrete and individual 3D points explicitly sampled from scene surfaces. With the fast development of implicit representation of 3D scenes, it is desirable to learn semantic information for implicit surfaces. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work to jointly estimate structures and semantics for implicit representations from real-world sparse point clouds.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: Shape reconstruction has been studied for decades.
