Beyond this paper, several other works have explicitly considered pedestrians as part of the problem formulation.  likewise addressed joint vehicle-pedestrian control at intersections, but made no assumptions about pedestrian detector capabilities.  used deep RL to control a signalized crosswalk across a road (with the actions being to set the pedestrian signal to green or red), and found that it outperformed actuation under moderate levels of pedestrian demand in simulations.  analyzed the performance of RL-based TSC in the presence of jaywalking pedestrians that cause vehicles to slow. Several works in RL-based TSC have also considered prioritization and preemption. For prioritization, [ref]72 upweighted buses and emergency vehicles in their throughput-based reward formulation;  used a state representation based on the cell transmission traffic model and modelled priority as a binary variable;  adopted an implicit approach based on minimizing delay per person instead of per vehicle;  and  both considered prioritization for trams, with the former’s rewards being based on tram schedule adherence and the latter using model predictive control to model driver behaviour; and [ref]136 adaptively altered vehicles’ priorities depending on queue length, waiting time, and emergency vehicle presence. For preemption, [ref]137 learned TSC policies for emergency vehicle routing with rewards that encourage low vehicle density, and  used RL to learn policies for notifying connected vehicles to clear out lanes for emergency vehicles to pass. Lastly, 9 included demand data from the field for multiple types of road users — including pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists, trucks, and buses — in their benchmark simulation for RL-based TSC, LemgoRL, which is based on a real road network; they also included pedestrian waiting times in rewards and enforced minimum pedestrian green times. There is a need to connect high-fidelity simulations such as LemgoRL to the various approaches for handling different road user classes that we outlined above, so as to ensure their ecological validity.\n\nReference markers found: [72]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]72: of RL-based TSC in the presence of jaywalking pedestrians that cause vehicles to slow.
