      "content": "Paper Title: Crowdsourcing the Perception of Machine Teaching\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMachine teaching involves a teacher who knows the decision boundaries and designs an optimal training set for one or more students . In this paper, the teacher is a human and the student is a classification model who is being trained to classify images of objects, as shown in Figure 2, though the inverse – machines teaching humans to classify images – is also an active area of research . There is a rich literature on sequential machine teaching with humans as the teacher, e.g., programming by demonstration for teaching robots to manipulate objects  . However, in this review we focus on prior work that utilizes batch teaching, where examples are given as a set and their order does not matter. Batch teaching is a very common paradigm for many real-world AI-infused systems, e.g., using face recognition, fraud detection and speech recognition. This is typically done by experts in the field and end-users are hardly exposed to the underlying mechanisms that could help explain their limitations. Teachable interfaces333A term coined by Patel and Roy (1998) , where “the user is a willing participant in the adaptation process and actively provides feedback to the machine to guide its learning.” that fall under this machine teaching paradigm, have the potential to help in this direction as they can enable non-experts to uncover basic machine learning concepts (e.g., ). Moreover, with advances in transfer learning  , they can spur innovation as end-users can re-purpose models trained on vast amounts of data for new but related tasks, e.g., personalize assistive technologies . We look into prior work employing teachable interfaces, a term perhaps not originally used by the authors. Here, we focus on a subset of interactive machine learning literature, where users are called to generate all the training and testing examples for a personalized model. Table 1 presents representative examples of prior studies from 2011-2019 on gesture recognition for musicians , sign language  and educational applications , personalized sound detectors for people who are deaf/Deaf or hard-of-hearing , personal object recognizers for blind people , and physical activity classifiers for young athletes . In contrast to this work, prior studies tend to have smaller participant pools and are typically conducted in a controlled setting, where the researchers are present. Partially this could be due to the user characteristics of interest; people with disabilities  , children , and students . Another reason could be challenges in remote data collection as it would require a working prototype   or specialized devices from the users  . Our teachable object recognition testbed, utilizing built in camera in a mobile phone, and existing crowdsourcing platforms allow us to reach a larger participant pool that can be further scaled. As shown in Table 1, the input modality for the teaching set was more often based on sensing    and videos   with one example for sound  and photos . For the last two, participants could not assess the quality of their teaching examples – participants who were deaf/Deaf or hard-of-hearing could not hear the sounds they recorded  and blind participants could not see the photos they took . In this paper, we choose images as the input modality for the teaching set. This allows us to tap into a large user group of non-experts that can simply use their mobile phones to take the photos in a real-world setting. More so, by choosing an object classification task, an accessible task to many where they can serve as the oracle, we are given the opportunity to explore how humans teach a high-dimensional decision boundary to machines by feeding them only with few instances. More importantly, this modality allows us to visually inspect the teaching set for common patterns in users’ behavior. Similar to most of the prior work in Table 1, our analysis is based on observed behaviors and participant feedback. Leveraging prior work in neuroscience, we examine how non-experts’ teaching strategies draw parallels in machine robustness to human robustness, where object recognition involves generalization across size, location, viewpoint and illumination . While prior work did not include such a fine-grained analysis of the participants’ input, it provided insights and anecdotal evidence that guided the design of our study such as the need for iterations   , which may vary not only across participants but also due to the underlying algorithm and task [ref]22. For comparison purposes and time sake, we opted to keep the number of iterations constant at two. Similar to our study, the number of classes were limited (2-5) with an exception of 15 , where there were no iterations.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: insights and anecdotal evidence that guided the design of our study such as the need for iterations   , which may vary not only across participants but also due to the underlying algorithm and task [ref]22.
