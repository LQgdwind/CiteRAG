      "content": "Paper Title: Theory and Applications of Probabilistic Kolmogorov Complexity\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConsider an arbitrary binary string x∈{0,1}∗𝑥superscript01x\\in\\{0,1\\}^{*}, e.g., The Kolmogorov complexity of x𝑥x, 𝖪​(x)𝖪𝑥\\mathsf{K}(x), is the length |M|𝑀|M| of the shortest program M𝑀M that prints x𝑥x when computing over the empty input string.111We formally define (time-bounded) Kolmogorov complexity in Section 2. Intuitively, 𝖪​(x)𝖪𝑥\\mathsf{K}(x) can be seen as a measure of the “randomness” of x𝑥x, in the sense that simple strings exhibiting an apparent pattern have bounded Kolmogorov complexity (e.g., the leftmost 20 bits of the string x𝑥x from Equation 1), while a typical random n𝑛n-bit string has 𝖪​(x)𝖪𝑥\\mathsf{K}(x) close to n𝑛n, i.e., it cannot be compressed. The investigation of Kolmogorov complexity has uncovered surprising connections to distant areas of mathematics and computer\nscience, ranging from computability, logic, and algorithm design to number theory, combinatorics, statistics and a number of other fields. We refer to   for a comprehensive treatment of Kolmogorov complexity and its applications. Despite the appealing nature and wide applicability of Kolmogorov complexity, its results and techniques tend to be inappropriate in settings where the running time of algorithms is of concern, e.g., in complexity theory, computational learning theory, and cryptography. This is because 𝖪​(x)𝖪𝑥\\mathsf{K}(x) does not take into account the time that the machine M𝑀M takes to output x𝑥x. To address this issue, several authors have contributed to the development of time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity. In order to proceed with our discussion, we describe two prominent time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity notions. (A formal treatment appears in Section 2.) In an influential paper, Levin  introduced 𝖪𝗍​(x)𝖪𝗍𝑥\\mathsf{Kt}(x), a variant of Kolmogorov complexity that simultaneously takes into account the running time t𝑡t and description length |M|𝑀|M| of all programs M𝑀M that output x𝑥x. More precisely, given a string x∈{0,1}∗𝑥superscript01x\\in\\{0,1\\}^{*}, we let To provide intuition and give a concrete example of the usefulness of this time-bounded variant of Kolmogorov complexity to algorithms and complexity theory, we consider the following computational problem at the intersection of mathematics and computer science:\n Explicit Construction of Primes: Given an integer n≥2𝑛2n\\geq 2, deterministically compute an n𝑛n-bit prime number.222For instance, the string x𝑥x in Equation 1 is a 404040-bit prime (733008047147733008047147733008047147 in decimal representation).\n The fastest known algorithm that solves this problem runs in time O~​(2n/2)~𝑂superscript2𝑛2\\widetilde{O}(2^{n/2}) , and it is a longstanding open problem to improve this bound (see ). Let A​(n)𝐴𝑛A(n) denote this procedure, and consider the sequence {pn}n≥2subscriptsubscript𝑝𝑛𝑛2\\{p_{n}\\}_{n\\geq 2} of primes output by A​(n)𝐴𝑛A(n). Since we can encode the fixed algorithm A𝐴A using O​(1)𝑂1O(1) bits and any fixed number n𝑛n using O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) bits, it follows that some program M𝑀M of description length O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) runs in time t=O~​(2n/2)𝑡~𝑂superscript2𝑛2t=\\widetilde{O}(2^{n/2}) and prints pnsubscript𝑝𝑛p_{n}. Consequently, there is an n𝑛n-bit prime pnsubscript𝑝𝑛p_{n} such that 𝖪𝗍​(pn)≤O​(1)+O​(log⁡n)+log⁡t≤n/2+O​(log⁡n)𝖪𝗍subscript𝑝𝑛𝑂1𝑂𝑛𝑡𝑛2𝑂𝑛\\mathsf{Kt}(p_{n})\\leq O(1)+O(\\log n)+\\log t\\leq n/2+O(\\log n). More generally, a faster algorithm yields improved bounds on the 𝖪𝗍𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{Kt} complexity of some sequence of prime numbers. Conversely, it is possible to prove that if there is a sequence {qn}n≥2subscriptsubscript𝑞𝑛𝑛2\\{q_{n}\\}_{n\\geq 2} of n𝑛n-bit primes such that 𝖪𝗍​(qn)=λn𝖪𝗍subscript𝑞𝑛subscript𝜆𝑛\\mathsf{Kt}(q_{n})=\\lambda_{n}, then the problem of explicit constructing primes can be solved in time O~​(2λn)~𝑂superscript2subscript𝜆𝑛\\widetilde{O}(2^{\\lambda_{n}}).333As discovered by Levin, this is achieved by an algorithm that attempts to compute an n𝑛n-bit prime by carefully simulating all programs of small description length for an appropriate number of steps until an n𝑛n-bit prime is found. This shows that one can completely capture the problem of explicitly constructing primes via time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity! Note that in 𝖪𝗍𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{Kt} complexity the time bound is not fixed and depends on the best possible description of x𝑥x. In some contexts, it is desirable to restrict attention to programs M𝑀M that run under a specified time bound t​(n)𝑡𝑛t(n), e.g., in time ≤n3absentsuperscript𝑛3\\leq n^{3}. This is captured by 𝖪tsuperscript𝖪𝑡\\mathsf{K}^{t} complexity (see, e.g., ), where t:ℕ→ℕ:𝑡→ℕℕt\\colon\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{N} is a fixed function: As a recent application of time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity, Liu and Pass  connected one-way functions (OWF), a primitive that is essential to cryptography, to the computational difficulty of estimating the 𝖪tsuperscript𝖪𝑡\\mathsf{K}^{t} complexity of an input string x𝑥x, when t𝑡t is a fixed polynomial. A bit more precisely, they showed that OWFs exist if and only if it is computationally hard on average to estimate 𝖪t​(x)superscript𝖪𝑡𝑥\\mathsf{K}^{t}(x) for a random input string x𝑥x (see their paper for the exact statement). This provides another striking example of the power and reach of time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity. While connections between time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity and different areas of theoretical computer science have been known for a long time (see, e.g.,    ), recent applications of it to cryptography   , learning  8, average-case complexity 5, circuit complexity , and proof search 9 have led to much interest in this topic and to a number of related developments. We refer the reader to these papers and to        for more information on different time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity measures and their applications.\n Probabilistic (Time-Bounded) Kolmogorov Complexity. The need to use time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity in certain applications can create issues that are not present in the case of (time-unbounded) Kolmogorov complexity. More precisely, several central results from Kolmogorov complexity are not known to hold in a time-bounded setting. Some of them do survive under a plausible assumption (e.g., a source coding theorem holds for 𝖪tsuperscript𝖪𝑡\\mathsf{K}^{t} under a strong derandomisation assumption ), but this leads to conditional results only. In other cases, the validity of a result in the setting of time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity is closely tied to a longstanding open problem in complexity theory (e.g., the computational difficulty of estimating 𝖪t​(x)superscript𝖪𝑡𝑥\\mathsf{K}^{t}(x) and the aforementioned connection to OWFs ). We refer to  for an extensive discussion on the similarities and differences between Kolmogorov complexity and its time-bounded counterparts. Going beyond the technical difficulties of employing time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity, which some papers such as 5 managed to overcome with the right assumptions in place, there is perhaps a more relevant issue in the application of notions such as 𝖪𝗍𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{Kt} and 𝖪tsuperscript𝖪𝑡\\mathsf{K}^{t} to algorithms and complexity: these classical measures refer to deterministic algorithms and programs. However, in many cases it is desirable or even necessary to consider randomised algorithms. Since the random strings that are part of the input of a randomised algorithm have high complexity, the classical theory of time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity might be inappropriate or simply cannot be applied in such contexts. To mitigate these issues and develop a more robust theory of time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity that can be deployed in the important setting of randomised computations, some recent papers  [ref]44 [ref]45 1 [ref]46 have explored probabilistic notions of time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity. For this to make sense, we must conciliate the high complexity of a random string, which can be accessed by a randomised algorithm, with the goal of obtaining a succinct representation of x∈{0,1}∗𝑥superscript01x\\in\\{0,1\\}^{*}. Note that simply storing a good choice of the random string r𝑟r for a small program M𝑀M that prints x𝑥x when given r𝑟r does not lead to a succinct representation of x𝑥x. The key concept employed in the aforementioned papers is that of a probabilistic representation of the string x𝑥x. In other words, this is the code of a randomised program M𝑀M such that, for most choices of its internal random string r𝑟r, M𝑀M prints x𝑥x from r𝑟r. Observe that the representation itself is a deterministic object: the code of M𝑀M. However, to recover x𝑥x from M𝑀M, we must run the randomised algorithm M𝑀M, meaning that we obtain x𝑥x with high probability but there might be a small chance that M𝑀M outputs a different string.444This is similar to the notion of a pseudodeterministic algorithm from . If |M|𝑀|M| is small, we obtain a succinct probabilistic representation of x𝑥x. It is possible to introduce different variants of probabilistic time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity, and we properly define them in Section 3. The investigation of probabilistic Kolmogorov complexity and of probabilistic representations is motivated from several angles: If we are running a randomised algorithm over an input string x𝑥x, then storing a probabilistic representation of x𝑥x instead of x𝑥x can be done without loss of generality. There is already a small probability that the randomised algorithm outputs an incorrect answer, so it makes sense to tolerate a small probability of computing over a wrong input as well (i.e., when x𝑥x is not correctly recovered from its probabilistic representation). We will see later in the survey that probabilistic Kolmogorov complexity allows us in some cases to obtain unconditional versions of results that previously were only known to hold under strong complexity-theoretic assumptions. As alluded to above, there are situations where the deterministic time-bounded measures simply cannot be applied due to the presence of randomised computations involving random strings of high complexity. Finally, advances in probabilistic Kolmogorov complexity can be translated into results and insights for the classical notions of 𝖪𝗍𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{Kt} complexity and 𝖪tsuperscript𝖪𝑡\\mathsf{K}^{t} complexity, under certain derandomisation hypotheses. Before describing our results and explaining the points mentioned above in more detail, we present a list of five fundamental questions to guide our investigation and exposition of probabilistic Kolmogorov complexity.\n Q1. Usefulness: Are there shorter probabilistic representations for natural objects, such as prime numbers? Can such representations detect structure in data that is inaccessible for 𝖪𝗍𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{Kt} and 𝖪tsuperscript𝖪𝑡\\mathsf{K}^{t}?\n Q2. Probabilistic Compression: If succinct probabilistic representations exist, how can we efficiently compute one such representation? This is particularly relevant for data compression.\n Q3. Applications: Are there interesting applications of probabilistic time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity to algorithms and complexity theory?\n Q4. Computational Hardness: If provably secure cryptography exists, it must be impossible to efficiently detect certain patterns in data. Is it computationally hard to decide if a string admits a succinct probabilistic representation?\n Q5. Finding an Incompressible String: Can we explicitly produce a string that does not admit a short probabilistic representation? What are such strings useful for?\n In the remaining parts of this article, we explain the recent progress on Questions Q1-Q5 achieved by references  [ref]44 [ref]45 1 [ref]46. Along the way, we highlight some concrete open problems and present directions for further research. Due to space constraints, we often provide only a sketch of the underlying arguments, referring to the original references for more details.\n Organisation and Overview. For convenience of the reader, we provide below a brief overview of each remaining section of this survey and how it relates to Questions Q1-Q5 described above.\n – Section 2 fixes notation and formalises the deterministic time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity notions 𝖪𝗍𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{Kt} and 𝖪tsuperscript𝖪𝑡\\mathsf{K}^{t}.\n – Section 3 formalises the intuitive concept of probabilistic representations discussed above. We introduce the probabilistic measures 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt}, 𝗋𝖪tsuperscript𝗋𝖪𝑡\\mathsf{rK}^{t}, and 𝗉𝖪tsuperscript𝗉𝖪𝑡\\mathsf{pK}^{t} and describe some simple applications.\n – Section 4 addresses Question Q1 (Usefulness) and explains a result from [ref]45 showing that infinitely many primes admit efficient probabilistic representations of sub-polynomial complexity. This is a significant improvement over the aforementioned ≈n/2absent𝑛2\\approx n/2 bound for 𝖪𝗍𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{Kt} complexity.\n – Section 5 covers the relation between sampling algorithms for a distribution over strings and the existence of probabilistic representations for individual strings [ref]44 [ref]46. Such results are called source coding theorems and have applications to Question Q2 (Probabilistic Compression).\n – Section 6 approaches Question Q3 (Applications) and discusses applications of 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt}, 𝗋𝖪tsuperscript𝗋𝖪𝑡\\mathsf{rK}^{t}, and 𝗉𝖪tsuperscript𝗉𝖪𝑡\\mathsf{pK}^{t} to average-case complexity and learning 1 [ref]46. We employ these notions to simplify previous proofs, obtain new results that crucially rely on probabilistic Kolmogorov complexity, and establish unconditional analogues of theorems that were only known under derandomisation hypotheses.\n – Section 7 is connected to Question Q1 (Usefulness) and focuses on the relation between time-bounded deterministic and probabilistic measures. We observe that these notions essentially coincide under strong enough derandomisation assumptions  1. Assuming them, insights from probabilistic Kolmogorov complexity readily translate into information about 𝖪𝗍𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{Kt} and 𝖪tsuperscript𝖪𝑡\\mathsf{K}^{t}.\n – Section 8 sheds light on Question Q4 (Computational Hardness) by unconditionally establishing that certain computational problems about estimating the probabilistic time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity of an input string cannot be solved in probabilistic polynomial time  [ref]45.\n – Section 9 shows that Question Q5 (Finding an Incompressible String) is closely related to the existence of hierarchy theorems for probabilistic time [ref]44 [ref]45, a fundamental question in computational complexity theory.\n – Section 10 provides some concluding remarks and prospects for the potential impact of (probabilistic) time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity in algorithms and complexity.\n Acknowledgements.
