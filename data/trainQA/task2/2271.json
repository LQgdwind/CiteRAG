      "content": "Paper Title: Subgroup Generalization and Fairness of Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) [ref]13   are a family of machine learning models that can be used to model non-Euclidean data as well as inter-related samples in a flexible way. In recent years, there have been enormous successful applications of GNNs in various areas, such as drug discovery , computer vision , transportation forecasting [ref]49, recommender systems [ref]48, etc. Depending on the type of prediction target, the application tasks can be roughly categorized into node-level, edge-level, subgraph-level, and graph-level tasks . In contrast to the marked empirical success, theoretical understanding of the generalization ability of GNNs has been rather limited. Among the existing literature, some studies    focus on the analysis of graph-level tasks where each sample is an entire graph and the samples of graphs are IID. A very limited number of studies   explore GNN generalization for node-level tasks but they assume the nodes (and their associated neighborhoods) are IID samples, which does not align with the commonly seen graph-based semi-supervised learning setups. Baranwal et al.  investigate GNN generalization without IID assumptions but under a specific data generating mechanism. In this work, our first contribution is to provide a novel PAC-Bayesian analysis for the generalization ability of GNNs on node-level tasks with non-IID assumptions. In particular, we assume the node features are fixed and the node labels are independently sampled from distributions conditioned on the node features. We also assume the training set and the test set can be chosen as arbitrary subsets of nodes on the graph. We first prove two general PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds (Theorem 1 and Theorem 2) under this non-IID setup. Subsequently, we derive a generalization bound for GNN (Theorem 3) in terms of characteristics of the GNN models and the node features. Notably, the generalization bound for GNN is influenced by the distance between the test nodes and the training nodes in terms of their aggregated node features. This suggests that, given a fixed training set, test nodes that are “far away” from all the training nodes may suffer from larger generalization errors. Based on this analysis, our second contribution is the discovering of a type of unfairness that arises from theoretically predictable accuracy disparity across some subgroups of test nodes. We further conduct a empirical study that investigates the prediction accuracy of four popular GNN models on different subgroups of test nodes. The results on multiple benchmark datasets indicate that there is indeed a significant disparity in test accuracy among these subgroups. We summarize the contributions of this work as follows: We establish a novel PAC-Bayesian analysis for graph-based semi-supervised learning with non-IID assumptions. Under this setup, we derive a generalization bound for GNNs that can be applied to an arbitrary subgroup of test nodes. As an implication of the generalization bound, we predict that there would be an unfairness of GNN predictions that arises from accuracy disparity across subgroups of test nodes. We empirically verify the existence of accuracy disparity of popular GNN models on multiple benchmark datasets, as predicted by our theoretical analysis.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) [ref]13   are a family of machine learning models that can be used to model non-Euclidean data as well as inter-related samples in a flexible way.
