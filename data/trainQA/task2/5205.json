      "content": "Paper Title: Distributed Pruning Towards Tiny Neural Networks in Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved great success in the past decade. However, the huge computational cost and storage overhead limit the usage of DNNs on resource-constrained devices. Neural network pruning has been a well-known solution to improve hardware efficiency  . The core of neural network pruning is to remove insignificant parameters from a DNN and determine specialized subnetworks for different hardware platforms and training tasks (defined as deployment scenarios).\nTo achieve better accuracy, most pruning approaches rely heavily on training data to trade off model size, efficiency, and accuracy  [ref]3 [ref]4  , which, unfortunately, becomes ineffective when dealing with confidential training datasets distributed over resource-constrained devices. Recent success in federated learning enables collaborative training across distributed devices with confidential local datasets . Instead of uploading local data, federated learning aggregates on-device knowledge by iteratively updating local model parameters at the server. While successful, federated learning cannot determine the specialized pruned model for participating devices without training data. To address this issue,  proposed to decouple the pruning process under federated environments, where a large-size model is first pruned on the server and then fine-tuned on devices.\nHowever, since most pruning algorithms require a guide from the data distribution, without access to device-side training data, the server-side pruning leads to significant bias in the pruned subnetwork, especially under heterogeneous (non-iid) local data distributions.\nTo mitigate such bias issues, recent research pushes pruning operations to devices  0 1 2 3. As shown in Fig. 1 left, either a full-size model or a coarse-pruned model will be finer-pruned based on the updated importance scores from devices. The importance scores for all parameters need to store in memory, which is infeasible for resource-constrained devices with limited memory budgets. Moreover, without any interaction with the device side, the initial model through server-side coarse pruning still suffers from the bias issue, requiring extra efforts in later finer pruning to find the optimal subnetwork. Such negative impact becomes more challenging when pruning towards an extremely tiny subnetwork, as the biased initial subnetwork can deviate significantly from the optimal structure, resulting in poor accuracy 4. To address the above challenges, in this paper, we develop a novel distributed pruning framework for federated learning named FedTiny. Depending on the deployment scenarios, i.e., participating hardware platforms, and training tasks, FedTiny can obtain specialized tiny models using distributed and confidential datasets on participating devices. Besides, FedTiny allows devices with tight memory and computational budgets to participate in the resource-intensive pruning process by reconfiguring interactions between the server and devices. As shown in Fig. 1 right, FedTiny introduces two key modules: the adaptive batch normalization (BN) selection module and the progressive pruning module.\nTo avoid the negative impact of biased initial pruning, we introduce the adaptive BN module to identify a specialized coarse-pruned model by indirectly pruning at devices, where devices only evaluate the server-side pruning. It should be mentioned that evaluating a pruned model is much cheaper than training and pruning. The local evaluation is feedback to the server through batch normalization parameters. Since batch normalization layers can effectively measure local data distribution with very few parameters 5, this module guides the initial pruning with little computation and communication cost. Besides, contrary to prior research using importance scores of all parameters in a full-size model for finer pruning, the progressive pruning module is developed to iteratively adjust the model structure with sparse and cheap local computation. Inspired by RigL 4, devices only rate partial model parameters (e.g., a single layer) at a time, where the top-K importance scores are stored locally and uploaded to the server, significantly reducing memory, computation, and communication cost. To demonstrate the effectiveness of FedTiny, we evaluate FedTiny on ResNet18 6 and VGG11 7 with four image classification datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CINIC-10, and SVHN). Extensive experimental results suggest that FedTiny achieves much higher accuracy with a lower level of memory and computational cost than state-of-the-art baseline approaches. Especially in a low-density regime 8 from 10−2superscript10210^{-2} to 10−3superscript10310^{-3}, FedTiny gets a slight loss of accuracy, while other baselines suffer from the sharp drop in accuracy. Moreover, FedTiny achieves top-one accuracy of 85.23%percent85.2385.23\\% with the 0.014×0.014\\times FLOPs and 0.03×0.03\\times memory footprint of ResNet18 6, which outperforms the best baseline, which gets 82.62%percent82.6282.62\\% accuracy with 0.34×0.34\\times FLOPs and 0.51×0.51\\times memory footprint.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: platforms and training tasks (defined as deployment scenarios).\nTo achieve better accuracy, most pruning approaches rely heavily on training data to trade off model size, efficiency, and accuracy  [ref]3 [ref]4  , which, unfortunately, becomes ineffective when dealing with confidential training datasets distributed over resource-constrained devices.
