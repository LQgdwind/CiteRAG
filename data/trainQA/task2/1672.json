      "content": "Paper Title: SUM: A Benchmark Dataset of Semantic Urban Meshes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo the best of our knowledge, none of the state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks of 3D semantic segmentation can directly be used on large-scale texture meshes.\nAdditionally, although the data structures of point clouds and meshes are different, the inherent properties of geometry in the 3D space of the urban environment are nearly identical.\nIn other words, they can share the feature vectors within the same scenes.\nConsequently, we sample the mesh into coloured point clouds (see Figure 13) with a density of about 10 p​t​s/m2𝑝𝑡𝑠superscript𝑚2pts/m^{2} as input for the competing deep learning methods.\nIn particular, we use Montecarlo sampling  to generate randomly uniform dense samples, and we further prune these samples according to Poisson distributions [ref]51 and assign the colour via searching the nearest neighbour from the textures. To evaluate and compare with the current state-of-the-art 3D deep learning methods that can be applied to a large-scale urban dataset, we select five representative approaches (i.e., PointNet [ref]14, PointNet++ , SPG , KPConv , and RandLA-Net ).\nWe perform all the experiments on an NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX 1080Ti GPU.\nNote that these deep learning-based methods downsample the input point clouds significantly as a pre-processing step.\nIn our experiments, the point sampling density is limited by the GPU memory, and increasing or decreasing the sampling density within a reasonable range may lead to slightly different performance.\n\nIt should be noted that no matter how dense the input point clouds are, almost all state-of-the-art deep learning architectures (such as PointNet, PointNet++, RandLaNet, KPConv, and SPG, etc.) downsample the input point clouds significantly, and they are still able to learn effective features for classification.\nBesides, different deep learning-based point cloud classification frameworks exploit different strategies for downsampling the input points.\n\nIn addition, we also compare with the joint RF-MRF , which is the only competition method that directly takes the mesh as input and without using GPU for computation. The hyper-parameters of all the competing methods are tuned according to the validation data to achieve the best results we could acquire.\nBesides, the results of each competitive method (see Table 6) are demonstrated in average performance based on ten times experiments with the same setting.\nFrom the comparison results, as shown in Table 6, we found that our baseline method outperforms other methods except for KPConv.\nSpecifically, our approach outperforms RF-MRF with a margin of 5.3%percent5.35.3\\% mIoU, and deep learning methods (not including KPConv) from 16.7%percent16.716.7\\% to 29.3%percent29.329.3\\% mIoU.\nCompared with the KPConv, the performance of our method is much more robust, which can be observed from Table 6 that the standard deviation of our method is close to zero (i.e., the standard deviation of mIoU of our method is about 0.024%percent0.0240.024\\%).\nThe reason is that in our method, we set 100 trees in the random forest to ensure the stability of the model, but in KPConv, the kernel point initialization strategy may not be able to select some parts of the point cloud, which leads to the instability of the results.\nFurthermore, compared with all deep learning pipelines, our method is conducted on a CPU and uses much less time for training (including feature computation).\nThis can be explained by the fact that we have fewer input data (triangles versus points), and the time complexity of our handcrafted features computation is much lower than the features learned from deep learning. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerrain\n\n\nHigh Vegetation\n\nBuilding\nWater\nVehicle\nBoat\nmIoU\nOA\nmAcc\nmF1\ntt​r​a​i​nsubscript𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛t_{train}\n\n\n\nPointNet [ref]14\n56.3\n\n\n14.9\n\n66.7\n83.8\n0.0\n0.0\n36.9 ± 2.3\n71.4 ± 2.1\n46.1 ± 2.6\n44.6 ± 3.2\n1.8\n\nRandLaNet \n38.9\n\n\n59.6\n\n81.5\n27.7\n22.0\n2.1\n38.6 ± 4.6\n74.9 ± 3.2\n53.3 ± 5.1\n49.9 ± 4.8\n10.8\n\nSPG \n56.4\n\n\n61.8\n\n87.4\n36.5\n34.4\n6.2\n47.1 ± 2.4\n79.0 ± 2.8\n64.8 ± 1.2\n59.6 ± 1.9\n17.8\n\nPointNet++ \n68.0\n\n\n73.1\n\n84.2\n69.9\n0.5\n1.6\n49.5 ± 2.1\n85.5 ± 0.9\n57.8 ± 1.8\n57.1 ± 1.7\n2.8\n\nRF-MRF \n77.4\n\n\n87.5\n\n91.3\n83.7\n23.8\n1.7\n60.9 ± 0.0\n91.2 ± 0.0\n65.9 ± 0.0\n68.1 ± 0.0\n1.1\n\nKPConv \n86.5\n\n\n88.4\n\n92.7\n77.7\n54.3\n13.3\n68.8 ± 5.7\n93.3 ± 1.5\n73.7 ± 5.4\n76.7 ± 5.8\n23.5\n\nBaseline\n83.3\n\n\n90.5\n\n92.5\n86.0\n37.3\n7.4\n66.2 ± 0.0\n93.0 ± 0.0\n70.6 ± 0.0\n73.8 ± 0.0\n1.2\n\nReference markers found: [51]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]51: for the competing deep learning methods.\nIn particular, we use Montecarlo sampling  to generate randomly uniform dense samples, and we further prune these samples according to Poisson distributions [ref]51 and assign the colour via searching the nearest neighbour from the textures.
