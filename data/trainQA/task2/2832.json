      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Algorithmic Reasoners are Implicit Planners\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe will now present the context of our work, by gradually surveying the key developments which bring VI into the implicit planning domain and introducing the building blocks of our XLVIN agent. Planning has been studied under the umbrella of model-based RL   . However, having a good model of the environment’s dynamics is essential before being able to construct a good plan. We are instead interested in leveraging the progress of model-free RL   by enabling planning through inductive biases in the policy network—a direction known as implicit planning. The planner could also be trained to optimise a supervised imitation learning objective  [ref]2. This is performed by UPNs  in a goal-conditioned setting. Our differentiable executors are instead applicable across a wide variety of domains where goals are not known upfront. Diff-MPC [ref]2 leverages an algorithm in an explicit manner. However, explicit use of the algorithm often has issues of requiring a bespoke backpropagation rule, and the associated low-dimensional bottlenecks. Throughout this section we pay special attention to implicit planners based on VI, and distinguish two categories of previously proposed planners: models which assume fixed and known environment dynamics [ref]40   and models which derive scalars to be used for VI-style updates  . Value iteration (VI) is a successive approximation method for finding the optimal value function of a discounted Markov decision process (MDPs) as the fixed-point of the so-called Bellman optimality operator . A discounted MDP is a tuple (𝒮,𝒜,R,P,γ)𝒮𝒜𝑅𝑃𝛾({\\cal S},{\\cal A},R,P,\\gamma) where s∈𝒮𝑠𝒮s\\in{\\cal S} are states, a∈𝒜𝑎𝒜a\\in{\\cal A} are actions, R:𝒮×𝒜→ℝ:𝑅→𝒮𝒜ℝR:{\\cal S}\\times{\\cal A}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} is a reward function, P:𝒮×𝒜→Dist​(𝒮):𝑃→𝒮𝒜Dist𝒮P:{\\cal S}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\text{Dist}(\\mathcal{S}) is a transition function such that P​(s′|s,a)𝑃conditionalsuperscript𝑠′𝑠𝑎P(s^{\\prime}|s,a) is the conditional probability of transitioning to state s′superscript𝑠′s^{\\prime} when the agent executes action a𝑎a in state s𝑠s, and γ∈ [ref]1𝛾01\\gamma\\in [ref]1 is a discount factor which trades off between the relevance of immediate and future rewards. In the infinite horizon discounted setting, an agent sequentially chooses actions according to a stationary Markov policy π:𝒮×𝒜→ [ref]1:𝜋→𝒮𝒜01\\pi:{\\cal S}\\times{\\cal A}\\rightarrow [ref]1 such that π​(a|s)𝜋conditional𝑎𝑠\\pi(a|s) is a conditional probability distribution over actions given a state. The return is defined as Gt=∑k=0∞γk​R​(at+k,st+k)subscript𝐺𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑘0superscript𝛾𝑘𝑅subscript𝑎𝑡𝑘subscript𝑠𝑡𝑘G_{t}=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\gamma^{k}R(a_{t+k},s_{t+k}).

In the infinite horizon discounted setting, we know that there exists an optimal stationary Markov policy π∗superscript𝜋\\pi^{*} such that for any policy π𝜋\\pi it holds that Vπ∗​(s)≥Vπ​(s)superscript𝑉superscript𝜋𝑠superscript𝑉𝜋𝑠V^{\\pi^{*}}(s)\\geq V^{\\pi}(s) for all s∈𝒮𝑠𝒮s\\in{\\cal S}. Furthermore, such optimal policy can be deterministic – greedy – with respect to the optimal values. Therefore, to find a π∗superscript𝜋\\pi^{*} it suffices to find the unique optimal value function V⋆superscript𝑉⋆V^{\\star} as the fixed-point of the Bellman optimality operator. The optimal value function V⋆superscript𝑉⋆V^{\\star} is such a fixed-point and satisfies the Bellman optimality equations : V⋆​(s)=maxa∈𝒜⁡(R​(s,a)+γ​∑s′∈𝒮P​(s′|s,a)​V⋆​(s′))superscript𝑉⋆𝑠subscript𝑎𝒜𝑅𝑠𝑎𝛾subscriptsuperscript𝑠′𝒮𝑃conditionalsuperscript𝑠′𝑠𝑎superscript𝑉⋆superscript𝑠′V^{\\star}(s)=\\max_{a\\in\\mathcal{A}}\\left(R(s,a)+\\gamma\\sum_{s^{\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{S}}P(s^{\\prime}|s,a)V^{\\star}(s^{\\prime})\\right). Accordingly, VI randomly initialises a value function V0​(s)subscript𝑉0𝑠V_{0}(s), and then iteratively updates it as follows: VI is thus a powerful technique for optimal control in RL tasks, but its applicability hinges on knowing the MDP parameters (especially P𝑃P and R𝑅R) upfront—which is unfortunately not the case in most environments of interest. To make VI more broadly applicable, we need to leverage function approximators (such as neural networks) and representation learning to estimate such parameters. Value iteration is message passing   Progress towards broader applicability started by lifting the requirement of knowing R𝑅R. Several implicit planners, including (G)VIN [ref]40  and GPPN , were proposed for discrete environments where P𝑃P is fixed and known. Observing the VI update rule (Equation 1), we may conclude that it derives values by considering features of neighbouring states; i.e. the value V​(s)𝑉𝑠V(s) is updated based on states s′superscript𝑠′s^{\\prime} for which P​(s′|s,a)>0𝑃conditionalsuperscript𝑠′𝑠𝑎0P(s^{\\prime}|s,a)>0 for some a𝑎a. Accordingly, it tightly aligns with message passing over the graph corresponding to the MDP, and hence a graph neural network (GNN)  over the MDP graph may be used to estimate the value function. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been intensively studied as a tool to process graph-structured inputs, and were successfully applied to various RL tasks   [ref]1. For each state s𝑠s in the graph, a set of messages is computed—one message for each neighbouring node s′superscript𝑠′s^{\\prime}, derived by applying a message function M𝑀M to the relevant node (h→s,h→s′)subscript→ℎ𝑠subscript→ℎsuperscript𝑠′(\\vec{h}_{s},\\vec{h}_{s^{\\prime}}) and edge (e→s′→s)subscript→𝑒→superscript𝑠′𝑠(\\vec{e}_{s^{\\prime}\\rightarrow s}) features. Incoming messages in a neighbourhood 𝒩​(s)𝒩𝑠\\mathcal{N}(s) are then aggregated through a permutation-invariant operator ⨁direct-sum\\bigoplus (such as sum or max), obtaining a summarised message m→ssubscript→𝑚𝑠\\vec{m}_{s}: The features of state s𝑠s are then updated through a function U𝑈U applied to these summarised messages: GNNs can then emulate VI computations by setting the neighbourhoods according to the transitions in P𝑃P; that is, 𝒩​(s)={s′∣∃a∈𝒜.P​(s′|s,a)>0}𝒩𝑠conditional-setsuperscript𝑠′formulae-sequence𝑎𝒜𝑃conditionalsuperscript𝑠′𝑠𝑎0\\mathcal{N}(s)=\\{s^{\\prime}\\mid\\exists a\\in\\mathcal{A}.\\ P(s^{\\prime}|s,a)>0\\}. For the special case of grid worlds, the neighbours of a grid cell correspond to exactly its neighbouring cells, and hence the rules in Equations 2–3 amount to a convolutional neural network over the grid [ref]40. While the above blueprint yielded many popular implicit planners, the requirement of knowing upfront the transition neighbourhoods is still limiting. Ideally, we would like to be able to, on-the-fly, generate states s′superscript𝑠′s^{\\prime} that are reachable from s𝑠s as a result of applying some action. Generating neighbouring state representations corresponds to a learned transition model, and we present one such method, which we employed within XLVIN, next. TransE    The TransE  loss for embedding objects and relations can be adapted to RL  . State embeddings are obtained by an encoder z:𝒮→ℝk:𝑧→𝒮superscriptℝ𝑘z:{\\cal S}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{k} and the effect of an action in a given state is modelled by a translation model T:ℝk×𝒜→ℝk:𝑇→superscriptℝ𝑘𝒜superscriptℝ𝑘T:\\mathbb{R}^{k}\\times{\\cal A}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{k}. Specifically, T​(z​(s),a)𝑇𝑧𝑠𝑎T(z(s),a) is a translation vector to be added to z​(s)𝑧𝑠z(s) in order to obtain an embedding of the resulting state when taking action a𝑎a in state s𝑠s. This embedding should be as close as possible to z​(s′)𝑧superscript𝑠′z(s^{\\prime}), for the observed transition (s,a,s′)𝑠𝑎superscript𝑠′(s,a,s^{\\prime}), and also far away from negatively sampled state embeddings z​(s~)𝑧~𝑠z(\\tilde{s}). Therefore, the embedding function is optimised using the following variant of the triplet loss (with hinge hyperparameter ξ𝜉\\xi): Having a trained T𝑇T function, it is now possible to dynamically construct 𝒩​(s)𝒩𝑠\\mathcal{N}(s). For every action a𝑎a, applying T​(h→s,a)𝑇subscript→ℎ𝑠𝑎T(\\vec{h}_{s},a) yields embeddings h→s,asubscript→ℎ𝑠𝑎\\vec{h}_{s,a} which correspond to one neighbour state embedding in 𝒩​(s)𝒩𝑠\\mathcal{N}(s). We can, of course, roll out T𝑇T further from h→s,asubscript→ℎ𝑠𝑎\\vec{h}_{s,a} to simulate longer trajectory outcomes—the amount of steps we do this for is denoted as the “thinking time”, K𝐾K, of the planner. With neighbourhoods constructed, one final question remains: how to apply VI over them, especially given that the embeddings h→ssubscript→ℎ𝑠\\vec{h}_{s} are high-dimensional, and VI is defined over scalar reward/value inputs? If we also train a reward model, R​(h→s,a)𝑅subscript→ℎ𝑠𝑎R(\\vec{h}_{s},a), and a state-value function, V​(h→s)𝑉subscript→ℎ𝑠V(\\vec{h}_{s}) from state embeddings, we can attach scalar values and rewards to our synthesised graph. Then, VI can be directly applied over the constructed tree to yield the final policy. As the VI update (Equation 1) is differentiable, it composes nicely with neural estimators and standard RL loss functions. Further, R𝑅R and V𝑉V can be directly trained from observed rewards and returns when interacting with the environment. This approach inspired a family of powerful implicit planners, including VPN , TreeQN and ATreeC . However, it remains vulnerable to a specific bottleneck effect, which we discuss next. Algorithmic bottleneck   Through our efforts of learning transition and reward models, we reduced our (potentially highly complex) input state s𝑠s into an abstractified graph with scalar values in its nodes and edges, so that VI can be directly applied. However, VI’s performance guarantees rely on having the exactly correct parameters of the underlying MDP. If there are any errors in the predictions of these scalars, they may propagate to the VI operations and yield suboptimal policies. We will study this effect in detail on synthetic environments in Section 4.3. As the ATreeC-style approaches commit to using the scalar produced by their reward models, there is no way to recover from a poorly predicted value. This leaves the model vulnerable to an algorithmic bottleneck, especially early on during training when insufficient experience has been gathered to properly estimate R𝑅R. Accordingly, the agent may struggle with data efficiency. With our XLVIN agent, we set out to break this bottleneck, and do not project our state embeddings h→ssubscript→ℎ𝑠\\vec{h}_{s} further to a low-dimensional space. This amounts to running a graph neural network directly over them. Given that these same embeddings are optimised to produce plausible graphs (via the TransE loss), how can we ensure that our GNN will stay aligned with VI computations? Algorithmic reasoning   An important research direction explores the use of neural networks for learning to execute algorithms  —which was recently extended to algorithms on graph-structured data . In particular,  establishes algorithmic alignment between GNNs and dynamic programming algorithms. Furthermore,  show that supervising the GNN on the algorithm’s intermediate results is highly beneficial for out-of-distribution generalization. As VI is, in fact, a dynamic programming algorithm, a GNN executor is a suitable choice for learning it, and good results on executing VI emerged on synthetic graphs —an observation we strongly leverage here.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: by enabling planning through inductive biases in the policy network—a direction known as implicit planning.
