      "content": "Paper Title: Transversal non-Clifford gates for quantum LDPC codes on sheaves\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur construction is inspired by various observations and previous works.\nThe first observation is that the triorthogonal code introduced in \nheavily relies on the trilinear function\nf​(α1,α2,α3)=∑i=1n(α1)i​(α2)i​(α3)i𝑓subscript𝛼1subscript𝛼2subscript𝛼3superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛subscriptsubscript𝛼1𝑖subscriptsubscript𝛼2𝑖subscriptsubscript𝛼3𝑖f(\\alpha_{1},\\alpha_{2},\\alpha_{3})=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\\alpha_{1})_{i}(\\alpha_{2})_{i}(\\alpha_{3})_{i},\nwhere α1,α2,α3subscript𝛼1subscript𝛼2subscript𝛼3\\alpha_{1},\\alpha_{2},\\alpha_{3} are vectors in 𝔽2nsuperscriptsubscript𝔽2𝑛\\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}.\nThis suggests that a degree 333 function is necessary to access the non-Clifford gates at the third level of the Clifford hierarchy.\nThis also raises the possibility that other degree 333 functions,\nsuch as more general trilinear functions,\nmay be sufficient to capture the non-Clifford features.\nThis idea is formalized into the CCZ formalism discussed in Section 3.\nIn particular,\nall we need is a trilinear function f𝑓f defined on the cohomology classes,\nwhich we mean by the condition for any ζisubscript𝜁𝑖\\zeta_{i} in the cocycle (corresponding to the logical operators)\nand any βisubscript𝛽𝑖\\beta_{i} in the coboundary (corresponding to the stabilizers).\nThis modification provides more flexibility to the construction of codes with transversal non-Clifford gates. The second observation is that many known codes with non-Clifford operations\ncan be linked to the triple intersection number of\ntheir corresponding topological spaces.\nFor example,\nthe [  ]delimited-[]832[  ] code 0\nand 3D toric codes support transversal CCZ gates [ref]12.\nThis is related to the fact that the 3D torus\nhas three homology clases H2​(𝕋3,ℤ/2​ℤ)=(ℤ/2​ℤ)3subscript𝐻2superscript𝕋3ℤ2ℤsuperscriptℤ2ℤ3H_{2}(\\mathbb{T}^{3},\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})=(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^{3}\nwith a nontrivial triple intersection.\nFurthermore,\nthe topological nature of the triple intersection number\nimplies that it is defined on the homology classes.\nThis observation suggests an approach to study quantum code with a topological nature\nand define f𝑓f as the triple intersection.\nThis strategy has also been observed recently\nand applied to 3D manifolds in . This brings us to the final observation that the good qLDPC codes\nin the recent breakthrough [ref]18  0\ndo have a topological interpretation,\nincluding their higher dimensional analogue 2.\nThis topological perspective is inspired by a series of work on geometrically local codes\n1 2 3 4\nwhich implicitly uses the topological nature of the qLDPC codes.\nFor qLDPC codes constructed from 3D cubical complexes,\nthe X logical operators can be interpreted as surface configurations\non the cubical complex.\nThis geometric interpretation allows us to define the triple intersection number,\nwhich leads to the transversal CCZ gates on these codes.\nTogether, these observations provide the foundation for our main result regarding the cup product on chain complexes induced from sheaves.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: operations\ncan be linked to the triple intersection number of\ntheir corresponding topological spaces.\nFor example,\nthe [  ]delimited-[]832[  ] code 0\nand 3D toric codes support transversal CCZ gates [ref]12.\nThis is related to the fact that the 3D torus\nhas three homology clases\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
