      "content": "Paper Title: FashionVQA: A Domain-Specific Visual Question Answering System\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisual feature learning in VQA:\nThe visual feature vector is often extracted from the input image using a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as the visual encoder, e.g., VGG , ResNet , or ResNext  models. In the early VQA frameworks, grid-based visual features extracted by ImageNet-pretrained  VGG or ResNet models were widely adopted. Since , region-based visual features extracted using Faster R-CNN -based object detection model, especially fine-tuned on Visual Genome  dataset, have been dominant [ref]9. In , the authors propose extracting the grid features from the same layer as the pretrained detector, achieving comparable performance as the region-based features with higher efficiency. We benchmark these two types of visual feature extraction methods on our dataset across different VQA models. Cross-modality fusion models:\nCross-modality fusion model is a core component of the VQA framework. It aligns the features from the visual and language modalities. Initially-proposed VQA models identify the high-level cross-modal interactions by Bilinear Fusion . MCB , MLB  and MUTAN  are later introduced to achieve better fusion performance at much lower computational cost and parameters. Motivated by the remarkable performance of the attention mechanism in language and vision models , the attention module becomes the fundamental block in designing the cross-modality fusion models. DFAF [ref]9 uses self-attention and co-attention modules to learn the inter-and intra-connections between the two modalities. MCAN  builds the model with the blocks of self-attention and guided attention. LXMERT , VilBERT 0 adopt a similar strategy and build a two-stream co-attention-based model. VisualBERT 1, UNITER 2, OSCAR , OSCAR+ 3 learn the alignment between image and language by pretraining on multiple image caption datasets with BERT-style  visual language models (VLMs). Fashion datasets:\nIn recent year, many valuable fashion datasets 456789 01234 have greatly contributed to clothing item recognition and apparel attribute understanding. However, most of them suffer from some limitations when considered for training versatile VQA models. In 3642, only primary categories in the dataset are labeled. Additional garment parts and attributes are annotated in 957. Segmentation masks over each piece of garment are drawn for the semantic segmentation task in 6350. Generally, the localization of the garment pieces and parts in these types of datasets takes considerable human annotation labor, and few of the datasets are suitable for conversion to a new dataset for vision language tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: models were widely adopted. Since , region-based visual features extracted using Faster R-CNN -based object detection model, especially fine-tuned on Visual Genome  dataset, have been dominant [ref]9.

We\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
