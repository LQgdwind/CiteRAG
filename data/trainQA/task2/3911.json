      "content": "Paper Title: A Computational Framework of Cortical Microcircuits Approximates Sign-concordant Random Backpropagation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs in Figure 3 (a), the gray colored neuron represents a nonspecified neuron from the Pyr neuron’s previous layer. Computationally, a Pyr neuron that receives inputs from its previous layer, needs to propagate its error information backwards. Yet the spike-based backward PSCs a​(t)=ab​(t)+e​(t)𝑎𝑡subscript𝑎𝑏𝑡𝑒𝑡a(t)=a_{b}(t)+e(t) has a large base PSC current ab​(t)subscript𝑎𝑏𝑡a_{b}(t). Following previous work , we also introduce an additional inhibitory cell to cancel out ab​(t)subscript𝑎𝑏𝑡a_{b}(t). As observed in NE.7: there exists assembly competition mechanism , which drives SOM to follow the most active Pyr , we design our excitatory backward microcircuit with one additional SOM neuron, which receives a one-on-one input from its paired Pyr neuron, and synapse onto the apical dendrites (following NE.5 and NE.6) of neurons in the previous layer. In other words, every neuron, no matter Pyr or PV, that synapses onto a Pyr neuron’s basal dendrites receives two connections synapse back onto its apical dendrites. One from the Pyr neuron, the other from the paired SOM neuron (IS.5). Name the Pyr backward weights in layer (l+1)𝑙1(l+1) as 𝐖Pyr←(l+1)superscriptsubscript𝐖←Pyr𝑙1\\boldsymbol{\\rm W}_{\\overleftarrow{\\rm Pyr}}^{(l+1)}, and the Pyr backward PSCs as 𝒂+←(l+1)superscriptsubscript𝒂←𝑙1\\boldsymbol{a}_{\\overleftarrow{+}}^{(l+1)}, The pyramidal cells’ backward currents are simply formulated as 𝐖Pyr←(l+1)​𝒂+←(l+1)superscriptsubscript𝐖←Pyr𝑙1superscriptsubscript𝒂←𝑙1\\boldsymbol{\\rm W}_{\\overleftarrow{\\rm Pyr}}^{(l+1)}\\boldsymbol{a}_{\\overleftarrow{+}}^{(l+1)}.\nName the backward weights matrix of SOM cells in layer (l+1)𝑙1(l+1) as 𝐖SOM←(l+1)superscriptsubscript𝐖←SOM𝑙1\\boldsymbol{\\rm W}_{\\overleftarrow{\\rm SOM}}^{(l+1)}, which shares the same shape with 𝐖Pyr←(l+1)superscriptsubscript𝐖←Pyr𝑙1\\boldsymbol{\\rm W}_{\\overleftarrow{\\rm Pyr}}^{(l+1)}. For excitatory (+) backward path, the top down current is: Ideally, only the pure error signal 𝒆+subscript𝒆\\boldsymbol{e}_{+} is propagated backwards, and 𝐖Pyr←⋅𝒂b+⋅subscript𝐖←Pyrsubscript𝒂limit-from𝑏\\boldsymbol{\\rm W}_{\\overleftarrow{\\rm Pyr}}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{a}_{b+} is canceled out by 𝐖SOM←⋅(−𝒂b+)⋅subscript𝐖←SOMsubscript𝒂limit-from𝑏\\boldsymbol{\\rm W}_{\\overleftarrow{\\rm SOM}}\\cdot(-\\boldsymbol{a}_{b+}), which implies 𝐖Pyr←=𝐖SOM←:=𝑩+subscript𝐖←Pyrsubscript𝐖←SOMassignsubscript𝑩\\boldsymbol{\\rm W}_{\\overleftarrow{\\rm Pyr}}=\\boldsymbol{\\rm W}_{\\overleftarrow{\\rm SOM}}:=\\boldsymbol{B}_{+}. This alignment is guaranteed by the anti-Hebbian learning, which we will discuss in Section 4. The only hypothesis we make is that the sole connection needs to be strong enough (greater than SOM cells’ threshold) so that each excitatory spike fired by Pyr cells can induce an inhibitory SOM spike. Fortunately, NE.8: SOM is well-known for its low threshold, and the ability to fire temporal accurate inhibitory spikes[ref]42. Our SOM neuron model differs from the previous work: We present a SOM model with single compartment (respecting NE.3), while Sacramento et al. model a SOM cell with double compartments (the additional one is used to store a \"nudging signal\" from its paired Pyr neuron). Therefore, we adjust synapses that connect to SOM cells error-freely. The error-free assembly competition mechanism is realized through Hebbian learning, which can be informally described as: \"Cells that fire together, wire together\" . Yet cells that wires together also tend to fire together more often. Due to the existence of such a positive feedback loop, one needs to introduce additional tricks to stabilize the learning process - such as weights normalization , or weights clamping [ref]51 . Here, we find that with a proper normalization, the one-on-one connectivity can be formed easily. Figure 3 (b) exhibits our simulation goal. Name the synaptic weights from Pyr cell to SOM cell within the same layer (l)𝑙(l) as 𝐖PyS(l)superscriptsubscript𝐖PyS𝑙\\boldsymbol{\\rm W}_{\\rm PyS}^{(l)}. We visualized 𝐖PyS(l)superscriptsubscript𝐖PyS𝑙\\boldsymbol{\\rm W}_{\\rm PyS}^{(l)} in Figure 3 (c): The weight matrix gradually forms one-on-one connectivity pattern from pure random initiation.\nThe Hebbian rule we applied here is simple. We stimulate Pyr cells randomly, and records the firing behavior of SOM cells. The synaptic weights of cells that fires together are strengthened, otherwise weakened. The normalization we apply is to keep the summation along both rows and columns of 𝐖PyS(l)superscriptsubscript𝐖PyS𝑙\\boldsymbol{\\rm W}_{\\rm PyS}^{(l)} as a constant. Consider the total area of SOM cell’s dendrites are limited, forming more synaptic connections with a Pyr cell requires weaken other Pyr cells’ connections. Similarly, if a Pyr cell wish to form more axon connections to a SOM cell, a price of weakening other axon connections are paid. As demonstrated in the last sub-figure of Figure 3 (c), each SOM cell successfully find their paired Pyr cell to follow with.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: each excitatory spike fired by Pyr cells can induce an inhibitory SOM spike.
