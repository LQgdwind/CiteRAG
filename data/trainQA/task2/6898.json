      "content": "Paper Title: Fine-Tuning Llama 2 Large Language Models for Detecting Online Sexual Predatory Chats and Abusive Texts\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this study, we use the pretrained Llama 2 7B-parameter model and apply a fine-tuning approach to it for text classification problems. This model along with other Llama 2 variants were built based on an auto-regressive transformer [ref]17. The model architecture and pretraining process involve the use of the RMSNorm pre-normalization [ref]18, the SwiGLU activation function [ref]19, and the rotary positional embeddings . The LLaMA tokenizer uses the bytepair encoding algorithm  with the implementation from SentencePiece . The resulting Llama vocabulary has a size of 32k tokens . The proposed fine-tuning approach\nis depicted in Fig. 2. The original weights of the Llama 2 7B-parameter model are converted to the Hugging Face transformer format to take advantage of the Hugging Face fine-tuning tools. The converted model is encapsulated within the PEFT-LoRA framework, which implements the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method  based on the Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) library . LoRA is among many PEFT methods, including prefix-tuning , prompt-tuning , Compacter , Infused Adapter by Inhibiting and Amplifying Inner Activations - (IA)3 , BitFit , SparseAdapter , LLaMA-Adapter , AdaLoRA , and so on, which are able to deal with the problem of fine-tuning LLMs  . The LoRA approach was inspired by the structure-aware intrinsic dimension method  and introduces a different way to execute low-rank fine-tuning. In LoRA, the parameter update for a pretrained weight matrix W0∈ℝd×ksubscript𝑊0superscriptℝ𝑑𝑘W_{0}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times k} is specified by a product of two low-rank matrices WAsubscript𝑊𝐴W_{A} and WBsubscript𝑊𝐵W_{B}: where WA∈ℝd×rsubscript𝑊𝐴superscriptℝ𝑑𝑟W_{A}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times r} and WB∈ℝr×ksubscript𝑊𝐵superscriptℝ𝑟𝑘W_{B}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{r\\times k} are matrices of trainable parameters, and the rank r≪min⁡(d,k)much-less-than𝑟𝑑𝑘r\\ll\\min(d,k) . The pretrained model parameters W0subscript𝑊0W_{0} are frozen during training and do not receive gradient updates. Both W0subscript𝑊0W_{0} and δ​W=WA​WB𝛿𝑊subscript𝑊𝐴subscript𝑊𝐵\\delta W=W_{A}W_{B} are multiplied with the same input ; hence, the forward pass for h=W0​xℎsubscript𝑊0𝑥h=W_{0}x is altered as: The matrix WAsubscript𝑊𝐴W_{A} is initially set to zero whilst the matrix WBsubscript𝑊𝐵W_{B} is started with a random Gaussian initialization. Therefore, δ​W=WA​WB𝛿𝑊subscript𝑊𝐴subscript𝑊𝐵\\delta W=W_{A}W_{B} is zero when the fine-tuning process begins. During training, δ​W​x𝛿𝑊𝑥\\delta Wx is scaled by αr𝛼𝑟\\frac{\\alpha}{r} where α𝛼\\alpha is a constant in r𝑟r . After training, the trainable parameters can be combined with the original weight matrix W0subscript𝑊0W_{0} by adding the matrix WA​WBsubscript𝑊𝐴subscript𝑊𝐵W_{A}W_{B} to W0subscript𝑊0W_{0}. This approach allows the trainable matrices WAsubscript𝑊𝐴W_{A} and WBsubscript𝑊𝐵W_{B} to be trained to adapt to the new data while reducing the overall number of updates. As gradients for most of the original pretrained weights do not need to be computed, the GPU memory requirement is reduced significantly, leading to a fast and efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Our fine-tuning approach as presented in Fig. 2 uses a cross-entropy loss function between neural network’s output logits x𝑥x and target y𝑦y, averaged over the mini-batch size N𝑁N: where w𝑤w is a weight vector with each element assigned to each of the classes, and lnsubscript𝑙𝑛l_{n} is specified as: with the logits x𝑥x consisting of the unnormalized logits for each class, the target y𝑦y containing class indices, and C𝐶C being the number of classes. In Fig. 2, the outputs of the trainable PEFT model correspond to the logits x𝑥x whilst the labels correspond to the target y𝑦y.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: Llama 2 7B-parameter model and apply a fine-tuning approach to it for text classification problems.
