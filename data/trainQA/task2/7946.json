      "content": "Paper Title: MVGT: A Multi-view Graph Transformer Based on Spatial Relations for EEG Emotion Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEEG signals are inherently noisy and susceptible to channel crosstalk . Due to the complexity of EEG signals, it is challenging to isolate clean and independent signals. Therefore, it is crucial to select what form of data to analyze under conditions of high noise. Effective features of EEG signals can reduce noise and facilitate the recognition of cognitive patterns in specific tasks. Experimental evidence suggests that frequency domain features are often associated with behavioral patterns , hence they are commonly used in EEG analysis. Along with the development of deep learning, increasingly complex models with rich expressive abilities have emerged and have been extensively utilized in EEG signal analysis. Zheng et al.  employed deep belief networks to analyze important frequency domain components and effective channels based on the learned parameters. Song et al. [ref]12 used a GCN method based on Chebyshev polynomials [ref]24 to dynamically learn the representations of EEG signals. Zhong et al.  innovatively incorporated the asymmetric information of the hemispheres as prior knowledge into the adjacency matrix in 3D space.\nThe reasonable combination of the multi-domain information contributes to improving the accuracy in the emotion recognition task. Li et al. [ref]14 proposed an adaptive GCN that integrates the temporal domain, frequency domain, and functional connectivity. Ding et al. , inspired by neuroscience research, combined intra-region convolution and inter-region convolution based on brain lobe regions to learn cognitive patterns. Jiang et al.  utilized the advantages of GCN in the spatial domain and Transformer in the temporal domain to improve the accuracy of emotion classification.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: utilized in EEG signal analysis.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
