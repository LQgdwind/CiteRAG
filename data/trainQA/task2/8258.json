      "content": "Paper Title: Unraveling Movie Genres through Cross-Attention Fusion of Bi-Modal Synergy of Poster\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur proposed architecture begins by inputting a poster image, which undergoes an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text. Subsequently, both visual and textual features are extracted to undergo cross-modal understanding, followed by processing through a feed-forward neural network.\nThe workflow of our solution architecture is pictorially shown in Fig. 2, which we now present in detail. Encoding Movie Posters:\nOur proposed framework involves the analysis of a movie poster image ℐisubscriptℐ𝑖{\\cal{I}}_{i}.\nThe movie poster ℐisubscriptℐ𝑖{\\cal{I}}_{i} is processed through Gemini-Pro-Vision [ref]24-based OCR to extract text 𝒯i=(ti​1,ti​2,…,ti​a)subscript𝒯𝑖subscript𝑡𝑖1subscript𝑡𝑖2…subscript𝑡𝑖𝑎{\\cal{T}}_{i}=\\left(t_{i1},t_{i2},\\ldots,t_{ia}\\right) which is tokenized into sub-word units, where a𝑎a is the number of tokens in the text 𝒯isubscript𝒯𝑖{\\cal{T}}_{i}.\nFor visual details, movie poster ℐisubscriptℐ𝑖{\\cal{I}}_{i} divided it into distinct regions denoted as ri={ri​1,ri​2,…,ri​b};subscript𝑟𝑖subscript𝑟𝑖1subscript𝑟𝑖2…subscript𝑟𝑖𝑏r_{i}=\\{r_{i1},r_{i2},\\ldots,r_{ib}\\}; for ri​j∈ℝbsubscript𝑟𝑖𝑗superscriptℝ𝑏r_{ij}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{b}, where b𝑏b signifies the total count of regions. The integration of language and image understanding at the semantic level is seamlessly achieved through the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) network [ref]25.\nThis architecture facilitates effective transfer learning by leveraging a contrastive learning approach.\nCLIP is extensively pre-trained on a vast dataset of 400 million image-text pairs from the internet, incorporating contrastive learning with both image and text exposure.\nIn alignment with these principles, our approach utilizes a pre-trained CLIP-based model [ref]25 to extract features from both visual and textual details.\n{fvi,fti}=CLIP​(ℐi,𝒯i)subscriptsubscript𝑓𝑣𝑖subscriptsubscript𝑓𝑡𝑖CLIPsubscriptℐ𝑖subscript𝒯𝑖\\{{{f}_{v}}_{i},{{f}_{t}}_{i}\\}=\\text{CLIP}({\\cal{I}}_{i},{\\cal{T}}_{i})\nwhere, fvi∈ℝDisubscriptsubscript𝑓𝑣𝑖superscriptℝsubscript𝐷𝑖{{f}_{v}}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D_{i}} and fti∈ℝDtsubscriptsubscript𝑓𝑡𝑖superscriptℝsubscript𝐷𝑡{{f}_{t}}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D_{t}} are the extracted visual and textaul feature, respectiviely. Here, Disubscript𝐷𝑖D_{i} and Dtsubscript𝐷𝑡D_{t} are the dimensions of visual and textual feature vectors, respectively. Cross Modal Understanding:\nTo capture the essence of integrating visual and textual features from movie poster ℐisubscriptℐ𝑖{\\cal{I}}_{i} to create a cohesive multimodal representation, we implemented the cross-modal understanding module. This module comprises three crucial sub-modules:\n(i) Alignment Module,\n(ii) Multi-head Cross Attention Module (M​C​A​M𝑀𝐶𝐴𝑀MCAM), and\n(iii) Sequential Multi-head Self Attention Module (S​M​S​A​M𝑆𝑀𝑆𝐴𝑀SMSAM), all of which are elaborated in detail below. (i) Alignment Module:\nDifferent modalities, such as text and images, capture information in diverse manners. Without proper alignment, the representations from these modalities lack comparability, resulting in inconsistent interpretations and hindering effective fusion .\nFeature alignment enhances the model’s ability to leverage complementary information from different modalities.\nThe dimensions of visual (fvisubscriptsubscript𝑓𝑣𝑖{{f}_{v}}_{i}) and textual feature (ftisubscriptsubscript𝑓𝑡𝑖{{f}_{t}}_{i}) may be different.\nWe applied layer normalization [ref]27 and linear projection functions to align these features in the same dimension Dasubscript𝐷𝑎D_{a}. where, p​r​o​j​e​c​t𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡project and L​N𝐿𝑁LN denote linear projection and layer normalization, respectively. (ii) Multi-head Cross Attention Module (MCAM):\nCross attention proves to effectively exploit inter-feature relationships between visual and textual feature maps. Through a linear transformation, we derive Dksubscript𝐷𝑘D_{k} dimensional queries (Q𝑄Q) and keys (K𝐾K), and Dvsubscript𝐷𝑣D_{v} dimensional values (V𝑉V) for visual feature fv​aisubscriptsubscript𝑓𝑣𝑎𝑖{{f}_{va}}_{i}, represented as\n(Qvi=fv​ai⋅Wv​q,Kvi=fv​ai⋅Wv​k,Vvi=fv​ai⋅Wv​v)formulae-sequencesubscriptsubscript𝑄𝑣𝑖⋅subscriptsubscript𝑓𝑣𝑎𝑖subscript𝑊𝑣𝑞formulae-sequencesubscriptsubscript𝐾𝑣𝑖⋅subscriptsubscript𝑓𝑣𝑎𝑖subscript𝑊𝑣𝑘subscriptsubscript𝑉𝑣𝑖⋅subscriptsubscript𝑓𝑣𝑎𝑖subscript𝑊𝑣𝑣\\left({{Q}_{v}}_{i}={{f}_{va}}_{i}\\cdot W_{vq},{{K}_{v}}_{i}={{f}_{va}}_{i}\\cdot W_{vk},{{V}_{v}}_{i}={{f}_{va}}_{i}\\cdot W_{vv}\\right).\nSimilarly, for the textual feature ft​aisubscriptsubscript𝑓𝑡𝑎𝑖{{f}_{ta}}_{i}, we obtain\n(Qti=ft​ai⋅Wt​q,Kti=ft​ai⋅Wt​k,Vti=ft​ai⋅Wt​v)formulae-sequencesubscriptsubscript𝑄𝑡𝑖⋅subscriptsubscript𝑓𝑡𝑎𝑖subscript𝑊𝑡𝑞formulae-sequencesubscriptsubscript𝐾𝑡𝑖⋅subscriptsubscript𝑓𝑡𝑎𝑖subscript𝑊𝑡𝑘subscriptsubscript𝑉𝑡𝑖⋅subscriptsubscript𝑓𝑡𝑎𝑖subscript𝑊𝑡𝑣\\left({{Q}_{t}}_{i}={{f}_{ta}}_{i}\\cdot W_{tq},{{K}_{t}}_{i}={{f}_{ta}}_{i}\\cdot W_{tk},{{V}_{t}}_{i}={{f}_{ta}}_{i}\\cdot W_{tv}\\right),\nwhere, {Wv​q,Wv​k,Wt​q,Wt​k}∈ℝDa×Dksubscript𝑊𝑣𝑞subscript𝑊𝑣𝑘subscript𝑊𝑡𝑞subscript𝑊𝑡𝑘superscriptℝsubscript𝐷𝑎subscript𝐷𝑘\\left\\{W_{vq},W_{vk},W_{tq},W_{tk}\\right\\}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{{D_{a}}\\times{D_{k}}} and\n{Wv​v,Wt​v}∈ℝDa×Dvsubscript𝑊𝑣𝑣subscript𝑊𝑡𝑣superscriptℝsubscript𝐷𝑎subscript𝐷𝑣\\left\\{W_{vv},W_{tv}\\right\\}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{{D_{a}}\\times{D_{v}}} are learnable weight matrices.\nThen, we applied multi-head cross attention (M​C​A)𝑀𝐶𝐴(MCA) to capture relationships and dependencies between different modalities. M​C​A𝑀𝐶𝐴MCA consists of multiple cross attention mechanisms in parallel , where each attention head captures the essence of different aspects of inter-relationship between visual feature fv​aisubscriptsubscript𝑓𝑣𝑎𝑖{{f}_{va}}_{i} and ft​aisubscriptsubscript𝑓𝑡𝑎𝑖{{f}_{ta}}_{i}.\nCross attention utilizes scaled dot product attention (S​A)𝑆𝐴(SA)  to calculate the attention score.\nHere, we compute the visual (𝒵visubscriptsubscript𝒵𝑣𝑖{{\\cal{Z}}_{v}}_{i}) and textual (𝒵tisubscriptsubscript𝒵𝑡𝑖{{\\cal{Z}}_{t}}_{i}) representations of cross attention as below: where, ψmsubscript𝜓𝑚\\psi_{m} denotes softmax activation [ref]27, and 𝒳Tsuperscript𝒳𝑇{\\mathcal{X}}^{T} represents transpose of matrix 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}.\nThe multi-head cross attention is empowered with multiple heads. The concurrent cross attention is collectively computed as follows: where, hℎh signifies the number of attention heads; 𝒵vic​csubscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝒵𝑣𝑐𝑐𝑖{{{\\cal{Z}}_{v}}^{cc}_{i}} and 𝒵tic​csubscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝒵𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑖{{{\\cal{Z}}_{t}}^{cc}_{i}} are the concatenated visual and textual representations, respectively.\nWe observed information loss after applying multi-head cross attention.\nTo address this issue, we employed residual connection, which eventually improved the performance.\nAfter that, we fused the visual and textual representations by leveraging layer normalization (L​N𝐿𝑁LN). (iii) Sequential Multi-head Self Attention Module (SMSAM):\nMulti-head Self Attention (M​S​A𝑀𝑆𝐴MSA) can directly learn long-range dependencies and intra-relationships in input features. M​S​A𝑀𝑆𝐴MSA also contains multiple parallel attention layers. Each head uses SA , wherein the input consists of queries and keys with dimensionality of Dksubscript𝐷𝑘D_{k}, and values with dimensionality of Dvsubscript𝐷𝑣D_{v}. M​S​A𝑀𝑆𝐴MSA is computed as follows: where, a set of queries, keys, and values are simultaneously packed together and form corresponding Q𝑄Q, K𝐾K, V𝑉V matrices. Wqi∈ℝDv​t×Dksubscriptsuperscript𝑊𝑖𝑞superscriptℝsubscript𝐷𝑣𝑡subscript𝐷𝑘W^{i}_{q}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D_{vt}\\times D_{k}}, Wki∈ℝDv​t×Dksubscriptsuperscript𝑊𝑖𝑘superscriptℝsubscript𝐷𝑣𝑡subscript𝐷𝑘W^{i}_{k}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D_{vt}\\times D_{k}} and Wvi∈ℝDv​t×Dvsubscriptsuperscript𝑊𝑖𝑣superscriptℝsubscript𝐷𝑣𝑡subscript𝐷𝑣W^{i}_{v}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D_{vt}\\times D_{v}} are learnable metrices. Dv​tsubscript𝐷𝑣𝑡D_{vt} is the dimension of fv​tisubscriptsubscript𝑓𝑣𝑡𝑖{{f}_{vt}}_{i}. We applied this M​S​A𝑀𝑆𝐴MSA in sequential connection to a rich representation. It can be formulated as below: where, l=1,2,…,L𝑙12…𝐿l=1,2,\\ldots,L. Here L=4𝐿4L=4 is the number of M​S​A𝑀𝑆𝐴MSA used sequentially. After applying multiple M​S​A𝑀𝑆𝐴MSA, we get the final fused representation: y=L​N​(zL)𝑦𝐿𝑁subscript𝑧𝐿y=LN\\left(z_{L}\\right). Feed Forward Neural Network (FFN):\nThe final stage of our model incorporates an FFN comprising two hidden layers featuring 512 and 128 nodes, respectively, which uses the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function [ref]27. The output layer contains M𝑀M nodes and employs the sigmoid output function [ref]27.\nConclusively, when presented with a movie poster image ℐisubscriptℐ𝑖{\\cal{I}}_{i}, our framework provides a genre confidence score vector Z^i=(Z^1i,Z^2i,…,Z^Mi)superscript^𝑍𝑖subscriptsuperscript^𝑍𝑖1subscriptsuperscript^𝑍𝑖2…subscriptsuperscript^𝑍𝑖𝑀\\hat{Z}^{i}=\\left(\\hat{Z}^{i}_{1},\\hat{Z}^{i}_{2},\\ldots,\\hat{Z}^{i}_{M}\\right). Loss Function:\nMulti-label datasets are mostly imbalanced and have more negative samples than positive ones for a particular class. We use Asymmetric Loss (A​S​L)𝐴𝑆𝐿(ASL) to address this issue . The main objective of A​S​L𝐴𝑆𝐿ASL is to provide control over positive and negative sample imbalance in the optimization of multi-label classification.\nIt prioritizes learning of more challenging samples, particularly those belonging to minority classes in the given datasets. A​S​L𝐴𝑆𝐿ASL achieves this by adjusting specific weights to each class in the loss function, considering the complexity of the classification task.\nConsequently, the loss function assigns higher weights to minority class samples, which involve greater classification complexity, while allocating lower weights to majority class samples that are comparatively simpler to classify.\nGiven the input movie poster image ℐisubscriptℐ𝑖{\\cal{I}}_{i}, we can predict its genre confidence score vector Z^i=(Z^1i,Z^2i,…,Z^Mi)superscript^𝑍𝑖subscriptsuperscript^𝑍𝑖1subscriptsuperscript^𝑍𝑖2…subscriptsuperscript^𝑍𝑖𝑀\\hat{Z}^{i}=\\left(\\hat{Z}^{i}_{1},\\hat{Z}^{i}_{2},\\ldots,\\hat{Z}^{i}_{M}\\right). using our framework. We employ the asymmetric loss to calculate the loss as below: where, Yjisubscriptsuperscript𝑌𝑖𝑗Y^{i}_{j} denotes the ground truth for jt​hsuperscript𝑗𝑡ℎj^{th} genre gj∈Gsubscript𝑔𝑗𝐺g_{j}\\in G for image ℐisubscriptℐ𝑖{\\cal{I}}_{i} calculated through Eqn. 1. Pϵ​(Z^ji)subscript𝑃italic-ϵsubscriptsuperscript^𝑍𝑖𝑗P_{\\epsilon}\\left(\\hat{Z}^{i}_{j}\\right) is shifted probability of Z^jisubscriptsuperscript^𝑍𝑖𝑗\\hat{Z}^{i}_{j}. Shifted probability is the probability assigned to negative samples after applying hard thresholding using the margin ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon for adjustment. It is defined as below: The overall cost is calculated by taking an average of losses across all samples in the training dataset.\nEmpirically, we set γ+=3superscript𝛾3\\gamma^{+}=3, γ−=4superscript𝛾4\\gamma^{-}=4, ϵ=0.2italic-ϵ0.2\\epsilon=0.2 for our experiments. Post-processing:\nIn this step, we apply quantization on the confidence score vector Z^isuperscript^𝑍𝑖\\hat{Z}^{i} to get the final output vector Yi^∈{0,1}M^superscript𝑌𝑖superscript01𝑀\\hat{Y^{i}}\\in\\{0,1\\}^{M}, as below: where, we have empirically chosen the threshold ττ\\uptau to be 0.5.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: Movie Posters:\nOur proposed framework involves the analysis of a movie poster image ℐisubscriptℐ𝑖{\\cal{I}}_{i}.\nThe movie poster ℐisubscriptℐ𝑖{\\cal{I}}_{i} is processed through Gemini-Pro-Vision [ref]24-based OCR to extract text 𝒯i=(ti​1,ti​2,…,ti​a)subscript𝒯𝑖subscript𝑡𝑖1subscript𝑡𝑖2…subscript𝑡𝑖𝑎{\\cal{T}}_{i}=\\left(t_{i1},t_{i2},\\ldots,t_{ia}\\right) which is tokenized into sub-word units,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
