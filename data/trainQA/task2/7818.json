      "content": "Paper Title: Synthesis of Temporal Causality\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs it turns out, the intricate balance between the counterfactual criterion and minimality of temporal causality gives rise to an intuitive order-theoretic characterization of causes: The complement of the cause is the upward closure of the negated effect property in the partial order defined by the similarity relation (measuring distance from the actual trace). We illustrate the intuition behind this characterization in Section¬†3.1, and formally prove it in Section¬†5.1. The consequence of our characterization is that if we can compute the upward closure of the negated effect ùñ§¬Ø¬Øùñ§\\overline{\\mathsf{E}} and the complement of the result, then we can compute the cause for ùñ§ùñ§\\mathsf{E} on œÄùúã\\pi. We show that if ùñ§ùñ§\\mathsf{E} is an œâùúî\\omega-regular property, œÄùúã\\pi in a lasso shape, and the similarity relation is also defined by a (relational) œâùúî\\omega-regular property, such an upward closure can be constructed as a nondeterministic B√ºchi automaton, which means that the cause (i.e., the complement of the automaton) again is an œâùúî\\omega-regular property. This approach forms the core of our cause synthesis algorithm, which we describe in Section¬†5. The complexity of our algorithm significantly scales in the size of the description of the similarity relation, which is problematic due to the complex and large similarity relations of previous work. Coenen et al.¬†[ref]19 observed that with the original counterfactual criterion, these similarity relations need to satisfy the assumption that there is a non-empty set of closest traces for any actual trace and candidate cause, otherwise the counterfactual condition can be vacuously true. We tie this restriction to the limit assumption first introduced by Lewis¬† and study similarity relations through this lens. Concrete similarity relations that have been proposed so far¬† [ref]19 satisfy the limit assumption by adding additional criteria, but these increase the size of the formula describing the similarity relation significantly. In Section¬†4, we show that we can instead modify the counterfactual condition of the causality definition to allow similarity relations that do not satisfy the limit assumption, using Lewis‚Äô semantics for counterfactuals¬†, as extended to non-total similarity relations by Finkbeiner and Siber¬†. Crucially, this modification retains the original semantics of Coenen et al.¬†for similarity relations that satisfy the limit assumption as long as the actual trace is deterministic. Hence, it generalizes our closure-based characterization and the corresponding algorithm to significantly simpler similarity relations. In Section¬†6, we show through experiments with our prototype tool CORP that our modified counterfactual criterion leads to significantly faster computations in practice. We further compare our cause synthesis algorithm with the incomplete sketching approach of the tool CATS¬†. Last, we extend our approach to cause checking through cause synthesis with an additional equivalence check, which we compare with the checker implemented in CATS. In summary, we make the following contributions: We extend the theory of temporal causality to similarity relations that do not satisfy the limit assumption. We prove an order-theoretic characterization of causes as downward closed sets of the similarity relation. Based on this characterization, we develop the first complete method for œâùúî\\omega-regular cause synthesis. We present and evaluate a prototype implementation of our approach.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: our algorithm significantly scales in the size of the description of the similarity relation, which is problematic due to the complex and large similarity relations of previous work.
