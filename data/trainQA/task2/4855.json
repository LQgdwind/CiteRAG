      "content": "Paper Title: Sustainable Online Reinforcement Learning for Auto-bidding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVAS-based RL Auto-bidding Methods.\nImpressed by powerful contextual learning and sequential decision-making capabilities of RL, modern auto-bidding policies, such as DRLB , RLB , MSBCB  and USCB (state-of-the-art) , are usually learned by RL algorithms in a manually built VAS. However, as stated before, they all suffer from the IBOO problem. The SORL avoids using the VAS and thereby completely address the IBOO challenge. Offline RL. Offline RL (also known as batch RL) 1 3 6 7 [ref]30    0 aims to learn better policies based on a fixed offline dataset collected by some behavior policies. The main challenge offline RL addressed is the extrapolation error caused by missing data 7. Specifically,\noffline RL algorithms usually address this challenge in three ways, including policy constraint methods\nsuch as BCQ 1, BEAR [ref]30, and conservative regularization methods\nsuch as CQL 3, BRAC 0, as well as modifications of imitation learning  such as ABM , CRR , BAIL. However, there is another important challenge that offline RL cannot solve: the fixed offline dataset cannot be guaranteed to contain sufficient state-action pairs from high-reward regions 7. This challenge exists in many practical applications, including the auto-bidding problem, and can inherently prevent offline RL algorithms from learning excellent policies. Hence, a great advantage of the SORL is its ability to continuously collect data from OOD high-reward regions that can give new feedbacks to the auto-bidding policy being trained. Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE). OPE is an algorithm to evaluate the performance of the policy with offline data collected by other policies 2. The state-of-the-art OPE algorithm in auto-bidding is to calculate the R/Râˆ—R/R* of the evaluated policy in the VAS (see Appendix B for details). However, as shown in Table. 1, the OPE in auto-bidding is not accurate. This indicates that we cannot rely on the OPE to select auto-bidding policies with good performance for directing further online explorations. Notably, the proposed offline training algorithm in the SORL, V-CQL, outperforms existing offline RL algorithms in training stabilities and helps to reduce the OPE process during iterations in SORL. Online RL. Safety is of vital importance in the online exploration of many real-world industrial systems, including the RAS. Many safe online RL algorithms have been proposed to guarantee the safety of explorations 7 8 9 0 1 2 [ref]33  .\nHowever, many of them are either developed based on the constraints that are not suitable for the auto-bidding problem or designed for systems with specific assumptions (see Appendix B for details).\nBesides, many existing works [ref]33   1 assume that there exists a specific set of safe state-action pairs that can be explored. Some work [ref]33 even requires to know the safe states in advance. However, in the auto-bidding problem, no specific actions at any state cannot be explored as long as the expected accumulative reward maintains at a high level. This requires the exploration policy to maintain high performance throughout the iterations, which is more challenging. Notably, the SER policy can meet this requirement with theoretical guarantees.\nRecently, with the development of the offline RL field, many algorithms for efficient online explorations on the premise of having an offline dataset 4 3 have emerged. However, they often only focus on the efficiency of data collections but ignore the safety of it. Notably, the SER policy in the SORL strikes a good balance between the efficiency and safety. Supplementary related works are described in Appendix B.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: as stated before, they all suffer from the IBOO problem.
