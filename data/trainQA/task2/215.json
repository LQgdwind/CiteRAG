      "content": "Paper Title: Distributed and Democratized Learning: Philosophy and Research Challenges\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDefinition and goal: Democratized Learning (Dem-AI in short) focuses on the study of dual (coupled and working together) specialized-generalized processes in a self-organizing hierarchical structure of large-scale distributed learning systems. The specialized and generalized processes must operate jointly towards an ultimate learning goal identified as performing collective learning from biased learning agents, who are committed to learn from their own data using their limited learning capabilities. As such, the ultimate learning goal of the Dem-AI system is to establish a mechanism for collectively solving common (single or multiple) complex learning tasks from a large number of learning agents. In case of a common single learning task setting, the Dem-AI system aims to improve the aggregation accuracy of all agents, as done in federated learning. The ultimate goal in a conventional federated learning system is to minimize the average model loss of all agents for a single learning task. Moreover, for different learning settings and applications, the goal of Dem-AI systems can be derived from following specific designs of learning objectives. The learning agents can also collectively contribute to solving common multiple tasks as an ultimate goal in Dem-AI system. For example, with multi-tasks learning setting [ref]20, the goal is to attain the overall learning performance for multiple tasks, simultaneously. In meta-learning [ref]9, the learning goal is to construct a generalized knowledge that can efficiently deal with similar new learning tasks. Similarly, in reinforcement learning, the coordination task is defined to maximize the cumulative rewards for the joint actions taken by individual agents according to their partial observation . Democracy in learning:\nThe Dem-AI system features a unique characterization of participation in the learning process, and consequently develops the notion of democracy in learning whose principles include the following: According to the differences in their characteristics, learning agents are divided into suitable groups that can be specialized for the learning tasks. These specialized groups are self-organized in a hierarchical structure to mediate voluntary contributions from all members in the collaborative learning for solving multiple complex tasks. The shared generalized learning knowledge supports specialized groups and learning agents to improve their learning performance by reducing individual biases during participation. In particular, the learning system allows new group members to: a) speed up their learning process with the existing group knowledge and b) incorporate their new learning knowledge in expanding the generalization capability of the whole group. Learning agents are free to join suitable learning groups and exhibit equal power in constructing their groupsâ€™ generalized learning model. The group power can be represented by the number of its members, which can vary over the training time. Dem-AI Meta-Law: We define a meta-law as a mechanism that can be used to manipulate the transition between the dual specialized-generalized processes of our Dem-AI system. This meta-law is driven by two coincident primary forces: 1) a stability force, and 2) a plasticity force. Throughout the learning time, the transition mechanism adjusts the importance weight between these forces to empower the plasticity or the stability in the specialized learning and generalization as well as the hierarchical structure of the Dem-AI system. The Dem-AI meta-law also provides the necessary information to regulate the self-organizing hierarchical structuring mechanism. Specialized Process: This process is used to leverage the specialized learning capabilities in the learning agents and specialized groups by exploiting their collected data. This process also drives the hierarchical structure of specialized groups with many levels of relevant generalized knowledge to become stable and well-separated. Thus, with the addition of higher levels of generalized knowledge created by the generalization of all specialized group members, the learning agents can exploit their local datasets so as to reduce biases during personalized learning for a single learning task. Thus, the personalized learning objective has two goals in its learning problem: 1) to perform specialized learning, and 2) to reuse the available hierarchical generalized knowledge.\nBesides, generalized knowledge can be incorporated by the regularizers for the personalized learning objectives.\nMoreover, the specialized learning can be performed as group learning formation when the members do not have learning capabilities on their own or when they are required to solve a coordination task.\nConsiderably, over time, the generalized knowledge becomes less important compared to the specialized learning goal and a more stable hierarchical structure of specialized groups will form. These transitions are the direct consequence of the stability force characterized by the specialized knowledge exploitation and knowledge consistency. However, it becomes stronger over time in the meta-law design of our Dem-AI principle. Generalized Process: This process is used to regulate the generalization mechanism for all existing specialized groups as well as the plasticity level of all groups. Here, group plasticity pertains to the ease with which learning agents can change their groups. The generalization mechanism encourages group members to become close together when doing a similar learning task and sharing knowledge.\nThis process enables the sharing of knowledge among group members and the construction of a hierarchical level of the generalized knowledge from all of the specialized groups. Thereafter, the generalized knowledge helps the Dem-AI system to maintain the generalization ability for efficiently dealing with environment changes or new learning tasks. Hence, knowledge sharing is the mechanism to construct the generalized knowledge from similar and correlated learning tasks such as model averaging in FL , sharing knowledge mechanisms in multi-tasks learning [ref]21, and knowledge distillation . Moreover, to resolve the conflict among excessively different specialized groups, an election mechanism can be adopted to reach consensus or a union mechanism can be applied to maintain the diversity of the potential groups. Consequently, the hierarchical generalized knowledge can be constructed based on the contribution of the group members, which is driven by the plasticity force. This force is characterized by creative attributes, knowledge exploration, multi-task capability, and survival in uncertainty, and it becomes weaker over time in the meta-law design of the Dem-AI principle. Self-organizing Hierarchical Structure:\nAccording to the transition between the two basic forces as well as the necessary information in the meta-law, the hierarchical structure of specialized groups and the relevant generalized knowledge are constructed and regulated following a self-organization principle (e.g., hierarchical clustering ). This structure then evolves to become more stable: temporary small groups with high-level group plasticity will later unite to form a bigger group that enhances the generalized capability for all members.\nThus, the specialized groups at higher levels in the hierarchical structure have more members and can construct more generalized (less biased) knowledge. Hierarchical modular networks can be found in the human brain as well as in the structures of human knowledge . These hierarchical structures exhibit higher overall performance and evolvability (i.e., faster adaptation to new environments), as explained in . Next, we establish the general principles that characterize the evolution of underlying processes in Dem-AI.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: of learning objectives.
