      "content": "Paper Title: False Correlation Reduction for Offline Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe conduct extensive experiments on the widely adopted D4RL [ref]2 benchmark.\nD4RL provides three robotic tasks (halfcheetah, hopper, and walker2d) shown in Figure 2. Each task has five datasets of different qualities:\n“random” is collected using a random initialized policy, “medium” is collected using a partially trained policy, and “expert” is collected using a well-trained policy. “medium-replay” and “medium-expert” are derived from a mixture of policies 111In practice, the behavioral policy is usually unknown and comes in the form of a mixture of multiple policies of different quality., with the former containing all the data in the replay buffer of the “medium-level” policy and the latter being the product of mixing the “meidum” and “expert” datasets in equal proportions. In brief, unlike online RL experiments that only test algorithms on different tasks, the offline RL benchmark evaluates algorithms on datasets of different qualities. In this way, we can comprehensively assess the ability of an algorithm to learn effective policies on various training data distributions. There are 15 datasets in total. We evaluate 8 different baselines of diversified types on the D4RL benchmark, as summarized in Table I: BCQ [ref]1 is a simple yet strong baseline, providing stable performance. It involves training a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and an agent with the actor-critic architecture. In particular, the actor perturbs the actions proposed by the VAE instead of directly output actions, and the critic determines the final action to be performed from a set of candidate actions. BEAR  employs a similar architecture to BCQ but directly uses the actor to output actions. The authors propose to use the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) distance to constrain the learning process in policy optimization to avoid large differences with the behavioral policy. CQL [ref]9 is the state-of-the-art offline RL algorithm. Unlike policy-constrained methods, it incorporates a strong value regularizer into the critic’s loss to suppress the value of OOD actions, thus indirectly leading the agent to resist them. Specifically, the OOD data is sampled using the learned policy in practice, which requires additional computational costs. MOPO  is a model-based offline RL algorithm which modifies the observed reward by incorporating the maximum standard deviation of the learned models (model uncertainty) as a penalty. The agent is then trained with the penalized rewards. MOReL  is also a model-based offline RL algorithm. Instead of the using the maximum standard deviation, MOReL proposes to use the maximum disagreement of the learned models as the penalty. UWAC  improves BEAR  by incorporating MC dropout to estimate the uncertainty of the input sample and weight the loss accordingly. TD3-BC  is a simple offline reinforcement learning algorithm with minimal modifications to the TD3 2 algorithm. The authors suggest to use a weighted sum of the critic loss and the behavior cloning loss to update the actor. Despite its simplicity, the method also offers stable and good performance. PBRL  quantifies uncertainty through the disagreements of the bootstrapped Q-networks and performs pessimistic updates. Similar to CQL, PBRL utilizes an OOD sampler to obtain pseudo-OOD samples. In the policy evaluation step, PBRL proposes to introduce an additional pseudo target for these samples and imposes a large uncertainty penalty on them. Inspired by , PBRL-prior constructs a set of random prior networks of the same size as the Q-networks on top of PBRL. Empirically, the performance is remarkably improved by incorporating these prior networks. Therefore, we report the performance of the PBRL-prior version in the experiments. We remark that the results reported in the D4RL white paper [ref]2 are based on the “v0” version of D4RL, and most previous work reuse those results for comparison. However, the “v0” version has some errors that may lead to wrong conclusions and the authors release a “v2” version later to correct the errors. To this end, we rerun all the baseline methods on the “v2” version and report the new results. All the experiments are run on a single NVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 GPU. To guarantee a fair comparison, we conducted the experiments under the same experimental protocol. The whole training process has a total of 1 million gradient steps, which are divided into 1000 epochs. At the end of each epoch, we run 10 episodes for evaluation. To reduce the effect of randomness on the experimental results, all experiments are run with 5 independent random seeds while keeping other factors unchanged. We specify both the actor network and the critic network to be a three-layer neural network with 256 neurons per layer. The first two layers of both networks use the ReLU activation function. In particular, the last layer of the actor network uses the tanh activation function for outputting actions. Both networks have a separated Adam optimizer and the learning rate is 3e-4. Some baselines differ in settings and have additional hyperparameters. We use the official code and the suggested settings. When the default parameters do not perform well, we use grid search to find the optimal hyperparameters for different datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: We conduct extensive experiments on the widely adopted D4RL [ref]2 benchmark.\nD4RL provides three robotic tasks (halfcheetah, hopper, and walker2d) shown in Figure 2.
