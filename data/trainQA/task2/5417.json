      "content": "Paper Title: Part\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo analyze student-teacher deviations,\nStanton et al. [ref]47\nmeasured the disagreement and the KL divergence between the student and teacher probabilities, in expectation over all points. They found these quantities to be non-trivially large, contrary to the premise of distillation. To\nprobe into the exact nature of these deviations, our idea is to study the per-sample relationship between the teacher and student probabilities. Setup.\nSuppose we have teacher and distilled student models 𝐟te,𝐟st:𝒳→ℝK:superscript𝐟tesuperscript𝐟st→𝒳superscriptℝ𝐾{\\mathbf{f}}^{\\textsf{te}},{\\mathbf{f}}^{\\textsf{st}}\\colon\\mathscr{X}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{K} respectively.\nWe seek to analyze the deviations in the corresponding\npredicted probability vectors 𝐩te​(𝐱)superscript𝐩te𝐱{\\mathbf{p}}^{\\textsf{te}}(\\mathbf{x}) and 𝐩st​(𝐱)superscript𝐩st𝐱{\\mathbf{p}}^{\\textsf{st}}(\\mathbf{x})\nfor each (𝐱,y)𝐱𝑦(\\mathbf{x},y) in the train and test set,\nrather than in the aggregated sense as in Stanton et al. [ref]47.\nTo visualize the deviations, we need a scalar summary of these vectors. An initial obvious candidate is the probabilities assigned to the ground truth class y⋆superscript𝑦⋆{y}^{\\star}, namely (py⋆te​(𝐱),py⋆st​(𝐱))subscriptsuperscript𝑝tesuperscript𝑦⋆𝐱subscriptsuperscript𝑝stsuperscript𝑦⋆𝐱({p}^{\\textsf{te}}_{{y}^{\\star}}(\\mathbf{x}),{p}^{\\textsf{st}}_{{y}^{\\star}}(\\mathbf{x})). However, the student does not have access to the ground truth class, and is only trying to mimic the teacher. Hence, it is more meaningful and valuable to focus on the teacher’s predicted class, which the student can infer i.e., the class yte=.argmaxy′∈[K]⁡py′te​(𝐱)superscript.superscript𝑦tesubscriptargmaxsuperscript𝑦′delimited-[]𝐾subscriptsuperscript𝑝tesuperscript𝑦′𝐱{y}^{\\textsf{te}}\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle.}}{{=}}\\operatorname{argmax}_{y^{\\prime}\\in[K]}\\,{{p}^{\\textsf{te}}_{y^{\\prime}}(\\mathbf{x})}. Thus, we examine the teacher-student probabilities on this label, (pytete​(𝐱),pytest​(𝐱))subscriptsuperscript𝑝tesuperscript𝑦te𝐱subscriptsuperscript𝑝stsuperscript𝑦te𝐱({p}^{\\textsf{te}}_{{y}^{\\textsf{te}}}(\\mathbf{x}),{p}^{\\textsf{st}}_{{y}^{\\textsf{te}}}(\\mathbf{x})). Purely for visual clarity,\nwe further perform a monotonic logit transformation ϕ​(u)=log⁡[u/(1−u)]italic-ϕ𝑢𝑢1𝑢\\phi(u)=\\log\\left[{u}/({1-u})\\right] on these probabilities to produce real values in (−∞,+∞)(-\\infty,+\\infty). Thus, we compare\nϕ​(pytete​(𝐱))italic-ϕsubscriptsuperscript𝑝tesuperscript𝑦te𝐱\\phi({{p}^{\\textsf{te}}_{{y}^{\\textsf{te}}}(\\mathbf{x})})\nand ϕ​(pytest​(𝐱))italic-ϕsubscriptsuperscript𝑝stsuperscript𝑦te𝐱\\phi({{p}^{\\textsf{st}}_{{y}^{\\textsf{te}}}(\\mathbf{x})}) for each train and test sample (𝐱,y)𝐱𝑦(\\mathbf{x},y). For brevity, we refer to these values as confidence values for the rest of our discussion. It is worth noting that these confidence values possess another natural interpretation. For any probability vector 𝐩​(𝐱)𝐩𝐱\\mathbf{p}(\\mathbf{x}) computed from the softmax of a logit vector 𝐟​(𝐱)𝐟𝐱\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}), we can write ϕ​(py​(𝐱))italic-ϕsubscript𝑝𝑦𝐱\\phi({{p}_{y}(\\mathbf{x})}) in terms of the logits as fy​(𝐱)−log​∑k≠yexp⁡(fk​(𝐱))subscript𝑓𝑦𝐱subscript𝑘𝑦subscript𝑓𝑘𝐱f_{y}(\\mathbf{x})-\\log\\sum_{k\\neq y}\\exp(f_{k}(\\mathbf{x})). This can be interpreted as a notion of multi-class margin for class y𝑦y. To examine point-wise deviations of these confidence values, we consider scatter plots of ϕ​(pytete​(𝐱))italic-ϕsubscriptsuperscript𝑝tesuperscript𝑦te𝐱\\phi({{p}^{\\textsf{te}}_{{y}^{\\textsf{te}}}(\\mathbf{x})}) (X𝑋X-axis) vs.\nϕ​(pytest​(𝐱))italic-ϕsubscriptsuperscript𝑝stsuperscript𝑦te𝐱\\phi({{p}^{\\textsf{st}}_{{y}^{\\textsf{te}}}(\\mathbf{x})}) (Y𝑌Y-axis). We report this on the training set for some representative self-distillation settings in Figures 1a, cross-architecture distillation settings in Fig 2b and test set in Fig 2a. In all plots, the dashed line indicates the X=Y𝑋𝑌X=Y line.\nAll values are computed at the end of training. The tasks considered include image classification benchmarks, namely CIFAR10, CIFAR-100 , Tiny-ImageNet , ImageNet [ref]45 and text classification tasks from the GLUE benchmark (e.g., MNLI , AGNews ).\nSee §C.1 for details on the experimental hyperparameters. The plots for all the settings (spanning more than 252525 settings in total) are consolidated in §C.2. Distilled students exaggerate one-hot trained teacher’s confidence.\nWe find that across all our settings, the student deviates from the teacher’s probabilities. Importantly, this deviation reveals a characteristic pattern. In a vast majority of our settings, the confidence values of the student are an “exaggerated” version of the teacher’s. This manifests in one of two ways. On the one hand, for points where the teacher attains low confidence, the student may attain even lower confidence — this is true for all our image settings, either on training or on test data. In the scatter plots, this can be inferred from the fact that for a large proportion of points where the X𝑋X axis value is small (low teacher confidence), it is also the case that Y≤X𝑌𝑋Y\\leq X (even lower student confidence). As a second type of exaggeration, for points where the teacher attains high confidence, the student may attain even higher confidence — this is true for a majority of our language settings, barring some cross-architecture ones.\nTo quantify these qualitative observations, in\n §C.4 we report the slope m𝑚m of the best linear fit Y=m​X+c𝑌𝑚𝑋𝑐Y=mX+c over the low and high-confidence points and find that they correspond to m>1𝑚1m>1 in the corresponding scenarios above. There are two reasons why these findings are particularly surprising. First, we see these deviations in both self-distillation settings (Fig 1a) and cross-architecture settings (see Fig 2b). It is remarkable that this should occur in self-distillation given that the student has the capacity to match the teacher probabilities. Next, these deviations can occur on both training and test data (Fig 2a). Here, it is surprising that there is deviation on training data, where the student is explicitly trained to match teacher probabilities. However, we must note that there are a few exceptions where it only weakly appears in training data e.g., CIFAR-10, but in those cases it is prominent on test data. We also conduct ablation studies in §C.5 showing that our observation is robust to various hyperparameter changes (batch size, learning rate, length of training), and choices of visualization metrics. In §C.3, we explore further patterns underlying the student’s underfit points. In §C.2, we discuss the exceptions where these patterns fail to appear e.g., in cross-architecture language settings. In summary, via our point-wise visualization of deviations, we find that the student’s mismatch of the teacher’s probabilities stems from a systematic exaggeration of the teacher’s confidence. How do we reconcile this deviation with the student outperforming the teacher in self-distillation? In the next section, we formalize a different type of exaggeration exerted by distillation that will help us resolve this question.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: To analyze student-teacher deviations,\nStanton et al.
