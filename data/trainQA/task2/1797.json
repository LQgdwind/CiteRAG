      "content": "Paper Title: Attention, please! A survey of Neural Attention Models in Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisual attention has become popular in many CV tasks. Action recognition, counting crowds, image classification, image generation, object detection, person recognition, segmentation, saliency detection, text recognition, and tracking targets are the most explored sub-areas, as shown in Table 3. Applications in other sub-areas still have few representative works, such as clustering, compression, deblurring, depth estimation, image restoration, among others, as shown in Table 4. Visual attention in image classification tasks was first addressed by Graves et al. . In this domain, there are sequential approaches inspired by human saccadic movements  and feedforward-augmented structures CNNs (Section 4). The general goal is usually to amplify fine-grained recognition, improve classification in the presence of occlusions, sudden variations in points of view, lighting, and rotation. Some approaches aim to learn to look at the most relevant parts of the input image, while others try to discern between discriminating regions through feature recalibration and ensemble predictors via attention. To fine-grained recognition, important advances have been achieved through recurrent convolutional networks in the classification of bird subspecies  and architectures trained via RL to classify vehicle subtypes . Visual attention also provides significant benefits for action recognition tasks by capturing spatio-temporal relationships. The biggest challenge’s classical approaches are capturing discriminative features of movement in the sequences of images or videos. The attention allows the network to focus the processing only on the relevant joints or on the movement features easily. Generally, the main approaches use the following strategies: 1) saliency maps: spatiotemporal attention models learn where to look in video directly human fixation data. These models express the probability of saliency for each pixel. Deep 3D CNNs extract features only high saliency regions to represent spatial and short time relations at clip level, and LSTMs expand the temporal domain from few frames to seconds ; 2) self-attention: modeling context-dependencies. The person being classified is the Query (Q), and the clip around the person is the memory, represented by keys (K) and values (V) vectors. The network process the query and memory to generate an updated query vector. Intuitively self-attention adds context to other people and objects in the clip to assist in subsequent classification ; 3) recurrent attention mechanisms: captures relevant positions of joints or movement features and, through a recurring structure, refines the attentional focus at each time step  [ref]153; and 4) temporal attention: captures relevant spatial-temporal locations [ref]320 [ref]320    [ref]423. Liu et al.  model is a recurrent attention approach to capturing the person’s relevant positions. This model presented a pioneering approach using two layers of LSTMs and the context memory cell that recurrently interact with each other, as shown in figure 19a. First, a layer of LSTMs generates an encoding of a skeleton sequence, initializing the context memory cell. The memory representation is input to the second layer of LSTMs and helps the network selectively focus on each frame’s informational articulations. Finally, attentional representation feeds back the context memory cell to refine the focus’s orientation again by paying attention more reliably.\nSimilarly, Du et al. [ref]153 proposed RPAN - a recurrent attention approach between sequentially modeling by LSTMs and convolutional features extractors. First, CNNs extract features from the current frame, and the attentional mechanism guided by the LSTM’s previous hidden state estimates a series of features related to human articulations related to the semantics of movements of interest. Then, these highly discriminative features feed LSTM time sequences. In image generation, there were also notable benefits. DRAW  introduced visual attention with an innovative approach - image patches are generated sequentially and gradually refined, in which to generate the entire image in a single pass (figure 19b). Subsequently, attentional mechanisms emerged in generative adversarial networks (GANs) to minimize the challenges in modeling images with structural constraints. Naturally, GANs efficiently synthesize elements differentiated by texture (i.e., oceans, sky, natural landscapes) but suffer to generate geometric patterns (i.e., faces, animals, people, fine details). The central problem is the convolutions that fail to model dependencies between distant regions. Besides, the statistical and computational efficiency of the model suffers from the stacking of many layers. The attentional mechanisms, especially self-attention, offered a computationally inexpensive alternative to model long-range dependencies easily. Self-attention as a complement to convolution contributes significantly to the advancement of the area with approaches capable of generating fine details , high-resolution images, and with intricate geometric patterns . In expression recognition, attention optimizes the entire segmentation process by scanning input as a whole sequence, choosing the most relevant region to describe a segmented symbol or implicit space operator . In information retriever, attention helps obtain appropriate semantic resources using individual class semantic resources to progressively orient visual aids to generate an attention map to ponder the importance of different local regions. . In medical image analysis, attention helps implicitly learn to suppress irrelevant areas in an input image while highlighting useful resources for a specific task. This allows us to eliminate the need to use explicit external tissue/organ localization modules using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Besides, it allows generating both images and maps of attention in unsupervised learning useful for data annotation. For this, there are the ATA-GANS 0 and attention gate  modules that work with unsupervised and supervised learning, respectively. For person recognition, attention has become essential in in-person re-identification (re-id)   . Re-id aims to search for people seen from a surveillance camera implanted in different locations. In classical approaches, the bounding boxes of detected people were not optimized for re-identification suffering from misalignment problems, background disorder, occlusion, and absent body parts. Misalignment is one of the biggest challenges, as people are often captured in various poses, and the system needs to compare different images. In this sense, neural attention models started to lead the developments mainly with multiple attentional mechanisms of alignment between different bounding boxes. There are still less popular applications, but for which attention plays an essential role. Self-attention models iterations between the input set for clustering tasks . Attention refines and merges multi-scale feature maps in-depth estimation and edge detection  . In video classification, attention helps capture global and local resources generating a comprehensive representation 0. It also measures each time interval’s relevance in a sequence [ref]423, promoting a more intuitive interpretation of the impact of content on the video’s popularity, providing the regions that contribute the most to the prediction . In face detection, attention dynamically selects the main reference points of the face . It improves deblurring in each convolutional layer in deblurring, preserving fine details . Finally, in emotion recognition, it captures complex relationships between audio and video data by obtaining regions where both signals relate to emotion .\n\nReference markers found: [153]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]153: classification ; 3) recurrent attention mechanisms: captures relevant positions of joints or movement features and, through a recurring structure, refines the attentional focus at each time step  [ref]153; and 4) temporal attention: captures relevant spatial-temporal locations [ref]320 [ref]320    [ref]423.
