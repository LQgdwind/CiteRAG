      "content": "Paper Title: Enhancing Fine-Tuning Based Backdoor Defense with Sharpness-Aware Minimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs deep neural networks (DNNs) have been increasingly applied to safety-critical tasks such as face recognition, autonomous driving, and medical image processing [ref]13 [ref]1   , the threat exhibited by DNNs has drawn attention from both the industrial and academic community. Recently, backdoor attacks     have emerged as a new practical and stealthy threat to DNNs, for which the attacker plants pre-defined triggers to a small portion of the dataset and misleads the DNNs trained on such dataset to behave normally with benign inputs while classifying the input with trigger into the target class. To detect or mitigate the effect of backdoor, substantial efforts have been done in inversing triggers, splitting dataset, or pruning the DNNs, while fine-tuning, a natural choice for backdoor defense, has received much less attention. Although complex techniques such as unlearning and pruning have achieved remarkable performance, they usually come at the cost of accuracy on the original tasks. Additionally, the effectiveness of pruning is contingent upon the network structure, as highlighted by Wu et al.  [ref]40, underscoring the necessity for meticulous pruning strategies. In contrast, fine-tuning, a more general approach, can moderately restore the model’s utility. Although vanilla fine-tuning has been adopted as a component of some backdoor defense methods  , fine-tuning a backdoored model to remove the backdoor is still challenging when only limited benign data is given[ref]40. Previous work [ref]40 has found that fine-tuning is a powerful technique in some situations, however, it cannot resist strong backdoor attacks such as Blended  and LF . One of the possible reason is the backdoored model already fits the benign samples well; hence, vanilla fine-tuning can only make minor changes to the weights of neurons and fail to mitigate the backdoor effect, as demonstrated in Figure 1. In this paper, we focus on the problem of designing a new objective function that can alter the backdoor-related weights and help to remove the backdoor effect via fine-tuning. To address this problem, we first take a closer look at the fine-tuning process from neurons’ perspective.\nWe empirically observe that the weight norm of neurons has a positive correlation with backdoor-related neurons in our experiment, which is also implied in . Intuitively, the neurons with large norms can cause the backdoor features to override the normal features, making the model incorrectly pay attention to the trigger’s feature. Motivated by the relationship between the neuron weight norms and the backdoor effect, we propose to adopt Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) with adaptive perturbations   to fine-tune the backdoored model, which can revise the large outliers of weight norms and induce a more concentrated distribution of weight norms . In detail, SAM considers a min-max formulation to encourage the weights in neighbors with an uniformly low loss. The adaptive constraints on perturbations can facilitate greater change of backdoor-related neurons. By leveraging SAM on the backdoored model, we empirically show that the model not only benefits from escaping the current local minima but also receives more perturbations on backdoor-related neurons than the normal weights. Therefore, SAM implicitly facilitates the learning of backdoored neurons and helps to remove the backdoor effect. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on three benchmark datasets with two networks, and compare them to seven state-of-the-art defense methods. The results shows our method is competitive with and frequently superior to the best baseline. Our method is also robust across different components. Additionally, we empirically confirm that our strategy can take the place of fine-tuning, which can be used in conjunction with current backdoor defense techniques to make up for accuracy drop. In summary, our main contributions are three-fold: (1) We reveal the reason of the weak backdoor defense performance of the vanilla fine-tuning based on a deep investigation from the perspective of backdoor-related neurons’ weight changes. (2) By leveraging SAM, we design an innovative fine-tuning paradigm to effectively remove the backdoor effect from a pre-trained backdoored model by perturbing the neurons.\n(3) Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance among existing defense methods and boost existing defense methods based on fine-tuning.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: As deep neural networks (DNNs) have been increasingly applied to safety-critical tasks such as face recognition, autonomous driving, and medical image processing [ref]13 [ref]1   , the threat exhibited by DNNs has drawn attention from both the industrial and academic community.
