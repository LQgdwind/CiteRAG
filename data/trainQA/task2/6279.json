      "content": "Paper Title: FedVal: Different good or different bad in federated learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe implement various state-of-the-art solutions as baselines from a wide range of prospective in our experiments for comprehensive comparisons. LFR 3 is a poisoning defense that removes a specified number of clients in each round based on their accumulated loss on a server-side validation dataset. In our experiments, 40%percent4040\\% of clients were removed each round, as determined by the mathematical experiment in Section A and the number of malicious clients used. LFR serves as a benchmark algorithm for validation-loss-based defenses. It is worth mentioning that following the original paper, the FEMNIST dataset experiments with LFR use a heterogeneous validation dataset with the same label distribution as the training dataset. Multi-Krum , an outlier-based defense method, is a defense that removes a specified number of client updates deemed as outliers, based on the Euclidean distance between updates. As Multi-Krum (and other outlier-based defenses) struggle to detect model poisoning attacks¬† 8, the number of clients to remove for multi-Krum is chosen to be 50%percent5050\\%. We also used norm-bounding 9 as a benchmark defense to mitigate the effects of poisoning attacks. This defense is integrated into our differential privacy solution  and was evaluated both in combination with other defenses and as a standalone measure against the attacks. We use a target quantile of 50% of norms to be bound as in . Lastly, we implement FedProx . FedProx is a widely-adopted method targeting to solve the data heterogeneity problem by preventing model drift from client updates. FedProx is implemented to investigate shortcomings and potential issues with such solutions. Experiments with FedProx follow the same protocol suggested in the original paper, which tests the hyper-parameter Œºùúá\\mu from the range of   [ref]5. As mentioned before, fairness and reducing group bias in federated learning is a field not well researched, and existing solutions often use methods that might not be feasible due to privacy and security issues 8. This makes it difficult to find baseline solutions targeted at promoting fairness. FedVal distinguishes itself from other existing methodologies in several crucial aspects. While multi-Krum utilizes outlier detection, FedVal uncovers malicious clients by analysing accumulated loss on a server-side validation dataset, a strategy similar to that employed by LFR. Despite these similarities, FedVal and LFR differ significantly in their operations. LFR relies heavily on pre-existing knowledge of the quantity of malicious nodes, as discussed in Sections 2.5 and A, can result in complications. In contrast, FedVal diverges in its approach by not needing prior knowledge of number of malicious nodes. FedVal leverages analyses performed on the server-side validation set to maintain model balance and identify oscillations across specific labels or dimensions. Unlike norm-bounding, which merely aims to minimize the fallout of an attack, FedVal seeks to eradicate malicious client updates altogether. Furthermore, for heterogeneity issues, it stands apart from FedProx by striving to craft a model that excels by its very design, rather than simply aligning it with the majority client model.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: shortcomings and potential issues with such solutions.
