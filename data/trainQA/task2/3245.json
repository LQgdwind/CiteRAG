      "content": "Paper Title: Automatic Configuration for Optimal Communication Scheduling in DNN Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe layer-wise structure of deep learning training makes it convenient to parallel the communication tasks and computing tasks. The communication scheduling strategies mainly targets at minimizing the network communication time  [ref]36   [ref]19 [ref]39     .\nPoseidon  supports overlapping communication process with backward propagation, reducing bursty network communication.\nP3  attempts to overlap communication with forward propagation by layer partitioning and scheduling on MXNet PS architecture. TicTac [ref]19 proposes a similar idea that reduces the iteration time by calculating the order of transmission. It guarantees near-optimal overlap of communication and computation. It is only implemented on TensorFlow PS. ByteScheduler [ref]39 provides a generic communication scheduler for distributed DNN training. It supports TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MXNet on both Parameter Server and all-reduce architectures. PipeDream [ref]36 also exploits the scheduling on the model parallelism. it proposes to aggressively pipeline mini-batch processing to maximize the utilization of computing resources. However, its coarse-grained partitioning potentially misses optimization opportunities and may fail to scale extremely large layers. TensorExpress  schedules tensor packets in-network using P4 to mitigate network contention and reduce training time. To sum up, there are two main techniques for communication scheduling, namely, tensor partition and priority-based scheduling  [ref]39, which have remarkable effects and thus been widely used. Tensor partitioning.\nDuring the forward propagation, the computation of back layers must wait for the completion of front layers . However, during the communication, tensors of back layers are transmitted first since they finish earlier in the backward propagation . To tackle this mismatching, recent work propose tensor partitioning [ref]39. At its core, a tensor will be divided into smaller chunks if its size is larger than a threshold, i.e, partition size. With the help of tensor partitioning, we are able to switch the transmission from back layers to front layers. The forward propagation can start immediately after receiving the front layers’ tensors. Therefore, the overlap of the communication and computation time is increased and the training time is reduced. Priority-based scheduling.\nAs we mentioned above, forward propagation processes the front layers first, therefore, a straightforward idea is to prioritize the transmission of front layers. With the help of priority-based scheduling, we can set the priority to be the index of the tensor’s layer. Thus these front-layer tensors can be transmitted first and the forward propagation can start earlier, which greatly mitigate the communication overhead. Priority-based scheduling is also proved to be the theoretical optimal [ref]39.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: learning training makes it convenient to parallel the communication tasks and computing tasks.
