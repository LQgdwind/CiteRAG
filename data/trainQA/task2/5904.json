For instance-level prediction, representative approaches often use a bottom-up strategy that groups points to form object proposals   , or first predicts 3D bounding boxes and then refines the object masks using a top-down solution   .\nThough achieving outstanding results on close-set benchmark datasets, they always struggle with open-world recognition. Open-world 3D Understanding.\nOpen-world 3D understanding [ref]43  [ref]7 [ref]24\naims to recognize novel categories that are unseen during training.\nMost recently, the high open-world capability of 2D foundation models    trained on massive multi-modality data has inspired recent approaches to leverage them for 3D open-world understanding.\nOne line of work  4 [ref]24 6 5  focuses on incorporating these 2D foundation models in the inference stage for open-world recognition, which mainly conducts open-world semantic prediction on the image modality using vision-language models    and fuses 2D prediction results into 3D if required. Though promising, they suffer from significant computation and storage overheads during inference and can be sub-optimal to address 3D understanding without learning from 3D geometries. This paper focuses on another open-world research direction that concentrates on open-world point cloud learning. It requires training 3D backbones to enable their open-world capabilities without the image modality dependence during inference and thus have more applicability potential.\nAlong this line of research, some  [ref]24 [ref]43 have attempted to distill 2D dense features   into 3D backbones for 3D feature learning. However, they still incur high training costs and might inherit 2D prediction failure modes.\nIn addition, Ding et al.  [ref]7  obtain point-language paired data through image captioning by VL foundation models for training 3D backbones.\nThese methods are scalable toward a large vocabulary space and can be easily integrated with advanced 3D backbones.\nDespite the advantages, they still suffer from the coarse language supervision.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: top-down solution   .\nThough achieving outstanding results on close-set benchmark datasets, they always struggle with open-world recognition.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
