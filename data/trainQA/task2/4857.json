      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Clustering With Consensus Representations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMost, current DC methods are designed with only a single clustering model in mind, e.g., SpectralNet [ref]7 for spectral clustering, DEC , IDEC , DCN  for kùëòk-means like clustering, VaDe  for Gaussian mixture models, or DeepECT  for hierarchical clustering or ENRC  for non-redundant clustering, see [ref]27 for an overview. SpectralNet is a deep extension of spectral clustering for large data and out-of-sample generalization. DEC minimizes a soft auxiliary target distribution using the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is related to soft kùëòk-means . Improved DEC (IDEC) includes the AE reconstruction loss in the DEC objective to avoid arbitrary clustering results. In contrast to the soft clustering objective of DEC, the DCN algorithm uses hard cluster assignments together with an alternating optimization scheme. It alternates between kùëòk-means clustering and representation update to achieve a kùëòk-means friendly embedding. VaDE combines a Gaussian mixture model prior with a variational autoencoder (VAE)  to learn a deep generative clustering. DeepECT  introduced a deep embedded cluster tree to learn a hierarchical embedding. The ConCURL3 algorithm leverages image augmentation and RPs to learn a cluster ensemble of Softmax predictions to improve the overall clustering performance. A difference between their approach and ours is that they are limited to data that can be augmented, e.g., images or text. Further, they create a kùëòk-means like ensemble by using the Softmax, see 0 for the connection between the Softmax and kùëòk-means. In contrast to that, our DECCS algorithm can be used with a wide range of existing clustering methods and is not limited to kùëòk-means.\nLiu¬†et al.4 proposed the IEC algorithm which embeds multiple clustering results with a marginalized Denoising AE 1 and clusters the learned embedding with kùëòk-means, without considering the original data. Tao¬†et al.5 extended the idea of 4 and proposed the AGAE method. Instead of embedding the clustering results, AGAE uses a consensus graph constructed from the CA matrix of the base partitions as an input to a DC method, which together with the original data produces an enriched embedding. In contrast to our approach, AGAE does not learn a consensus with the neural network but uses initial clusterings to construct a consensus graph as input for their DC algorithm, without updating the graph during training. Importantly and in contrast to ConCURL3 and DECCS, both IEC and AGAE are not jointly updating the consensus clusterings and representation, a key feature of DC [ref]27 to improve cluster performance.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Most, current DC methods are designed with only a single clustering model in mind, e.g., SpectralNet [ref]7 for spectral clustering, DEC , IDEC , DCN  for kùëòk-means like clustering, VaDe  for Gaussian mixture models, or DeepECT  for hierarchical clustering or ENRC  for non-redundant clustering, see\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
