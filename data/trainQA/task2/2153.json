      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring and Distilling Posterior and Prior Knowledge for Radiology Report Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMedical images like radiology and pathology images are widely-used in disease diagnosis and treatment . Given a radiology image, radiologists first examine both the normal and abnormal regions and then use the learned medical knowledge and accumulated working experience to write a coherent report to note down the findings  [ref]10 [ref]20. Given the large volume of radiology images, writing reports become a heavy burden for radiologists. Furthermore, for less experienced radiologists, some abnormalities in radiology images may be ignored and consequently not included in the reports . To relieve radiologists from such heavy workload and remind inexperienced radiologists of abnormalities, automatically generating radiology reports becomes a critical task in clinical practice. In recent years, automatic radiology report generation has attracted extensive research interests 5  0 [ref]14  . Most existing methods, like  2 4 follow the standard image captioning approaches and employ the encoder-decoder framework, e.g., CNN-HRNN  . In the encoding stage, the image features are extracted by CNN from the entire image; In the decoding stage, the whole report is generated by HRNN. However, directly applying image captioning approaches to radiology images has the following problems: 1) Visual data deviation: the appearance of normal images dominate the dataset over that of abnormal images .\nAs a result, this unbalanced visual distribution would distract the model from accurately capturing the features of rare and diverse abnormal regions. 2) Textual data deviation: as shown in Figure 1, in a report, radiologists tend to describe all the items in an image, making the descriptions of normal regions dominate the entire report. Besides, many similar sentences are used to describe the same normal regions. With this unbalanced textual distribution, training with such dataset makes the generation of normal sentences dominant [ref]14 2 4 , disabling the model to describe specific crucial abnormalities. In brief, as shown in Figure 1, the widely-used HRNN  generates some repeated sentences of normalities and fails to depict some rare but important abnormalities. To ensure these rare but important abnormal regions captured and described, the urgent problem is to alleviate such serious data deviation problem   [ref]14 [ref]20 5 . In our work, we propose the Posterior-and-Prior Knowledge Exploring-and-Distilling (PPKED) framework, which imitates the radiologists’ working patterns to alleviate above problems. Given a radiology image, radiologists will examine the abnormal regions and assign the disease topic tags to the abnormal regions; then accurately write a corresponding report based on years of prior medical knowledge and prior working experience accumulations [ref]10  [ref]20. In order to model above working patterns, the PPKED introduces three modules, i.e., Posterior Knowledge Explorer (PoKE), Prior Knowledge Explorer (PrKE) and Multi-domain Knowledge Distiller (MKD). The PoKE could alleviate visual data deviation by extracting the abnormal regions based on the input image; The PrKE could alleviate textual data deviation by encoding the prior knowledge, including the prior radiology reports (i.e., prior working experience) pre-retrieved from the training corpus and the prior medical knowledge graph (i.e., prior medical knowledge), which models the domain-specific prior knowledge structure and is pre-constructed from the training corpus111For conciseness, in this paper, the prior working experience and the prior medical knowledge denote the retrieved radiology reports and the constructed medical knowledge graph, respectively.. Finally, the MKD focuses on distilling the useful knowledge to generate proper reports. As a result, as shown in Figure 1, our PPKED has higher rate of accurately describing the rare and diverse abnormalities. In summary, our main contributions are as follows: In this paper, to alleviate the data bias problem, we propose the Posterior-and-Prior Knowledge Exploring-and-Distilling approach, which includes the Posterior and Prior Knowledge Explorer (PoKE and PrKE), and Multi-domain Knowledge Distiller (MKD). The PoKE explores posterior knowledge by employing the disease topic tags to capture the rare, diverse and important abnormal regions; The PrKE explores prior knowledge from prior working experience and prior medical knowledge; The MKD distills the extracted knowledge to generate reports. The experiments and analyses on the public IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets verify the effectiveness of our approach, which is able to outperform previous state-of-the-art model  on these two datasets. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 and Section 3 introduce the related works and the proposed approach, respectively, followed by the experimental results (see Section 4) and our conclusion (see Section 5).\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: radiologists first examine both the normal and abnormal regions and then use the learned medical knowledge and accumulated working experience to write a coherent report to note down the findings  [ref]10 [ref]20.
