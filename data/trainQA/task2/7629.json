Most MIL methods utilize ImageNet-pretrained ResNet50, and results in Tab. 1 show that this leads to relatively low generation performance. We then turn to CTransPath , which is pre-trained on 30,000 WSIs using contrastive learning strategy. However, Tab. 1 demonstrates only minor increases in the generation performance of baseline models. In contrast, as illustrated in Tab. 1, the baseline models show significant improvement by adopting our DINOv2 ViT-L, and several models such as R2GenCMN could already achieve plausible generation performance. This indicates that our DINOv2 ViT-L significantly outperforms both out-of-domain pretrained and domain-aligned pretrained methods, boosting subsequent tasks such as report generation. \n\n\n\n\nFeature Extractor\nMethods\nMetric\n\nBLEU-1\nBLEU-2\nBLEU-3\nBLEU-4\nMETEOR\nROUGE-L\n\n\n\nResNet50\nShow&Tell [ref]30\n0.249\n0.099\n0.047\n0.025\n0.086\n0.165\n\nUpDownAttn [ref]1\n0.250\n0.115\n0.065\n0.043\n0.096\n0.180\n\nTransformer \n0.249\n0.114\n0.065\n0.042\n0.095\n0.176\n\nM2Transformer [ref]9\n0.250\n0.115\n0.065\n0.042\n0.095\n0.180\n\nR2Gen \n0.240\n0.105\n0.058\n0.036\n0.089\n0.177\n\nR2GenCMN \n0.225\n0.095\n0.047\n0.022\n0.094\n0.151\n\nCTransPath \nShow&Tell [ref]30\n0.262\n0.126\n0.071\n0.043\n0.094\n0.184\n\nUpDownAttn [ref]1\n0.240\n0.139\n0.090\n0.063\n0.100\n0.201\n\nTransformer \n0.271\n0.165\n0.112\n0.082\n0.113\n0.227\n\nM2Transformer [ref]9\n0.259\n0.160\n0.108\n0.076\n0.103\n0.218\n\nR2Gen \n0.237\n0.135\n0.085\n0.054\n0.086\n0.205\n\nR2GenCMN \n0.211\n0.098\n0.054\n0.033\n0.079\n0.158\n\n\n\n\nDINOv2 ViT-L\n\n         (Ours)\n\nShow&Tell [ref]30\n0.189\n0.094\n0.056\n0.039\n0.070\n0.165\n\nUpDownAttn [ref]1\n0.320\n0.206\n0.147\n0.112\n0.131\n0.271\n\nTransformer \n0.382\n0.266\n0.200\n0.157\n0.162\n0.316\n\nM2Transformer [ref]9\n0.321\n0.213\n0.152\n0.112\n0.131\n0.266\n\nR2Gen \n0.274\n0.166\n0.107\n0.071\n0.102\n0.234\n\nR2GenCMN \n0.381\n0.264\n0.199\n0.157\n0.164\n0.313\n\n\nOurs\n0.413\n0.297\n0.229\n0.184\n0.182\n0.344\n\n\n WSI report generation results analysis. For SOTA report generation methods in Tab. 1, Show&Tell [ref]30 and UpDownAttn [ref]1 utilize CNN for image encoding and RNN for language decoding, manifesting lower performance compared to Transformer-based methods such as R2Gen . M2Transformer [ref]9 and R2GenCMN  further improve the performance by aligning encoding and decoding stages.\nHowever, visual token selection methods are needed to apply methods to WSI report generation due to the large sequence length, degrading report generation performance.\nOur proposed method addresses this problem and outperforms these methods by a large margin via efficiently exploring the local and global information inside the patch sequence, interactively aligning the visual and textual context, and effectively utilizing the model’s knowledge and memory from previous iterations. Building upon the DINOv2 ViT-L feature extractor, we compare our method to the aforementioned models. Tab. 1 confirms the superiority of our report generation model over SOTA models, with an average of around 3% improvement observed on all NLG metrics (Qualitative Analysis is shown in Supplementary Materials Fig. 2). Ablation Studies. We conduct additional experiments to determine the effects of our proposed modules.\nTab. 2 illustrates the performance of baseline models, in which Base represents a vanilla transformer with an additional pooling layer to accommodate the long sequence of WSI patches.\nOur findings reveal that progressive stacking of the proposed modules leads to incremental improvements in NLG metrics, indicating that both the LGH and CMC modules play essential roles in boosting WSI report generation.\n \n\n\n\n\nMethods\nMetric\n\nBLEU-1\nBLEU-2\nBLEU-3\nBLEU-4\nMETEOR\nROUGE-L\nAVG.
