      "content": "Paper Title: EEG-based Image Feature Extraction for Visual Classification using Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLSTM  and 1D CNN-based models  generally work well with time-series data including many EEG datasets  [ref]31. However, this typical strategy of using LSTM with EEGs did not yield a high classification accuracy with the EEG-ImageNet dataset. The low performance of the EEG-ImageNet dataset can be attributed to its complexity, as it is one of the most extensive EEG datasets available in terms of containing an unusually high number of classes (39) , thus a harder EEG classification problem. 2D CNNs can extract deep features from data very effectively compared to LSTMs and 1D CNNs. Similarly, EEG signals can be encoded into 2D time-frequency image representations (spectrograms/scaleograms) with methods like STFT and CWT to leverage the deep feature extraction capability of pre-trained CNNs (). However, more resources are required for computation as we need a separate time-frequency map of each of the 128 channels, increasing sample sizes and adding enormous complexity to the data processing. In addition to the complexity, STFT and CWT methods lose feature information when resizing the images produced from the encoding. Hence, the previous studies [ref]6 chose a selected number of channels for each trial instead of all EEG electrodes. On the other hand, our method of encoding the EEG signals to grayscaled image vectors outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods significantly (21%), as seen in Table II. The reason is that we accommodate the two-dimensional feature information from all the 128 channels in a single image by stretching the feature space of each channel instead of compressing it. In a different approach, we consider the six subjects as six separate channels of an image because the CNN can accommodate more than three channels. This strategy reduces the redundancy of the six different readings from the subjects but preserves the essential visual stimulus information (all the subjects are watching the same image). We also observe that the EEG data consisting of all frequencies, i.e., from 5 Hz to 95 Hz, performs better than the dataset filtered with beta and gamma bands, i.e., 14 Hz to 70 Hz when encoded with two-dimensional image representations. This higher performance shows that EEG data has definitive classifying information in alpha frequency and can be helpful when we encode the dataset into deeper dimensions. As per our findings, while resilient for multi-modal fusion, the Regression-based model did not perform with the filtered dataset. Palazzo et al. [ref]17 also evaluated the performance of the regression technique on the same dataset and obtained a similar comparable low accuracy. The high accuracy achieved in earlier studies with regression  was led by some extent of EEG drift, which caused a bias in signals . However, when using features from the mixed data (EEG signals + image data) as inputs, the Concatenation-based Model materialized with reasonable accuracy. Although this modelâ€™s accuracy is marginally reduced compared to the baseline CNN-based Image model, it is noteworthy as our findings aim to develop multi-modal fusion techniques to utilize brain-based visual features in future classification models.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: LSTM  and 1D CNN-based models  generally work well with time-series data including many EEG datasets  [ref]31.
