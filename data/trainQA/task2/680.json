      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamic Defense Against Byzantine Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMachine learning is highly susceptible to adversarial attacks , and the vast majority of the defensive approaches are based on three approaches : \n\n(1) game theory , \n(2) data sanitation  and \n(3) resilient and robust learning models, which assume that a fraction of the training data may be manipulated and consider it as outliers [ref]28.\n Due to the federated aggregation operator is agnostic in relation with adversarial clients information, the first approach can not be applied in FL. Likewise, since the training data in FL is inaccessible by the server, the second approach is also not feasible in FL. Therefore, the most promising defense approach is developing resilient and robust federated aggregation operators with the ability to safeguard the model from the effect of attacks. According to [ref]29, there are two types of adversarial attacks in FL: \n\n(1) Inference attacks, which aim at inferring information from the training data; and \n(2) poisoning attacks, which pursue to compromise the global learning model. \n Concerning inference attacks, there are different types of them depending on the information being inferred. The most important ones are the property and membership inference attacks, which respectively seek to infer certain properties of the data and the membership of specific samples in the training set. Because of their nature, the defenses proposed in the literature are based on applications derived from or inspired by the Differential Privacy . Regarding poisoning attacks, we identify two taxonomies: Depending on which part of the FL model is attacked, we differentiate between model-poisoning [ref]33 and data-poisoning attacks . In practice, both are almost equivalent, since a poisoning of the data results in a poisoned model. However, data-poisoning attacks and some of the model-poisoning attacks fail to be effective since the attack dissipates in the aggregation of many clients. Hence, these attacks are combined with model-replacement  techniques, which boosts the adversarial model (or models) in order to replace the global model. Depending on the purpose of the attack, we distinguish between untargeted or byzantine attacks , which seek to affect the model’s performance, and targeted or backdoor attacks , which aim at injecting a secondary or backdoor task into the global model by stealth.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: approaches : \n\n(1) game theory , \n(2) data sanitation  and \n(3) resilient and robust learning models, which assume that a fraction of the training data may be manipulated and consider it as outliers [ref]28.\n Due to the federated aggregation operator is agnostic in relation with adversarial clients information, the first approach can not be applied in FL.
