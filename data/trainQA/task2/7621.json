      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Rematch Mismatched Pairs for Robust Cross-Modal Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nApproaches for cross-modal retrieval aim to retrieve relevant items across different modalities for the query data. Current dominant methods project different modalities into a shared embedding space to measure the similarity of cross-modal pairs, which generally follow two research lines: 1) Global Alignment focuses on learning the correspondence between whole cross-modal data. Existing studies usually propose a two-stream network to learn comparable global features [ref]13  . 2) Local Alignment. It seeks to align the fine-grained regions for more precise cross-modal matching. For example,  employ the cross-attention mechanism to fully excavate the semantic region-word alignments.   explore the intra-modal relation to facilitate inter-modal alignments. Although these prior arts have achieved promising results, their success mainly relies on well-matched data, which is extremely expensive and even impossible to collect. To satisfy a more practical retrieval that is robust against the PMPs,  [ref]35  divide the mismatched pairs from training data and estimate a soft correspondence to downweight their training contribution. Recently, [ref]21 resorts to complementary contrastive learning that only utilizes the negative information to avoid overfitting. However, these methods neglect the usage of either the negative information  [ref]35  or the positive one [ref]21. To fully leverage the training data, this paper proposes an OT-based method to rematch those partially mismatched pairs.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: research lines: 1) Global Alignment focuses on learning the correspondence between whole cross-modal data.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
