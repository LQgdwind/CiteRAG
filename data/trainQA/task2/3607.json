Element-wisely, it can be represented as The size of cores, rk,k=1,⋯,Kformulae-sequencesubscript𝑟𝑘𝑘1⋯𝐾r_{k},k=1,\\cdots,K, denoted by a vector [r1,⋯,rK]subscript𝑟1⋯subscript𝑟𝐾[r_{1},\\cdots,r_{K}], is called TR rank. TR decomposition can be divided into three states, i.e., supercritical (dk<rk​rk+1subscript𝑑𝑘subscript𝑟𝑘subscript𝑟𝑘1d_{k}<r_{k}r_{k+1}), critical (dk=rk​rk+1subscript𝑑𝑘subscript𝑟𝑘subscript𝑟𝑘1d_{k}=r_{k}r_{k+1}), and subcritical (dk>rk​rk+1subscript𝑑𝑘subscript𝑟𝑘subscript𝑟𝑘1d_{k}>r_{k}r_{k+1}) states [ref]41. Previous work  has also experimentally found this fact in some real-world tensor data in the sense that letting rk​rk+1>dksubscript𝑟𝑘subscript𝑟𝑘1subscript𝑑𝑘r_{k}r_{k+1}>d_{k} to achieve more favorable recovery performance. Tensor data with TR supercritical or critical states is full-Tucker-rank. Proof of Lemma 1 is a part of proof of Lemma 3, it can be found in Appendix I of supplementary material. According to Lemma 1, incomplete tensor with TR supercritical or critical states may not be recovered by Tucker rank minimization-based methods, since it is a full-Tucker-rank approximation problem. Next, we give three tensor-matrix unfolding schemes, and show their relationship with tensor ranks. The multi-index operation is given by where ik∈[dk],k∈[K]formulae-sequencesubscript𝑖𝑘delimited-[]subscript𝑑𝑘𝑘delimited-[]𝐾i_{k}\\in[d_{k}],k\\in[K].

Therefore, the complex tensor rank minimization problem can be equivalently reduced to a series of matrix rank minimization subproblems. According to Remark 2, to minimize TR rank, a natural option is to consider the sum of rank of unfolding matrices: However, problem (6) is computational intractable in general. Motivated by the proxy of rank function, the sum of nuclear norm has been adopted as a convex surrogate of (6), and revealed in the following definition. Let 𝓣𝓣\\bm{\\mathscr{{T}}} be a tensor with TR rank [r1,⋯,rK]subscript𝑟1⋯subscript𝑟𝐾[r_{1},\\cdots,r_{K}], then its TRNN is given by: where αk∈ subscript𝛼𝑘01\\alpha_{k}\\in  and ∑k=1Kαk=1superscriptsubscript𝑘1𝐾subscript𝛼𝑘1\\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\alpha_{k}=1 corresponds to the weight of mode-(k,s)𝑘𝑠(k,s) unfolding. TRNN is defined by the sum of nuclear norm on circular mode-(k,s)𝑘𝑠(k,s) unfolding matrices, which is similar with Tucker nuclear norm (TcNN)  and tensor train nuclear norm (TTNN) .\nTcNN always minimizes the nuclear norm on multiple fat matrices due to its one versus the others unfolding (see Definition 3), while the unfolding matrices of TTNN are usually fat or thin matrices when k𝑘k approaches to one or K𝐾K (see Definition 4).\nInstead, by simply setting s=⌈K/2⌉𝑠𝐾2s=\\lceil K/2\\rceil, TRNN is defined on a series of square matrices.\nInterestingly, minimizing nuclear norm on these square matrices often tends to obtain exact recovery guarantee with small number of observations in LRMC problem , since it is easier to achieve rank​(𝐓)≪d1∧d2much-less-thanrank𝐓subscript𝑑1subscript𝑑2\\text{rank}(\\bm{\\mathbf{T}})\\ll d_{1}\\wedge d_{2} than the fat or thin matrices with d1∧d2≪d1∨d2much-less-thansubscript𝑑1subscript𝑑2subscript𝑑1subscript𝑑2d_{1}\\wedge d_{2}\\ll d_{1}\\vee d_{2}.\nAdditionally, according to Lemma 1, incomplete tensor with TR supercritical state and TR critical state may not be recovered via TcNN. However, TRNN can avoid such issue, since the number of column and row of the circular unfolding matrix is of order 𝒪​(d⌈K/2⌉)𝒪superscript𝑑𝐾2\\mathcal{O}(d^{\\lceil K/2\\rceil}) and 𝒪​(d⌊K/2⌋)𝒪superscript𝑑𝐾2\\mathcal{O}(d^{\\lfloor K/2\\rfloor}), respectively, while the rank is merely of order 𝒪​(r2)𝒪superscript𝑟2\\mathcal{O}(r^{2}), indicating the sufficient low-rank structure in circular unfolding matrix. Moreover, due to the square unfolding on each order, the weights αk,k∈[K]subscript𝛼𝑘𝑘delimited-[]𝐾\\alpha_{k},k\\in[K] of TRNN can be simply set to 1/K1𝐾1/K rather than carefully adjusting the optimal value as TcNN and TTNN.\n\n Next, we give the dual norm of TRNN in the following Lemma, which will play a significant role in statistical analysis of the proposed estimator. The dual norm of TRNN is defined by where 𝓨ksuperscript𝓨𝑘\\bm{\\mathscr{{Y}}}^{k} denotes the k𝑘kth latent component. The proof of the Lemma 2 is given in Appendix B of supplementary material.
