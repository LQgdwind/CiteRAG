      "content": "Paper Title: LLMs and the Future of Chip Design: Unveiling Security Risks and Building Trust\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe promising code generation ability of LLMs led researchers to investigate the potential for Verilog RTL generation, aiming to relieve the burden of manual design efforts. However, there are challenges due to the limited hardware-related knowledge with existing pretrained LLMs.\nTo address these challenges, researchers proposed various prompting-based and FT-based frameworks.333Recall that prompting-based frameworks iteratively guide pretrained models with external knowledge to deal with\nlimited training datasets and avoid further training, whereas FT-based frameworks address the challenge directly and\nbuild training datasets to\nfine-tune pretrained LLMs. 1a) Prompting-based Frameworks: Chip-Chat  interacts with conversational generative pretrained transformer (GPT)-4 with prompts, alongside experienced engineers, to collaboratively design an 8-bit accumulator-based microprocessor. This work shows the possibility of going from design specifications to a functional implementation with minimal effort, but it lacks verification and modern security features. ChipGPT [ref]39 interacts with GPT-3.5 through prompts and finalizes a design considering its functional correctness and Power/Performance/Area (PPA) optimization.\nThis method is tested on simple designs,\ndemonstrating improvements in area and correctness of the generated simple design. Further enhancing the quality of generated designs, RTLLM  covers three objectives: syntax, functionality, and design quality.\nIt evaluates the capability of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in generating\nRTL codes for these objectives and then improves performance by requiring LLMs to provide reasoning steps and syntax error checking in initial prompts. AutoChip  utilizes a feedback loop to integrate with generated Verilog compilation and simulation results for more accurate code generation without human intervention. Although the\niterative feedback improves the success rate, it cannot handle larger designs due to prompting limitations. 1b) Fine-tuning-based Frameworks:\nDAVE [ref]26 fine-tunes GPT-2 with a dataset of English-task-and-Verilog-result pairs for deriving Verilog snippets from English. VeriGen  fine-tunes the CodeGen-16B  LLM using compiled Verilog datasets sourced from GitHub and textbooks in an unsupervised manner.\nIts generated Verilog codes still contain functional errors, requiring designers to debug and refine them. For instance,\nVeriGen\non complex RTLLM  benchmarks underperforms compared to GPT-3.5 . VerilogEval  further fine-tunes VeriGen\nwith synthetic description-and-code pairs, demonstrating improved performance.\nIt open-sources two synthetic benchmark datasets, called VerilogEval-machine and VerilogEval-human. However, it ignores downstream task performance. RTLCoder  provides various instruction-and-Verilog pairs to fine-tune a LLM based on code quality feedback.\nIt utilizes quantized parameters with minimal loss of accuracy, allowing it to serve as a local assistant for engineers.\nHowever, it underperforms compared to GPT-4 on RTLLM  and encounters functionality errors on complex designs.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: This work shows the possibility of going from design specifications to a functional implementation with minimal effort, but it lacks verification and modern security features.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
