      "content": "Paper Title: On the Privacy Risks of Algorithmic Recourse\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlgorithmic Recourse.\nSeveral approaches have been proposed in literature to provide recourse to individuals who have been negatively impacted by model predictions  [ref]18              7.\nThese approaches can be broadly categorized based on :\ntype of the underlying predictive model (e.g., tree vs. differentiable classifier), type of access they require to the underlying predictive model (e.g., black box vs. gradient access), whether they encourage sparsity in counterfactuals (i.e., only a small number of features should be changed), whether counterfactuals should lie on the data manifold, whether the underlying causal relationships should be accounted for when generating counterfactuals, and whether the output produced by the method should be multiple diverse counterfactuals or a single counterfactual. Recent research also highlighted and addressed various challenges pertaining to the robustness  5  \nand fairness  \nof algorithmic recourse.\nHowever, none of the aforementioned works explore the privacy risks associated with algorithmic recourse which is the focus of our work.\n Privacy Attacks for ML Models.\nThere is a long line of prior work developing privacy attacks on machine learning models 1 3 2  .\nOne class of attacks called membership inference attacks focus on determining if a given instance is present in the training data of a particular model 3 2  .\nThese attacks typically exploit the differences in the distribution of model confidence on the true label (or the loss) between the instances that are in the training set and those that are not. For example, Shokri et al. 3 proposed a loss-based membership inference attack which determines if an instance is in the training set by testing if the loss of the model for that instance is less than a specific threshold. Other membership inference attacks are also predominantly loss-based attacks where the calibration of the threshold varies from one proposed attack to the other 2  . Some works leverage additional information beyond loss functions to do membership inference attacks. For instance,  leverages adversarial examples to orchestrate membership inference attacks.\nWhile there exist similarities between adversarial examples and recourses output by SCFE , the recourses output by other SOTA methods such as CCHVAE  and GS [ref]18 are quite different from adversarial examples and their framework does not apply to algorithmic recourse broadly. Intersections between Privacy and Explainability. The intersection between privacy and explainability, which is the focus of our work, is relatively under explored. Recently, Shokri et al. 4 developed a membership inference attack against a variety of feature attribution based explanation methods (e.g., LIME 0, SHAP , Gradient-based methods 9 6). Their attack exploits the intuition that the higher the variance of the feature attribution corresponding to an instance, the more uncertain the corresponding prediction (i.e., higher model loss), and therefore the less likely it is that the instance belongs to the training set. Furthermore, Aïvodji et al.  developed a model extraction attack against counterfactual explanation methods. Their attack leverages model predictions and counterfactual explanations (output in case of unfavorable predictions) corresponding to a set of instances, and learns a proxy model that mimics the behavior of the model under attack as closely as possible. None of these works develop membership inference attacks against counterfactual explanation (algorithmic recourse) methods which is the main theme of our work.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: Algorithmic Recourse.\nSeveral approaches have been proposed in literature to provide recourse to individuals who have been negatively impacted by model predictions  [ref]18              7.\nThese approaches can be broadly categorized based on :\ntype of the underlying predictive model (e.g., tree vs. differentiable classifier), type of access they require to the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
