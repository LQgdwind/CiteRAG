Similar to¬†, several approaches consider end-to-end training¬†[ref]34 [ref]36, however they frequently necessitate enormous computation and memory resources and suffer from inexact relaxations¬†[ref]34 [ref]36 or training instabilities caused by unrolling numerous iterations¬† . Other strategies¬†[ref]48  lessen the difficulty of optimization by emphasizing short-term behavior, requiring a single training step on the distilled data to match that on the real data. Nevertheless, errors may accrue during evaluation, when the distilled data is used in multiple steps. To address the difficulties of error accumulation in single training step matching algorithms¬†[ref]48 , Cazenavette et al.¬† propose to match segments of the parameter trajectories trained on synthetic data with long-range training trajectory segments of networks trained on the real datasets. However, the error accumulation of the parameters in particular segments is still inevitable. Instead, our strategy further mitigates the accumulated trajectory errors with the guidance of a flat teacher trajectory inspired by the heuristic of Sharpness-aware Minimization. The geometry of the loss landscape.\nMinimizing the spectrum of the Hessian matrix ‚àáŒ∏2fŒ∏subscriptsuperscript‚àá2ùúÉsubscriptùëìùúÉ\\nabla^{2}_{\\theta}f_{\\theta} as in Equation¬†12 is an difficult and expensive task. Fortunately, a series of sharpness-aware minimization methods¬†1 0  have been proposed to perform the task implicitly with low cost for improved generalization. It has been argued in many studies¬†7  8  that the spectrum of the Hessian matrix constitutes a good characterization of the geometry of the loss landscape (sharpness), which then translates to having a strong relationship to the generalization abilities¬†   of the network. We leverage the approaches from¬†1  to efficiently optimizing the spectrum of the Hessian matrix to minimize the accumulated trajectory error in this work.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: by¬† aims to obtain a new, synthetic dataset that is much reduced in size which also performs almost as well as the original dataset.
