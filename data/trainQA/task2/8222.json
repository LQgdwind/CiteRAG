      "content": "Paper Title: HG2P: Hippocampus-inspired High-reward Graph and Model-Free Q-Gradient Penalty for Path Planning and Motion Control\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor most offline RL algorithms, experience replay has been the fundamental component, where previously collected experiences are reused to improve sample efficiency. Naturally, the construction and utilization (sampling) strategies of the replay buffer are critical factors influencing sample efficiency. Model-based RL methods learn dynamics models directly from historical data and then predict upcoming states. However, in order to learn such dynamics models, model-based RL methods often take orders of magnitudes more data. Episodic RL methods propose to use high-return episodic memory to improve sample efficiency. Specifically, in a near-deterministic environment, an agent can use episodic memory to record experiences and later imitate sequences of actions that yield high rewards. The episodic strategy is in part inspired by the human brain, where the hippocampus and related medial temporal lobe structures play an integral role in episodic memory encoding and processing. Previous works on episodic RL used tabular-like representation to memorize past experience and retrieved the highly-rewarding sequences through context-based lookup [ref]3 . Furthermore, recent theoretical work  argued that both model-free and model-based control systems should be considered together for better sample efficiency. Because, in the working mechanism of the human brain, two particular controllers complement each other: one associated with the hippocampus and model-based learning, and the other with the ventral striatum and dopamine. Therefore, in related literature , both model-free RL and episodic RL methods were leveraged to provide an inference target and a memory target for the agent. However, these studies merely utilized a tabular-like memory to store original data or episodic trajectories, without considering the association between past experiences. Several extensions   have been proposed to fully exploit the information in episodic memory by reconstructing memory graphs. The concept of associative memory was introduced in the form of a directed graph, where each visited state was encoded as a node attributed with a state-action value . Since the same states may appear in multiple trajectories, these nodes will contribute to connecting different trajectories and facilitating inter-episode value propagation. In the end, similar to previous work , researchers used the graph-based state-action value as a memory target for the agent . Another work introduced a similar concept termed \"engram\". The framework abstracted key nodes from the memory graph, utilized a shortest-path search algorithm to get valuable paths, and prioritized updating these nodes within the reconstructed paths. Our work differs from episodic RL methods, which often succeed under the strong assumption of a near-deterministic environment with a fixed goal. In contrast, our objective is to address more complex tasks that involve varying goals. Another related line of work is about trajectory-wise sampling. From the perspective of instance-based decision theory, the performance of the target policy is anchored on the performance of the behavior policy that collects interaction data. Therefore, anchoring in a high-performing dataset favors the performance of the target policy; otherwise, it may hinder the performance. Imitation learning methods, such as decision transformers  [ref]9, tend to perform behavior cloning on only trajectories with higher cumulative rewards, ordered by episode returns. However, these studies use a simplistic approach by discarding low-return episodic experiences. The most closely related prior work to our method is that of Hong et al. [ref]13, which employs trajectory-wise reweighting to fully exploit rare high-performing data. However, from an application perspective, Hong et al. [ref]13 use weighted sampling strategies to update policies, whereas our work focuses on identifying key states through high-return sampling to reconstruct the memory graph.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: memory encoding and processing.
