      "content": "Paper Title: Asymptotic Convergence and Performance of Multi-Agent Q-learning Dynamics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnderstanding the behaviour of multi-agent learning systems has been a hallmark problem of game theory and online\nlearning. The requirement is that agents must explore potentially sub-optimal decisions whilst interacting with\nother agents to ultimately maximise their long-term reward. In contrast to online learning with a single agent,\nthis poses a fundamentally non-stationary problem, in which convergence to an equilibrium is not always\nguaranteed. In fact, recent work has consistently found that, when learning on games, agents may present a wide array of\nbehaviours. This includes cycles   , and even chaos    [ref]7 [ref]8. Furthermore, the equilibria of\na game need not be unique, so even if convergence is guaranteed, it may be to one of many (or even a continuum) of\nequilibria. Thus, predicting the behaviour of online learning in games with many players becomes a particularly\nchallenging problem. Yet it remains an important problem to solve. Recent advances in machine learning require training multiple neural\nnetworks for applications to generative models [ref]9 0. In order for such applications to be\nrealised, it is required that that training provably converges to an equilibrium. Of equal importance is that this\nequilibrium be unique, so that the outcome remains consistent regardless of initial conditions.\nA unique equilibrium guarantees not only the reproducibility of the system, but also ensures that desired behaviours will persist, even if the system is perturbed from its desired state.\nSimilarly, the most complex tasks often require the interaction of multiple autonomous agents 1. This again\nrequires that agents are able to reliably equilibrate their behaviour. There is a strong, and ongoing, effort in the research community to understand these learning behaviours, with\npositive convergence results being found in an assortment of game structures. For instance, games with two players\nand two actions are well understood 2 3 4. Beyond this, some of the most\nwidely studied games are potential games, in which agents collaborate to maximise a shared global function, and\nzero sum games (and its network variants), in which agents are in competition. Indeed, it has been found that a\nnumber of learning algorithms, including Fictitious Play 5, Q-Learning 6 7 , Replicator Dynamics 8 9 0 all converge to equilibria (though not always unique) in potential\ngames 1 2. In zero sum games, the former two converge to a unique fixed\npoint 3 4, whereas the latter is known to cycle, always maintaining its distance\nfrom the equilibrium . Outside of this class of games, however, the story becomes much more complicated. A wide array of results show\nlearning algorithms may be chaotic in even the simplest games . Such complex behaviours become even\nmore pronounced as the number of agents in the game increases [ref]7. However, they are also\ninfluenced by the structure of the game and the parameters of the learning algorithm 5. This dichotomy between the range of possible learning behaviours and the convergence\nrequirement of the applications motivate our central question: Are there learning dynamics such that convergence to a unique equilibrium is guaranteed in any game?\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: is not always\nguaranteed. In fact, recent work has consistently found that, when learning on games, agents may present a wide array of\nbehaviours. This includes cycles   , and even chaos    [ref]7 [ref]8. Furthermore, the equilibria of\na game need not be unique, so even if convergence is guaranteed, it may be to one of many (or even a continuum) of\nequilibria.
