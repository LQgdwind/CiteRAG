      "content": "Paper Title: S-HR-VQVAE: Sequential Hierarchical Residual Learning Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder for Video Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSequence learning focuses on the development of algorithms for the analysis of sequential data found in a wide variety of domains including, computer vision, natural language processing, speech processing, and bioinformatics  [ref]2.\nSequence learning algorithms typically operate on input sequences that consist of a series of discrete or continuous observations, such as letters, words, video frames, and audio samples.\nThe goal of sequence learning algorithms is to learn patterns and relationships within the sequential data that can be used to make predictions about future unseen data. 111This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication. Copyright may be transferred without notice, after which this version may no longer be accessible.\nThis may involve modeling the probability distribution of the sequential data, identifying common subsequences or motifs, and learning to predict the next observation in the sequence.\nSequence learning for video prediction refers to future video frame anticipation given a set of preceding frames .\nThis is a challenging task because it requires the algorithm to learn complex spatiotemporal relationships within the video. The video prediction task poses four main challenges related to (i) spatiotemporal modeling, (ii) high dimensionality, (iii) blurry predictions, and (iv) physical characteristics.\nThe spatiotemporal modeling challenge is concerned with capturing spatiotemporal dependencies in sequences of video frames, which is related to humans’ ability to understand their surrounding physical world and is related to accurate modeling of videos .\nHigh dimensionality is intrinsic to video patterns, and high-dimensional patterns pose the problem referred to as the curse of dimensionality in function approximation and optimization .\nBlurry predictions are caused by the properties of many statistical models that tend to produce fuzzier outputs when predicting future events that are inherently affected by higher uncertainty.\nThe challenge of physical characteristics refers to the properties and attributes of the objects (e.g., shape, size, color) and scenes (e.g., lighting conditions) captured in a video that may affect the prediction task.\nIf modeled properly, those characteristics may be easier to predict in future frames. This paper proposes a sequential hierarchical residual learning vector quantized variational autoencoder (S-HR-VQVAE) for the task of video prediction with the goal of addressing the abovementioned challenges.\nIn particular, S-HR-VQVAE implements major extensions to two non-time sequential algorithms: 1) Our recent work on hierarchical residual learning vector quantized variational autoencoder for image reconstruction and generation, HR-VQVAE  and 2) An autoregressive generative model that captures the distribution of dependencies between image pixels, PixelCNN  . In particular, the proposed S-HR-VQVAE technique consists of three steps. In the first step, the input video frames are encoded to a continuous latent space and then mapped to discrete representations through the hierarchical vector quantization encoder of HR-VQVAE, with each latent vector assigned to a codeword in a codebook.\nThe key property of this model is the strict hierarchy imposed between codebooks belonging to different layers in the model, producing extremely compact and efficient discrete representations.\nIn the second step, in order to predict the latent representations of future frames, we propose a spatiotemporal PixelCNN (ST-PixelCNN) where the distribution of the discrete representation for a particular location in the current frame is conditioned on the representations for neighboring locations both in space and time.\nIn the third step, the predicted discrete representation is used by the decoder of HR-VQVAE to generate the corresponding video frame. Our contributions can be summarized as follows. A novel model is proposed to address the video prediction task, namely S-HR-VQVAE, that has the property of capturing different levels of abstraction in a sequence of video frames. Higher layers capture the context; whereas lower layers focus on the details.\nThis model is a significant extension of previously proposed methods such as HR-VQVAE and PixelCNN, as will be detailed in the method section.\nLeveraging hierarchical VQ within the VAE framework , S-HR-VQVAE is able to better contrast the blurring phenomenon encountered in video prediction, e.g., , while better handling the high-dimensionality issue. Furthermore, by combing HR-VQVAE properties discussed in  with the newly introduced ST-PixelCNN, S-HR-VQVAE well captures spatiotemporal dependencies and physical characteristics. Finally, S-HR-VQVAE also owns the property of significantly reducing the time required for training and inference. A thorough and systematic experimental validation of the contributions of S-HR-VQVAE is presented while providing an extensive account and comparison with state-of-the-art in video prediction techniques over two video sequence prediction tasks, namely the Moving-MNIST task 0, and the KTH Human Action task 1. A novel loss function to jointly train the HR-VQVAE and the ST-PixelCNN is introduced, which is experimentally proven to boost S-HR-VQVAE over the Moving-MNIST, and KTH Human Action tasks, and across several metrics. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.\nSection 2 presents the related works, grouped accordingly to the four aforementioned challenges.\nSection 3 gives the key concepts necessary to introduce our technique.\nThe proposed method is described in Section 4. The experimental setup and related results are discussed in Sections 5, and 6, respectively. Section 7 discusses some key properties of the proposed technique. Section 8 concludes the present work.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: the development of algorithms for the analysis of sequential data found in a wide variety of domains including, computer vision, natural language processing, speech processing, and bioinformatics  [ref]2.\nSequence learning algorithms typically operate on input sequences that consist of a series of discrete or continuous observations, such as letters, words, video frames, and audio samples.\nThe\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
