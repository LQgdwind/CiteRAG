      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Dynamic Belief Graphs to Generalize on Text-Based Games\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe graph updater discussed in the previous section defines a key component of GATA that enables the model to maintain a structured belief graph based on text observations.\nThe second key component of GATA is the action selector, which uses the belief graph 𝒢tsubscript𝒢𝑡\\mathcal{G}_{t} and the text observation Otsubscript𝑂𝑡O_{t} at each time-step to select an action.\nAs shown in Figure 2, the action selector consists of four main components:\nthe text encoder and graph encoder convert text inputs and graph inputs, respectively, into hidden representations; a representation aggregator fuses the two representations using an attention mechanism; and a scorer ranks all candidate actions based on the aggregated representations. ∙∙\\bullet Graph Encoder: \nGATA’s belief graphs, which estimate the true game state, are multi-relational by design. Therefore, we use relational graph convolutional networks (R-GCNs) [ref]32 to encode the belief graphs from the updater into vector representations.\nWe also adapt the R-GCN model to use embeddings of the available relation labels, so that we can capture semantic correspondences among relations (e.g., east_of and west_of are reciprocal relations).\nWe do so by learning a vector representation for each relation in the vocabulary that we condition on the word embeddings of the relation’s name. We concatenate the resulting vector with the standard node embeddings during R-GCN’s message passing phase.\nOur R-GCN implementation uses basis regularization [ref]32 and highway connections  between layers for faster convergence.\nDetails are given in Appendix A.1. ∙∙\\bullet Text Encoder: \nWe adopt a transformer encoder [ref]43 to convert text inputs from Otsubscript𝑂𝑡O_{t} and At−1subscript𝐴𝑡1A_{t-1} into contextual vector representations.\nDetails are provided in Appendix A.2. ∙∙\\bullet Representation Aggregator: \nTo combine the text and graph representations, GATA uses a bi-directional attention-based aggregator [ref]49 .\nAttention from text to graph enables the agent to focus more on nodes that are currently observable, which are generally more relevant;\nattention from nodes to text enables the agent to focus more on tokens that appear in the graph, which are therefore connected with the player in certain relations.\nDetails are provided in Appendix A.3. ∙∙\\bullet Scorer: \nThe scorer consists of a self-attention layer cascaded with an MLP layer.\nFirst, the self-attention layer reinforces the dependency of every token-token pair and node-node pair in the aggregated representations.\nThe resulting vectors are concatenated with the representations of action candidates Ctsubscript𝐶𝑡C_{t} (from the text encoder), after which the MLP generates a single scalar for every action candidate as a score.\nDetails are provided in Appendix A.4. Training the Action Selector:\nWe use Q-learning  to optimize the action selector on reward signals from the training games.\nSpecifically, we use Double DQN  combined with multi-step learning  and prioritized experience replay .\nTo enable GATA to scale and generalize to multiple games, we adapt standard deep\nQ-Learning by sampling a new game from the set of training games to collect an episode.\nConsequently, the replay buffer contains transitions from episodes of different games.\nWe provide further details on this training procedure in Appendix E.2.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: ∙∙\\bullet Graph Encoder: \nGATA’s belief graphs, which estimate the true game state, are multi-relational by design.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
