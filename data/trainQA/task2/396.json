      "content": "Paper Title: Manthan: A Data Driven Approach for Boolean Function SynthesisThe open source tool is available at https://github.com/meelgroup/manthan\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGiven an existentially quantified Boolean formula ∃Y​F​(X,Y)𝑌𝐹𝑋𝑌\\exists YF(X,Y) over the set of variables X𝑋X and Y𝑌Y, the problem of Boolean functional synthesis is to compute a vector of Boolean functions, denoted by Ψ​(X)=⟨ψ1​(X),ψ2​(X),…,ψ|Y|​(X)⟩Ψ𝑋subscript𝜓1𝑋subscript𝜓2𝑋…subscript𝜓𝑌𝑋\\Psi(X)=\\langle\\psi_{1}(X),\\psi_{2}(X),\\ldots,\\psi_{|Y|}(X)\\rangle, and referred to as Skolem function vector, such that ∃Y​F​(X,Y)≡F​(X,Ψ​(X))𝑌𝐹𝑋𝑌𝐹𝑋Ψ𝑋\\exists YF(X,Y)\\equiv F(X,\\Psi(X)). In the context of applications, the sets X𝑋X and Y𝑌Y are viewed as inputs and outputs, and the formula F​(X,Y)𝐹𝑋𝑌F(X,Y) is viewed as a functional specification capturing the relationship between X𝑋X and Y𝑌Y, while the Skolem function vector Ψ​(X)Ψ𝑋\\Psi(X) allows one to determine the value of Y𝑌Y for the given X𝑋X by evaluating ΨΨ\\Psi. The study of Boolean functional synthesis traces back to Boole , and over the decades, the problem has found applications in a wide variety of domains such as certified QBF solving    , automated program repair [ref]26, program synthesis , and cryptography . Theoretical investigations have demonstrated that there exist instances where Boolean functional synthesis takes super-polynomial time. On the other hand, practical applicability has necessitated the development of algorithms with progressively impressive scaling.\nThe algorithmic progress for Boolean functional synthesis has been driven by a diverse set of techniques: (i) the usage of incremental determinization employing the several heuristics in state-of-the-art Conflict Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) solvers , (ii) usage of decomposition techniques employing the progress in knowledge compilation    , and (iii) Counter-Example Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR)-based techniques relying on usage of SAT solvers as black boxes [ref]4   . While the state of the art techniques are capable of handling problems of complexity beyond the capability of tools a decade ago, the design of scalable algorithms capable of handling industrial problems remains the holy grail. In this work, we take a step towards the above goal by proposing a novel approach, called 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan}, at the intersection of machine learning, constrained sampling, and automated reasoning. Motivated by the unprecedented advances in machine learning, we view the problem of functional synthesis through the lens of multi-class classification aided by the generation of the data via constrained sampling and employ automated reasoning to certify and refine the learned functions. To this end, the architecture of 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan} comprises of the following three novel techniques: The state of the art machine learning techniques use training data represented as a set of samples where each sample consists of valuations to features and the corresponding label. In our context, we treat X𝑋X as the features and Y𝑌Y as labels. Unlike the standard setup of machine learning wherein for each assignment to X𝑋X, there is a unique label, i.e. assignment to Y𝑌Y, the relationship between X𝑋X and Y𝑌Y is captured by a relation and not necessarily a function. To this end, we design a weighted sampling strategy to generate a representative data set that can be fitted using a compactly sized classifier. The weighted sampling strategy, implemented using state of the constrained sampler, seeks to uniformly sample input variables (X𝑋X) while biasing the valuations of output variables towards a particular value. Given training data viewed as a valuation of features (X) and their corresponding labels (Y), a natural approach from machine learning perspective would be to perform multi-class classification to obtain Y=h​(X)𝑌ℎ𝑋Y=h(X), where hℎh is a symbolic representation of the learned classifier. Such an approach, however, can not ensure that hℎh can be expressed as a vector of Boolean functions. To this end, we design a dependency aware classifier to construct a vector of decision trees corresponding to each Yisubscript𝑌𝑖Y_{i}, wherein each decision tree is expressed as a Boolean function. Since machine learning techniques often produce good but inexact approximations, we augment our method with automated reasoning techniques to verify the correctness of decision tree-based candidate Skolem functions. To this end, we perform a counterexample driven refinement approach for candidate Skolem functions. To fully utilize the impressive test accuracy attained by machine learning models, we design a proof-guided refinement approach that seeks to identify and apply minor repairs to the candidate functions, in an iterative manner, until we converge to a provably correct Skolem function vector. In a departure from prior approaches utilizing the Shannon expansion and self-substitution, we first use a MaxSAT solver to determine potential repair candidates, and employ unsatisfiability cores obtained from the infeasibility proofs capturing the reason for current candidate functions to meet the specification, to construct a good repair. Finally, We perform an extensive evaluation over a diverse set of benchmarks with state-of-the-art tools, viz. C2Syn[ref]4, BFSS, and CADET. Of 609 benchmarks, 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan} is able to solve 356356356 benchmarks while C2Syn, BFSS, and CADET solve 206206206, 247247247, and 280280280 benchmarks respectively. Significantly, 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan} can solve 606060 benchmarks beyond the reach of all the other existing tools extending the reach of functional synthesis tools. We then perform an extensive empirical evaluation to understand the impact of different design choices on the performance of 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan}. Our study reveals several surprising observations arising from the inter-play of machine learning and automated reasoning. 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan} owes its runtime performance to recent advances in machine learning, constrained sampling, and automated reasoning. Encouraged by 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan}’s scalability, we will seek to extend the above approach to related problem domains such as automated program synthesis, program repair, and reactive synthesis. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: We first introduce notations and preliminaries in Section 2. We then discuss the related work in Section 3. In Section 4 we present an overview of 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan} and give an algorithmic description in Section  5. We then describe the experimental methodology and discuss results in Section 6. Finally, we conclude in Section 7.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: Boolean functional synthesis traces back to Boole , and over the decades, the problem has found applications in a wide variety of domains such as certified QBF solving    , automated program repair [ref]26, program synthesis , and cryptography .
