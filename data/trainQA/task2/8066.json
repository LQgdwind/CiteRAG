      "content": "Paper Title: GeneticPrism: Multifaceted Visualization of Scientific Impact Evolutions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisualizing scientific impact evolution involves understanding and presenting a scholar’s contributions over time and examining how topics, authors, and scientific trends develop and impact their fields. A list of related works and comparisons is shown in Table I. Topic-based visualization is crucial as it allows for identifying and tracking thematic developments. The related works can be classified into three categories: visual factor analysis for career development, ego-centric scholar visualization, and citation pattern visualization. Method Topic-based Temporal Career analysis Domain insight Impact evolution Visual Technique Year Visual factor analysis includes works that analyze and visualize multiple factors influencing academic careers. ACSeeker  explores potential factors of academic success across different career stages. ImpactVis  uses a matrix form to visualize individual careers and domain trends. Vis Author Profiles  combines text and visualization for insights into individual and domain impacts. ScholarPlot [ref]35 and Pathway  use scatter plots and area charts to depict career trajectories. These works lack detailed topic-based or domain-specific analysis. Ego-centric scholar visualization focuses on a single scholar’s academic impact and collaboration network. EgoSlider  uses a timeline-based visualization for evolutionary collaboration networks. EgoLines  employs a “subway map” metaphor for temporal dynamics. Reitz  uses a scholar’s ego-centric node-link diagram for temporal distributions of joint works. MENA  represents ego-centric networks as dynamic graphs in small multiples. Fung et al.  suggest a botanically inspired tree visualization summarizing collaborations over time. Episogram  presents a novel visualization tool for summarizing egocentric social interactions, enabling users to explore and compare social behaviors over time. This class of works focuses on the collaboration of scholars but not on broader impact evolutions. Citation pattern visualization highlights citation patterns and the influence of individual scholars. Eiffel  applies triple summarizations and uses a dynamic flow map for hierarchical and temporal changes of a paper’s citation influence. CiteRivers  employs a streamgraph for temporal trends in domain-specific impacts. VEGAS  employs visual influence graph summarization to enable the exploration of highly influential papers. The Nature journal  offers galaxy and light cone views for co-citation networks. VOSviewer  uses density and network visualizations for citation analysis. PubExplorer  employs citation pattern analysis and science maps to explore research trends and collaborations. These methods highlight citation patterns but may lack detailed temporal and topic-based insights. GeneticFlow (GF)   introduces methods for constructing graph-based scholar profiles, illustrating academic trajectories and scholarly impact. This structured representation of a scholar’s scientific development emphasizes the evolution of research topics. Still, it does not work well for top scholars with abundant publications and citation influence. Additionally, its intrusive topic modeling, which assigns only one topic per paper, reduces the possibility of understanding domain insight in complex, multi-topic scenarios. Despite their contributions, current approaches to visualizing scientific impact evolution face scalability issues and challenges in visualizing overlapping topics. In comparison, GeneticPrism distinguishes itself by integrating topic-based, temporal, individual career, and domain-specific visualizations using a combination of node-link graphs, chord diagrams, streamgraphs, and flow maps, providing a holistic solution of scientific impact visualization across various dimensions.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: ImpactVis  uses a matrix form to visualize individual careers and domain trends.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
