      "content": "Paper Title: A Hybrid Convolutional Neural Network with Meta Feature Learning for Abnormality Detection in Wireless Capsule Endoscopy Images\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDetection of pathology through vision-based CAD systems has been in place for quite some time. Early works on WCE video analysis were based on conventional ML methods that utilized color and texture based handcrafted features for the classification of WCE abnormalities. Local binary pattern (LBP), color histogram, , statistical features like mean, standard deviation, skew, and energy  were extensively used by researchers for WCE image classification. These methods were primarily designed for specific type of anomalies like bleeding, polyp, and ulcers. In recent years, CNNs have been quite effective in automatic extraction of generic features in WCE images. One of the first works on WCE image classification using a CNN can be found in Jia et al.. They have used a 5-layer CNN for feature extraction and bleeding detection in WCE images. Since then, several CNN architectures have been proposed for different types of abnormality detection [ref]14. Segui et al.  have used the Hessian and Laplacian of images along with the original RGB inputs to learn the features of WCE images using three parallel CNNs. Then the three CNNâ€™s features are fused and passed on to fully connected layers for image classification. Iakovidis et al.  have also employed a 5-layer CNN for anomaly detection and localization. The feature maps are utilized for the identification of salient points that may fall in the anomalous regions by using deep saliency detection and iterative cluster unification algorithms. Goel et al.  have employed a two branch CNN, one as backbone network, and the other with resolution preserving dilated Conv operation. The backbone CNN extracts multiple features at different scales. The dilated Conv branch increases receptive field and helps in the extraction of dominant features. Finally, the features of backbone CNN and the dilated CNN are fused to fetch the global dominant features . Transfer learning approaches are commonly applied to train CNNs when the training data is limited. This situation is quite relevant to the existing WCE datasets and researchers have suggested the use of pretrained CNN architectures like AlexNet, GoogLeNet, ResNet, VGG16, etc. for the classification of WCE images . Caroppo et al.  have contemplated the technique for feature extraction from intermediate layers of pretrained ResNet50, VGG16, and InceptionV3 models. The features were concatenated and optimized with the maximum relevance-minimum redundancy algorithm on which ML classifiers were trained to identify the bleeding images. Lan et al.  have also suggested the use of a pretrained VGG-16 network with region proposals to classify and localize abnormalities. Rustam et al.  have exploited MobileNet architecture in a custom-built CNN, for the classification of bleeding frames. These research articles signify the efficiency of deep transfer learning in the classification and localization tasks in WCE images. Size, shape, and texture of abnormal regions in WCE images vary in different types of abnormalities. In some images, an abnormal region could be very small in size. Further, the color and texture of an abnormality in some cases may be similar to that of a normal region. Figure 1 shows these variations for different abnormalities like polyp, vascular, and inflammatory legions. In some cases, features of normal regions may dominate those of tiny abnormal regions. To deal with these challenges, attention-guided CNNs have been used by researchers. Xing et al.[ref]7 have suggested a novel two stage attention mechanism for zooming into abnormal regions that helps in detecting small abnormalities present in images. Jain et al.  have used squeeze-and-excitation blocks in a CNN for the identification of anomalies that attained higher accuracy. To deal with intra-class variations, Yuan et al.  have introduced an image similarity constraint in the loss function to train a DenseNet for polyp identification in WCE images. A densely connected CNN with unbalanced discriminant loss and category sensitive loss was suggested by Yuan et al. , that helped in low intra-class variation and high inter-class variations. Guo et al. [ref]24 have made a triple ANET architecture with angular contrastive loss with an attention mechanism to minimize intra-class variance for polyp detection. Methods available in the literature have mostly dealt with intra-class variation with a single type of abnormality. To deal with different types of anomalies while classifying them as abnormal, special mechanism needs to be designed that can capture the inherent characteristics of these abnormalities. Harnessing the power of different types of Conv operations, a parallel CNN architecture is proposed in the present paper that employs a novel meta-feature extraction technique to distinguish between a wide range of abnormalities using the statistical patterns hidden in the feature maps. These meta-features when clubbed with the conventional feature maps resulted in an improved performance of the classifier. In the next section, details of the proposed CNN model are presented.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: al..
