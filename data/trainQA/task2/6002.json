      "content": "Paper Title: CP-CNN: Core-Periphery Principle Guided Convolutional Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConvolutional neural networks (CNNs) have greatly reshaped the paradigm of image processing with impressive performances rivaling human experts in the past decade  [ref]2 . Though with a biologically plausible inspiration from the cat visual cortex , the evolution and success of CNNs can be largely attributed to the design of network architecture, i.e., the wiring pattern of neural network and the operation type of network nodes. Early CNNs such as AlexNet [ref]5 and VGG [ref]6 adopted a chain-like wiring pattern where the output of the preceding layer is the input of the next layer. Inception CNNs employ an Inception module that concatenates multiple branching pathways with different operations  . ResNets propose a wiring pattern x+F‚Äã(x)ùë•ùêπùë•x+F(x) aiming to learn a residual mapping that enables much deeper networks, and have been widely adapted for many scenarios such as medical imaging with superior performance and generalizability . Orthogonally, depthwise separable convolution operation greatly reduces the number of parameters and enables extremely deeper CNNs 0. Recent studies also suggest that CNNs can benefit from adopting convolution operation with large kernels (e.g., 7√ó7777\\times 7) 1 2 with comparable performance with Swin Transformer 3. By combining dilated convolution operation and large convolution kernel, a CNN-based architecture can achieve state-of-the-art in some visual tasks 4. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) advances this trend by jointly optimizing the wiring pattern and the operation to perform. Basically, NAS methods sample from a series of possible architectures and operations through various optimization methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) 5, evolutionary methods 6, gradient-based methods 7, weight-sharing 8, and random search 9. Despite its effectiveness, NAS does not offer a general principle for network architecture design. The outcome of NAS for each run is a neural network instance for a specific task, which may not be generalized to other tasks. For example, an optimal network architecture for natural image classification may not be optimal for X-ray image classification. Hence, some studies explored the design space of neural architectures  and investigated the general design principles that can be applied to various scenarios. Recently, a group of studies suggested that artificial neural networks (ANNs) and biological neural networks (BNNs) may share common principles in optimizing the network architecture. For example, the property of small-world in brain structural and functional networks are recognized and extensively studied in the literature   . In , the neural networks based on Watts-Strogatz (WS) random graphs with small-world properties yield competitive performances compared with hand-designed and NAS-optimized models. Through quantitative post-hoc analysis,  found that the graph structure of top-performing ANNs such as CNNs and multilayer perceptron (MLP) is similar to those of real BNNs such as the network in macaque cortex.  synchronized the activation of ANNs and BNNs and found that ANNs with higher performance are similar to BNNs in terms of visual representation activation. Together, these studies suggest the potential of taking advantage of prior knowledge from brain science to guide the architecture design of neural networks. Motivated by these aspects, we explore a brain-inspired Core-Periphery (CP) principle for guiding the architecture design of CNNs. Core-Periphery organization is well-recognized in structural and functional brain networks of humans and other mammals  , which boosts the efficiency of information segregation, transmission and integration. We illustrate the concept of Core-Periphery network organization in Figure¬†1. Core-core node pairs have the strongest connection in comparison to core-periphery node pairs (moderate) and periphery-periphery node pairs (the lowest). We design a novel core-periphery graph generator according to this property and introduce a novel core-periphery principle guided CNN (CP-CNN). CP-CNN follows a typical hierarchical scheme of CNNs (e.g., ResNet¬†) which consists of a convolutional stem and four consecutive blocks. For each block, we abandon the traditional chain-like wiring pattern but adopt a directed acyclic computational graph which is mapped from the generated core-periphery graph where each node corresponds to an operation such as convolution. In addition, we sparsify the convolution operation in a channel-wise manner and enforce it to follow a core-periphery graph constraint. The proposed CP-CNN is evaluated on CIFAR-10 dataset and two medical imaging datasets (INBreast, NCT-CRC). The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the CP-CNN, as well as its superior performance over state-of-the-art CNN and ViT-based methods. The main contributions of our work are summarized as follows: We proposed a novel brain-inspired CP-CNN model which follows a core-periphery design principle and outperforms the state-of-the-art CNN and ViT baselines. We proposed a core-periphery graph-constrained convolution operation, which reduces the complexity of the model and improves its performances. Our work paves the road for future brain-inspired AI to leverage the prior knowledge from the human brain to inspire the neural network design.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have greatly reshaped the paradigm of image processing with impressive performances rivaling human experts in the past decade  [ref]2 .
