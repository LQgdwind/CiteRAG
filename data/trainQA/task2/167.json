      "content": "Paper Title: Cognitively-Inspired Model for Incremental Learning Using a Few Examples\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Keras deep learning framework¬† was used to implement all of the neural network models. For Caltech-101 and CUBS-200-2011 datasets, the ResNet-18¬†[ref]18 model pre-trained on the ImageNet¬†[ref]44 dataset was used and for CIFAR-100 the ResNet-34¬†[ref]18 model pre-trained on ImageNet was used for feature extraction. These model architectures are consistent with¬† for a fair comparison. For the experiment with the CIFAR-100 dataset the model was allowed to store up to K=7500ùêæ7500K=7500 centroids requiring 3.87 MB versus 84 MB for an extra ResNet-34 teacher model as in¬†. Furthermore, compared to methods that store only 2000 images for previous classes¬†[ref]39  , 7500 centroids for our approach require less memory (3.87 MB) than 2000 complete images (17.6 MB). For Caltech-101 K=1100ùêæ1100K=1100 centroids were stored (0.5676 MB versus 45 MB for a ResNet-18 teacher model as in¬†) and for CUBS-200-2011 K=800ùêæ800K=800 centroids were stored (0.4128 MB). As mentioned in Section 1, none of the prior incremental learning techniques are suitable for FSIL because they require a large amount of training data per class. Hence, we compare CBCL against a few-shot learning baseline (FLB). FLB uses the features from the pre-trained ResNet neural network which are passed on to a linear layer which is trained with softmax loss (Figure 3). This procedure follows prior work on few-shot learning research , which indicates that FLB is better than many other few-shot learning techniques that use a deeper backbone, such as ResNet-18 or ResNet-34. Since FLB is not suitable for few-shot incremental learning, we train the final linear layer of FLB with softmax loss using the complete training set of all the new and old class data in each increment. In other words, FLB does not learn incrementally. FLB was trained for 25 epochs in each increment using a fixed learning rate of 0.001 and cross-entropy loss with minibatches of size 8 optimized using stochastic gradient descent. For CBCL, for each batch of new classes, the hyper-parameters Dùê∑D (distance threshold) and nùëõn (number of closest centroids used for classification) are tuned using cross-validation. We only use the previously learned centroids and the training data of the new classes for hyper-parameter tuning.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: The Keras deep learning framework¬† was used to implement all of the neural network models.
