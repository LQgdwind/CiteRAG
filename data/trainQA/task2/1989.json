      "content": "Paper Title: Node Selection Toward Faster Convergence for Federated Learning on Non-IID Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSome existing works on FL focus on the communication cost reduction, with the aim of directly reducing communication cost on the wireless link, where typical methods range from important-based updating , , model quantization , and analog aggregation . In particular, Wang et al.  proposed identifying the irrelevant update at the node side caused by different data distribution. Communication cost is reduced by excluding irrelevant updates from local nodes. Similarly, authors in  introduced a concept, namely important gradient, where communication reduction is achieved by sending the gradient with a larger magnitude. Different from  , Seide et al.  proposed 1-bit stochastic gradient descent to reduce model transfer data size and achieved 10×\\times speed up in speech applications. Zhu et al.  proposed to utilize analog aggregation rather than digital aggregation. By exploiting the waveform-superposition property of a multi-access channel, model transmission and aggregation are realized over wireless links simultaneously. Another series of studies concentrate on the algorithmic perspective via handling the inherent non-i.i.d. data distribution across participating nodes, aiming to reduce communication rounds in FL. These studies include adaptive tuning local training , weighting design for model aggregation , and node selection strategies  [ref]19  [ref]21 [ref]22   . The algorithm FedProx by Li et al.  uses a regularization term to balance the optimizing discrepancy between the global and local objectives, and allowing participating nodes to perform a variable number of local updates, to consequently overcome the non-i.i.d. data distribution and resource heterogeneity. Authors in  exhibited a contribution-related weighting design, namely FedAdp to boost FL convergence rate in the presence of nodes with non-i.i.d. data samples, which assigns distinguished weights for participating nodes according to the correlation between local objective and global objective revealed by gradient information. In general, to avoid long-tail waiting time in synchronous aggregation protocol, FL algorithm randomly selects a subset of nodes (i.e., partial node participation) in each round to participate in local training (e.g., FedAvg , FedProx , CMFL ). Compared with DML, candidate nodes in FL are more heterogeneous with regard to computation/communication capability, wireless connection, and data quality. Therefore, a carefully designed node selection is beneficial for performance improvement. Several works are carried out focusing on node selection design to improve the FL convergence rate, taking the system heterogeneity and uncertainty of wireless medium into consideration  [ref]19 [ref]21 [ref]22 .\nSpecifically, Nishio et al.  proposed to select nodes intentionally based on the resource condition on nodes. Amiria et al. [ref]19 designed a node scheduling algorithm by considering the significance of local update measured by ℓ​2ℓ2\\ell 2-norm and channel condition separately or jointly. For example, in BN2 algorithm [ref]19, the server first selects a macro set of nodes to participate in local training. Then a subset of the macro set is finally chosen for model aggregation by ordering the norm of gradient transmitted from nodes of the macro set. In , the authors proposed biased client selection strategies, that is, preferentially choosing the node with higher local loss. Though the contribution-related loss measurement leads to a faster convergence, the selection skewness imposes potential error, and the local loss measurement results in additional communication and computation cost. Differently, references [ref]21 [ref]22    focus on probabilistic node selection strategy where each node is eligible to contribute to the global model. In particular, Chen et al. [ref]21 considered the limited bandwidth resource for model transmission where node selection for global model aggregation is of importance. The proposed method measures the node contribution according to the norm of local updates, by which the probability for each node to be selected is calculated so as to execute the node selection procedure. The nodes with higher norm of local updates are chosen with higher probability, thus boosting the convergence rate when limited bandwidth resource is provided. Along with [ref]21, authors in [ref]22 proposed to use Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as a predictor to estimate the model updates of nodes that are not allocated the bandwidth for transmission, based on the model updates that are successfully transmitted using limited bandwidth resource. The additionally included model updates further accelerate the model convergence. Authors in  proposed a probabilistic design by considering the importance of local update and transmission latency, where the importance of local update is evaluated by gradient divergence between local gradients and the ground truth global gradient. The probability for node selection is finally determined by the local gradient norm and transmission latency. Chen et al.  designed an importance sampling scheme that selects more informative nodes. The node sampling procedure minimizes the variance of local gradients for aggregation, while the probability for each node to be chosen is proportional to the norm of local updates. In addition, authors in  applied importance sampling for node selection on the server level and data selection on the node level. Similar to , the optimal node selection is achieved by minimizing the bound on the variance of gradient noise, i.e., the estimation error of the global gradient because of the partial node participation. The probability for each node to be chosen is proportional to the norm of its local updates. None of the aforementioned node selection designs analyzed the impact of data heterogeneity on node selection. Given the heterogeneous training samples across nodes, the magnitude of local gradient norm is deficient in reflecting the contribution from each of those nodes, which is empirically shown in Section V-D, since local gradients may not align with the global gradient.\nIn contrast to the above research, our work in this paper builds on the data heterogeneity perspective and designs a probabilistic model to choose participating nodes. The proposed method scrutinizes the relationship between local gradients and the global gradient so as to adjust the probability for each node to be selected, which is different from the criteria (i.e., the norm of local gradient/update) adopted in [ref]19 [ref]21 [ref]22   . Since FedAvg algorithm may struggle to converge on non-i.i.d. data, it is not trivial to profile the distribution of data samples across nodes. Upon identifying the contribution difference of nodes, it is profitable to accelerate model convergence by choosing nodes tendentiously, as compared with random selection. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section III provides the preliminary and implementation of federated learning and the challenge of non-i.i.d. data on FL. In Section IV, the convergence analysis, the proposed aggregation scheme and probabilistic node selection, and complexity analysis are presented. Experimental results are shown in Section V, and the conclusion is presented in Section VI.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: participating nodes, aiming to reduce communication rounds in FL.
