      "content": "Paper Title: Point Cloud Based Reinforcement Learning for Sim-to-Real and Partial Observability in Visual Navigation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe true potential of RL lies in the applications it can solve in the real world. Consequently, a considerable amount of research has been dedicated into making RL work in real scenarios. Current RL methods require an vast amount of environment interactions to learn high-performance policies, so most successful implementations rely on first training the policy on simulated environments and then using several techniques to transfer these policies to the real world. Some strategies consist on adapting the policy to the real-world (e.g., retraining parts of the policy  and meta-RL ), considering domain-randomization [ref]7 during training,\nand attempting to match the training/test observations or embeddings (e.g., using segmented images , projecting real-world observations to the ones used in simulations [ref]4, , , and using photo-realistic simulators [ref]4, [ref]5). One of the cases with the best results in terms of sim-to-real is the case of navigation tasks using range lasers , since geometry and observations are similar between simulation and reality. However, these approaches usually use lasers as feature vectors  and are only valid for tasks in which the 2D observations are enough. Following the idea of using depth sensors for a seamless transfer, the use of depth cameras is logical and have been used in several works [ref]5, . However, the nature of these sensors differs greatly from the real ones (e.g., reflections, invalid values, etc.), and if the simulated robot is not completely matched to the real one, the approach is prone to fail. To prevent this phenomenon, up to the finest details of the real robot and its sensors are attempted to be replicated in simulations. Following this line, recent simulators aim for photo-realism by reconstructing real environments [ref]5, [ref]4, . Authors suggest that by training agents in these environments, a successful sim-to-real transfer can be obtained, and give as a partial proof that this approach attains good results on the related sim-to-sim  problem (training on one simulator and then evaluating on another one). However, same as in non-photorealistic simulators, when the simulated robot presents changes between training and evaluation (robot-to-robot transfer), its performance is strongly affected. This incapacity to generalize among robots can be addressed using techniques like domain randomization [ref]7, but such approaches do not constitute a definitive answer, as the overall performance is still reduced. We show evidence of these phenomena in Section IV, where we also show how our method is transferable among robots, indicating its suitability for the sim-to-real problem.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: to transfer these policies to the real world.
