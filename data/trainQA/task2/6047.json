      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring the Mutual Influence between Self-Supervised Single-Frame and Multi-Frame Depth Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSingle-frame depth estimation refers to inferring the corresponding pixel-wise depth from a single image, which is an ill-posed problem because there are an infinite number of possible 3D scenes that can correspond to the same image. Early single-frame depth estimation studies [ref]14 [ref]4 focused on supervised methods, which suffer from collecting ground truth depth. To avoid the heavy work of collecting labels, Garg et al.  proposed the first self-supervised single-frame depth estimation model supervised by view synthesis loss from rectified stereo image pairs. Zhou et al. [ref]6 extended the self-supervised stereo training into a more general form, i.e., self-supervised monocular training, which jointly estimates depth and poses to form view synthesis loss only using unlabeled monocular videos. Monodepth2  further improved the training loss to alleviate the problems caused by occlusions and stationary pixels and provided a strong baseline for the following works including our method. Following , more powerful or efficient network architectures   and more effective data augmentation strategies  have been proposed to improve single-frame depth. In addition, other tasks such as flow estimation , bird’s-eye-view scene layout estimation , and semantic segmentation   were introduced to provide extra information for single-frame depth estimation. Furthermore, some works   attempted to use knowledge distillation to improve the results of depth estimation, and we will review these works in Section II-C.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: depth from a single image, which is an ill-posed problem because there are an infinite number of possible 3D scenes that can correspond to the same image.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
