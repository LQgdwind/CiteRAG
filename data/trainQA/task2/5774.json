      "content": "Paper Title: Assessor-Guided Learning for Continual Environments\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRegularization-based method designs a regularization term preventing important parameters of old tasks from deviations. Important parameters of old tasks are estimated and an important parameter matrix is integrated in the regularization term. Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) [ref]1 adopts the Fisher information matrix (FIM) to estimate the importance of network synapses. Synaptic intelligence (SI)  utilizes an accumulated gradient to quantify the significance of network parameters and incurs less expensive computation than FIM. An alternative is offered by memory aware synapses using an unsupervised and online approach . Learning without forgetting (LWF)  applies the knowledge distillation approach making sure that current network outputs are close to previous network outputs. An online version of EWC is put forward in  where the parameter importance is approximated with the Laplace approximation. It is found that the regularization mechanism is better performed in the neuron level than the synaptic level because of the hierarchical nature of neural networks . That is, the regularization step is achieved by controlling the learning rates of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method. Similar approach is adopted in  but it considers the common information of each task enabling a node to be shared by different tasks. This strategy is capable of scaling up the regularization-based method for large-scale problems. Another approach to scale the regularization-based approach is done with the classifier’s projection . This approach induces wide local optimum regions, i.e., overlapping region. The regularization-based approach depends on the task IDs and task boundaries, thus performing poorly for the class-incremental learning problems. Structure-based approach is pioneered by progressive neural networks  where new network components are added to deal with new tasks while freezing old network parameters to handle the catastrophic forgetting problem. The complexity of this approach grows as the increase of learning task. An error-based network growing method is put forward in . It utilizes a selective-based retraining approach to handle the catastrophic forgetting problem. Learn-to-grow approach is developed in [ref]16 where neural architecture search (NAS) is integrated to obtain the best network configuration of new tasks while isolating old network parameters. The same concept is implemented for graph continual learning in . The Bayesian approach is incorporated in . The idea is akin to [ref]16 but the Bayesian approach is adopted instead of NAS to find the best network structure. These approaches are computationally prohibitive and calls for the presence of tasks IDs and task’s boundaries. [ref]19 0 offer a data-driven structural learning approach for unsupervised continual learning where the bias-variance decomposition is put forward to grow or prune the network structure. The catastrophic forgetting problem is dealt with the centroid-based experience replay mechanism [ref]19 or the knowledge-distillation approach 0. Although it is free of the task IDs and task boundaries for learning and predicting, the data-driven structural learning technique does not guarantee an optimal structure. Memory-based approach replays old samples stored in the memory when learning new tasks. iCaRL  utilizes the exemplar set of each class where the classification step is performed via the nearest-mean strategy. GEM  and A-GEM 1 store past examples to determine the forgetting case used to constrain the model update. HAL 2 puts forward the concept of anchor points optimized to maximize the forgetting case via a bilevel optimization approach. Prediction should not change to these anchor points when learning new tasks. DER  combines the concept of knowledge distillation and experience replay. 3 proposes the concept of knowledge amalgamation as a post-processing approach of class-incremental continual learning. These methods suffer from the class imbalanced problem since the size of memory buffer is much less than new samples. AGLA presents an extension of the memory-based approach where a sequence-aware assessor is deployed to guide the learning process of the base model. The assessor not only regulates the influence of every sample such that only positive samples are learned but also selects a suitable learning strategy of a given sample where the interaction of loss functions is controlled in a seamless manner. The class imbalanced issue is tackled with the COS method handling out of distributions of augmented samples.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: of old tasks from deviations.
