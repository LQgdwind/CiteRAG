      "content": "Paper Title: Untangling Dense Non-Planar Knots by Learning Manipulation Features and Recovery Policies\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRobot manipulation of 1D deformable objects, such as cables, ropes, and wires, can facilitate automation of tasks in industrial, surgical, and household settings [ref]9. Such manipulation tasks include organization of cables [ref]7 , hoses , suture thread , and wires used in automotive and other electronic assembly , as well as reducing clutter and preventing injury in surgical, manufacturing, and home environments .\nAs robots automate more tasks involving 1D deformable objects, which we refer to as “cables,” they will increasingly confront highly complex knots, either because the task itself requires knot untangling or because untangling cables is a prerequisite for a downstream task. Prior work has explored untangling manipulation plans consisting of high-level manipulation primitives (e.g., pick and pull points) 8 [ref]19 [ref]7, but robots often face challenges when attempting to execute these plans in physical manipulation tasks, due to the complexity of dynamics modeling and perception in real-world settings. This motivates the need for a low-level controller which can mitigate the gap between high-level planning and physical execution. This is relevant to any task involving untangling or arrangement of cables where sensing grasping precision or recovering from manipulation failures is critical. We propose a low-level controller consisting of two algorithms that jointly improve the robustness of robot untangling. Untangling cables is a challenging task due to the infinite-dimensional configuration space, self-occlusions, and visual homogeneity of cables. These properties complicate the problems of both generating untangling manipulation plans and executing these plans effectively, especially in densely knotted configurations. Prior work for cable manipulation has primarily explored manipulation planning methods that learn full state information 8 [ref]19 or task-specific features [ref]7. These methods then execute planned actions through a sequence of analytical, hand-engineered motion primitives, which can be brittle and imprecise under increasing knot complexity and density due to layered self-occlusions, friction at cable intersections, and the need for precision in grasping. Most prior work considers cable configurations that have sufficiently wide space between self-intersections for a gripper jaw to fit or that have only two cable segments at each self-intersection. These manipulation challenges are exacerbated for non-planar configurations, where configuration complexity increases to intersections with three or more segments. Grannen et al. [ref]7 propose HULK, a high-level vision-based planner for untangling of cables in semi-planar configurations, where self-intersections involve at most two segments of cable. In this work, we extend HULK with two novel algorithms for non-planar knots. The first algorithm, LOKI (Local Oriented Knot Inspection), learns manipulation features to generate high-precision grasping actions. LOKI refines the cable grasp location and orientation from a coarse keypoint by recentering and learning to grasp orthogonally to the cable’s axis, as illustrated in Figure 1. The second algorithm, SPiDERMan (Sensing Progress in Dense Entanglements for Recovery Manipulation) detects and recovers from 4 common failure modes: (1) consecutive poor action executions, (2) exceeding a maximum threshold of untangling actions, (3) the cable leaving the reachable workspace, and (4) the robot gripper jaws becoming wedged between two segments of dense cable.\nUnlike prior work which focuses on high precision for failure avoidance 2 , SPiDERMan acknowledges the likelihood of failures in real-world settings and plans recovery actions. We perform physical untangling experiments with cables in dense, non-planar configurations more complex than the semiplanar arrangements considered in prior work and find that the combination of HULK, LOKI, and SPiDERMan achieves 50% higher success rates\nin comparison to analytical controllers.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: Robot manipulation of 1D deformable objects, such as cables, ropes, and wires, can facilitate automation of tasks in industrial, surgical, and household settings [ref]9.
