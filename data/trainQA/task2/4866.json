      "content": "Paper Title: Censored Deep Reinforcement Patrolling with Information Criterion for Monitoring Large Water Resources using Autonomous Surface Vehicles\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe utilization of ASVs is an increasingly common option for autonomous operation in hydrological resources and harbors       . Applications range from bathymetry surveys , pollutant modeling and monitoring , or patrolling for early warning . In most applications, Artificial Intelligence or metaheuristic optimization techniques are usually applied to solve complex NP-hard problems: Bayesian optimization , genetic algorithms (GA) , Swarm Intelligence , or DRL . For the acquisition of a surrogated model of the environment, in  Bayesian Optimization is used to obtain a model of Lake Ypacaraí itself with a single ASV using Gaussian Processes (GP). In that work, the suitability of different kernels for GP and novel acquisition functions to meet the vehicle battery constraints is deepened. Along the same lines, in  the algorithm is extended to a multivariate case, where there are different objective functions to fit. Both approaches seek to minimize the regression error by choosing the next point to sample using an acquisition function that balances the exploration/exploitation through uncertainty and GP averaging. However, it does not take into account possible temporal changes of the benchmark functions under monitoring. Moreover, our proposal attempts to find an intensive coverage with a higher number of samples and is not particularly tied to any particular regression method. In  the use of aerial vehicles with a camera for environmental characterization is also proposed. This work uses the CEM-ES evolutionary algorithm to minimize entropy in a Kalman Filter model for adaptive modeling. Our work also makes use of the entropic criterion as an indicator of the information obtained, but with a smaller data regime and, again, with an application for temporal patrolling. A similar criterion is used in , where the entropy leverages the remained information. Nonetheless, the approach is seen to be problematic when surveying convex scenarios, and its performance is surpassed by other heuristics. In our approach, we present solid results of the utility of the presented algorithm, and, again, an extension to temporal patrolling, which is not addressed in . Regarding the use of DRL for modeling, in  it can be found the use of Proximal Policy Optimization with CNNs to minimize the mean square error (MSE) of an objective function with multiple vehicles. This aforementioned work demonstrates that it is possible to find effective multiagent policies with DRL for monitoring. In , a similar approach was presented, but for gas leaks localization. This approach used a differential model of the gases to provide a sufficiently accurate model for the deep agent to learn. Our approach, on the contrary, works in a full model-free fashion respect to the information, as it is sometimes hard when not impossible to model the behavior of WQ parameters in such big resources. An example of maximizing the area covered in water resource monitoring can be found in [ref]4. This approach is based on solving a Travel Salesman Problem (TSP) using Eulerian cycles to maximize the unvisited area using a single vehicle with GA. This approach only uses edge-to-edge movements and is limited by the formulation of visitable nodes. Our algorithm proposes to overcome this method by allowing movements in different directions at each instant. Moreover, the information coverage is no longer based on an all-or-nothing basis, but follows the information criterion imposed by the RBF function. Another example of full coverage algorithms is in , where a DRL algorithm for a transformable mobile robot with discrete actions is applied. In this work, the algorithm called Actor-Critic with Experience Replay (ACER) and a visual formulation of the state with CNNs are used in the same way as in our proposal. However, the application again consists of a binary coverage (covered/uncovered regions) with no temporal criterion or useful redundancy factors in the coverage. Regarding the particular use of DRL for path planning of vehicles, most of the works focus on simply finding obstacle-free routes  or low-level control . In , the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (T3D) algorithm is implemented for obtaining optimal obstacle avoidance policies for aerial vehicles with distance sensors. In , the DRL is applied in obtaining a low-level tracking policy for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) using visual inputs from a camera. By the means of the TinyYOLO architecture, an convolutional obstacle detection system, the AUV is able to track the desired paths without collisions. Another interesting application of DRL in vehicles can be found in [ref]25, where a DRL policy is optimized to solve the vehicle routing and navigation task in an interactive and self-adapting manner. The difference in the sense of obstacle-avoidance between such approaches and ours is that the proposed censoring mechanism implies a simplification. The navigation map is known a priori, and the obstacles are observable. Then, the decisions related to the information acquisition are surrogated to the detection mechanism and therefore. With regard to patrolling and surveillance tasks, there are previous coverage applications   that use DRL with a visual formulation of the state. In , the use of DQL is proposed for the realization of partial coverage routes based on a battery budget with vehicle landing constraints. Our work differs in the sense of the resolution and the state-action domain, which is significantly bigger in our case. The work  is more similar to a low resolution task like . In , an interesting example of nonhomogeneous temporal patrolling can be found, where emphasis is put on going over the most important areas with longer waiting time, in a similar way, but with a discrete redundancy criterion. The proposed work differs from  in the presence of nonnavigable zones. There is also a difference in the acquisition system. Whereas in  a camera is in charge of sensing, the proposed approach uses point samples and generates a model in between. In this work, we propose a framework based on DRL and information theory, which, as far as the authors are aware, fills the following research gaps: i) most applications of DRL in vehicles are limited to low-level control or path planning, with results similar to classical algorithms. This work proposes a way to optimize more complex problems, such as entropy minimization for environmental monitoring, with a visual formulation of the process. ii) The proposed framework is able to simultaneously deal with obstacles while minimizing uncertainty, and is useful when information varies temporally or in the presence of outliers.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: as it is sometimes hard when not impossible to model the behavior of WQ parameters in such big resources.
