      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Relation-Specific Representations for Few-shot Knowledge Graph Completion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA knowledge graph (KG) is essentially a multi-relational network composed of a large number of facts.\nEach fact is organized as a triple (h, r, t): (head entity, relation, tail entity), e.g., (China, CountryCapital, Beijing), indicating that Beijing is the capital of China.\nToday, large scale KGs like YAGO , NELL , and Wikidata  have been widely applied in various downstream applications, such as question & answering , semantic search , and information extraction [ref]6. Although typical KGs are large in size, they are always incomplete since the limited texts used to construct KGs cannot cover all the facts.\nTo solve this problem, researchers have proposed the KG completion task,\nwhich aims to infer new triples by exploring latent semantics of entities and relations in existing triples.\nOver the past decade, knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has\nproven to be a powerful technique for the KG completion task [ref]6  [ref]8.\nThese KGE-based methods typically represent each entity and each relation in KGs as a low-dimensional vector and measure the plausibility of triples based on their semantic representations.\nDespite their success, existing KGE-based models always require sufficient training triples for both entities and relations.\nHowever,\nreal-world KGs contain a large proportion of relations having only a limited number of triples.\nRelations with a few triples are called few-shot relations.\nFor instance, about 10% of relations in Wikidata  have no more than 10 triples [ref]9.\nIn addition,\nfor many practical applications such as social media and recommendation systems, KGs are always dynamically updated over time, and just a few triples are temporarily available for newly added relations.\nConsequently, the performance of KGE-based models drops dramatically when they perform the KG completion task for the few-shot or newly added relations. To tackle this issue,\na series of few-shot knowledge graph completion (FKGC) methods have been proposed to predict the missing tail entity tùë°t in a query triple (h,r,?)‚Ñéùëü?(h,r,?) given only KùêæK reference triples about the few-shot relation rùëür [10, 11, 9, 12, zhang2021gaussian, 13].\nThe key idea behind FKGC methods is to learn a vector representation for each few-shot relation, which reflects the\ncommon and shared information within one relation and can be transferred from reference triples to query triples.\nTo this end,\nmost FKGC models learn the entity-pair representations by encoding the direct (one-hop) neighbors of head and tail entities, and then\naggregate the representations of reference entity pairs to obtain the representation of the corresponding few-shot relation. However, these FKGC methods have two limitations:\n(1) They learn representations of entity pair from a local view.\nOn the one hand, there are a large amount of entities having very few direct neighbors (a.k.a long-tailed entities) in real-world KGs.\nFigure 1 shows that around 82.6% of entities in Wikidata have only one direct neighbor.\nThese long-tailed entities receive limited neighbor information from their local neighborhoods, thus the representations of the involved entity pairs have low expressiveness.\nOn the other hand,\nthere are many different entities sharing common direct neighbors in KGs 4.\nTherefore, exploiting direct neighbors is not sufficient to reveal the subtle differences between these entities, resulting in low-discrimination representations for the involved entity pairs.\n(2)\nExisting FKGC methods generate the representations of few-shot relations based on the semantic information of entity pairs, without considering of the relation associated by the head and tail entities.\nIn practice, in real-world KGs, there may exist multiple relations between a pair of entities.\nModeling only the semantic information of head and tail entities cannot accurately infer the concrete relationship between the two entities in a specific situation. To address the above limitations,\nin this paper, we propose a Relation-Specific Context Learning (RSCL) framework for few-shot knowledge graph completion.\nThe RSCL framework is as follows.\nFirstly, we present a subgraph extractor to construct a context subgraph for each triple, which contains multiple entity-relation paths surrounding the triple.\nSecondly, we devise a hierarchical attention network, in which a Transformer-based global encoder and a graph neural networks-based local encoder are jointly trained to model the graph contexts of triples.\nInstead of learning entity-pair representations, the hierarchical attention network generates triple representations that incorporate the semantic information of relations and entities simultaneously.\nFinally, we design a hybrid attention aggregator to learn relation-specific representations for few-shot relations and evaluate the likelihood of query triples at the global and local levels. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: We propose a relation-specific context learning framework, which exploits graph contexts of triples to learn relation-specific relations that incorporate the semantic information of relations and entities simultaneously. We design a novel hierarchical attention network, which combines the advantages of Transformer and graph neural networks to capture rich graph contextualized information of triples and highlight valuable local neighborhood information of head and tail entities. We conduct extensive experiments on two public datasets.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods of few-shot KG completion.\nAdditionally, the ablation study verifies the effectiveness of each module in our framework.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: large scale KGs like YAGO , NELL , and Wikidata  have been widely applied in various downstream applications, such as question & answering , semantic search , and information extraction [ref]6.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1.
