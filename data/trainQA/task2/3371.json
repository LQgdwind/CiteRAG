      "content": "Paper Title: Conditional entropy minimization principle for learning domain invariant representation features\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIdeally, we want to learn a representation function f𝑓f such that f​(X)=Zinv𝑓𝑋subscript𝑍invf(X)=Z_{\\textup{inv}}. However, due to a finite number of observed domains, it is possible that the learned features might contain spurious invariant features which are invariant for all observed domains, but change in the unseen domain [ref]1 [ref]2. We model this situation by assuming that the representation function extracts features that are (approximately) composed of two elements: the (true) invariant features and the spurious invariant features: Next, we state three assumptions on Zinv,Zspsubscript𝑍invsubscript𝑍spZ_{\\textup{inv}},Z_{\\textup{sp}} and ΘΘ\\Theta that we will use in Section 4 to derive our theoretical results. The (true) invariant features Zinvsubscript𝑍invZ_{\\textup{inv}} are independent of the spurious invariant features Zspsubscript𝑍spZ_{\\textup{sp}} for a given label Y𝑌Y. Formally, Zinv⟂⟂Zsp|YZ_{\\textup{inv}}\\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp Z_{\\textup{sp}}|Y. Assumption 1 is widely accepted in the DG literature [ref]10 [ref]2  . For example, in the construction of the binary-MNIST dataset [ref]10, the class (label) is first selected, then the color (spurious feature) is independently added to the hand-written digit (invariant feature) picked from the selected class, making Zinv⟂⟂Zsp|YZ_{\\textup{inv}}\\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp Z_{\\textup{sp}}|Y. For more details, we refer the reader to the third constraint in Section 3, page 5 of [ref]10. In [ref]2  and , this assumption is used but not explicitly stated. It is, however, implicit in Fig. 2 in , Fig. 3.1 in [ref]2, and the discussion below Fig. 2 in . The uncertainty of the invariant features is lower than the uncertainty of the spurious features when the label is known. Formally, we assume H​(Zinv|Y)<H​(Zsp|Y)𝐻conditionalsubscript𝑍inv𝑌𝐻conditionalsubscript𝑍sp𝑌H(Z_{\\textup{inv}}|Y)<H(Z_{\\textup{sp}}|Y). Assumption 2 has the following interesting clustering interpretation: invariant features are better clustered together in each class (have smaller variability) than spurious features. If additionally, H​(Zinv)=H​(Zsp)𝐻subscript𝑍inv𝐻subscript𝑍spH(Z_{\\textup{inv}})=H(Z_{\\textup{sp}}), then I​(Zinv;Y)=H​(Zinv)−H​(Zinv|Y)>H​(Zsp)−H​(Zsp|Y)=I​(Zsp;Y)𝐼subscript𝑍inv𝑌𝐻subscript𝑍inv𝐻conditionalsubscript𝑍inv𝑌𝐻subscript𝑍sp𝐻conditionalsubscript𝑍sp𝑌𝐼subscript𝑍sp𝑌I(Z_{\\textup{inv}};Y)=H(Z_{\\textup{inv}})-H(Z_{\\textup{inv}}|Y)>H(Z_{\\textup{sp}})-H(Z_{\\textup{sp}}|Y)=I(Z_{\\textup{sp}};Y), implying that the invariant features Zinvsubscript𝑍invZ_{\\textup{inv}} are more strongly related to the label Y𝑌Y than the spurious features Zspsubscript𝑍spZ_{\\textup{sp}}. f​(X)=Z=Θ​(Zinv,Zsp)=a​Zinv+b​Zsp𝑓𝑋𝑍Θsubscript𝑍invsubscript𝑍sp𝑎subscript𝑍inv𝑏subscript𝑍spf(X)=Z=\\Theta(Z_{\\textup{inv}},Z_{\\textup{sp}})=aZ_{\\textup{inv}}+bZ_{\\textup{sp}} and Var⁡(Z|Y)=Var⁡(Zinv|Y)=Var⁡(Zsp|Y)=1Varconditional𝑍𝑌Varconditionalsubscript𝑍inv𝑌Varconditionalsubscript𝑍sp𝑌1\\operatorname{\\textit{Var}}(Z|Y)=\\operatorname{\\textit{Var}}(Z_{\\textup{inv}}|Y)=\\operatorname{\\textit{Var}}(Z_{\\textup{sp}}|Y)=1. Assumption 3 states that the extracted (learned) features are a linear combination of invariant features and spurious features, i.e., Z=Θ​(Zinv,Zsp)=a​Zinv+b​Zsp𝑍Θsubscript𝑍invsubscript𝑍sp𝑎subscript𝑍inv𝑏subscript𝑍spZ=\\Theta(Z_{\\textup{inv}},Z_{\\textup{sp}})=aZ_{\\textup{inv}}+bZ_{\\textup{sp}}. This is similar in spirit to the settings in  \nand is inspired by methods for Blind Source Separation (BSS) such as Independent Component Analysis (ICA)    which aim to separate-out statistically independent latent component sources, say S1,S2,S1⟂⟂S2S_{1},S_{2},S_{1}\\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp S_{2}, from observations of their linear combination M=a1​S1+a2​S2𝑀subscript𝑎1subscript𝑆1subscript𝑎2subscript𝑆2M=a_{1}S_{1}+a_{2}S_{2}. Our focus on a simple linear combination model enables us to derive some insightful theoretical results in the next section and translate them into a practical algorithm for filtering-out spurious features in the context of domain generalization which provides substantial performance improvements over competing alternatives. A general non-linear dependence relationship Z=Θ​(Zinv,Zsp)𝑍Θsubscript𝑍invsubscript𝑍spZ=\\Theta(Z_{\\textup{inv}},Z_{\\textup{sp}}) could potentially be handled using techniques such as non-linear ICA  or non-linear IRM  to filter out the spurious features. But we leave this to future work. The assumption Var⁡(Z|Y)=Var⁡(Zinv|Y)=Var⁡(Zsp|Y)=1Varconditional𝑍𝑌Varconditionalsubscript𝑍inv𝑌Varconditionalsubscript𝑍sp𝑌1\\operatorname{\\textit{Var}}(Z|Y)=\\operatorname{\\textit{Var}}(Z_{\\textup{inv}}|Y)=\\operatorname{\\textit{Var}}(Z_{\\textup{sp}}|Y)=1 is also motivated by an identical constraint in ICA needed to overcome the so-called scaling ambiguity: if S1⟂⟂S2S_{1}\\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp S_{2} and M=a1​S1+a2​S2𝑀subscript𝑎1subscript𝑆1subscript𝑎2subscript𝑆2M=a_{1}S_{1}+a_{2}S_{2}, then both (S1,S2)subscript𝑆1subscript𝑆2(S_{1},S_{2}) and (a1​S1,a2​S2)subscript𝑎1subscript𝑆1subscript𝑎2subscript𝑆2(a_{1}S_{1},a_{2}S_{2}) are pairs of independent component sources whose linear combination is M𝑀M.\nFinally, it is worth noting that Assumption 1 and Assumption 3 together imply that a2+b2=1superscript𝑎2superscript𝑏21a^{2}+b^{2}=1 (see proof of Lemma 1).\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: a finite number of observed domains, it is possible that the learned features might contain spurious invariant features which are invariant for all observed domains, but change in the unseen domain [ref]1 [ref]2.
