Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

We compare CPL-SLAM with the popular state-of-the-art SE-Sync  and Powell‚Äôs Dog-Leg method (PDL-GN)  . Even though the original algorithms of SE-Sync  are not designed for problems with landmarks, we extend SE-Sync following a similar procedure as CPL-SLAM. For the linear solvers to compute a descent direction, CPL-SLAM and SE-Sync  use the indirect and iterative truncated conjugate gradient method, whereas PDL-GN   uses the sparse direct method. The C++ code of CPL-SLAM is available at https://github.com/MurpheyLab/CPL-SLAM. All the experiments have been performed on a laptop with an Intel i7-8750H CPU and 32GB of RAM running Ubuntu 18.04 and using g++ 7.8 as C++ compiler. We have done the computation on a single core of CPU. For all the experiments, we choose the initial rank to be rSE=3subscriptùëüSE3r_{\\mathrm{SE}}=3 and rCPL=2subscriptùëüCPL2r_{\\mathrm{CPL}}=2 for SE-Sync and CPL-SLAM, respectively, since we find that rSE=3subscriptùëüSE3r_{\\mathrm{SE}}=3 and rCPL=2subscriptùëüCPL2r_{\\mathrm{CPL}}=2 are in general good enough for SE-Sync and CPL-SLAM to solve planar graph-based SLAM given the noise levels in robotics and computer vision applications.\n\nReference markers found: [55]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]55: In this section, we implement CPL-SLAM on the simulated Tree datasets, simulated City datasets and a suite of large-scale 2D SLAM benchmark datasets with and without landmarks [ref]55  [ref]30.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
