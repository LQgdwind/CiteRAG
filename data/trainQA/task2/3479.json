      "content": "Paper Title: Graph Spring Network and Informative Anchor Selection for Session-based Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecurrent neural networks (RNNs) are capable of sequential modeling, and many RNN-based models have been designed for the SBR task     [ref]12   . For example, Hidasi et al. [ref]12 propose a GRU4Rec model by applying a GRU layer to encoder sequential items. Li et al.  propose a NRAM model to boost a GRU layer with attention to learn session representation by discriminating GRU hidden states. Wang et al.  propose a CSRM model to exploit collaborative information from multiple sessions. Ren et al.  propose a RepeatNet model that incorporates a repeat-explore mechanism into a GRU network to automatically learn the switch probabilities between repeat and explore modes. Besides using RNNs, some other neural networks have also be explored for the SBR task [ref]6 [ref]11       . For example, Liu et al. [ref]6 propose the STAMP model that employs an attention network to emphasize the importance of the last click item when learning session representation. Kang et al.  propose the SASRec algorithm by stacking self-attention layers to capture latent relations in between consecutive items in a session. Yuan et al.  propose a NextItNet model by using a dilated convolutional network to capture dependencies in between items. Song et al.  propose the ISLF model that employs a recurrent variational auto-encoder (VAE) to take interest shift into account. Pan et al.  apply a modified self-attention network to estimate items’ importance in a session. Luo et al. [ref]11 integrate the collaborative self-attention network to learn the session representation and predict the intent of the current session by investigating neighborhood sessions. Yuan et al.  propose a dual sparse attention network to find the possible unrelated item in sessions. The aforementioned neural models mainly consider item transition or co-occurrence relations within a single session or several similar sessions, which limits their performance because of their lack of item embedding learning against the whole set of all available items and sessions.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are capable of sequential modeling, and many RNN-based models have been designed for the SBR task     [ref]12   .
