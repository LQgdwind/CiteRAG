      "content": "Paper Title: Limitations of Affine Integer Relaxations for Solving Constraint Satisfaction Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConstraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) provide a general framework that encompasses a huge variety of different problems, from solving systems of linear equations over Boolean satisfiability to variants of the graph isomorphism problem.\nWe view CSPs as homomorphism problems. A CSP is defined by its template structure 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}. An instance is a structure 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} of matching vocabulary and the question is whether there is a homomorphism from 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} to 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}. We are only concerned with finite-domain CSPs, i.e., the template 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} is always finite.\nIt had long been conjectured by Feder and Vardi  that every finite-domain CSP is either NP-complete or in P. In 2017, the conjecture was confirmed independently by Bulatov  and Zhuk  who both presented sophisticated universal algorithms that run in polynomial time and solve every CSP which is not NP-complete. These tractable CSPs are precisely the ones whose template admits a polymorphism that is a so-called weak near-unanimity operation. A simpler algorithm had been known earlier for templates with a Mal’tsev polymorphism 1.\nEven though this dichotomy gives us a complete complexity classification in a coarse sense, one may still wonder about the more fine-grained structure of the tractable, i.e., polynomial-time solvable, case. For instance, there is a well-known subclass of the tractable CSPs called bounded width CSPs (see e.g.   [ref]2). These are solvable by the k𝑘k-consistency method, for a fixed constant k𝑘k:\nThis is a simple algorithm that can even be implemented in Datalog.\nEssentially, it checks for inconsistencies between local solutions to subinstances of size at most k𝑘k and propagates these in a fixed-point computation. This method provably fails to solve all tractable CSPs , so we can at least subdivide the tractable case into bounded and unbounded width. But what can be said about tractable CSPs of unbounded width? Can this class be refined further along a different algorithmic technique? Is it perhaps even the case that some more natural and straightforward technique (this can arguably not be said about Bulatov-Zhuk) suffices to solve all tractable CSPs? What we are concerned with is solving systems of linear Diophantine equations,\nthat is, systems of linear equations over the integers.\nWe show that this is insufficient to solve all tractable finite-domain CSPs – at least in the way it is used in various algorithms from the literature, that we outline below.\nThe counterexample we provide has a Mal’tsev template and thus separates the affine algorithms even from the algorithm for Mal’tsev CSPs 1. This also refutes a conjecture by Dalmau and Opršal 9, that we expand upon below. Let us briefly introduce the algorithms that are addressed by our construction.\nAll of them involve solving a system of linear Diophantine equations that approximates the solvability of the CSP,\nwhich is also referred to as affine (IP) relaxations of the CSP 0  7 9.\nDifferent algorithms make use of (slightly) different equation systems, which all can be reduced to the formulation we present in Section 2.1.\nGiven a template structure 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}, an instance 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B}, and a width k∈ℕ𝑘ℕk\\in\\mathbb{N}, the variables of the equation system are indexed with partial homomorphisms from substructures of size at most k𝑘k of 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} to 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}.\nA solution to the width-k𝑘k system is thus an assignment of numerical values to partial homomorphisms.\nThe equations enforce a consistency condition, i.e., express that partial homomorphisms with overlapping domains receive values that fit together in a certain sense.\nIn contrast to the k𝑘k-consistency method, a solution of the width-k𝑘k system\nrequires a certain global notion of consistency.\nThe power of this equation system has been studied over different numerical domains. It is not hard to verify that it has a {0,1}01\\{0,1\\}-solution if and only if there is a global homomorphism from 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} to 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}, i.e., the CSP instance is satisfiable.\nMoreover, the existence of rational solutions in  01  to the width-k𝑘k system corresponds to feasibility of the k𝑘k-th level of the well-known Sherali-Adams linear programming relaxation 9 . The algorithms we are dealing with here compute solutions in ℤℤ\\mathbb{Z} – without the {0,1}01\\{0,1\\}-restriction.\nSolving systems of linear Diophantine equations is possible in polynomial time (see ) but, as we show, even for tractable template structures, the existence of an integral solution to the width-k𝑘k system is not equivalent to the satisfiability of the CSP instance.\nMore precisely, for any fixed width k𝑘k, there are instances where there is no homomorphism from 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} to 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} but the width-k𝑘k system admits an integral solution. Thus, integral feasibility of the width-k𝑘k system is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for satisfiability of the CSP instance.\nThe algorithms that fail to solve our counterexample are the following: ℤℤ\\mathbb{Z}-affine k𝑘k-consistency 9, Section 5: Run the k𝑘k-consistency procedure first. Remove all non-k𝑘k-consistent partial homomorphisms from the formulation of the width-k𝑘k equation system.\nThen accept the instance 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} if and only if this modified version of the width-k𝑘k system has an integral solution.\nDalmau and Opršal 9 conjectured that each tractable finite-domain CSP is Datalog-reducible to a CSP over ℤℤ\\mathbb{Z} and is thus solved by ℤℤ\\mathbb{Z}-affine k𝑘k-consistency for a fixed k𝑘k. BLP+AIP 0, Section 6: This algorithm by Brakensiek, Guruswami, Wrochna, and Živný solves the width-k𝑘k system first over the non-negative rationals and then over the integers, where k𝑘k is the arity of the template structure. The width-k𝑘k equation system is refined by forcing every variable to 00 which is set to 00 in every rational solution and then checked for an integral solution. BAk 6, Section 6: Ciardo and Živný proposed this generalization of BLP+AIP, in which the width k𝑘k is not fixed to be the arity of the constraint relations but is a parameter of the algorithm, like in ℤℤ\\mathbb{Z}-affine k𝑘k-consistency. CLAP 7, Section 7: This algorithm, also due to Ciardo and Živný, combines non-negative rational solutions with integral ones. In the first step, it is tested for every partial homomorphism f𝑓f whether this f𝑓f can receive weight exactly 111 in a non-negative rational solution of the width-k𝑘k system,\nwhere k𝑘k is again the arity of the template.\nIf not, it is discarded.\nThis step is repeated, where all discarded partial homomorphisms are set to 00 in the system.\nWhen this process stabilizes, the width-k𝑘k system is solved over the integers,\nwhere all discarded partial homomorphisms are forced to 00.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: about the more fine-grained structure of the tractable, i.e., polynomial-time solvable, case.
