      "content": "Paper Title: A hybrid classification-regression approach for 3D hand pose estimation using graph convolutional networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe report the quantitative results of the 2D hand pose estimation task with EPE (pixel), and we compare it against  [ref]19. We can see from Table. 4 that our approach achieves low errors in the two datasets and outperforms the state-of-the-art, proving that the 2D GCN-based regressor benefits from the learned per-pose constraint (2D relations matrix). Since our main aim is to estimate the 3D hand pose, we compare the proposed method against several competitive state-of-the-art on RHD and STB datasets with all the aforementioned metrics. For a fair comparison, we follow previous works preprocessing of the RHD dataset , and we validate the proposed method under the same evaluation conditions and standards and using the same data split. We use a range of 20−50205020-50 (mm) for the 3D PCK metric since it is a well-known standard criterion for RHD and STB dataset. Fig. 6 shows the 3D PCK results comparison on the STB dataset of our approach and several state-of-the-art methods       [ref]13   [ref]15. Our method outperforms       [ref]13  and achieves competitive performances on the STB dataset to  [ref]15. To further evaluate our approach, we report the 3D PCK curves of the RHD dataset. Fig. 7 shows that our method outperforms the compared state-of-the-art methods  [ref]13  [ref]15 on all the PCK thresholds. We report the AUC of 3D PCK for a better understanding of the results. Table. 5 presents the results of the two datasets with additional state-of-the-art methods [ref]19        . We can see that the proposed approach has the highest score in the RHD dataset, improving the AUC value to 0.939. Also, there is a small improvement in the STB dataset (0.998). Note that the advantage of our approach appears in the RHD dataset that includes low-resolution images with complex backgrounds and poses. STB dataset is less challenging since it contains simple backgrounds with a restricted number of poses. Finally, Table. 6 lists the EPE metric comparison against five state-of-the-art methods  [ref]13  [ref]15 . We can see that the proposed method has superior performances providing 12.81 and 6.58 mean EPE on RHD and STB datasets, respectively. This is mainly due to the learned per-pose geometric constraint (adjacency matrix) and the ANN-based refinement module.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: We report the quantitative results of the 2D hand pose estimation task with EPE (pixel), and we compare it against  [ref]19.
