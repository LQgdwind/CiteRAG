      "content": "Paper Title: Limitations of Sums of Bounded Read Formulas\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPolynomials are one of the fundamental mathematical objects and have wide applications in Computer Science. Algebraic Complexity Theory aims at a classification of polynomials based on their computational complexity. In his seminal work, Valiant 9 laid foundations of Algebraic Complexity Theory and popularized arithmetic circuits as a natural model of computation for polynomials. He proposed the permanent polynomial 𝗉𝖾𝗋𝗆nsubscript𝗉𝖾𝗋𝗆𝑛{\\sf perm}_{n}: as the primary representative of intractability in algebraic computation. In fact, Valiant9 conjectured that the complexity of computing 𝗉𝖾𝗋𝗆nsubscript𝗉𝖾𝗋𝗆𝑛{\\sf perm}_{n} by arithmetic circuits is different from that of the determinant function which is now known as Valiant’s hypothesis. One of the important offshoots of Valiant’s hypothesis is the arithmetic circuit lower bound problem: prove a super polynomial lower bound on the size of an arithmetic circuit computing an explicit polynomial of polynomial degree. Here, an explicit polynomial is one whose coefficients are efficiently computable. Baur and Strassen  obtained a super linear lower bound on the size of any arithmetic circuit computing the sum of powers of variables. This is the best known size lower bound for general classes of arithmetic circuits. Lack of improvements in the size lower bounds for general arithmetic circuits lead the community to investigate restrictions on arithmetic circuits. Restrictions considered in the literature can be broadly classified into two categories: syntactic and semantic. Syntactictic restrictions considered in the literature include restriction on fan-out i.e., arithmetic formulas, restriction on depth i.e., bounded depth circuits   , and the related model of algebraic branching programs. Semantic restrictions include monotone arithmetic circuits   , homogeneous circuits , multilinear circuits  and noncommutative computation 6. Grigoriev and Razborov  obtained an exponential lower bound for the size of a depth three arithmetic circuit computing the determinant or and permanent over finite fields. In contrast, only almost cubic lower bound is known over infinite fields . Explaining the lack of progress on proving lower bounds even in the case of depth four circuits, Agrawal and Vinay [ref]1 showed that an exponential lower bound for the size of depth four circuits implies Valiant’s hypothesis over any field. This lead to intense research efforts in proving lower bounds for the size of constant depth circuits, the reader is referred to an excellent survey by Saptharishi et al.  for details. Recall that a polynomial p∈𝔽​[x1,…,xn]𝑝𝔽subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛p\\in\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}] is said to be multilinear if every monomial in p𝑝p with non-zero coefficient is square-free. An arithmetic circuit is said to be multilinear if every gate in the circuit computes a multilinear polynomial. Multilinear circuits are natural models for computing multilinear polynomials. Raz  obtained super polynomial lower bounds on the size of multilinear formulas computing the determinant or permanent. Further, he gave a super polynomial separation between multilinear formulas and circuits . In fact, Raz  considered a syntactic version of multilinear circuits known as syntactic multilinear  circuits. An arithmetic circuit C𝐶C is said to be syntactic multilinear, if for every product gate g=g1×g2𝑔subscript𝑔1subscript𝑔2g=g_{1}\\times g_{2} the sub-circuits rooted at g1subscript𝑔1g_{1} and g2subscript𝑔2g_{2} are variable disjoint. The syntactic version has an advantage that the restriction can be verified by examining the circuit whereas there is no efficient algorithm for testing if a circuit is multilinear or not. Following Raz’s work, there has been significant interest in proving lower bounds on the size of syntactic multilinear circuits. Exponential separation of constant depth multilinear circuits is known , while the best known lower bound for unbounded depth syntactic multilinear circuits is only almost quadratic . An Algebraic Branching Program (ABP) is a model of computation for polynomials that generalize arithmetic formulas and were studied by Ben-Or and Cleve  who showed that ABPs of constant width are equivalent to arithmetic formulas. Nisan 6 proved exponential size lower bound for the size of an ABP computing the permanent when the variables are non-commutative. It is known that polynomial families computed by ABPs are the same as families of polynomials computed by skew circuits, a restriction of arithmetic circuits where every product gate can have at most one non-input gate as a predecessor 3. Further, skew arithmetic circuits are known to characterize the complexity of determinant . Despite their simplicity compared to arithmetic circuits, the best known lower bound for size of ABPs is only quadratic 1 . Even with the restriction of syntactic multilinearity, the best known size lower bound for ABPs is only quadratic . However, a super polynomial separation between syntactically multilinear formulas and ABPs is known . Proving super quadratic size lower bounds for syntactic multilinear ABPs (smABPs for short) remains a challenging task. Given that there is no promising approach yet to prove super quadratic size lower bounds for smABPs, it is imperative to consider further structural restrictions on smABPs and formulas to develop finer insights into the difficulty of the problem. Following the works in 7 9 8, we study syntactic multilinear formulas and smABPs with restrictions on the number of reads of variables and the order in which variables appear in a smABP. (1) Sum of ROFs:\nA read-once formula (ROF) is a formula where every variable occurs exactly once as a leaf label. ROFs are syntactic multilinear by definition and have received wide attention in the literature. Volkovich  gave a complete characterization of polynomials computed by ROFs. Further, Minahan and Volkovich 4 obtained a complete derandomization of the polynomial identity testing problem on ROFs. While most of the multilinear polynomials are not computable by ROFs , sum of ROFs, denoted by Σ⋅𝖱𝖮𝖥⋅Σ𝖱𝖮𝖥\\Sigma\\cdot{\\sf ROF} is a natural model of computation for multilinear polynomials. Shpilka and Volkovich showed that a restricted form of Σ⋅𝖱𝖮𝖥⋅Σ𝖱𝖮𝖥\\Sigma\\cdot{\\sf ROF} requires linear summands to compute the monomial x1​x2​⋯​xnsubscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2⋯subscript𝑥𝑛x_{1}x_{2}\\cdots x_{n}. Further, Mahajan and Tawari 2 obtained a tight lower bound on the size of Σ⋅𝖱𝖮𝖥⋅Σ𝖱𝖮𝖥\\Sigma\\cdot{\\sf ROF} computing an elementary symmetric polynomial. Ramya and Rao 9 obtained an exponential lower bound on the number of ROFs required to compute a polynomial in \\VP\\VP\\VP. In this article, we improve the lower bound in 9 to obtain an exponential separation between read-k𝑘k formulas and Σ⋅𝖱𝖮𝖥⋅Σ𝖱𝖮𝖥\\Sigma\\cdot{\\sf ROF} for a sufficiently large constant k𝑘k. Formally, we prove: There is constant k>0𝑘0k>0 and a family of multilinear polynomials fPRYsubscript𝑓PRYf_{\\textsf{PRY}} computable by read-k𝑘k formulas such that if fPRY=f1+f2+⋯+fssubscript𝑓PRYsubscript𝑓1subscript𝑓2⋯subscript𝑓𝑠f_{\\textsf{PRY}}=f_{1}+f_{2}+\\dots+f_{s}, where f1,…,fssubscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑠f_{1},\\ldots,f_{s} are ROFs, then s=2Ω​(n)𝑠superscript2Ω𝑛s=2^{\\Omega(n)}. (2) Sum of ROABPs: \nA natural generalization of ROFs are read-once oblivious branching programs (ROABPs). In an ROABP, a layer reads at most one variable and every variable occurs in exactly one layer. Arguments in 6 imply that any ROABP computing the permanent and determinant requires exponential size. Kayal et al.  obtain an exponential separation between the size of ROABPs and depth three multilinear formulas.\nIn 7, an exponential lower bound for the sum of ROABPs computing a polynomial in \\VP\\VP\\VP is given. We improve this bound to obtain a super polynomial separation between sum of ROABPs and smABPs: There is a multilinear polynomial family f^^𝑓\\hat{f} computable by smABPs of polynomial size such that if f^=f1+…+fs^𝑓subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑠\\hat{f}=f_{1}+\\ldots+f_{s}, each fi∈𝔽​[X]subscript𝑓𝑖𝔽delimited-[]𝑋f_{i}\\in\\mathbb{F}[X] being computable by a ROABP of size poly​(n)poly𝑛\\text{poly}(n), then s=exp​(Ω​(nϵ))𝑠expΩsuperscript𝑛italic-ϵs=\\text{exp}(\\Omega(n^{\\epsilon})) for some ϵ<1/500italic-ϵ1500\\epsilon<1/500. (3) Strict-interval ABPs and Interval formulas:\nIt may be noted that any sub-program of a ROABP computes a polynomial in an interval {xi,…,xj}subscript𝑥𝑖…subscript𝑥𝑗\\{x_{i},\\ldots,x_{j}\\} of variables for some i<j𝑖𝑗i<j. A natural generalization of ROABPs would be to consider smABPs where every sub-program computes a polynomial in some interval of variables, while a variable can occur in multiple layers. These are known as interval ABPs and were studied by Arvind and Raja  who obtained a conditional lower bound for the size of interval ABPs. Ramya and Rao 8 obtained an exponential lower bound for a special case of interval ABPs known as strict-interval  ABPs. We show that strict-interval ABPs are equivalent to ROABPs upto polynomial size: The class of strict-interval ABPs is equivalent to the class of ROABPs. Finally, we examine the restriction of intervals in syntactic multilinear formulas. We show that unlike ROFs, interval formulas can be depth reduced (Theorem 6.7). To the best of our knowledge, Theorem 3.3 is the first exponential separation between bounded read formulas and Σ⋅𝖱𝖮𝖥⋅Σ𝖱𝖮𝖥\\Sigma\\cdot{\\sf ROF}. Prior to this, only a linear separation between bounded read formulas and Σ⋅𝖱𝖮𝖥⋅Σ𝖱𝖮𝖥\\Sigma\\cdot{\\sf ROF} was known . Ramya and Rao 9 obtain an exponential separation between Σ⋅𝖱𝖮𝖥⋅Σ𝖱𝖮𝖥\\Sigma\\cdot{\\sf ROF} and multilinear \\VP\\VP\\VP. Our result is an extension of this result for the case of a simpler polynomial computable by bounded read formulas. Mahajan and Tawari 2 obtain tight linear lower bound for Σ⋅𝖱𝖮𝖥⋅Σ𝖱𝖮𝖥\\Sigma\\cdot{\\sf ROF} computing an elementary symmetric polynomial. Kayal, Nair and Saha  obtain a separation between ROABPs and multilinear depth three circuits. The authors define a polynomial, efficiently computed by set multilinear depth three circuits, that has an exponential size ROABP computing it. This polynomial can be expressed as a sum of three ROFs. Later, Ramya and Rao 7 obtain a sub-exponential lower bound against the model of Σ⋅𝖱𝖮𝖠𝖡𝖯⋅Σ𝖱𝖮𝖠𝖡𝖯\\Sigma\\cdot{\\sf ROABP} computing the polynomial defined by Raz and Yehudayoff 3. Dvir et al.  obtain a super-polynomial lower bound on the size of syntactic multilinear formulas computing a polynomial that can be efficiently computed by smABPs. We use the polynomial defined by  and adapt their techniques to obtain a separation between smABPs and Σ⋅𝖱𝖮𝖠𝖡𝖯⋅Σ𝖱𝖮𝖠𝖡𝖯\\Sigma\\cdot{\\sf ROABP}. Section 2 contains basic definitions of the models of computations, concepts and explicit polynomials used in the rest of the paper. The rest of the sections each describe results with respect to a particular bounded-read model. Section 3 describes the lower bound on the Σ⋅𝖱𝖮𝖥⋅Σ𝖱𝖮𝖥\\Sigma\\cdot{\\sf ROF} model and Section 4 describes the lower bound on the Σ⋅ROABP⋅ΣROABP\\Sigma\\cdot\\text{ROABP} model which follows using the same arguments as in the work of Dvir et al.. Section 5 shows that strict-interval ABP is a fresh way to look at ROABPs since the two models are equivalent. In Section 6 we see that Brent’s depth reduction result () holds for the class of interval formulas.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: fields.
