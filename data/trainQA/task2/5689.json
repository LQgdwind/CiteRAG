      "content": "Paper Title: Blockchain-Empowered Trustworthy Data Sharing: Fundamentals, Applications, and Challenges\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGood health is required to completely enjoy life. The significance of it is far reinforced, especially now that the entire world has confronted the health repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic . However, there are numerous hurdles that relate to authenticity, security, and privacy concerns for patients’ medical data and negatively affect medical staff in the process of analyzing and diagnosing patients’ health in the traditional healthcare domain . For example, patients’ EMRs, which record the whole process of their medical treatment, are very sensitive, scattered, and not synchronized among various medical institutions. Moreover, patients also do not have permission to access their EMRs because they are privately stored in the local databases of these institutions. Fortunately, blockchain technology has emerged and solved the above-mentioned problems by providing distributed and immutable storage to facilitate the sharing of medical data in a secure and privacy-preserving way among healthcare organizations while patients keep control over their data. The relevant study on blockchain-based medical data-sharing solutions will be summarized in the following. In , a scheme named BSPP was presented to improve diagnosis in e-Health systems. Authors used both private and consortium blockchains for storing and sharing EHRs in a secure and searchable way. While the private blockchain is used to store encrypted data, the consortium maintains records of EHR indexes. A keyword search protocol is introduced to allow authorized doctors to search historical EHRs while precluding them from searching for future records in order to improve data retrieval for treatment. Furthermore, the authors defined a Proof-of-Conformance consensus algorithm for broadcasting, validating, and appending new blocks to the chains. The proposed scheme was then implemented on JUICE platform for evaluation and achieved considerable results in terms of computation, storage, and time. In , Chen et al. proposed BFHS, a framework that provides a comprehensive DAC and data storage solution for electronic health record (EHR) sharing. To store EHRs in a decentralized and secure manner, and effectively retrieve them, BFHS used IPFS technology in the company of the consortium blockchain. In particular, while IPFS keeps encrypted patient’s EHRs and returns indices of them, the consortium blockchain stores ciphertext of indices that are encrypted by patients using ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) . Furthermore, the smart contract was created to manage access control policies for patients, individuals, and organizations who desire to own EHRs. It also supports credit calculation for consensus nodes. The higher a node’s reputation, the more likely it is to be picked to participate in the consensus process. In [ref]149, authors presented a blockchain-based system, named MeDShare, to reduce risks to patients’ EMRs related to privacy issues when sharing them among CSPs. MeDShare, with the help of smart contracts, enabled capabilities like data traceability, data audit, and DAC over medical records during data-sharing processes. The system was designed with four layers: user, data query, data structuring and provenance, and existing database infrastructure. Smart contracts and an access control mechanism were utilized to trace actions performed on requested data to ensure that the data was used properly. If detecting any misbehavior on shared data, smart contracts revoke the access permission of the requester. Furthermore, these actions on the request and delivery of data would be stored in an immutable blockchain network maintained by consensus nodes. The authors evaluated and discussed the system performance by employing scenarios of two different threat levels (data and report swap). The work in  aimed to improve the efficiency and privacy of patient EMR sharing and retrieval in eHealth systems. The authors developed SPChain, a public or permissionless blockchain system that uses chameleon hash functions (CHFs)  to create new kinds of block structure (keyblocks and microblocks) to securely store EMRs, as well as proxy re-encryption (PRE) to ensure data privacy while exchanging EMR. Furthermore, to incentivize medical institutions to participate in the data-sharing and mining process, a reputation-based consensus protocol was designed. To demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed system, performance metrics such as storage cost, throughput, and time cost were assessed in a real-world implementation. Besides, the proposal was also resilient to different types of attacks. The authors in  proposed a blockchain-based system to share data between patients and hospitals with efficient EMR retrieval and access control mechanisms. The proposed system, named MeDBlock, uses local databases to store encrypted EMRs of patients among different hospitals, while their hash values are stored on the blockchain network. Because searching a historical patient’s EMR over the entire ledgers across hospitals is inefficient and takes time, authors used a breadcrumbs mechanism that caches the hash of department-based patient-related blocks in hospitals per query for faster data retrieval. Moreover, for unauthorized users, information about signatures and encrypted summaries of EMRs is hidden before their identities are authenticated to ensure privacy for sensitive data. The authors in  proposed a blockchain-based framework called Ancile to balance privacy and the necessity for access to EHRs. Ancile used smart contracts to manage access permissions for individuals who needed to access data for a specific reason. Furthermore, to improve data privacy, a distributed PRE method with blinding is given for data sharing between parties. This approach assures that messages and cryptographic key information cannot be fully decrypted if any hazards exist. To reduce storage costs, only transaction hashes were stored on the blockchain, while query link information was transmitted through the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure protocol. * Pub., Pri., Con., and Hyb. stand for Public, Private, Consortium, and Hybrid respectively. * BC stands for blockchain. Zhang et al.  contributed a hierarchical access control mechanism for those who need to perform necessary operations on malicious content without affecting block hash values. Attribute authorities, DPs, data modifiers, and a blockchain network are the four components of the proposed system. The authors employed a decentralized attribute-based encryption (ABE) method with hierarchical authorization to avoid the single-point-of-failure problem and limit the power of modifiers. Furthermore, when employing redactable blockchain technology with the CHF, the hash value of a block is not changed if the transactions within it are amended. If no updating operations are required, the traditional hash function will be performed instead of the Chameleon one. In , authors focused on building a blockchain-based EMR/surgery health record (SHR) sharing system using IoT devices, Hyperledger Fabric, cloud servers, and the PRE algorithm. The proposed system architecture includes five layers: the system management layer, the data collection layer, the blockchain network layer, the cloud service layer, and the application layer. Thanks to doctors and medical IoT devices, real-time EMR/SHR data are collected and gathered for processing and storage. Regarding storage, encrypted EMR/SHR are kept on cloud servers, and the indexes with data usage records are stored on-chain. The authors proposed a PRE-based data sharing scheme to ensure secure data sharing on semi-trusted cloud servers, guaranteeing that those cloud servers cannot obtain any raw data and cryptographic keys. The performance has been discussed, and achieved significant results in terms of throughput and attack resistance. MedShare  is a privacy-preserving consortium blockchain-based EHR sharing system that provides fine-grained access management and efficient data retrieval. MedShare’s architecture is comprised of four components: health centers, users with different EHR access permissions, a blockchain system, and attribute authority. Encrypted EHRs were stored locally at healthcare institutions in this study, whereas encrypted searchable indices based on access permissions for distinct roles were put on the blockchain network. Specifically, the authors developed an on-chain constant-size ABE-based access control method to embed access control policies into search results without incurring high storage costs, as well as a multi-keyword conjunctive boolean search approach for efficiently performing an on-chain search. The authors of  tackled the problem of cross-hospital diagnosis by developing an EHR-sharing system called CPDS. CSPs and private hospital blockchains were used to build CPDS storage. To cut storage costs on the blockchain while also complying with data protection rules, researchers employed the former to store original EHRs and the latter just EHR indices. It is worth mentioning that each hospital owns a private blockchain, thereby creating a huge storage network, including blockchains between hospitals. CPDS leverages Wanchain technology for rapid EHR transfer among hospitals, resulting in a robust solution for scalability and variety for further development. With this solution, patients have the ability to delete EHRs when they desire. Finally, the security level of the proposal against multiple adversary attacks was discussed and analyzed. Lessons learned. Blockchain technology promotes EMR sharing among patients, hospitals, and third parties for better diagnosis, detailed treatment plans, and efficient data management. DPs must encrypt their EMRs before uploading them to storage systems due to security and privacy concerns. Because the number of EMRs is massive and increases exponentially day by day, it is inefficient and costly to store all raw EMRs on blockchain network. Therefore, only hash values of EMRs are kept on the blockchain, while encrypted EMRs are stored on local hospital servers, cloud servers, or distributed storage systems such as IPFS and Swarm. In blockchain-based healthcare applications, EMR/EHR access control also needs to be carefully investigated and developed because it allows DPs to monitor and govern actions performed on their shared data. By using smart contracts and cryptographic techniques (e.g., ABE), DPs are able to flexibly set access control policies to prevent EMRs from being accessible to unauthorized entities. Another issue that has arisen in blockchain-based healthcare applications is the retrieval or querying of historical EMRs. Although a patient’s previous EMRs may be scattered across multiple medical institutions, applications must ensure that DRs, in general, can easily query them to provide quick and accurate diagnoses for a specific purpose. Because searching the entire ledger is inefficient, techniques and mechanisms (e.g., Bread crumbs ) might be used to speed up data accessing and querying. The majority of current blockchain-based healthcare applications have not considered using PPTs to protect the sensitive data privacy of patients. If DRs are nurses and doctors who are in charge of the patient’s medical examination, data sharing without PPTs may be acceptable because they still need to see explainable raw data (e.g., X-ray images) for diagnosis. Regarding third-party requesters, not all patients want their raw EMRs leaked, viewed, and monetized. As a result, there is a need to combine PPTs and blockchain in order to build a secure and privacy-preserving blockchain-based healthcare application like BlockDaSh. Especially, when the number of intelligent AI-based systems having large impacts on primary care and requiring a ton of medical data for training models increases at a rapid pace  , BlockDaSh is able to support them in reducing the risks of patients’ data leakage thanks to the trusted data sharing for collaborative learning service.\n\nReference markers found: [149]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]149: who desire to own EHRs.
