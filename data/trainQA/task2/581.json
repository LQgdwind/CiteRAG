InfoGAIL  is an extension of GAIL [ref]39 that aims at automatically identifying semantically meaningful latent factors that can explain variations in demonstrations across oracles. It assumes that demonstrations come from a mixture-of-oracles policy, where each demonstration is generated by sampling a value of the latent factors from a prior and using it to condition an oracle’s action choices. InfoGAIL tries to recover this oracle mixture. In contrast, MAMBA can be viewed as choosing actions based on learned estimates of oracles’ value functions without imitating any single oracle or their mixture directly. In multi-modal IL , latent factors conceptually similar to those in InfoGAIL correspond to different skills being demonstrated by the oracles, and Tamar et al. ’s approach focuses on settings where these factors characterize different oracles’ intentions. OIL [ref]19 is more similar to MAMBA: like MAMBA, it uses individual oracle policies’ state values to decide on an action in a given state. However, OIL does so by using the best-performing oracle in a given state as the learner’s “critic\" and doesn’t justify its approach theoretically. At least two algorithms have used a Bayesian approach to decide which oracle to trust in a multiple-oracle setting. AC-Teach  models each oracle with a set of attributes and relies on a Bayesian approach to decide which action to take based on their demonstrations. Gimelfarb et al. [ref]42 assumes that oracles propose reward functions, some of which are inaccurate, and uses Bayesian model combination to aggregate their advice. Out of the two, AC-Teach can be regarded as a Bayesian counterpart of MAMBA, but, like other existing approaches to learning from multiple oracles, doesn’t come with a theoretical analysis. Lastly, we remark that the improvement made from the suboptimal oracles in MAMBA is attributed to using reward information in IL, similar to AggreVaTeD  but different from behavior cloning  or DAgger . While we allow weaker oracle policies than are typical in IL literature, they still need to have meaningful behaviors to provide an informative advantage MAMBA to improve upon; e.g., they cannot be completely uniformly random policies as is often done in the batch RL setting.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: Several prior works proposed empirical approaches to IL settings with multiple oracles.
