      "content": "Paper Title: Texture Generation on 3D Meshes with Point-UV Diffusion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTexturing 3D meshes is a fundamental task in computer vision and graphics. It enhances the visual richness of 3D objects, thereby facilitating their application in various fields such as video games, 3D movies, and AR/VR technologies. However, generating high-quality textures can be daunting and time-consuming, often requiring specialized knowledge and resources. As such, there is a pressing need for an efficient approach to automatically create high-quality textures on 3D meshes. Despite the substantial progress the community has made in 2D image synthesis and 3D shape generation using GANs [ref]14    or diffusion models    , crafting realistic textures on mesh surfaces remains challenging.\nOne major difficulty stems from the need for suitable 3D representations for texture synthesis.\nEarly approaches investigate the use of voxels  0  or point clouds  and synthesize point/voxel colors.\nHowever, they can only afford to synthesize low-resolution results with low-fidelity textures due to memory and model complexity constraints.\nIn response, Texture Fields [ref]34 adopts an implicit representation with the potential to synthesize high-resolution textures, but still could not yield satisfactory results as shown in Figure 2 (a): over-smoothed results.\nMost recently, Siddiqui et al. [ref]43 propose to parameterize the shape as tetrahedral meshes and introduce tetrahedral mesh convolution to enhance local details.\nAlbeit improving results, tetrahedral parameterization inevitably destroys geometric details of the input mesh and thus cannot faithfully preserve the original structure. As shown in Figure 2 (b), the delicate structures of the chair’s back are absent. Moreover, the generative models utilized in these methods are limited to GANs [ref]34 [ref]43 and VAEs [ref]34 . The more advanced diffusion model, which could potentially open up new avenues for high-quality texture generation, remains insufficiently explored. In this paper, we delve into a novel texture representation based on UV maps and investigate the advanced diffusion model for texture generation. The 2D nature of the UV map enables it to circumvent the cost of high-resolution point/voxel representations. Besides, the UV map is compatible with arbitrary mesh topologies, thereby preserving the original geometric structures.\nHowever, while promising, direct integration of the UV map representation with a 2D diffusion model presents challenges in synthesizing seamless textures, leading to severe artifacts, as shown in Figure 2 (c). This occurs because the UV mapping process fragments the continuous texture on the 3D surface into isolated patches on the 2D UV plane (see Figure 3). To this end, we introduce Point-UV diffusion, a two-stage coarse-to-fine framework consisting of point diffusion and UV diffusion.\nSpecifically, we initially design a point diffusion model to generate color for sampled points that act as low-frequency texture components. This model is equipped with a style guidance mechanism that alleviates the impact of biased color distributions in the dataset and facilitates diversity during inference.\nNext, we project these colorized points onto the 2D UV space with 3D coordinate interpolation, thereby generating a coarse texture image that maintains 3D consistency and continuity. Given the coarse textured image, we develop a UV diffusion model with elaborately designed hybrid conditions to improve the quality of the textures (see Figure 2 (ours) and Figure Texture Generation on 3D Meshes with Point-UV Diffusion). In short, our contributions are as follows: 1) We propose a new framework for texture generation for given meshes. Our representation can handle meshes with arbitrary topology and is able to faithfully preserve geometric structures. 2) To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to train a diffusion model specifically for mesh texture generation. Our coarse-to-fine framework allows us to enjoy the efficiency of 2D representation while enhancing 3D consistency. 3) We compare our approach with multiple methods in unconditional generation and achieve state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method can be easily extended to scenarios with text-conditioning and image-conditioning.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: for an efficient approach to automatically create high-quality textures on 3D meshes.
