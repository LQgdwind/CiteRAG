      "content": "Paper Title: Quantifying and Improving Transferability in Domain Generalization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMulti-task learning  Multi-task learning (MTL) [ref]56 is related to but different from DG. In MTL, there are several tasks, and one hopes to improve the performance of each task by jointly training all the tasks simultaneously, utilizing the relationships between them. This is different from DG in the sense that in DG the target domain is unknown a priori, whereas in MTL the focus is more on better generalization on existing tasks that appear in training. Hence, there is no distribution shift in MTL per se. Furthermore, for MTL, the output spaces of different tasks are not necessarily the same. Zero-shot learning / Few-shot learning / Meta-learning  DG is different from zero-shot learning 7. In zero-shot learning, one has labeled training data and the goal is to make predictions on a new unseen label set. However, in DG the label set remains the same for the source and the target domains. On the other hand, the focus of few-shot learning is on fast adaptation, in the sense that the test distribution remains the same as the training distribution, but the learner can only have access to a few labeled samples. Domain generalization also shares similarity with meta-learning. However, in meta-learning, the learner is allowed to fine-tune over the target domain. In other words, the protocol of meta-learning allows access to a small amount of labeled data from future unseen domains. Meta-learning is more or less one specific method that is used to tackle few-shot learning. Because of the similarity, some meta-learning algorithms can be applied to DG . Self-supervised learning Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a popular unsupervised feature learning approach [ref]13  . The goal of SSL is to learn invariant representations w.r.t. different views of the same image. Although it is a promising feature learning method, it differs from our DG settings in the sense that no labels are used in SSL. Domain generalization\nThere have been a lot of old and new algorithms proposed for domain generalization. The simplest one is Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM), where we simply minimize the empirical risk of (the sum of) all source domains. In Blanchard et al. , Muandet et al. , kernel methods for DG were proposed. Arjovsky et al.  proposed Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) which aims to learn invariant predictors across source domains, and follow-up discussions can be found in  . Another approach is called distributional robustness  , where the model is optimized over a worst-case distribution under the constraint that this distribution is generated from a small perturbation around the source distributions. In Albuquerque et al. , a DG scheme based on distribution matching was proposed. Moreover, many domain adaptation algorithms can be directly adapted to the task of domain generalization, such as CORAL  and DANN . Last but not least, we mention a concurrent work  on the theory of domain generalization, which focuses more on proposing a model selection rule based on accuracy and variation. Adversarial robustness Our evaluation and training methods in §4 are reminiscent of the adversarial training method 3 in the literature of adversarial robustness. Perturbing the classifier in our case corresponds to perturbing the input data in adversarial robustness. From this perspective, our Transfer algorithm is parallel to the adversarial training method. It would be interesting to design certified robust feature embeddings, by analogy with certified robust classifiers .\n\nReference markers found: [56]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]56: Multi-task learning  Multi-task learning (MTL) [ref]56 is related to but different from DG.
