      "content": "Paper Title: Beneficial Perturbation Network for designing general adaptive artificial intelligence systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe proposed a fundamentally new biologically plausible type of method - beneficial perturbation network (BPN), a neural network that can switch into different modes to process independent tasks, allowing the network to create potentially unlimited mappings between inputs and outputs. We successfully demonstrated this in the continual learning scenario. Our experiments demonstrate the performance of BPN is better than the state-of-the-art. 1) BPN is more parameter efficient (0.3% increase per task) than the various network expansion and network partition methods. it does not need a large episodic memory to store any data from previous tasks, compared to episodic memory methods, or large context matrices, compared to partition methods. 2) BPN achieves state-of-the-art performance across different datasets and domains. 3) BPN has a larger capacity to accommodate a higher number of tasks than the partition networks. Through visualization of classification regions and quantitative results, we validate that beneficial perturbations can bias the network towards a task, allowing the network to switch into different modes. Thus, BPN significantly contributes to alleviating catastrophic forgetting and achieves much better performance than other types of methods. Elsayed et al.  showed how carefully computed adversarial perturbations embedded in the input space can repurpose machine learning models to perform a new task without changing the parameters of the models. This attack finds a single adversarial perturbation for each task, to cause the model to perform a task chosen by the adversary.\nThis adversarial perturbation can thus be considered as a program to execute each task. Here, we leverage similar ideas. But, in sharp contrast, instead of using malicious programs embedded in the input space to attack a system, we embedded beneficial perturbations (’beneficial programs’) into the network’s parameter space (the bias terms), enabling the network to switch into different modes to process different tasks. The goal of both approaches is similar - maximizing the probability (P​(c​u​r​r​e​n​t​t​a​s​k|i​m​a​g​e​i​n​p​u​t,p​r​o​g​r​a​m)𝑃conditional𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑡𝑎𝑠𝑘𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚P(current\\ task|image\\ input,\\ program)) of the current task given the image input and the corresponding program for the current task. This can be achieved by either forcing the network to perform an attack task in Elsayed et al., or assisting it to perform a beneficial task in our method. The addition of programs to either input space (Elsayed et al.’s method) or the network’s activation space (our method) helps the network maximize this probability for a specific task. We suggest that the intriguing property of the beneficial perturbations that can bias the network toward a task might come from the property of adversarial subspaces. Following the adversarial direction, such as by using the fast gradient sign method (FGSD) , can help in generating adversarial examples that span a continuous subspace of large dimensionality (adversarial subspace). Because of “excessive linearity” in many neural networks  , due to features including Rectified linear units and Maxout, the adversarial subspace often takes a large portion of the total input space. Once an adversarial input lies in the adversarial subspace, nearby inputs also tend to lie in it. Interestingly, this corroborates recent findings by Ilyas et al. [ref]20 that imperceptible adversarial noise can not only be used for adversarial attacks on an already-trained network, but also as features during training. For instance, after training a network on dog images perturbed with adversarial perturbation calculated from cat images, the network can achieve a good classification accuracy on the test set of cat images. This result shows that those features (adversarial perturbations) calculated from the cat training sets, contain sufficient information for a machine learning system to make correct classification on the test set of cat images. In our method, we calculate those features for each task, and store them into the bias units. In this case, although the normal weights have been modified (information from old tasks are corrupted), the stored beneficial features for each task have sufficient information to bias the network and enable the network to make correct predictions. BPN is loosely inspired by its counterpart in the human brain: having task-dependent modules such as bias units in our Beneficial Perturbation Network, and long-term memories in hippocampus (HPC, [ref]3) in a brain network, are crucial for a system to switch into different modes to process different tasks. During weight consolidation, the HPC     fuses features from different tasks into coherent memory traces. Over days to weeks, as memories mature, the HPC progressively stores permanent abstract high-level long-term memories to remote memory storage areas (neocortical regions). The HPC can then maintain and mediate their retrieval independently when a specific memory is in need.\nWe suggest that when a specific memory is retrieved, it helps the HPC switch into distinct modes to process different tasks. Thus, our analogy between HPC and BPN can be formulated as: during the training of BPN, updating the shared normal weights using EWC or PSP in theory leads to distinct task-dependent representations (similar to the coherent memory traces in HPC). However, some overlap between these representations is inevitable because model parameters become too constrained for EWC, or PSP runs out of unrealized capacity of the core network. To circumvent this effect, Bias units (akin to the long-term memories in the neocortical areas) are trained independently for each task. At test time, bias units for a given task are activated to push representations of old tasks back to their initial task-optimal working regions in an analogous manner to maintaining and mediating the retrieval of Long-term memories independently in HPC. An alternative biological explanation evokes the concept of factorized codes. In biological neuronal populations, neurons can be active for one task or, in many cases, for more than one tasks. At the population level, different tasks are encoded by different neuronal ensembles which can overlap. In our model, the PSP component deploys binary keys to activate task-specific readouts in hidden layers, in an analogy to neuronal task ensembles. When activating a BD component for a task, we would be further disambiguating a task-specific ensemble, particularly across neurons which are active for more than one task. The reason for this is that adding task-specific beneficial perturbations to activations of hidden layers can shift the distribution of the net activation (akin to a DC offset or carrier frequency). Evidence from nonhuman primate experiments [ref]43  and human behavioral results  support this factorized code theory. Electrophysiological experiments using monkeys demonstrated that neurons in prefrontal cortex are either representing competing categories independently [ref]43 or could represent multiple categories . In human behavior experiments, \"humans tend to form factorized representation that optimally segregated the tasks \". In addition, recent neural network simulations 1 demonstrated that \"network developed mixed task selectivity similar to recorded prefrontal neurons after learning multiple tasks sequentially with a continual learning technique\". Thus, having factorized representations for different tasks is important for enabling life-long learning and designing a general adaptive artificial intelligence system.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: portion of the total input space.
