      "content": "Paper Title: Scaling Up Knowledge Graph Creation to Large and Heterogeneous Data Sources\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA KG can be generated by semantifying and integrating heterogeneous data into an RDF data model; different tools and approaches can be applied for this purpose. In order to provide a flexible and transparent transformation, declarative mapping languages are proposed to map the data into the concepts of the unified schema or the ontology and transfer them into RDF. R2RML  recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and RDF Mapping Languages (RML), the extension of R2RML, are two popular exemplar declarative mapping languages. Accordingly, several methods and tools are proposed for transforming data into RDF using R2RML and RML mapping rules such as RMLMapper , SDM-RDFizer , RocketRML , and CARML . Priyatna et al.  introduce an extension of an existing SPARQL to SQL query rewriting algorithm, applying R2RML mapping rules. As a different approach, Lefracios et al.  propose an extension of SPARQL named SPARQL-Generate to generate RDF. In order to scale up the process of transforming data into RDF and creation of KG for large or complex data integration systems, different optimization frameworks are proposed, some of which can be applied along with mentioned tools. For instance, Szekely et al. propose the DIG system , Jozashoori and Vidal define MapSDI , while Gawriljuk et al.  present a scalable framework for incremental KG creation. Morph-KGC [ref]16 proposes an approach to partition R2RML and RML mapping assertions so that generated partitions can be executed in parallel. Morph-KGC relies on partitioning the mapping assertions into groups that generate disjoint sets of RDF triples. Nevertheless, based on this partitioning strategy, RDF triples with a join dependency, i.e., the subject of one RDF triple is the object of another, are partitioned into independent groups. Therefore, the same join RDF resource is generated redundantly by each disjoint partition to ensure the completeness and correctness of the result RDF triples. Nevertheless, an efficient partitioning strategy requires considering all mapping assertions including those that generate RDF triple sets with join dependency as a whole, to ensure that the result partitions are optimized.\nTherefore, despite the significance of all mentioned contributions and improvements, none of the mentioned approaches addresses the problem of scheduling the optimized execution of mapping assertion partitions, specifically considering different impacting factors, e.g., mapping assertions types, connection between mapping assertions, and common properties among them. Additionally, the mentioned approaches are specific for an engine, i.e., they are not necessarily adaptable to generic KG creation pipelines. We tackle the mentioned existing limitations, introducing an engine-agnostic execution technique relying on efficient partitioning and scheduling strategies. The proposed execution planner decides on the optimized execution plan based on the types of mapping assertions, the connection between the mapping assertions, and the redundancy of the predicates in mapping assertions. Any [R2]RML-compliant engine can adopt our proposed optimization approach, as shown in the next sections.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: tools.
