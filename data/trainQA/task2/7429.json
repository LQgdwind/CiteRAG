Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Synthesizing Sentiment-Controlled Feedback For Multimodal Text and Image Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMultimodal summarization combines the inputs from various modalities to produce comprehensive summaries . In this direction, Chen and Zhuge  used recurrent networks to align text with corresponding images. In another work, Zhu et al. [ref]17 focused on extractive summarization, selecting relevant images and texts using a pointer generator network. Their work was extended by Zellers et al.  for video summarization, using self-attention mechanisms to choose relevant video frames based on semantic content. Shang et al. [ref]19 emphasized timing in video summarization with time-aware transformers. In other studies, Zhao et al.  explored audiovisual video summarization including sensory input and Xie et al.  used visual aesthetics while generating multimodal summaries. Despite the advancements mentioned above, multimodal summarization faces the challenge of modality bias  , and it has not been explored for affect synthesis. Moreover, multimodal summarization approaches do not use human comments in model training. In contrast, the proposed system is trained on human-generated comments alongside text and image inputs to generate sentiment-controlled feedback. Furthermore, unlike multimodal summarization, which condenses the given information, controllable feedback synthesis produces feedback that aligns with sentiments and fits the context.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: inputs from various modalities to produce comprehensive summaries .
