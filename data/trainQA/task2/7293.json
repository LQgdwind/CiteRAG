Considering the rich information about the human cardiovascular system contained in PPG signals and the powerful data mining capabilities of deep learning, the application scenarios of PPG signals are no longer simply limited to tasks intuitively associated with them (e.g., HR measurement), but can be further explored and extended by researchers. In terms of application breadth, PPG signals were initially utilized for tasks such as HR and SpO2 calculation , where researchers could typically extract the necessary features from the signal under theoretical guidance. However, through the integration of deep learning methods, PPG-based tasks such as biometric identification  , sleep staging  , emotion recognition  [ref]73, and ECG signal reconstruction  have become feasible. In these tasks, PPG signals alone cannot sufficiently obtain the required feature information under existing theoretical guidance, as much feature information is hidden in the high-dimensional feature space and is difficult to directly discern  [ref]253. However, by harnessing the powerful learning capabilities of deep learning under the drive of big data, these high-dimensional information can also be fully exploited, thereby serving more potential application scenarios  [ref]253. In the context of application depth, consider the example of BP estimation based on PPG signals. Early studies in this area primarily relied on manually extracted features such as pulse transit time and pulse arrival time  . This approach typically necessitates the use of synchronized PPG and ECG signals or PPG signals collected from two different positions, and such methods usually only yield discrete BP values (e.g., SBP)   . However, in recent years, with the emergence of deep learning, the scope of PPG signal application in this scenario has been steadily broadening. For example, researchers can employ deep learning for automatic feature extraction, eliminating the need for labor-intensive manual feature extraction. This development has also spurred an in-depth exploration of using only single-site PPG signals for BP estimation  . Additionally, BP estimation is no longer confined to discrete values but has progressively advanced to the reconstruction of continuous BP waveforms  .\n\nReference markers found: [97]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]97: As previously mentioned, the application scenarios of PPG analysis based on deep learning have been widely explored by researchers, such as BP estimation  , arrhythmia detection [ref]97 , and sleep staging  .
