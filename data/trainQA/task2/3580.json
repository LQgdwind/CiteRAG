      "content": "Paper Title: Model Inversion Attack against Transfer Learning: Inverting a Model without Accessing It\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe success of machine learning has been the driving force behind a wide variety of applications, from computer vision to speech recognition  [ref]29.\nThus, due to their power and place in model software systems,\nmachine learning models, like deep neural networks, have become important pieces of intellectual property for their owners\ndue to their powerful capacity in modern software systems .\nHowever, building a powerful machine learning model requires both a massive amount of data and enormous computational resources.\nFurther, this hunger for data coupled with the exorbitant computational overhead limits the number of models that can be independently trained.\nOne solution to this problem has been transfer learning [ref]49,\nwhere a small number of well-trained teacher models is shared with the general community.\nIndividual users then can customize these teacher models, building student models to suit their particular tasks\nwith a much smaller amount of data and far less computational resources. Although transfer learning is able to address the data scarcity problem,\nits open nature attracts a diversity of adversaries\nwho exploit teacher models to compromise individual student models.\nResearch shows that adversarial activities against transfer learning,\ninclude both misclassification attacks 4 and membership inference attacks .\nHowever, among these adversarial activities, a common type of attack has not been investigated - that being model inversion attacks.\nThe aim of a model inversion attack is to reconstruct a model’s input data\nbased on its outputs (black-box) or model parameters (white-box)  .\nExisting model inversion attacks have mainly been mounted against standalone models   not transfer learning models.\nThat, however, does not necessarily mean that model inversion attacks against transfer learning models are not possible.\nHence, to explore this potential, we examined whether transfer learning is vulnerable to model inversion attacks. The research of model inversion against transfer learning is challenging,\nbecause 1) student models are private and cannot be accessed by adversaries;\nand 2) this privateness makes it difficult for an adversary to collect a great many samples with the same distribution as the student model’s training set.\nExisting white-box attacks   require the target model’s parameters, e.g., the architecture or the gradients.\nSuch information about the target student model, however, is not available in transfer learning.\nAlthough existing black-box attacks require only the target model’s outputs  ,\nthey can typically only acquire this information through a large number of queries to the target model.\nAs such, they assume that collecting a massive amount of data sharing the same distribution as the target model’s training set is possible 111Although Yang et al.  also used general distribution auxiliary data, their major results were derived from the same distribution data..\nOn the surface, it would therefore seem that transfer learning models are robust to model inversion attacks.\nHowever, we contend that such data and queries may not be required and propose two novel model inversion attack methods\nthat do not require access to the target model. In the first method, an adversary is assumed to have a set of data that has the same distribution as the training data of the teacher model.\nShe first uses these data to train an inversion model against the teacher model,\nand then trains a conversion model to assist the inversion model to suit the target student model using a limited amount of data.\nThese data share the same distribution as the training data of the student model.\nIn the second method, the adversary is assumed not to have any teacher data.\nShe first collects an amount of unlabeled data that have a similar distribution to the training data of the teacher model.\nThen, she augments her dataset using these unlabeled data. The augmented dataset is used to train a shadow model to mimic the target student model.\nIt is also used to train an attack model to invert the shadow model.\nAs the shadow model is similar to the target student model,\nthe attack model can also be used to invert the student model.\nIn summary, we make the following three key contributions.\n 1) To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the vulnerability of transfer learning under model inversion attacks. 2) To overcome the issue of the target student model being inaccessible and the problem of the amount of available data being limited,\nwe propose two novel attack methods, each of which suits a distinct situation. 3) We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of the two methods in diverse settings,\nincluding both facial images and hand-drawn digits.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: The success of machine learning has been the driving force behind a wide variety of applications, from computer vision to speech recognition  [ref]29.\nThus, due to their power and place in model software systems,\nmachine learning models, like deep neural networks, have become important pieces of intellectual property for their owners\ndue\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
