Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Optimal Observation-Intervention Trade-Off in Optimisation Problems with Causal Structure\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNon-trivial dependencies amongst bandit arms are typically listed under structured bandits. When that structure is explicitly causal the namesake follows   [ref]38. The literature on causal bandits is richer than that of causal bo. Bareinboim et al.  were the first to explore the connection between causal reasoning and mab algorithms. Lattimore et al.  and Sen et al.  introduced methods for best-arm identification and non-trivial challenges that arise when unobserved confounders (ucs) are present in the scm, which is explored in  [ref]36 where the authors introduce the notion of pomiss for graphs with and without non-manipulative variables respectively. More recently in  the authors prove regret bounds for causal mabs with linear scms, binary intervention domains and soft interventions. In the listed works thus far, the graph is assumed known. This assumption is relaxed in . Another direction is budgeted mabs  where pulling an arm comes as a fixed cost and the agent has a finite budget which she has to spend judiciously to find the best arm subject to that limitation. Similar to the existing work in causal bo, the main differences between this paper and the previous work on causal mab are a) that we propose a solution to the observation-intervention trade-off; and b) we quantify the costs associated with collecting observations. Further, to our knowledge, ours is the first study that combines the structured and the budgeted mab approaches.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: Non-trivial dependencies amongst bandit arms are typically listed under structured bandits.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
