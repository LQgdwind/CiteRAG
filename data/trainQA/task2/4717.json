      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Attentive Belief Propagation: Integrating Reasoning and Learning for Solving Constraint Optimization Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBelief Propagation (BP)  6 is an important message-passing algorithm for various reasoning tasks over graphical models, e.g., computing partition function of a Markov random field [ref]50, estimating the marginal distribution of a given set of random variables [ref]1, and decoding LPDC codes . Constraint Optimization Problems (COPs)   are a general mathematical paradigm for modeling many real-world problems like transportation, supply chain, energy, finance, and scheduling    . When \nsolving COPs, BP, also known as Min-sum message passing , seeks to find a cost-optimal solution by propagating cost information over the corresponding factor graph. It is known that vanilla BP does not guarantee convergence on a factor  graph containing loops and thus, it often explores low-quality solutions on COPs with cyclic factor graphs due to excessive loopy propagation. Therefore, considerable research efforts       have been devoted to tackling the convergence issue of loopy BP. Among them, Damped BP (DBP)111The method is referred as “Damped Max-sum” in . We use Damped BP for a coherent presentation.  has drawn significant attention recently. By mixing the new message composed in each iteration with the old message composed in the previous iteration, i.e., damping, it has been shown that DBP with a suitable damping factor will often converge and achieve state-of-the-art performance in practice. In fact, damping can be considered as a degree of freedom to balance exploration and exploitation in BP . Due to the significant impact of damping on BP , a damping factor is often treated as a hyperparameter and requires laborious case-by-case tuning. Besides, existing works often use a homogeneous and static damping factor for all variable-nodes which limits DBP’s capability. Moreover, DBP simply treats each variable-node’s neighbors equally when composing a new message, which fails to explore optimal composition strategy. On the other hand, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been applied to boost the performance of BP   . However, existing DNN-based BP variants often require supervised learning and expensive training labels and thus, they cannot be directly applied to solve COPs when training labels are not available. They also manipulate or simulate the BP messages with some black-box DNN components, which destroys the semantic of a BP message being the weighted sum of cost functions’ marginalizations and thus, the variable decision-making rule of BP for COPs is no longer applied (i.e., selecting the assignments with the minimum beliefs). To address the above issues, we propose the first self-supervised DNN-based BP for solving COPs by seamlessly integrating BP, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) , and Graph Attention Networks (GATs)  within the massage-passing framework to reason about dynamic weights and damping factors for composing new BP messages. Specifically, we make the following key contributions: We extend DBP by allowing dynamic damping factors and different neighbor weights for each variable-node. Consequently, we have more fine-grained control for composing new messages to trigger effective exploration without altering the semantic of BP messages. We infer the optimal damping factors and neighbor weights for each iteration automatically by seamlessly integrating BP and DNNs. Our model, Deep Attentive Belief Propagation (DABP), firstly embeds respectively the factor graph and BP messages with GATs and GRUs, and infers damping factors and neighbor weights through a multi-head attention   layer; Then, BP runs with those updated factors and weights to compose and propagate new messages, and so on. Note that integrating GRUs can capture the dynamics of BP messages and avoid the gradient vanishing/exploding issue in long BP reasoning sequences. We further equip our DABP with a novel self-supervised learning loss which is a smoothed surrogate for the cost under BP decision-making rule. Therefore, unlike existing DNN-based BP variants, we do not require expensive training labels which are often not available in practice, and also our model can avoid out-of-distribution issue with efficient online learning. We conduct extensive experimental evaluations on four standard benchmarks. The results show that our DABP achieves significantly higher convergence rate, where it successfully converges on average 96.25% instances given 1000 iterations, and it also outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by considerable margins.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: Belief Propagation (BP)  6 is an important message-passing algorithm for various reasoning tasks over graphical models, e.g., computing partition function of a Markov random field [ref]50, estimating the marginal distribution of a given set of random variables [ref]1, and decoding LPDC codes .
