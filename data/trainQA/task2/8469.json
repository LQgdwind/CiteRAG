      "content": "Paper Title: A Practical Quantum Hoare Logic with Classical Variables, I\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNow we are ready to define our quantum programming language 𝑞𝑊ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑒+\\mathit{qWhile}^{+}. Essentially, it is the classical while-language expanded by quantum gates and quantum measurement commands introduced in the previous subsections.\nThe alphabet of 𝑞𝑊ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑒+\\mathit{qWhile}^{+} consists of: the alphabet of a classical while-language (see for example Chapter 3 of [ref]2 and Section 3.2 of ); a countably infinite set 𝒬​𝒱\\mathcal{QV} of (simple and array) quantum variables (as described in Subsection 2.2); a set 𝒰\\mathcal{U} of basic (parameterized) quantum gate symbols (as described in Subsections 3.1); and a set ℳ\\mathcal{M} of basic quantum measurement symbols (as described in Subsection 3.2). Then we can introduce: The syntax of 𝑞𝑊ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑒+\\mathit{qWhile}^{+} is given as follows: where xx is a classical variable, ee and t1,…,tmt_{1},...,t_{m} are classical expressions, q,q1,…,qnq,q_{1},...,q_{n} are simple or subscripted quantum variables, U∈𝒰U\\in\\mathcal{U}, M∈ℳM\\in\\mathcal{M}, and bb is a classical boolean expression. Such a language was already introduced in the previous literature (see for example 7 2 ), but here we add parameterised gate U​(t1,…,tn)U(t_{1},...,t_{n}) as well as quantum array into it so that q,q1,…,qnq,q_{1},...,q_{n} in (3) can be (subscripted) array variables. As mentioned in Section 2, quantum arrays have been already introduced in previous quantum programming languages (e.g. OpenQSAM  and Q# ). Parameterised quantum gates are also supported by previous quantum programming languages, and they are recently generalised to differential quantum programming  7. Intuitively, q:=|0⟩q:=|0\\rangle means that quantum variable qq is initialised in a basis state |0⟩|0\\rangle. The quantum gate U​(t1,…,tm)​[q1,…,qn]U(t_{1},...,t_{m})[q_{1},...,q_{n}] and measurement command x:=M​[q1,…,qn]x:=M[q_{1},...,q_{n}] were already explained in Subsections 3.1 and 3.2, respectively. The meanings of other commands are the same as in a classical while-language. It is worth examining the interface between the classical and quantum parts of 𝑞𝑊ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑒+\\mathit{qWhile}^{+}. In the quantum to classical direction, the outcome of a quantum measurement M​[q1,…,qn]M[q_{1},...,q_{n}] is stored in a classical variable xx, which can appear in a classical expression ee and thus participate in a classical computation, or in a classical boolean expression bb and thus is used in the control of subsequent computation. In the classical to quantum direction, a classical boolean expression bb may be used in determining the control flow of quantum computation. In addition, classical variables may appear in the subscripts of some quantum array variables in U​(t1,…,tm)​[q1,…,qn]U(t_{1},...,t_{m})[q_{1},...,q_{n}] or M​[q1,…,qn]M[q_{1},...,q_{n}] and thus determine the locations that quantum gate UU or measurement MM performs on. The readers can find many quantum program examples using quantum arrays in the previous literature (for example  ). Also, variational quantum algorithms  and quantum machine learning algorithms  can be conveniently written as quantum programs with parameterised quantum gates as defined above.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: quantum measurement commands introduced in the previous subsections.\nThe alphabet of 𝑞𝑊ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑒+\\mathit{qWhile}^{+} consists of: the alphabet of a classical while-language (see for example Chapter 3 of [ref]2 and Section 3.2 of ); a countably infinite set 𝒬​𝒱\\mathcal{QV} of (simple and array) quantum variables (as described in Subsection 2.2); a set 𝒰\\mathcal{U} of basic (parameterized) quantum\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
