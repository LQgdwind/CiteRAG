      "content": "Paper Title: Handling Epistemic and Aleatory Uncertainties in Probabilistic Circuits\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo compare our approach against the state-of-the-art approaches for reasoning with uncertain probabilities, following  we restrict ourselves to the case of circuits representing inferences over a Bayesian network. For instance, Listing 4 shows an aProblog code that can also be interpreted as a Bayesian network. We considered three circuits and their Bayesian network representation: Net1 (Listing 4); Net2; and Net3. Figure 12 in Appendix D depicts the Bayesian networks that can be derived from such circuits. In the following, we will refer to NetX as both the circuit and the Bayesian network without distinction.\nWe then compared CPB against three approaches specifically designed for dealing with uncertain probabilities in Bayesian networks: Subjective Bayesian Networks; Belief Networks; and Credal Networks.   ,\nwas first proposed in , and it is an uncertain Bayesian network where the conditionals are subjective opinions instead of dogmatic probabilities. In other words, the conditional probabilities are known within a beta distribution. SBN uses subjective belief propagation (SBP), which was introduced for trees in  and extended for singly-connected networks in , that extends the Belief Propagation (BP) inference method of . In BP, π𝜋\\pi- and λ𝜆\\lambda-messages are passed from parents and children, respectively, to a node, i.e., variable. The node uses these messages to formulate the inferred marginal probability of the corresponding variable. The node also uses these messages to determine the π𝜋\\pi- and λ𝜆\\lambda-messages to send to its children and parents, respectively. In SBP, the π𝜋\\pi- and λ𝜆\\lambda-messages are subjective opinions characterised by a projected probability and Dirichlet strength. The SBP formulation approximates output messages as beta-distributed random variables using the methods of moments and a first-order Taylor series approximation to determine the mean and variance of the output messages in light of the beta-distributed input messages. The details of the derivations are provided in  . [ref]53 introduced a computationally efficient method to reason over networks via Dempster-Shafer theory . It is an approximation of a valuation-based system. Namely, a (conditional) subjective opinion ωX=[bx,bx¯,uX]subscript𝜔𝑋subscript𝑏𝑥subscript𝑏¯𝑥subscript𝑢𝑋\\omega_{X}=[b_{x},b_{\\bar{x}},u_{X}] from our circuit obtained from data is converted to the following belief mass assignment:\nm​(x)=bx𝑚𝑥subscript𝑏𝑥m(x)=b_{x}, m​(x¯)=bx¯𝑚¯𝑥subscript𝑏¯𝑥m(\\bar{x})=b_{\\bar{x}} and m​(x∪x¯)=uX𝑚𝑥¯𝑥subscript𝑢𝑋m(x\\cup\\bar{x})=u_{X}. Note that in the binary case, the belief function overlaps with the belief mass assignment. The method exploits the disjunctive rule of combination to compose beliefs conditioned on the Cartesian product space of the binary power sets. This enables both forward propagation and backward propagation after inverting the belief conditionals via the generalized Bayes’ theorem (GBT). By operating in the Cartesian product space of the binary power sets, the computational complexity grows exponentially with respect to the number of parents. .\nA credal network over binary random variables extends a Bayesian network by replacing single probability values with closed intervals representing the possible range of probability values. The extension of Pearl’s message-passing algorithm by the 2U algorithm for credal networks is described in . This algorithm works by determining the maximum and minimum value (an interval) for each of the target probabilities based on the given input intervals. It turns out that these extreme values lie at the vertices of the polytope dictated by the extreme values of the input intervals. As a result, the computational complexity grows exponentially with respect to the number of parents nodes. For the sake of comparison, we assume that the random variables we label our circuts with and elicited from the given data corresponds to a credal network in the following way: if ωx=[bx,bx¯,uX]subscript𝜔𝑥subscript𝑏𝑥subscript𝑏¯𝑥subscript𝑢𝑋\\omega_{x}=[b_{x},b_{\\bar{x}},u_{X}] is a subjective opinion on the probability pxsubscript𝑝𝑥p_{x}, then we have [bx,bx+uX]subscript𝑏𝑥subscript𝑏𝑥subscript𝑢𝑋[b_{x},b_{x}+u_{X}] as an interval corresponding to this probability in the credal network. It should be noted that this mapping from the beta-distributed random variables to an interval is consistent with past studies of credal networks . As before,\nTable 6 provides the root mean square error (RMSE) between the projected probabilities and the ground truth probabilities for all the inferred query variables for Ni​n​ssubscript𝑁𝑖𝑛𝑠N_{ins} = 10, 50, 100, together with the RMSE predicted by taking the square root of the average variances from the inferred marginal beta distributions. Figure 9 plots the desired and actual significance levels for the confidence intervals (best closest to the diagonal). Figure 10 depicts the distribution of execution time for running the various algorithms, and Figure 11 the correlation of the Dirichlet strength between the golden standard, i.e. a Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 samples, and both CPB and MC varying the number of samples. Table 6 shows that CPB shares the best performance with the state-of-the-art SBN and 𝒮βsuperscript𝒮𝛽\\mathcal{S}^{\\beta} almost constantly. This is clearly a significant achievement considering that SBN is the state-of-the-art approach when dealing only with single connected Bayesian Networks with uncertain probabilities, while we can also handle much more complex problems.\nConsistently with Table 5, and also with , 𝒮βsuperscript𝒮𝛽\\mathcal{S}^{\\beta} has lower RMSE than 𝒮SLsubscript𝒮SL\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{SL}} and it\nseems that 𝒮βsuperscript𝒮𝛽\\mathcal{S}^{\\beta} overestimates the predicted RMSE and 𝒮SLsubscript𝒮SL\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{SL}} underestimates it as 𝒮SLsubscript𝒮SL\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{SL}} predicts smaller error than is realised and vice versa for 𝒮βsuperscript𝒮𝛽\\mathcal{S}^{\\beta}. From visual inspection of Figure 9, it is evident that CPB, SBN, and MC all are very close to the diagonal, thus correctly assessing their own epistemic uncertainty. 𝒮βsuperscript𝒮𝛽\\mathcal{S}^{\\beta} performance is heavily affected by the fact that it computes the conditional distributions at the very end of the process and it relies, in (33), on the assumption of independence. CPB, keeping track of the covariance between the various nodes in the circuits, does not suffer from this problem.\nThis positive result has been achieved without substantial deterioration of the performance in terms of execution time, as displayed in Figure 10, for which the same commentary of Figure 7 applies. Finally, Figure 11 depicts the correlation of the Dirichlet strength between the golden standard, i.e. a Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 samples, and both CPB and MC, this last one varying the number of samples used. Like for Figure 8, it is straightforward to see that MC improves the accuracy of its computed epistemic uncertainty when increasing the number of samples considered, approaching the same level of CPB when considering more than 200 samples, while CPB performs very closely to the optimal value of 1.\n\nReference markers found: [53]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]53: a first-order Taylor series approximation to determine the mean and variance of the output messages in light of the beta-distributed input messages.
