      "content": "Paper Title: DynamicEmbedding: Extending TensorFlow for Colossal-Scale Applications\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEver since DynamicEmbedding was first developed around early 2018, we have upgraded a number of popular models to enjoy ever growing feature size.\nThe following is a partial list of models we have built. The skip-gram model  is upgraded by replacing its input with our dynamic embedding layer (Sec. 3.1.1) and its output with our sampled logits layer (Sec. 3.1.2). It is therefore capable of mapping any word (n-grams), regardless of language, into the same high-dimensional vector space. This model can map any search query into an embedding to upgrade Google Search’s related search101010https://support.google.com/trends/answer/4355000?hl=en feature based on semantic rather than syntactic similarity. A seq2seq model predicts a sentence from another input sentence (e.g., in translation). Here we have upgraded the Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) model [ref]46 with attention mechanism to take a sequence of words as input (implemented by our dynamic embedding layer) and output a sequence of words (the output layer is implemented by our sampled logits layer). This model allows us to improve Google Translate by including a much larger vocabulary than previously used. This is in essence similar to the Google Transformer model , which considers input as a bag of words and the output is generated by a recurrent neural network with attention mechanism. Similar to the two models mention above, we replace both input and output of the original model with our corresponding new DynamicEmbedding components. We applied this model to suggest ad headlines and descriptions111111https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1704389?hl=en from sparse features on a website and it can cover all languages using a single model. The input to the model is an image and the output is a label (e.g. a phrase or a description). In our new model, we first let each image go through the Inception model [ref]39 and connect its output (an embedding of the image) to our sampled logits layer (Sec. 3.1.2). This way, our model can be trained on arbitrary (image, label) pairs. We have applied this model to suggest a very large set of image labels available from Google Image Search, whose distinct label set is in the order of hundreds of millions. An image is a highly structured input as it can always be normalized into a fixed size. However, there is a plethora of unstructured data in the world that contains multiple possible input sources. For example, a webpage may contain texts, tables, images organized in a hierarchical way and there are many potential labeling for its content.\nOur DE-Sparse2Label model maps each of the source labels (may contain an unknown number of sparse values) into an embedding using the CA-SEM model [ref]47 and let it go through a few ResNet-like layers (i.e., CA-RES model [ref]47) for further processing, then output a sparse label (e.g., a query that leads to this webpage). Here both the input and output use our DynamicEmbedding components to achieve ever-growing sparse feature size. This model has been successfully applied in our ad keyword suggestion system and its detail is discussed in Sec. 4.4. This is the DynamicEmbedding counterpart of the BERT model  for natural language processing (NLP), which no longer requires a predefined maximal input length (e.g., 512512512 or 102410241024) or preprocessing the input into wordpieces [ref]46. Our model is able to learn from any continuously growing text corpus (e.g. online articles) and accordingly an ever-growing embedding repository is maintained for various downstream NLP applications.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: rather than syntactic similarity.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
