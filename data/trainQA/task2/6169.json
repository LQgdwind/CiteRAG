The well-known text-based LLM s include GPT-1 [ref]254, BERT , XLNet , RoBERTa , ELECTRA , T5 , ALBERT , BART , and PEGASUS . These models can learn general language representations from large volumes of unlabelled text data through self-supervised learning and subsequently transfer this knowledge to specific tasks, which has been a major factor contributing to their success in NLP . Kaplan et al.  demonstrated that simply increasing the size of T-PTLMs can lead to improved performance . This finding has spurred the development of LLMs such as GPT-3 , PANGU , GShard , Switch-Transformers  and GPT-4 . With the advancement of the Transformer development , significant enhancements were achieved in handling sequential data. Leveraging the Transformer architecture, LLM s have been created as potent models with the capacity to generate text resembling human language. ChatGPT represents a distinct embodiment of an LLM, characterised by its remarkable performance that yields groundbreaking outcomes. The progression of LLM s, depicted in Figure 2, starts from the evolution of deep learning and transformer-based frameworks, culminating in the latest explosion of LLM s. We divide the LLM s into Encoder-only, Decoder-only, and Encoder-Decoder according to . In Encoder-only and Encoder-Decoder architectures, the model predicts masked words in a sentence while taking into account the surrounding context. While Decoder-only models are trained by generating the subsequent word in a sequence based on the preceding words. GPT-style language model belongs to the Decoder-only type. We also note that, there are advanced uses of LLMs (or advanced prompt engineering) by considering e.g., self-consistency , knowledge graph , generating programs as the intermediate reasoning steps , generating both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner , etc.\n\nReference markers found: [60]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]60: LLMs are\ndesigned to understand natural language and generate human-like responses to queries and prompts.\nAlmost all NLP tasks (e.g., language translation [ref]60, chatbots   and virtual assistants ) have witnessed tremendous success with Transformer-based pretrained language models (T-PTLMs), relying on Transformer , self-supervised learning   and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
