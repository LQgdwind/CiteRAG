FuzzyGAN provides a stability improvement of the GAN game by transforming the output of the generator from y^^𝑦\\hat{y} to providing probabilities of existing abstract features. DFL takes the probabilities and uses functions to map those probabilities to y^^𝑦\\hat{y}. Fuzzy logic has shown experimental success in regression settings–the improvement was further shown by the upgrade on GANs for regression demonstrated by Nguyen et al. [ref]44. DFL is an extension of fuzzy logic that includes strictly differentiable operators. DFL is composed of four main steps: calculating the t-norm, the t-conorm, the implications of those norms, then the aggregation of the implications .\nAdditionally, DFL defines new semantics extending traditional fuzzy logic semantics to vector embeddings. The vector embeddings can be further abstracted than the traditional semantics represented by words or phrases. A structure in DFL consists of a domain of discourse and an embedded interpretation. A DFL structure is a tuple S=⟨O,η,θ⟩𝑆𝑂𝜂𝜃S=\\langle O,\\eta,\\theta\\rangle, where O𝑂O is a finite but unbounded set called domain of discourse and every o∈O𝑜𝑂o\\in O is a d-dimensional vector, η:P×ℝW→(Om→ ):𝜂→𝑃superscriptℝ𝑊→superscript𝑂𝑚01\\eta:P\\times\\mathbb{R}^{W}\\rightarrow(O^{m}\\rightarrow ) is an (embedded) interpretation, and θ∈ℝW𝜃superscriptℝ𝑊\\theta\\in\\mathbb{R}^{W} are parameters. η𝜂\\eta maps predicate symbols p∈P𝑝𝑃p\\in P with arity m𝑚m to a function of m𝑚m objects to a truth value  01 . That is, η​(p,θ):Om→ :𝜂𝑝𝜃→superscript𝑂𝑚01\\eta(p,\\theta):O^{m}\\rightarrow . That is, objects in DFL semantics are d𝑑d-dimensional vectors of reals. The vectorized semantics are then used in the t-norm and t-conorm operators to resolve the network’s truthness.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: DFL is the fuzzy logic model used in FuzzyGAN [ref]44.
