Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: Unknown Sniffer for Object Detection: Don‚Äôt Turn a Blind Eye to Unknown Objects\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nQuantitative Analysis.\nIn Table 2,\nwe show UnSniffer‚Äôs result on the UOD-Benchmark,\nalong with the results of MSP [ref]16, Mahalanobis , Energy score [ref]24, ORE [ref]18, OW-DETR  and VOS .\nNote that OW-DETR is based on Deformable DETR  with a stronger discriminative power,\nwhile other methods use Faster-RCNN.\nSince U-PRE or U-REC cannot independently reflect the model‚Äôs performance,\nwe mainly employ U-AP, U-F1, AOSE and WI.\nObservably,\non the COCO-OOD dataset, the U-AP of UnSniffer outperforms the 2nd result by more than twice, and our U-F1 is 16.2% higher than the 2nd result,\nat the cost of a 1.9% drop in mAP on VOC compared to Faster-RCNN .\nOn the COCO-Mix dataset,\nthe UnSniffer still holds the lead in both U-AP and U-F1,\nwhich are 1% and 11.2% higher than the 2nd results, respectively.\nThose comparisons demonstrate that UnSniffer outperforms the existing methods in unknown object detection,\nwhich  is owed to to our GOC learning the overall confidence of objects from finite known objects.\nFurthermore, UnSniffer has the smallest AOSE (398) but the largest WI (0.175),\nwhich can be explained by the inverse relationship between WI and the count of known objects misclassified as an incorrect class.\nMore details are illustrated in the supplementary material. Qualitative Analysis.\n\nFig. 7 visualizes the results of different methods on example images of the COCO-Mix (first two rows) and COCO-OOD dataset (last three rows).\nIt can be seen that VOS , MSP [ref]16, Mahalanobis distance , and Energy score [ref]24 miss many objects of the unknown class,\nsuch as the surfboards in the 1s‚Äãtsuperscript1ùë†ùë°1^{st} image,\nthe keyboard and water cup in the 3r‚Äãdsuperscript3ùëüùëë3^{rd} image,\nthe CD case in the 4t‚Äãhsuperscript4ùë°‚Ñé4^{th} image.\nTheir failure is due to the suppression of unknown objects in training.\nFor the OWOD methods,\nORE and OW-DETR generate too many predicted object boxes on almost all images.\nMost predictions are false positives.\nIn contrast,\nUnSniffer does not miss any unknown objects because we give reasonable GOC scores to all unknown objects.\nMoreover, using graph-based box determination,\nUnSniffer reliably predicts a single bounding box for each object even if two or more objects overlap (See the 4th row).\nMore results are available in the supplementary material.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: Quantitative Analysis.\nIn Table 2,\nwe show UnSniffer‚Äôs result on the UOD-Benchmark,\nalong with the results of MSP [ref]16, Mahalanobis , Energy score [ref]24, ORE [ref]18, OW-DETR  and VOS .\nNote that OW-DETR is based on Deformable DETR  with a stronger discriminative power,\nwhile other methods use\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
