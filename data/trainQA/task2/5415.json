      "content": "Paper Title: Part\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDistillation as a probability matching process.\nDistillation has been touted to be a process that benefits from matching the teacher’s probabilities . Indeed, many distillation algorithms have been designed in a way to more aggressively match the student and teacher functions  . Theoretical analyses too rely on explaining the benefits of distillation based on a student that obediently matches the teacher’s probabilities . But, building on Stanton et al. [ref]47, our work demonstrates why we may desire that the student deviate from the teacher, in certain systematic ways. Theories of distillation.\nA long-standing intuition for why distillation helps is that the teacher’s probabilities contain “dark knowledge” about class similarities  ,\nSeveral works   [ref]43 7 have formalized these similarities via inherently noisy class memberships. However, some works  3  have argued that\nthis\nhypothesis cannot be the sole explanation, because distillation can help even if the student is only taught information about the target probabilities (e.g., by smoothing out all non-target probabilities). This has resulted in various alternative hypotheses. Some have proposed\nfaster convergence    which only explains why the student would converge fast to teacher, but not why it may deviate from and supersede a one-hot teacher.\nAnother line of work casts distillation as a regularizer,\neither in the sense of Mobahi et al.  or in the sense of instance-specific label smoothing 6 3 .\nAnother interesting hypothesis is that distillation induces better feature learning or conditioning   2, likely in the early parts of training. This effect however is not general enough to appear in convex linear settings, where distillation can help. Furthermore, it is unclear if this is relevant in the CIFAR100 setting, where we find that switching to KD much later during training is sufficient to see gains in distillation (§E). Orthogonally,  suggest that distillation results in flatter minima, which may lead to better generalization. Finally, we also refer the reader to  5 0 who theoretically study distillation in orthogonal settings. Early-stopping and knowledge distillation. Early-stopping has received much attention in the context of distillation  [ref]43   . We build on Dong et al. , who argue how early-stopping a GD-trained teacher can automatically denoise the labels due to regularization in the eigenspace. However, these works do not provide an argument for why distillation can outperform the teacher. Empirical studies of distillation. Our study crucially builds on observations from [ref]47  demonstrating student-teacher deviations in an aggregated sense than in a sample-wise sense.\nOther studies   investigate how the student is similar to the teacher in terms of out-of-distribution behavior, calibration, and so on.\nDeng and Zhang 1 show how a smaller student can outperform the teacher when allowed to match the teacher on more data, which is orthogonal to our setting.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: teacher functions  . Theoretical analyses too rely on explaining the benefits of distillation based on a student that obediently matches the teacher’s probabilities . But, building on Stanton et al.
