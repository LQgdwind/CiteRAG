      "content": "Paper Title: Coded sparse matrix computation schemes that leverage partial stragglers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSeveral coded computation schemes have been proposed for matrix multiplication  3  [ref]2 4   1 5 , most of which are designed to mitigate the full stragglers; see 6 for a tutorial overview. We illustrate the basic idea below using the polynomial code approach of  for a system with n=5𝑛5n=5 workers where each of these worker nodes can store γA=12subscript𝛾𝐴12\\gamma_{A}=\\frac{1}{2} fraction of matrix 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} and γB=12subscript𝛾𝐵12\\gamma_{B}=\\frac{1}{2} fraction of matrix 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B}. Consider u=v=2𝑢𝑣2u=v=2 and p=1𝑝1p=1, thus we partition both 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} and 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} into two block-columns 𝐀0,𝐀1subscript𝐀0subscript𝐀1\\mathbf{A}_{0},\\mathbf{A}_{1} and 𝐁0,𝐁1subscript𝐁0subscript𝐁1\\mathbf{B}_{0},\\mathbf{B}_{1} respectively. Next, we define two matrix polynomials as The master node evaluates these polynomial 𝐀​(z)𝐀𝑧\\mathbf{A}(z) and 𝐁​(z)𝐁𝑧\\mathbf{B}(z) at distinct real values z0,z1,…,zn−1subscript𝑧0subscript𝑧1…subscript𝑧𝑛1z_{0},z_{1},\\dots,z_{n-1}, and sends the corresponding matrices to worker node Wisubscript𝑊𝑖W_{i}. Each worker node computes the product of its assigned submatrices. It follows that decoding at the master node is equivalent to decoding a degree-3 real-valued polynomial. Thus, the master node can recover 𝐀T​𝐁superscript𝐀𝑇𝐁\\mathbf{A}^{T}\\mathbf{B} as soon as it receives the results from any four workers, i.e., in this example, the recovery threshold is, τ=4𝜏4\\tau=4. When γA=1/kAsubscript𝛾𝐴1subscript𝑘𝐴\\gamma_{A}=1/k_{A} and γB=1/kBsubscript𝛾𝐵1subscript𝑘𝐵\\gamma_{B}=1/k_{B} and p=1𝑝1p=1, the work of 3 shows that their scheme has a threshold τ=kA​kB𝜏subscript𝑘𝐴subscript𝑘𝐵\\tau=k_{A}k_{B} which is optimal. Random coding solutions for this problem were investigated in 7. Approaches based on convolutional coding were presented in 0 8. In these schemes (analogous to linear block codes) there are systematic workers that only contain uncoded assignments and parity workers that contain coded assignments. The case when p>1𝑝1p>1 was considered in the work of [ref]2 4 3 5. Structuring the computation in this manner increases the computational load on the workers and the communication load from the workers to the master node but can reduce the recovery threshold as compared to the case of p=1𝑝1p=1. It is well-recognized that in several practical situations the underlying matrices 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} and 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} are sparse. Computing the inner product 𝐚T​𝐱superscript𝐚𝑇𝐱\\mathbf{a}^{T}\\mathbf{x} of n𝑛n-length vectors 𝐚𝐚\\mathbf{a} and 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} where 𝐚𝐚\\mathbf{a} has around δ​n𝛿𝑛\\delta n (0<δ≪10𝛿much-less-than10<\\delta\\ll 1) non-zero entries takes ≈2​δ​nabsent2𝛿𝑛\\approx 2\\delta n floating point operations (flops) as compared to ≈2​nabsent2𝑛\\approx 2n flops in the dense case. In general, the encoding process within coded computation increases the number of non-zero entries in the resultant encoded matrices. For instance, polynomial evaluations of degree d𝑑d will increase the number of non-zero entries by approximately d𝑑d times. This results in a d𝑑d-fold increase in the worker computation times which can be unacceptably high. Thus, it is important to consider schemes where the encoding only combines a limited number of submatrices. Consider an example with two large sparse matrices 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} and 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} both of whose sizes are 10,000×10,000100001000010,000\\times 10,000. Both of them have sparsity σ=3%𝜎percent3\\sigma=3\\%, i.e., randomly chosen approximately 3%percent33\\% entries of 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} and 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} are non-zero (we have used MATLAB command sprand for this example). We partition matrices 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} and 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} into 444 and 555 block-columns, respectively. First we choose a block-column 𝐀isubscript𝐀𝑖\\mathbf{A}_{i} and a block-column 𝐁jsubscript𝐁𝑗\\mathbf{B}_{j}, and next we obtain two coded submatrices 𝐀~isubscript~𝐀𝑖\\tilde{\\mathbf{A}}_{i} and 𝐁~jsubscript~𝐁𝑗\\tilde{\\mathbf{B}}_{j} which are random linear combinations of the uncoded block-columns of 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} and 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B}, respectively. Table I shows that it is around 444 times more expensive to compute the coded product than the uncoded product, although the sizes of the corresponding matrices are exactly the same. The reason is that the number of non-zero entries in the coded submatrices have gone up significantly. An important aspect of coded computation is “numerical stability” of the recovered result. Indeed, while coded computation borrows techniques from classical coding theory (over finite fields), it differs in the sense that the coded submatrices and the decoding operates over the reals. Over finite fields, the invertibility of a matrix is sufficient to solve a system of equations. In contrast, over the reals if the corresponding matrix is ill-conditioned, then the recovery will in general be inaccurate. It is well-recognized that real Vandermonde matrices corresponding to polynomial interpolation have condition numbers that grow exponentially in the matrix sizes. This is a serious issue with the polynomial-based approaches of , 9. There have been some works that have addressed these issues 0 2 7     in part. Yet another feature of the coded computation problem that distinguishes it from classical codes is the processing order. The worker nodes process the assigned tasks in a specific order, such that if a worker node is processing a given task, it has already completed the previously assigned tasks. Thus, at any given time the pattern of tasks that have been completed is restricted. Interestingly, codes for such systems have been investigated in  . These ideas were adapted for the distributed matrix-vector multiplication problem in 2. We note here that in principle using polynomial approaches can allow us to address both the optimal threshold and the optimal Q/Δ=1𝑄Δ1Q/\\Delta=1 by simply placing multiple evaluations of the polynomials at distinct points within each worker node. However, this approach is not practical, firstly because of numerical stability issues. Secondly, as discussed above when considering sparse 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} and 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} matrices, the polynomial approaches result in dense coded submatrices which can cause an unacceptable increase in the worker node computation times. Numerical experiments supporting these conclusions can be found in Section VI.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Several coded computation schemes have been proposed for matrix multiplication  3  [ref]2 4   1 5 , most of which are designed to mitigate the full stragglers; see 6 for a tutorial overview.
