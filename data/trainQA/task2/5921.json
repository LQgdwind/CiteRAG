      "content": "Paper Title: AMS-DRL: Learning Multi-Pursuit Evasion for Safe Targeted Navigation of Drones\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nObstacle avoidance aims to achieve designed objectives (e.g., reaching the destination) while subjecting to non-intersection or non-collision constraints. Obstacle avoidance is a basic requirement for intelligent drones to fly through cluttered environments. From the perspective of how drones generate control commands, existing obstacle avoidance can be categorized into indirect methods and end-to-end methods. Indirect methods [ref]7 [ref]5  [ref]26  generally divide the obstacle avoidance problem into several subtasks, namely perception, localizing and planning. The states of obstacles, such as shape, position, and velocity, are detected and localized before a maneuver is performed. Once obstacles are located, the drone can generate a feasible path or take action to avoid the obstacles. Within the indirect methods, planning can be further divided into two categories: one is offline methods based on high-resolution maps and pre-known position information, such as Dijkstra’s algorithm , A⋆  and sequential convex optimization ; the other one is online methods based on real-time decision-making. Online methods can be further categorized into the online path planning [ref]5  [ref]26 and the artificial potential field (APF) methods  [ref]7. Currently, due to the advantages of optimization and prediction capabilities, online path planning methods have become the preferred choice for drone obstacle avoidance. For instance, Zhou Boyu et al.[ref]5 introduced Fast-Planner for a drone to perform high-speed flight in an unknown cluttered environment. The key contributions are a robust and efficient planning scheme incorporating path searching, B-spline optimization, and time adjustment to generate feasible and safe trajectories for drones’ obstacle avoidance. However, these online path planning methods necessitate onboard complex optimization computation to obtain a local or global optimal trajectory. In contrast to online path planning, the APF methods require fewer computation resources and can well cope with dynamic obstacle avoidance using limited sensor information. Falanga et al. [ref]7 developed an efficient and fast control strategy based on APF to avoid fast-approaching dynamic obstacles. However, the repulsive forces computed only reach substantial values when the obstacle is very close, which may lead to unstable and jagged behavior. Besides, APF methods are heuristic methods that cannot guarantee global optimization and robustness for drones. Hence, it is not ideal to adopt APF methods for drones to evade pursuers. Compared to the indirect methods, end-to-end methods      exploit Reinforcement Learning (RL) to map the perception to actions directly. Reinforcement learning  is a technique for mapping the state (observation) space to the action space in order to maximize a long-term return with given rewards. A typical RL model features agents, the environment, reward functions, action, and state space. The policy model achieves the convergent status via constant interactions between the agents and the environment, where the reward function guides the training process. Malik et al.  presented an end-to-end reinforcement learning approach called NAVREN-RL to navigate a quadrotor drone in an indoor environment with expert data and knowledge-based data aggregation. The reward function in  was formulated from a ground truth depth image and a generated depth image. Loquercio et al.  developed an end-to-end approach that can autonomously guide a quadrotor drone through complex wild and human-made environments at high speeds with purely onboard visual perception and computation. The neural network policy was trained in a high-fidelity simulation environment with massive expert knowledge data. While the aforementioned end-to-end methods provide a straightforward way to generate obstacle avoidance policies for drones, they require massive training data to obtain acceptable generalization capabilities. Meanwhile, without the evolutionary environment, it is challenging for these designed neural network policies to update their weights to evade intelligent pursuers.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: cluttered environments.
