      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Data Augmentation with Online Bilevel Optimization for Image Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConsider a labeled set 𝒳:={xi,yi}i=1Nassign𝒳subscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖𝑁𝑖1\\mathcal{X}:=\\{x_{i},y_{i}\\}^{N}_{i=1}, where xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} is an input image, yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i} the associated class label, N the number of samples and 𝒳^^𝒳\\hat{\\mathcal{X}} the set of transformed images. We formulate the problem of identifying effective data augmentation transformations as a bilevel optimization problem. In this setup, the augmenter 𝒜θ:𝒳→𝒳^:subscript𝒜𝜃→𝒳^𝒳\\mathcal{A}_{\\theta}:\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow{\\hat{\\mathcal{X}}} is parametrized by θ𝜃{\\theta} and is used to minimize the loss ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} on the validation data 𝒳v​a​lsubscript𝒳𝑣𝑎𝑙\\mathcal{X}_{val} in the outer loop. In the inner loop, the classifier parameters ω𝜔\\omega are optimized on the training data 𝒳t​rsubscript𝒳𝑡𝑟\\mathcal{X}_{tr} in the standard supervised way. This formulation can be written as: While optimizing a few hyperparameters on the validation data is feasible with black-box approaches such as grid and random search  or Bayesian optimization 7, it is not efficient. With bilevel optimization, our aim is to efficiently learn an entire neural network 𝒜θsubscript𝒜𝜃\\mathcal{A}_{\\theta} (possibly with thousands of parameters θ𝜃\\theta) which defines a distribution of transformations that should be applied on the training data to improve generalization. Gradient descent was shown to be an efficient method for optimizing parameters of large networks. In problems such as architecture search [ref]31, the parameters can be directly optimized with gradient descent (or second order methods) against the training and validation data.\nHowever, this is not the case for data augmentation. The reason is that the transformation network 𝒜θsubscript𝒜𝜃\\mathcal{A}_{\\theta} is optimized to maximize the validation score, but applies transformations only on the training set. Therefore, first order methods would not work. The aim of data augmentation is to introduce transformations during the training phase that can make the model invariant or partially invariant to any transformations that can occur at test time. If we optimize the transformation network directly on the validation data, the model will simply select trivial solutions such as the identity transformation. This approach has been used for object localization  and it did not improve the model generalization performance as much as data augmentation.\nTo solve this issue, new methods relied on reinforcement learning instead of gradient descent to learn effective data augmentation  [ref]29 . In this work, we show that in the case of a differentiable augmenter 𝒜θsubscript𝒜𝜃\\mathcal{A}_{\\theta}, there is a simple, efficient way to find optimal data transformations based on gradient descent that generalize well on validation data. We formulate our problem as an approximation to bilevel optimization by using truncated back-propagation as it allows our method to:\ni) efficiently estimate a large number of parameters to generate the optimal data augmentation transformations by gradient descent;\nii) obtain an online estimation of the optimal data augmentation during the different phases of the training, which can also be beneficial ;\niii) change the training data to adapt to different validation conditions as in supervised domain adaptation.\nAlthough approximate bilevel optimization has already been proposed for hyperparameter optimization 5  , in this paper we show that it can be used for training a large, complex model (the augmenter 𝒜θsubscript𝒜𝜃\\mathcal{A}_{\\theta} network) in order to learn an effective distribution of transformations.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: be applied on the training data to improve generalization.
