      "content": "Paper Title: Robust Reinforcement Learning in Continuous Control Tasks with Uncertainty Set Regularization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRobust MDPs.\n\nThe mathematical framework of Robust MDPs   extends regular MDPs in order to deal with uncertainty about the transition function.\nA Robust MDP can be formulated as a 6-tuple ⟨𝒮,𝒜,ℙ,r,μ0,γ⟩𝒮𝒜ℙ𝑟subscript𝜇0𝛾\\langle\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{A},\\mathbb{P},r,\\mu_{0},\\gamma\\rangle, where 𝒮,𝒜𝒮𝒜\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{A} stand for the state and action space respectively, and r​(s,a):𝒮×𝒜→ℝ:𝑟𝑠𝑎→𝒮𝒜ℝr(s,a):\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\to\\mathbb{R} stands for the reward function. Let Δ𝒮subscriptΔ𝒮\\Delta_{\\mathcal{S}} and Δ𝒜subscriptΔ𝒜\\Delta_{\\mathcal{A}} be the probability measure on S𝑆S and A𝐴A respectively. The initial state is sampled from an initial distribution μ0∈Δ𝒮subscript𝜇0subscriptΔ𝒮\\mu_{0}\\in\\Delta_{\\mathcal{S}}, and the future rewards are discounted by the discount factor γ∈ 𝛾01\\gamma\\in .\nThe most important concept in robust MDPs is the uncertainty set ℙ={P​(s′|s,a)}ℙ𝑃conditionalsuperscript𝑠′𝑠𝑎\\mathbb{P}=\\left\\{P(s^{\\prime}|s,a)\\right\\} that controls the variation of transition function P:𝒮×𝒜→Δ𝒮:𝑃→𝒮𝒜subscriptΔ𝒮P:\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\to\\Delta_{\\mathcal{S}}, compared with the stationary transition function P𝑃P in regular MDPs. Let Π={π(a|s):𝒮→Δ𝒜}\\Pi=\\left\\{\\pi(a|s):\\mathcal{S}\\to\\Delta_{\\mathcal{A}}\\right\\} be the policy space; the objective of Robust RL can then be formulated as a minimax problem such that Robust Bellman Equation.\n\nWhile Wiesemann et al.  has proved NP-hardness of this mini-max problem with an arbitrary uncertainty set, most recent studies  [ref]9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 approximate it by assuming a rectangular structure on the uncertainty set, i.e., ℙ=×(s,a)∈𝒮×𝒜ℙs​a,where​ℙs​a={P​(s′|s,a)Ps​a​(s′) in short}formulae-sequenceℙsubscript𝑠𝑎𝒮𝒜subscriptℙ𝑠𝑎wheresubscriptℙ𝑠𝑎𝑃conditionalsuperscript𝑠′𝑠𝑎Psa(s′) in short\\mathbb{P}=\\mathop{\\times}_{(s,a)\\in\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}}\\mathbb{P}_{sa},{\\rm where}\\ \\mathbb{P}_{sa}=\\{P(s^{\\prime}|s,a)\\quad\\text{$P_{sa}(s^{\\prime})$ in short}\\} denotes the local uncertainty of the transition at (s,a)𝑠𝑎(s,a). In other words, the variation of transition is independent at every (s,a)𝑠𝑎(s,a) pair. Under the assumption of a rectangular uncertainty set, the robust action value Qπ​(s,a)superscript𝑄𝜋𝑠𝑎Q^{\\pi}(s,a) under policy π𝜋\\pi must satisfy the following robust version of the Bellman equation 7 such that where Vπ​(s′)=∑a′π​(a′|s′)​Qπ​(s′,a′)superscript𝑉𝜋superscript𝑠′subscriptsuperscript𝑎′𝜋conditionalsuperscript𝑎′superscript𝑠′superscript𝑄𝜋superscript𝑠′superscript𝑎′V^{\\pi}(s^{\\prime})=\\sum_{a^{\\prime}}\\pi(a^{\\prime}|s^{\\prime})Q^{\\pi}(s^{\\prime},a^{\\prime}). Nilim and Ghaoui 1 have shown that a robust Bellman operator admits a unique fixed point of Equation 2, the robust action value Qπ​(s,a)superscript𝑄𝜋𝑠𝑎Q^{\\pi}(s,a). Robustness-Regularization Duality.\n\nSolving the minimization problem in the RHS of Equation 2 can be further simplified by the Legendre-Fenchel transform 8. For an arbitrary function f:X→ℝ:𝑓→𝑋ℝf:X\\to\\mathbb{R}, its convex conjugate is f∗​(x∗):=sup{⟨x∗,x⟩−f​(x):x∈X}assignsuperscript𝑓superscript𝑥supremumconditional-setsuperscript𝑥𝑥𝑓𝑥𝑥𝑋f^{*}\\left(x^{*}\\right):=\\sup\\left\\{\\left\\langle x^{*},x\\right\\rangle-f(x)~{}\\colon~{}x\\in X\\right\\}. Define δℙs​a​(Ps​a)=0subscript𝛿subscriptℙ𝑠𝑎subscript𝑃𝑠𝑎0\\delta_{\\mathbb{P}_{sa}}(P_{sa})=0 if Ps​a∈ℙs​asubscript𝑃𝑠𝑎subscriptℙ𝑠𝑎P_{sa}\\in{\\mathbb{P}_{sa}} and +∞+\\infty otherwise, Equation 2 can be transformed to its convex conjugate (refer to Derman et al. 0 for detailed derivation) such that The transformation implies that the robustness condition on transitions can be equivalently expressed as a regularization term on the value function, which is referred to as the robustness-regularization duality. The duality can extensively reduce the cost of solving the minimization problem over infinite transition choices and thus is widely studied in the robust reinforcement learning research community 9  . As a special case, Derman et al. 0 considered a L2subscript𝐿2L_{2} norm uncertainty set on transitions, i.e., ℙs​a={P¯s​a+α​P~s​a:‖P~s​a‖2≤1}subscriptℙ𝑠𝑎conditional-setsubscript¯𝑃𝑠𝑎𝛼subscript~𝑃𝑠𝑎subscriptnormsubscript~𝑃𝑠𝑎21\\mathbb{P}_{sa}=\\{\\bar{P}_{sa}+\\alpha\\tilde{P}_{sa}:\\|\\tilde{P}_{sa}\\|_{2}\\leq 1\\}, where P¯s​asubscript¯𝑃𝑠𝑎\\bar{P}_{sa} is usually called the nominal transition model. It can represent the prior knowledge of a transition model or a numerical value of the training environment. The uncertainty set implies that the transition model is allowed to fluctuate around the nominal model with some degree α𝛼\\alpha. Therefore, the corresponding Bellman equation in Equation 3 becomes Qπ​(s,a)=r​(s,a)+γ​∑s′P¯s​a​(s′)​Vπ​(s′)−α​‖Vπ​(⋅)‖2superscript𝑄𝜋𝑠𝑎𝑟𝑠𝑎𝛾subscriptsuperscript𝑠′subscript¯𝑃𝑠𝑎superscript𝑠′superscript𝑉𝜋superscript𝑠′𝛼subscriptnormsuperscript𝑉𝜋⋅2Q^{\\pi}(s,a)=r(s,a)+\\gamma\\sum_{s^{\\prime}}\\bar{P}_{sa}(s^{\\prime})V^{\\pi}(s^{\\prime})-\\alpha\\|V^{\\pi}(\\cdot)\\|_{2}. Similarly, the L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} norm has also been used as uncertainty set on transitions 4, i.e., ℙs​a={P¯s​a+α​P~s​a:‖P~s​a‖1≤1}subscriptℙ𝑠𝑎conditional-setsubscript¯𝑃𝑠𝑎𝛼subscript~𝑃𝑠𝑎subscriptnormsubscript~𝑃𝑠𝑎11\\mathbb{P}_{sa}=\\{\\bar{P}_{sa}+\\alpha\\tilde{P}_{sa}:\\|\\tilde{P}_{sa}\\|_{1}\\leq 1\\}, and the Bellman equation becomes the form such that Qπ​(s,a)=r​(s,a)+γ​∑s′P¯s​a​(s′)​Vπ​(s′)−α​maxs′⁡|Vπ​(s′)|superscript𝑄𝜋𝑠𝑎𝑟𝑠𝑎𝛾subscriptsuperscript𝑠′subscript¯𝑃𝑠𝑎superscript𝑠′superscript𝑉𝜋superscript𝑠′𝛼subscriptsuperscript𝑠′superscript𝑉𝜋superscript𝑠′Q^{\\pi}(s,a)=r(s,a)+\\gamma\\sum_{s^{\\prime}}\\bar{P}_{sa}(s^{\\prime})V^{\\pi}(s^{\\prime})-\\alpha\\max_{s^{\\prime}}|V^{\\pi}(s^{\\prime})|. This robustness-regularization duality works well in the finite state space but the extension to the infinite state space is still a question. We claim that such an extension is non-trivial, since both regularizers ‖Vπ​(⋅)‖2subscriptnormsuperscript𝑉𝜋⋅2\\|V^{\\pi}(\\cdot)\\|_{2} and maxs′⁡|Vπ​(s′)|subscriptsuperscript𝑠′superscript𝑉𝜋superscript𝑠′\\max_{s^{\\prime}}|V^{\\pi}(s^{\\prime})| need to be calculated on the infinite-dimensional vector Vπ​(⋅)superscript𝑉𝜋⋅V^{\\pi}(\\cdot).\nIn this work, we extend this concept to the continuous state space which is a critical characteristic in robotics.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: be formulated as a minimax problem such that Robust Bellman Equation.\n\nWhile Wiesemann et al.  has proved NP-hardness of this mini-max problem with an arbitrary uncertainty set, most recent studies  [ref]9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 approximate it by assuming a rectangular structure on the uncertainty set, i.e., ℙ=×(s,a)∈𝒮×𝒜ℙs​a,where​ℙs​a={P​(s′|s,a)Ps​a​(s′) in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
