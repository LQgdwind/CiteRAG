      "content": "Paper Title: Temporal Difference Learning with Compressed Updates: Error-Feedback meets Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCompressed TD(0) Algorithm with Error-Feedback. We develop a general framework for analyzing iterative compressed stochastic approximation (SA) algorithms with error-feedback. The generality of this framework stems from two salient features: (i) it applies to nonlinear SA with Markovian noise; and (ii) the compression operator covers several common quantization and (biased) sparsification schemes studied in optimization. As an instance of our framework, we propose a new algorithm called EF-TD (Algo.¬†1) to study extreme distortions to the TD(0) update direction. Examples of such distortion include, but are not limited to, replacing each coordinate of the TD(0) update direction with just its sign, or just retaining the coordinate with the largest magnitude. While such distortions have been extensively studied for SGD, we are unaware of any analagous algorithms or analysis in RL. Analysis for the i.i.d. setting. To build key insights, we start by analyzing EF-TD in two simplified scenarios: (i) a deterministic mean-path setting that captures the steady-state behavior of the underlying Markov chain (Theorem 1); and (ii) an i.i.d. noise setting that is common in RL¬†(Theorem 2). In the latter case, we show that with a constant step-size, EF-TD guarantees linear convergence to a ball centered around the optimal parameter. For the deterministic case, there is no residual error. Up to a compression factor, the exponent of linear convergence matches known rates in RL. Moreover, the effect of the compression factor exactly mirrors that for compressed SGD. Collectively, Theorems 1 and 2 are significant in that they are the first set of theoretical results about the robustness of TD learning algorithms to structured perturbations. Arriving at these results requires some work. In particular, we cannot directly appeal to existing analyses of compression in optimization since the problems we study do not involve minimizing a static loss function. Our analysis crucially hinges on studying the drift of a novel Lyapunov function that accounts for the joint dynamics of the parameter and the memory variable introduced by error-feedback. Analysis for the Markov setting. In Theorem 3, we provide the first result in RL that accounts for general compression operators and error-feedback in tandem with linear function approximation and Markovian sampling. Our result mirrors existing rates without compression¬†. A non-asymptotic analysis of even vanilla TD(0) under Markovian sampling is known to be challenging due to complex temporal correlations. Our setting is further complicated by the fact that the dynamics of the parameter and the memory variable are intricately coupled with the temporally-correlated Markov data tuples. This leads to a complex stochastic dynamical system that has not been analyzed before in RL. Providing a comprehensive finite-time analysis of this system is one of the most significant contributions of our work. In our next set of contributions, we significantly generalize our results to more involved settings. Extension to Nonlinear Stochastic Approximation. In Section 6, we study Algo.¬†1 in its full generality by considering a compressed nonlinear SA scheme with error-feedback, and establishing an analog of Theorem 3 in Theorem 4. This result is significant for two main reasons. First, since the nonlinear SA scheme we study captures certain instances of Q-learning¬†[ref]16, it shows that our results extend gracefully beyond policy evaluation to decision-making problems as well. Second, Theorem 4 reveals that the power and scope of the popular error-feedback mechanism¬†[ref]2 in large-scale ML extends well beyond the optimization problems it has been used for thus far. Extension to Multi-Agent Settings. Since one of our main motivations is to facilitate communication-efficient MARL, we propose a multi-agent version of EF-TD where MùëÄM agents interacting with the same MDP exchange compressed TD(0) directions via a central server. Furthermore, each agent runs a local error-correction scheme. In Theorem 5, we prove that by collaborating, each agent can achieve an MùëÄM-fold speedup in the dominant term of the convergence rate. Importantly, with a carefully chosen Lyapunov function, we show that the effect of compression only shows up in higher-order terms, leaving the dominant term unaffected. This implies that even with extreme compression (e.g., transmitting just O~‚Äã(1)~ùëÇ1\\tilde{O}(1) bits per-agent per-round), one can preserve the same asymptotic rates as vanilla TD(0), while achieving an optimal linear convergence speedup w.r.t. the number of agents. We envision that this result will have important implications for MARL. Additionally, we perform simulations that reveal: (i) without error-feedback, compressed TD(0) can end up making little to no progress; and (ii) with error-feedback, the performance of compressed TD(0) complies with our theory. In what follows, we briefly outline some related work; a more detailed description can be found in the Appendix. Related Work. A variety of both scalar¬†[ref]2   , and vector¬†  quantization schemes have been explored for optimization. When the output of the compression operator is not an unbiased version of its argument, naively compressing gradients can lead to diverging iterates¬†[ref]19 . In¬† , and later in ¬†[ref]19 , it was shown that the above issue could be ‚Äúfixed‚Äù by using a mechanism known as error-feedback that exploits memory. This idea is also related to modulation techniques in coding theory¬†. Our work can be seen as the first analog of the above results in general, and the error-feedback idea in particular, in the context of online, iterative algorithms for RL.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: and establishing an analog of Theorem 3 in Theorem 4.
