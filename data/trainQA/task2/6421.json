      "content": "Paper Title: Adaptive Ensemble Q-learning: Minimizing Estimation Bias via Error Feedback\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIt is known that the determination of the optimal ensemble size is highly nontrivial, and a poor choice of the ensemble size would degrade the performance of ensemble Q-learning significantly .\nAs mentioned earlier, it is unclear a priori if a fixed ensemble size should be used in the learning process. In what follows, we use an example to illustrate the potential pitfalls in the ensemble methods by examining the sensitivity of the estimation bias to the ensemble size  . Along the same line as in , we consider an example with a real-valued continuous state space. In this example, there are two discrete actions available at each state and the optimal action values depend only on the state, i.e., in each state both actions result in the same optimal value Q∗​(s,⋅)superscript𝑄𝑠⋅Q^{*}(s,\\cdot), which is assumed to be Q∗​(s,⋅)=sin⁡(s)superscript𝑄𝑠⋅𝑠Q^{*}(s,\\cdot)=\\sin(s). Figure 2 demonstrates how the ensemble method is carried out in four stages: (I) For each Q-function approximator Qisuperscript𝑄𝑖Q^{i}, i=1,2,⋯,5𝑖12⋯5i=1,2,\\cdots,5, we first generate 10 noisy action-value samples independently (green dots in Figure 2(a)). Let ei​(s,a)superscript𝑒𝑖𝑠𝑎e^{i}(s,a) denote the approximation error of Qisuperscript𝑄𝑖Q^{i}: where τi∼𝒰​(0,τ)similar-tosubscript𝜏𝑖𝒰0𝜏\\tau_{i}\\sim\\mathcal{U}(0,\\tau) models the approximation error distribution for the i𝑖i-th approximator. Note that the assumption on the uniform error distribution is commonly used to indicate that both positive and negative approximation error are possible in Q-function approximators . (II) Next, Figure 2(b) illustrates the ensemble (N=5𝑁5N=5) of approximators for two actions, where each approximator is a 666-degree polynomial that fits the noisy values at sampled states. (III) Following the same ensemble approach in , we randomly choose M𝑀M approximators from the ensemble and take the minimum over them to obtain a proxy approximator for each action, resulting in\nthe dashed lines in Figure 2(c). (IV) Finally, the maximum action value of the proxy approximator is used as the target to update the current approximators. To evaluate the target value estimation error, Figure 2(d) depicts the difference between the obtained target value and the underlying true value when using different ensemble size M𝑀M. As in , we utilize the average estimation error (i.e., estimation bias) to quantify the performance of current approximators. For example, when the ensemble size M=2𝑀2M=2, the red line is above zero for most states, implying the overestimation tendency in the target. Clearly, Figure 2(d) indicates that the estimation bias is highly dependent on the ensemble size, and even a change of M𝑀M can lead the shift from overestimation to underestimation.\nSince the Q-function approximation error of each approximator changes over time in the training process [ref]5 (examples for this phenomenon can be found in Appendix B.3), we next analyze the impact of the ensemble size on the estimation bias under different approximation error distributions. As shown in Figure 3(a), with a fixed ensemble size M𝑀M, the estimation bias may shift between positive and negative and be ‘dramatically’ large for some error distributions. In light of this observation, departing from using a fixed size, we advocate to adapt the in-target ensemble size, e.g., set M=4𝑀4M=4 when the noise parameter τ>1.5𝜏1.5\\tau>1.5 and M=3𝑀3M=3 otherwise. The estimation bias resulted by this adaptation mechanism is much closer to zero. Besides, Figure 3(b) characterizes the estimation bias under different action spaces, which is also important considering that different tasks normally have different action spaces and the number of available actions may vary in different states even for the same task. The adaptive ensemble approach is clearly more robust in our setting. In a nutshell, both Figure 3(a) and 3(b) suggest that a fixed ensemble size would not work well to minimize the estimation bias during learning for different tasks. This phenomenon has also been observed in the empirical results . In stark contrast, adaptively changing the ensemble size based on the approximation error indeed can help to reduce the estimation bias in different settings.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: size, and even a change of M𝑀M can lead the shift from overestimation to underestimation.\nSince the Q-function approximation error of each approximator changes over time in the training process [ref]5 (examples for this phenomenon can be found in Appendix B.3), we next analyze the impact of the ensemble size on the estimation bias under different approximation error distributions.
