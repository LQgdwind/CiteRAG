      "content": "Paper Title: A Sequence Repetition Node-Based Successive Cancellation List Decoder for 5G Polar Codes: Algorithm and Implementation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe critical path of an SCL decoder is generally through the PM sorting unit , and several works have thus focused on optimizing the PM sorting, either using pruned sorting   [ref]33 or partial sorting [ref]18  [ref]11, with a comparison of various implementations in [ref]33.\nMost of these current sorters focus on the 2​L→L→2𝐿𝐿2L\\rightarrow L sorting required for the result in (4), including the SOA pruned rank-order sorter in [ref]33, which prunes the sorter by using the property that the result of comparing certain PMs is known ahead of time.\nHowever, this property of the PMs depends on how the path forking is done in hardware and requires additional routing and control.\nAs the SR-I part requires sorting |𝕊|​L𝕊𝐿|\\mathbb{S}|L PMs from (21), the sorting size for the SR-List decoder is much larger compared to previous works, and all of the |𝕊|​L𝕊𝐿|\\mathbb{S}|L PMs have different PM penalties so there is no explicit order known ahead of time.\nTherefore, in our decoder, we consider more general cases and assume no special properties on the input PMs. To avoid a large complexity by fully sorting all input PMs, we simplify the sorter by allowing the output PMs to be partially sorted, as SCL decoding only requires the L𝐿L smallest PMs without these being sorted.\nHerein, a full sorter can be replaced by two small full sorters and one layer of comparators, which results in our proposed partial rank-order sorter almost halving the number of comparators compared to a full sorter. Let X𝑋X-to-Y𝑌Y denote a sorter with X𝑋X inputs and Y𝑌Y outputs.\nOur partial rank-order sorter, shown in Fig. 11 for 888-to-444, is composed of two X2𝑋2\\frac{X}{2}-to-Y𝑌Y full rank-order sorters which return at least Y𝑌Y fully sorted results in ascending and descending order, respectively, as shown in (26) and (27) After the full rank sorters, we use a set of comparators to find the Y𝑌Y smallest inputs from the pairs {mi,ni},i∈[0,Y−1]subscript𝑚𝑖subscript𝑛𝑖𝑖0𝑌1\\{m_{i},n_{i}\\},i\\in[0,Y-1]. For an X𝑋X-to-Y𝑌Y partial rank sorter, all results belong to the Y𝑌Y smallest elements from the X𝑋X inputs. Any partial rank-order sorter output o​u​ti𝑜𝑢subscript𝑡𝑖{out}_{i}, for i∈[0,Y−1]𝑖0𝑌1i\\in[0,Y-1], is chosen by comparing misubscript𝑚𝑖m_{i} and nisubscript𝑛𝑖n_{i}, where misubscript𝑚𝑖m_{i} is less than or equal to X2−i−1𝑋2𝑖1\\frac{X}{2}-i-1 other m𝑚m values and nisubscript𝑛𝑖n_{i} is less than or equal to X2−Y+i𝑋2𝑌𝑖\\frac{X}{2}-Y+i other n𝑛n values.\nTherefore, for every comparison between the two inputs misubscript𝑚𝑖m_{i} and nisubscript𝑛𝑖n_{i}, it holds that o​u​ti𝑜𝑢subscript𝑡𝑖{out}_{i} must be less than or equal to (X2−i−1)+(X2−Y+i)+1=X−Y𝑋2𝑖1𝑋2𝑌𝑖1𝑋𝑌(\\frac{X}{2}-i-1)+(\\frac{X}{2}-Y+i)+1=X-Y other input values and o​u​ti𝑜𝑢subscript𝑡𝑖{out}_{i} is therefore always amongst the X−Y𝑋𝑌X-Y smallest inputs.\n∎ Compared to the 12​(X2−X)12superscript𝑋2𝑋\\frac{1}{2}(X^{2}-X) comparators in the full rank-order sorter, the partial rank sorter only has (14​X2−12​X)+Y14superscript𝑋212𝑋𝑌(\\frac{1}{4}X^{2}-\\frac{1}{2}X)+Y comparators, which simplifies to X24superscript𝑋24\\frac{X^{2}}{4} when Y=X2𝑌𝑋2Y=\\frac{X}{2}.\nFrom the synthesis results, shown in Table III, the proposed sorter has a 45 %times45percent45\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{\\char 37\\relax} smaller area than the full sorter for 646464-to-888. ††\\dagger The full rank sorter from [ref]33 was re-implemented and synthesized in 28 nmtimes28nanometer28\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{nm} FD-SOI.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: The critical path of an SCL decoder is generally through the PM sorting unit , and several works have thus focused on optimizing the PM sorting, either using pruned sorting   [ref]33 or partial sorting [ref]18  [ref]11, with a comparison of various implementations in [ref]33.\nMost of these current sorters focus on the 2​L→L→2𝐿𝐿2L\\rightarrow L sorting required for the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
