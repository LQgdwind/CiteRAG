      "content": "Paper Title: FedGroup: Efficient Federated Learning via Decomposed Similarity-Based Clustering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne of the main challenges in the design of the large-scale FL system is statistical heterogeneity (e.g. non-IID, size imbalanced, class imbalanced)¬† [ref]3 [ref]10 [ref]17  .\nThe conventional way is to train a consensus global model upon incongruent data, which yields unsatisfactory performance in the high heterogeneity setting¬†.\nInstead of optimizing a consensus global model, CFL divides the optimization goal into several sub-objectives and follows a Pluralistic Group architecture¬†. CFL maintains multiple groups (or clusters) models, which are more specialized than the consensus model and achieve high accuracy. Sattler et al. propose the first CFL-based framework¬†, which recursively separate the two groups of clients with incongruent descent directions. The authors further propose¬† to improve the robustness of CFL-based framework in byzantine setting.\nHowever, the recursive bi-partitioning algorithm is computational inefficient and requires multiple communication rounds to completely separate all incongruent clients.\nFurthermore, since the participating client in each round is random, this may cause the recursive bi-partitioning algorithm to fail.\nTo improve the efficiency of CFL, Ghosh et al. propose IFCA¬†, which randomly generates cluster centers and divides clients into clusters that will minimize their loss values.\nAlthough the model accuracy improvements of IFCA are significant, IFCA needs to broadcast all group models in each round and is sensitive to the initialization with probability success.\nFeSEM¬† uses a ‚Ñì2subscript‚Ñì2\\ell_{2} distance-based stochastic expectation maximization (EM) algorithm instead of distance-based neighborhood methods. However, ‚Ñì2subscript‚Ñì2\\ell_{2} distance often suffer in HDLSS situation which is known as distance concentration phenomenon in high dimension¬†.\nThe distance concentration of ‚Ñìpsubscript‚Ñìùëù\\ell_{p} will cause the violation of neighborhood structure¬†, which has adverse effects on the performance of pairwise distance-based clustering algorithms such as K-Means, k-Medoids and hierarchical clustering¬†.\nSimilarity to the cosine similarity-based clustering method¬†, Briggs et al. propose an agglomerative hierarchical clustering method named FL+HC¬†[ref]17.\nIt relies on iterative calculating the pairwise distance between all clusters, which is computationally complex.\nNote that, all the above CFL frameworks assume that all clients will participate in the clustering process and no newcomer devices, which is unpractical in a large-scale FL system.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: One of the main challenges in the design of the large-scale FL system is statistical heterogeneity (e.g. non-IID, size imbalanced, class imbalanced)¬† [ref]3 [ref]10 [ref]17  .\nThe conventional way is to train a consensus global model upon incongruent data, which yields unsatisfactory performance in the high heterogeneity setting¬†.\nInstead of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
