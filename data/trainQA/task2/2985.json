A popular textbook solution to RMQ problem is the sparse table algorithm.\nThe algorithm prepares answers to all the RMQ queries whose lengths are power of two (for simplicity, we ignore the rounding issue), thus the algorithm uses O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n) memory words of Ω​(log⁡n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(\\log n) bits.\nObserve that any RMQ query can be solved by comparing the elements in array A𝐴A corresponding to the answers to at most two prepared overlapping RMQ queries.\nTherefore the algorithm can answer RMQ query in O​(1)𝑂1O(1) time.\nGabow, Bentley, Tarjan 4 and Harel, Tarjan 9 further show that we can compress the space usage to O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) memory words while enjoy the O​(1)𝑂1O(1) query time by reducing to a problem named ±1​RMQplus-or-minus1RMQ\\pm 1\\texttt{RMQ}. A trend in the theory of data structures is the succinct data structure 1.\nFrom the perspective of the succinct data structure, the classical solution is far from being optimal.\nIt turns out that the Cartesian tree  of the input array A​[1​…​n]𝐴delimited-[]1…𝑛A[1\\ldots n] precisely captures all the information about the answers to all RMQ queries.\nThe Cartesian tree is a rooted binary tree of n𝑛n nodes, hence the number of different inputs is the n𝑛n-th Catalan number Cn≜(2​nn)/(n+1)≜subscript𝐶𝑛binomial2𝑛𝑛𝑛1C_{n}\\triangleq\\binom{2n}{n}/(n+1), and the information-theoretical optimal number of bits needed to store the input is 2​n−1.5​log⁡n+O​(1)2𝑛1.5𝑛𝑂12n-1.5\\log n+O(1).\nHowever the above classical solution consumes O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) words ≈O​(n​log⁡n)absent𝑂𝑛𝑛\\approx O(n\\log n) bits. The first “truly” linear space (which is called a compact data structure in the language of succinct data structure) solution is presented by Sadakane .\nSadakane proposed a RMQ data structure using ≈4​nabsent4𝑛\\approx 4n bits of space and O​(1)𝑂1O(1) query time, assuming the word size is Θ​(log⁡n)Θ𝑛\\Theta(\\log n) bits.\nLater, the space cost is improved to 2​n−1.5​log⁡n+O​(n​log⁡log⁡n/log⁡n)2𝑛1.5𝑛𝑂𝑛𝑛𝑛2n-1.5\\log n+O(n\\log\\log n/\\log n) bits by Fischer and Heun 0 1. The state-of-the-art solution  3 is based on the succinct augmented B-tree 5 (which is called segment tree by competitive programming participants 2).\nAssuming the word size is Θ​(log⁡n)Θ𝑛\\Theta(\\log n) bits, the solution solves RMQ with 2​n−1.5​log⁡n+n/(log⁡nt)t2𝑛1.5𝑛𝑛superscript𝑛𝑡𝑡2n-1.5\\log n+n/(\\frac{\\log n}{t})^{t} bits of space for database, extra O~​(n3/4)~𝑂superscript𝑛34\\tilde{O}(n^{3/4}) bits of space for a pre-computed lookup table to help the computation in the RAM model, and O​(t)𝑂𝑡O(t) query time, where t>1𝑡1t>1 is an arbitrary parameter.\nOn the other hand, the only known lower bound for RMQ is presented by Liu and Yu 9.\nThey proved that any data structure which solves RMQ in t𝑡t time must use 2​n−1.5​log⁡n+n/(log⁡n)O​(t2​log2⁡t)2𝑛1.5𝑛𝑛superscript𝑛𝑂superscript𝑡2superscript2𝑡2n-1.5\\log n+n/(\\log n)^{O(t^{2}\\log^{2}t)} bits of space, assuming the word size is Θ​(log⁡n)Θ𝑛\\Theta(\\log n) bits.\nIt is easy to see that, in terms of time complexity, the gap between the state-of-the-art upper bound and the lower bound is quadratic:\nif the space cost is limited to 2​n−1.5​log⁡n+r2𝑛1.5𝑛𝑟2n-1.5\\log n+r bits, then the query time upper bound is t=O​(log⁡(n/r)log⁡(log⁡n/t))𝑡𝑂𝑛𝑟𝑛𝑡t={O}\\left(\\frac{\\log(n/r)}{\\log(\\log n/t)}\\right), while the query time lower bound is t=Ω~​(log⁡(n/r)log⁡log⁡n)𝑡~Ω𝑛𝑟𝑛t=\\widetilde{\\Omega}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log(n/r)}{\\log\\log n}}\\right).\nIn particular, when r=O​(1)𝑟𝑂1r=O(1), the upper bound is t=O​(log⁡n)𝑡𝑂𝑛t=O(\\log n) meanwhile the lower bound is t=Ω~​(log⁡n)𝑡~Ω𝑛t=\\widetilde{\\Omega}(\\sqrt{\\log n}).\nThus a question is raised from 3 9:\nwhat is the optimal time-space trade-off for RMQ data structures?\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: The data structures to RMQ problem play significant roles in numerous areas of computer science, such as graph problems     7, text processing  2 2     3 0  and other areas of computer science   [ref]7.
