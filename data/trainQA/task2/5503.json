      "content": "Paper Title: Boosted ab initio Cryo-EM 3D Reconstruction with ACE-EM\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n3D reconstruction and view synthesis is a popular field in computer vision. Many new methods have been emerged in recent years, such as\nNeRF  ,\nPlenoxels  ,\nDirectVoxGo  ,\nBARF  ,\nSCNeRF  , and\nGNeRF  .\nThese methods can reconstruct 3D scenes from\nnatural images with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR).\nIn ab initio\ncryo-EM 3D reconstruction, the reconstruction problem is much harder\ndue to the low-SNR nature of cryo-EM images and missing image\nprojection parameters.\nIn addition to traditional cryo-EM reconstruction methods like RELION  \nand cryoSPARC  , many\nML-based cryo-EM reconstruction methods have been developed in the past\nfew years.\nGiven only the 2D cryo-EM projection images without any labels,\ncryo-EM 3D reconstruction can be formulated as a self-supervised learning problem.\nTwo ML frameworks have been explored: GAN   and autoencoder  .\nCryoGAN  \nand Multi-CryoGAN  [ref]16 adopted the GAN framework.\nIn these methods, the generator contains the predicted volume information and generates projection images, while the discriminator adopts the generated and authentic images and discriminates the source of the images.\nHowever, due to the limitations of GANs,\nthese methods lack pose estimation and 3D reconstruction quality is inferior to other methods.\nFor cryo-EM, the images are fed to the encoder to generate a latent variable (usually representing the pose estimation),\nand the decoder produces the reconstructed images based on this variable.\nThe model is trained by reducing the loss of the original and reconstructed ones.\nAfter training, the 3D reconstruction density map can be obtained from the decoder.\nCryo-EM 3D reconstruction with variational autoencoder (VAE)  ,\nCryoDRGN    [ref]20,\nAtomVAE  ,\nCryoPoseNet  ,\nand cryoAI  [ref]7\nadopt the autoencoder architecture.\nThey improve the performance of autoencoders in cryo-EM 3D reconstructions by using more powerful networks\nfor encoders and decoders, adding or modifying loss functions, modifying the latent variable designs\nand other strategies. Pose estimation is concerned with\nestimating the missing\norientation and position (together known as pose) parameters\nof the images based on the underlying 3D object.\nExisting pose estimation methods can be divided into two classes:\nPer-image pose search methods and amortized inference methods.\nThe first class of methods performs a global pose search\nfor each projection image in the input dataset.\nTraditional software,\nlike RELION  \nand cryoSPARC  , and some ML-based\nmethods,\ninluding cryoDRGN-BNB  and\nCryoDRGN2 [ref]20,\nfall into this category.\nThe per-image pose search method is not an ML-based strategy,\nTo control the Pose estimation as an ML process,\nthe second class method, amortized inference,\nis first proposed for cryo-EM 3D reconstruction\nby Ullrich et. al.  .\nIt focuses on learning\na parameterized function for mapping image Yisubscript𝑌𝑖Y_{i} to its pose ϕisubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖\\phi_{i},\nthen it is widely accepted by autoencoder solutions as the encoder.\nFor autoencoders with amortized inference method,\nthey suffer from too many local minima in their\nprobabilistic pose estimation framework.\nRosenbaum et. al. attempted to overcome local-minima traps using variational autoencoder (VAE)  .\nCryoAI  [ref]7 extended CryoPoseNet   work by introducing “symmetry loss”\nto facilitate pose learning by adding a 180∘-rotated input image as input.\nIn practice, we found these strategies are\ninsufficient for avoiding poses being trapped in local minima.\nThe proposed ACE-EM method also falls into this category of amortized inference. In the view of cryo-EM 3D reconstruction, a decoder (in autoencoder) or a generator (in GAN) is a structure that contains the volume representation, which adopts the pose or other variables and outputs the predicted 2D projection images.\nThe underlying target 3D object can have either\nreal-space or frequency-space representations in the space domain,\nand either neural network type or voxel grid type for volume parameter representations  .\nTraditional softwares represent\nthe reconstruction target volume as a\n3D voxel grid of frequency space,\nlike Relion   and\ncryoSPARC  .\nMany recently developed deep-learning-based reconstruction methods mainly use two types of decoders (generators):\nreal-space voxel grid type\nand frequency-space neural network type.\nCryoDRGN    [ref]20 and CryoAI  [ref]7 uses the frequency-space neural network as their decoders.\nReal-space voxel grid methods are also used by many algorithms, such as\nCryoGAN  ,\nMulti-CryoGAN  [ref]16,\n3DFlex  ,\nand AtomVAE  .\nCryoPoseNet   stores a real space voxel grid representation of\nthe reconstruction target, but the projection was made in Fourier space.\nIn this work, we show that the ACE-EM method is effective with both real-space voxel grid type\nand frequency-space neural network type of decoders. Our method uses encoder-decoder(E-D) and decoder-encoder(D-E) two orders for training in autoencoders, and this cyclic training is widely used in style transfer, like MUNIT  , DRIT   and CDD  . These methods differ from ours in 4 main aspects, architecture setting, data format, aims, and challenges.\nFor the architecture setting, MUNIT uses E-D and (E-)D-E two orders  ,\nDRIT uses one task E-D-E-D to finish the cycle, while more complex tasks are used in CDD.\nMUNIT and DRIT need two random images inputted together as a group for cross-domain translation   , CDD uses paired data for supervised learning  , but paired or grouped data is not required by ACE-EM.\nStyle transfer aims to decouple images’ style and content, and our aim is to settle the poses in an accurate distribution.\nAlso, our methods face specific reconstruction challenges, like noise problems.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: without any labels,\ncryo-EM 3D reconstruction can be formulated as a self-supervised learning problem.\nTwo ML frameworks have been explored: GAN   and autoencoder  .\nCryoGAN  \nand Multi-CryoGAN  [ref]16 adopted the GAN framework.\nIn these methods, the generator contains the predicted volume information and generates projection images, while the discriminator adopts the generated and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
