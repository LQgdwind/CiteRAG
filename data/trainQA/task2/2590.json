Moreover, learning the order of sentences can help in modeling text coherence 5. In sentence ordering, the goal is to arrange a set of unordered sentences in a cohesive order. Ordering models aim to identify patterns resulting sentences to appear in a specific order in a coherent text. Several previous studies have addressed the task of sentence ordering for a set of data such as news articles  1 . Previous methods suggested on the task of sentence ordering fall into two categories: traditional approaches, and deep learning-based approaches. Traditional approaches to coherence modeling and sentence ordering often apply probabilistic models 1. Barzilay utilized content models to represent topics as HMM states , then employed hand-crafted linguistic features, including Entity Grid, to model the document structure . 0 suggested using n-gram overlapping to pick a final sentence from two human-made options of the ROCStories stories. In 5, a similar method is used to arrange the set of unordered sentences of the stories. As the next sentence, they pick the sentence with the most n-gram overlaps with the current sentence. They measured an overlap up to 4-gram using Smoothed-BLEU 4. In recent years, researchers used neural approaches to solve sentence ordering tasks.  proposed SkipThought + Pairwise model. The method involves combining two points identified from the unary embedding of sentences without considering context and a pairwise model of sentences based on their relative composition in context. However, as SkipThought model 8 was applied to map sentences into vector space, some information is missing. Another method proposed in 3 is a productive model that is called Seq2Seq + Pairwise. A Seq2Seq model based on an encoder-decoder architecture is used to predict the following sentence, having one. This way, the model learns a probabilities distributions over sentences. Gong employed an end-to-end sentence ordering method, LSTM + PtrNet4. After getting encrypted and decoded by LSTM models, pointer networks are being used to arrange sentences. Another method proposed in 5, called LSTM + Set2Seq, uses LSTM and attention mechanism to encode sentences and learn a representation of context. Then a pointer network is applied to ranks sentences.\n0 proposed Hierarchical attention networks (HAN). The idea is to capture the information of clue words to learn the dependency between sentences. The system uses a word encoder with a BiLSTM architecture, an attention layer that creates sentence embedding, and an attention mechanism to encode and decode a group of sentences together. Although LSTM and BiLSTM-based models show improvement, they are less efficient comparing to a BERT-based encoder model. This is mostly because of the fact that BiLSTM models do not look at both directions of a word simultaneously. In contrast, BERT is trained to learn both left and right positions at the same time. 7 proposed a CBoW model that generate sentence embedding using the average of the word embedding vectors of the words that compose the sentence.\nThis embedding is used in 5 to suggest a baseline, where cosine similarity between embeddings of pairs of sentences is used to order the pairs. This has two essential defects: it does not include many sentence information such as clue words and there is no way for modelling sentencesâ€™ dependencies. 5 presents sentence correlation measure (SCM) for sentence ordering. This measure has three main components: A sentence encoding component based on the pretrained SBERT-WK 9; A scoring component based on the cosine similarity; A ranking component based on a Brute Force search. None of the above components need access to training data which provides an advantage where limited data is available5. The method does not work as well as HAN or LSTM + Set2Seq when enough training data is available, since dependencies between sentences are not captured. 0 proposed RankTxNet ListMLE, which is a pointer-based model. This method relies on a pre-trained BERT model for encoding sentences and a self-attention based transformer network for encoding paragraphs. To predict a relative score for each sentence, they use a feed-forward network as a decoder which determines each sentenceâ€™s position in a paragraph. Our proposed model has some similarity with the methods presented in 4 and 5 in using neural networks for for predicting sentence ordering in a pairwise manner. However, we employ a BERT-based model for sentence encoding, in contrast to the LSTM-based model they used. Moreover, by applying universal transformers we encode a group of sentences and learn a language model.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Understanding relations between sentences has become increasingly important for various NLP tasks, such as multi-document summarization , text generation [ref]7, and text coherence modeling 5.
