      "content": "Paper Title: Deep autoencoders for physics-constrained data-driven nonlinear materials modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConstitutive modeling is traditionally based on constitutive or material laws to describe the explicit relationship among strain, stress, and state variables based on experimental observations, physical hypothesis, and mathematical simplifications.\nHowever, the phenomenological modeling process inevitably introduces errors due to limited data and mathematical assumptions in model parameter calibration.\nMoreover, constitutive laws rely on pre-defined functions and often lack generality to capture full aspects of material behaviors [ref]1. With advancements in computing power and proliferation of digital data , machine learning (ML) based data-driven approaches, such as artificial neural networks (NNs), have emerged as a promising alternative for constitutive modeling due to their ability in extracting features and complex patterns in data .\nThis type of approaches usually requires parameterization of machine learning models with given constitutive data a priori, and thus, they are classified as model-based approaches.\nFor example, NNs have been applied to modeling a variety of materials, including concrete materials , hyper-elastic materials , viscoplastic material of steel , and homogenized properties of composite structures .\nAccordingly, the NN-based constitutive models were integrated into finite element codes to predict path- or rate-dependent materials behaviors    .\nRecently, deep neural networks (DNNs) with special mechanistic architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) haven been applied to path-dependent materials   [ref]14. In [ref]14, for example, graph neural networks (GNNs) based representation of topology information of crystal microstructures (e.g., Euler angles) were introduced for learning anisotropic elasto-plastic responses.\nBesides, the deep material network approach was proposed in [ref]15  to simulate multiscale heterogeneous materials, in which the NNs were constructed based on hierarchical mechanistic building blocks derived from analytical two-phase elasticity model and homogenization theory. Another strategy in data-driven materials modeling is to bypass the constitutive modeling step by formulating an optimization problem to search for the physically admissible state that satisfies equilibrium and compatibility and minimizes the distance to a material dataset   .\nIn this data-driven approach, the search of material data at each integration point from the material dataset is determined via a distance-minimization function and is called the distance-minimizing data-driven (DMDD) computing.\nThis data-driven computing paradigm has been extended to dynamics 0, problems with geometrical nonlinearity 1 [ref]1, inelasticity 2, anisotropy 3, material identification and constitutive manifold construction 4 5 6 7.\nA variational framework for data-driven computing was proposed in 8 9 to allow versatile in the employment of special approximation functions and numerical methods. To better handle noise induced by outliers and intrinsic randomness in the experimental datasets, data-driven computing integrated with statistical models or machine learning techniques were developed, including incorporating maximum entropy estimation with a cluster analysis 0, regularization based on data sampling statistics 1, and locally convex reconstruction inspired from manifold learning for nonlinear dimensionality reduction 8.\nIn the local convexity data-driven (LCDD) computing proposed in 8, the convexity condition is imposed on the reconstructed material graph to avoid convergence issues that usually arise in standard data fitting approaches.\nRecently, Eggersmann et al. 2 introduced tensor voting, an instance-based machine learning technique, to the entropy-based data-driven scheme 0 to construct locally linear tangent spaces for achieving higher-order convergence in data-driven solvers. The above mentioned (distance-minimizing) data-driven computing approaches are distinct from the NN-based constitutive modeling approaches.\nThe latter constructs the surrogate models of constitutive laws independent to the solution procedure of boundary value problems, whereas the former is ”model free” and it incorporates the material data search into the solution procedure of boundary value problems. Thus, the former approach was also called model-free data-driven computing 0 2.\nThe model-free data-driven approach circumvents the need of using material tangent during solution iteration processes, which offers another unique feature in computational mechanics.\nFrom the perspective of machine learning algorithms, the NN approach is considered as supervised learning, and it requires pre-defined input-output functions, e.g. strain-stress laws. It has been shown that selecting the response function by NNs within the constitutive framework is non-trivial 3  [ref]14.\nOn the other hand, the data-driven computing approaches with unsupervised learning such as clustering and manifold learning are capable of discovering the underlying data structure for the constitutive manifold\n8 .\nHowever, this type of data-driven approaches could encounter difficulties in high dimensional applications when material data sampling involves multidimensional and history-dependent state variables. As demonstrated in   8, higher data dimension results in lower convergence rate with respect to data size, and thus demands effective dimensionality reduction for improved effectiveness of data-driven computing.\nFurther, the model-free data-driven schemes rely on the direct search of nearest neighbors from the material dataset, leading to limited extrapolative generalization when the distribution of data points becomes sparse. In this work, we aim to develop a novel data-driven computing approach to overcome the curse of dimensionality and the lack of generalization in classical model-free data-driven computing approaches   8.\nTo this end, we propose to introduce a novel autoencoders based deep neural network architecture 4 5 under the LCDD framework 8\nto achieve two major objectives: dimensionality reduction and generalization of physically meaningful constitutive manifold.\nIt should be emphasized that there have been various nonlinear dimensionality reduction (i.e. manifold learning) techniques developed for complex high-dimensional data 6 7 8 9 0, but these methods remain challenging in out-of-sample extension (OOSE), that is to project new unseen data onto the learned low-dimensional representation space, due to the lack of explicit mapping function. While nonparametric OOSE 0 is an option to construct the mapping, the computational complexity increases substantially with the size of dataset.\nOn the other hand, owing to its deep learning architecture, an autoencoder is capable of naturally defining the mapping functions between high- and low-dimensional representation and capturing highly varying nonlinear manifold with good generalization capability 0 , as to be discussed in Section 3. By integrating autoencoders and the discovered low-dimensional embedding into the data-driven solver, the proposed framework is referred to as auto-embedding data-driven (AEDD) computing, which can also be considered as a hybrid of the NN-based constitutive modeling and the classical model-free data-driven computing.\nIn this approach, the autoencoders are first trained in an offline stage to extract a representative low-dimensional manifold (embedding) of the given material data. Autoencoders also provide effective noise filtering through the data compression processes.\nThe trained autoencoders are then incorporated in the data-driven solver during the online computation with customized convexity-preserving reconstruction.\nHence, all operations related to distance measure, including the search of the closest material points in the dataset are performed in the learned embedding space, circumventing the difficulties resulting from high dimensionality and data noise.\nTo ensure numerical stability and representative constitutive manifold parameterized by the trained autoencoder networks, an efficient convexity-preserving interpolation is proposed to locally approximate the optimal material data to a given physically admissible state.\nSpecifically, in this work, we present two different solvers to perform locally convex reconstruction, and demonstrate the one directly providing interpolation approximation without using decoders outperforms the one that fully uses the encoder-decoder network structure.\nFurthermore, it is shown that the proposed method is computationally tractable, since the additional autoencoder training is conducted offline and the online data-driven computation mainly involve lower-dimensional variables in the embedding space.\n The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The background of physics-constrained data-driven framework is first introduced in Section 2, including the data-driven equations in variational form and the material local solvers.\nIn Section 3, the basic theory of deep neural networks and autoencoders are presented. Section 4 introduces the convexity-preserving interpolation for data-driven materials modeling with improved performance.\nFinally, in Section 5, the effectiveness of the proposed AEDD framework are examined, and a parametric study is conducted to investigate the effects of autoencoder architecture, data noise, data size and sparsity, and neural network initialization on AEDD’s performance.\nThe proposed method is also applied to biological tissue modeling to demonstrate the enhanced effectiveness and generalization capability of AEDD over the other data-driven schemes.\nConcluding remarks and discussions are summarized in Section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: data and mathematical assumptions in model parameter calibration.\nMoreover, constitutive laws rely on pre-defined functions and often lack generality to capture full aspects of material behaviors [ref]1.
