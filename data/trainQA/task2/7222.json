      "content": "Paper Title: Introducing New Node Prediction in Graph Mining: Predicting All Links from Isolated Nodes with Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLink prediction  is a task in graph and network analysis that aims to predict future or missing connections between nodes in a network. Given a partially observed network, link prediction involves inferring which links are most likely to be added based on the observed connections and the network structure. The two basic approaches for link prediction are: (1) topology-based methods, and (2) node attribute-based methods. Topology-based methods, such as Common Neighbors and Jaccard Measure, assume that nodes with similar network structures are more likely to form a link. Node attribute-based methods, such as Euclidean Distance and Cosine Similarity, predict the existence of a link based on the similarity of node attributes. Many current approaches for link prediction combine attribute and topology-based methods. Some of these mixed methods include: (1)  node representation / graph feature-based methods (such as DeepWalk [ref]19 and node2vec ); (2) Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) (such as TransE, DistMult, ComplEx, and ConvE) 6; and (3) Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) (such as Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Attention Networks) . GNNs achieve high accuracy in link prediction by jointly leveraging graph topology and node attributes. When considering the popular Citeseer dataset111https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/dataset/CiteSeer for testing link prediction, some GNNs-based methods report an AUC (Area under the ROC Curve) over 96%, including the use of graph autoencoders (GAEs)  and variational graph autoencoders (VGAEs) [ref]1. Different methods to improve GNNs learning, such as incorporating clustering information  or utilizing new pooling schemes , also achieve outstanding results. Although we experiment with GNNs, this paper does not focus on a specific architecture or method for predictions: instead, it defines a new related problem and investigates its feasibility. There are many domains and types of graphs in which including all entities during the training process is impractical or unfeasible. For example, real-world knowledge graphs (KG) involve the constant occurrence of new entities. For this reason, there are several works and research lines in the literature that address link prediction in scenarios where little information is known about the connectivity of new entities. Wang et al.  consider the problem of prediction of links in a new emerging node, which also brings new links to the existing (and observed) nodes in a KG. Baek et al.  also study essentially the same problem under the very descriptive term of transductive few-shot out-of-graph link prediction, obtaining significant results on benchmark datasets for knowledge graph completion and prediction of drug-drug interaction. Before these works, Hamaguchi et al.  studied the problem of out-of-knowledge-base (OOKB) entity in knowledge-base completion (KBC). This task requires answering queries regarding test nodes that were not observed at training time. This challenging problem can be seen as a one-shot out-of-Graph link prediction, i.e. predicting new links to a new node that emerges with just one link to observed nodes. Bose et al.  also address the few-shot link prediction pointing out that most link prediction techniques perform poorly on this task. Jambor et al.  empirically explore the limits of existing few-shot Link Prediction methods, concluding that having only a few examples of a relation fundamentally limits models from using fine-grained structural information. Recently, Seong and Kim [ref]1 took the link prediction problem to another level. They found that GAEs and VGAEs performed poorly when dealing with nodes whose degree is zero or isolated nodes. This scenario is more realistic than it seems. The authors gave a very illustrative example of a social network of students where students are the nodes and the links indicate a “friendship” relationship. In this scenario, the task of “finding friends of students” is a link prediction problem. What they found was that most link prediction methods could not be used for “freshmen”, i.e., new nodes that do not have any connections. In these isolated nodes, the content of the features (e.g., the circles or the hobby of the students) plays an important role in this link prediction problem because there is no connectivity information. Their experimental results showed that the content features of isolated nodes tend to go to zero in various graph-structured networks, unlike their proposed Graph Normalized AutoEncoder (VGNAE). Similarly to Seong and Kim [ref]1, we deal with link prediction on isolated nodes. However, we want to explore the possibility of predicting all (or a significant amount of) links of a previously isolated (non-existing) node. To the best of our knowledge, this is a problem that has not been explored previously in the specialized literature. Knowing all links of a node means, in a number of graphs, knowing all the relevant information of this node. Therefore, we believe that the term new node prediction is more appropriate than link prediction. However, this can also be seen as zero-shot out-of-graph all-links prediction. This new problem is not just an aggregation of link prediction with isolated nodes. Even if a model can predict a large number of new links of isolated nodes, this same model can be incapable of predicting most of the links of a specific isolated node. Another difference with respect to related work [ref]1 is that, admitting the great importance of feature content in the prediction of isolated node links, their article does not specify what these are, nor experiments with different initial features. Wang et al. 6 detail research works which incorporate additional information for link prediction; among others: node types, link types, relation paths, logic rules, and textual descriptions. As in any zero-shot learning setting, the use of some form of auxiliary information is essential. We experiment with feature content based on textual description embeddings among other alternatives, evaluating their impact on the novel problem of new node prediction. There are other problems related with the task of new node prediction introduced here. Galkin et al.  provides benchmarks for inductive link prediction on KGs. In inductive settings, the training graph and the network where links must be predicted are different. The inductive inference graph can contain a combination of seen and unseen nodes (i.e., the setting is semi-inductive) or only unseen nodes (i.e., fully inductive), and either the same or a subset of links from the training graph. Although this setup also makes the link prediction problem more challenging, the ability to predict all links for an emerging and isolated node is not evaluated. Song et al. 1 define the problem of graph learning with out-of-distribution nodes, which means detecting nodes that do not belong to the known distribution. Hence, this task can be seen as a type of node classification instead of a case of link prediction. Zhang et al. 7 comprehensively surveys work on few-shot learning on graphs. In the mentioned survey no zero-shot task has been explored except zero-shot relation prediction 0. This supports the novelty of the presented  new node prediction task, which is a case of zero-shot learning.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: current approaches for link prediction combine attribute and topology-based methods.
