Most of the work in the literature uses classical methods to optimize the network state (e.g., ILP). During the last decade a plethora of algorithms have been proposed, exploring a wide spectrum of techniques and network abstractions    . Some works have previously attempted to apply DRL [ref]11 [ref]12  or MARL [ref]18  to TE. However, they were unable to report a performance comparable to the state of the art, as they were compared to simpler routing schemes, such as SP routing (e.g., [ref]12 [ref]18 ), SP+ECMP (e.g., ), Load Balancing (e.g., [ref]12 ) or oblivious routing (e.g., [ref]11). Our work is the first to be benchmarked against a state-of-the-art optimizer –i.e., DEFO – and to provide enough evidence to address the open question posed in this paper. Moreover, most of the current state-of-the-art (MA)RL-based TE solutions [ref]11 [ref]12 [ref]18 suffer from another limitation: they fail to generalize to unseen scenarios (e.g., different network topologies) as the implemented traditional neural networks (e.g., fully connected, convolutional) are not well-suited to learn and generalize over data that is inherently structured as graphs. One exception is the work of , a different MARL approach that addresses an inter-region TE network scenario. GNNs  , and in particular MPNNs , precisely emerged as specialized methods for dealing with graph-structured data; for the first time, there was an AI-based technology able to provide with topology-aware systems. In fact, GNNs have recently attracted a larger interest in the computer networks field for addressing the aforementioned generalization limitations. The work from  proposed the use of GNNs to predict network performance metrics (e.g., average delay). Authors of  proposed a novel architecture for routing optimization in Optical Transport Networks that embeds a GNN into a centralized, single-agent RL setting that is compared against Load Balancing routing. Arguably, the closest work to this paper is , whose premise is similar to ours: the generation of easily-scalable, automated distributed protocols for intradomain TE. For doing so, the authors of this work also make use of a GNN, but unlike our unsupervised RL-based solution, their approach is limited to learn already existing protocols (e.g., shortest path routing). Particularly, they use a semi-supervised learning algorithm that requires labeled data, against which they compare their solution. In fact, there are very few works that have combined GNN with a DRL framework  , and they are theoretical proposals from the ML community that do not apply to the field of networking.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: ILP).
