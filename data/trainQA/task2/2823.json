Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

The results of CZSL are shown in Tab. III, where the first five rows are baselines from [ref]1 [ref]2 (the scores with ∗* are reproduced by [ref]2, the others are from [ref]1).\nSymNet outperforms all baselines on two benchmarks.\nAlthough we use a simple product to compose the attribute and object scores, we still achieve 2.1% and 3.8% improvements over the state-of-the-art  on two benchmarks, respectively.\nMost previous approaches do not surpass the Visual Product baseline on UT-Zappos, while ours outperforms by 2.2%. In addition, our object classification performance on the two datasets are 28.8% and 65.4% respectively, which is comparable to AttrOperator [ref]2 (20.5%, 67.5%) and GenModel  (27.7%, 68.1%).\nAccordingly, the main contribution of the CZSL improvement of SymNet comes from attribute learning rather than object recognition. To further evaluate our SymNet, we additionally conduct the comparison on the generalized CZSL setting from recent state-of-the-art TMN  on the larger MIT-States [ref]10 in Tab. IV.\nSymNet also outperforms previous methods significantly on all metrics.\nWe notice that novel metrics on UT-Zappos  are proposed by a very recent work Causal 2, so we also conduct a test following its metrics. The results are shown in Tab. V. Compared with TMN , SymNet shows its superiority on Seen, Harmonic, and AUC metrics.\nFurthermore, even compared with the very recent Causal 2 method, our SymNet still improves the Seen, Closed, and AUC metrics.\nAll these results further strongly prove the efficacy of our method. \n\n\n\nMethod\nNovel\nAll\n\n1-shot\n2-shot\n5-shot\n1-shot\n2-shot\n5-shot\n\nCOMP\n52.5\n63.6\n73.8\n62.6\n68.4\n74.0\n\nCOMP - SymNet\n54.0\n63.8\n74.3\n63.1\n68.9\n74.1\n\nCOMP w/ data aug  \n53.6\n64.8\n74.6\n63.1\n69.2\n74.5\n\nCOMP w/ data aug - SymNet\n57.3\n66.7\n76.0\n64.9\n68.8\n74.9\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Method\nMIT-States\nUT-Zappos\n\nTop-1\nTop-2\nTop-3\nTop-1\nTop-2\nTop-3\n\nVisual Product [ref]1\n9.8/13.9∗\n16.1\n20.6\n49.9∗\n/\n/\n\nLabelEmbed (LE) [ref]1\n11.2/13.4∗\n17.6\n22.4\n25.8∗\n/\n/\n\n- LEOR [ref]1\n4.5\n6.2\n11.8\n/\n/\n/\n\n- LE + R [ref]1\n9.3\n16.3\n20.8\n/\n/\n/\n\n-\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
