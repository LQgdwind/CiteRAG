      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to schedule job-shop problems: Representation and policy learning using graph neural network and reinforcement learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nScheduling is considered as an important problem in both academia and practice. The job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) is, a type of scheduling problem that aims to determine the optimal sequential assignments of machines to multiple jobs consisting of series of operations while preserving the problem constraints (processing precedence and machine-sharing). The JSSP has attracted much interest in the research community  not only because it can be utilized as a framework to derive an effective scheduling strategy for manufacturing systems, but also because it can be used as a challenging benchmark for NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems  in developing combinatorial optimization (CO) algorithms. Researchers has suggested numerous approaches to solve the JSSP. Exact optimization approaches such as mathematical programming  and the branch and bound algorithm , have been proposed to solve the JSSP. Such methods guarantee an optimal solution but suffer from the curse of dimensionality, which has prevented these methods from being widely applied in the real-world applications . This limitation has led researchers to focus on developing approximation methods, which aim to find an effective but not optimal solution within reasonable computational time. These methods mainly include neighborhood search methods and priority dispatching rules (PDRs). Neighborhood search methods, such as Tabu search , simulated annealing , and genetic algorithm , generate high quality solutions in reasonable computational time. However, it is difficult to apply these search-based methods to the dynamic scheduling problems, where the conditions of the problem continuously change, because they are designed to find the entire scheduling assignments for a given initial condition. Therefore, these methods should be applied again whenever the conditions of the scheduling problem change , which is impractical in practice due to the extensive time required to find a good solution. To cope with such difficulties, PDRs have been extensively applied to real-world manufacturing scheduling problems  [ref]17 . A PDR is a heuristic rule that assigns jobs to machines based on their priorities while considering the current status of the system. By repeatedly applying PDRs whenever the status of the system changes, one can determine a sequence of jobs as the scheduling progress. Due to their simplicity, human-interpretable results, and low computational load, the majority of industries rely on PDRs more than other optimization methods. However, PDRs ignore the sequential nature of scheduling problems. As an extension of PDR, the composite dispatching rules (CDR) has been investigated for solving dynamic JSSP. the CDR whose parameters (the weight of dispatching rules) are optimized with genetic programming methods can yield a qualified dispatching policy.   Besides the approaches mentioned earlier, machine learning approaches, which especially utilize the function approximation property of the neural network, have been widely investigated to solve the JSSP in supervised learning (SL) setting   . The objective of the SL methods is to learn parameters of the neural network such that the trained networks can replicate the behavior of pre-existing scheduling methods such as mathematical optimizations, search methods, PDRs, or CDRs. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been employed to determine the scheduling actions of JSSP without utilizing any existing methods. In RL approaches, a scheduler (often RL agent) learns a dispatching policy that maps the current state of the manufacturing system to the scheduling action while considering the sequential nature of the problem. Following such characteristics, RL approaches successfully produce a scheduling solution of JSSP [ref]4   . Moreover, the RL approaches often discover the dispatching rules that are superior to the existing PDRs  . However, these RL methods typically require instance-by-instance training to derive the schedule, which entails difficulty applying the trained policy to a new JSSP. There have been few studies that employ graph neural networks (GNN) to solve scheduling problems, such as traveling salesman problem (TSP), vehicle routing problems (VRP)  [ref]18 . These studies first represent a problem instance into a graph and employ GNN to transform the graph into a set of node embedding that summarizes the structural information of the target problem. The policy function then takes the node embedding and produces the scheduling action. Because GNN enables the scheduling policy to handle the differently-sized graph, the trained policy can be used to produce scheduling actions for problem instances in different sizes. In this paper, we propose a framework to construct the scheduling policy for JSSPs using GNN and RL. We formulate the scheduling of a JSSP as a sequential decision making problem in a computationally efficient way. Next, we represent the state of a JSSP as a graph, consisting of operation nodes and constraint edges. Then, we employ a GNN to learn node features that embed the spatial structure of the JSSP and derive a scheduling policy that maps the embedded node features to scheduling action. We represent the state of job shop using a disjunctive graph  . The disjunctive graph specifies the structure of JSSP instance; nodes represent operations, conjunctive edges represent precedence/succeeding constraints between two nodes, and disjunctive edges represent machine-sharing constraints between two operations. The graph representation is then processed by GNN, a type of neural network that learns the interaction among nodes and edges of given graphs, to extract the node embedding. Because the node embedding summarizes the structural information of the JSSP graph, the scheduling policy that takes the node embedding as an input can yield good scheduling action while considering the JSSP structure. Since GNN learns how to extract the node embedding from the input graph, the GNN-based JSSP scheduler shows better scheduling performance than well-known PDRs on unseen JSSP instances without additional training. Moreover, the GNN-based scheduler shows on-par or even better scheduling performances than the baseline RL methods that are trained for solving specific-size JSSP problems, again without additional training. We use proximal policy optimization (PPO)  algorithm, a variant of policy-based RL, to train the GNN based state representation module and the parameterized decision-making policy jointly. PPO updates the parameters of the GNN and the policy only when the current representation module and the policy (locally) improves the scheduling performance. Because PPO have shown the most stable learning performance comparing to other RL algorithms such as baseline-augmented policy gradients  and Q-learning , this study employs PPO as principal learning algorithm. In summary, we propose a framework that effectively represents the JSSP state (representation learning) and makes the optimal decision (policy learning), along with an RL-based training method to optimally train these modules in an end-to-end fashion. We will refer to the derived scheduler as ‘GNN scheduler’. The proposed framework is illustrated in Figure 1. The scheduling policy learns to consider the inherent structure of the JSSP, rather than learning the characteristics of a specific JSSP instance. Therefore, the trained scheduling policy can be directly adopted to new JSSP instances without further training process. We empirically show that the GNN scheduler outperforms existing learning-based methods and PDRs when scheduling for unseen JSSP instances. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: We propose a problem formulation for JSSP as a sequential decision making problem with graph representation of the state to consider the structure of JSSP. We propose a framework to process JSSP graph state into node embedding using a GNN (representation learning) and make scheduling action using the constructed embedding (policy learning). We propose effective training methods for both (1) GNN based node embedding and (2) parameterized policy using reinforcement learning in an end-to-end fashion. We empirically demonstrate that the GNN scheduler for JSSP outperforms practically favored dispatching rules on various benchmark JSSP instances and provides an effective scheduling solution to completely new JSSP instances that are too large to be solved with conventional search-based algorithms.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: in practice due to the extensive time required to find a good solution.
