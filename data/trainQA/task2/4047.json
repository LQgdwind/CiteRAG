      "content": "Paper Title: Stochastic Multiple Target Sampling Gradient Descent\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe apply the proposed MT-SGD method on multi-task learning, following Algorithm 2. Our method is validated on\ndifferent benchmark datasets: (i) Multi-Fashion+MNIST [ref]27,\n(ii) Multi-MNIST, and (iii) Multi-Fashion. Each of them consists of\n120,000 training and 20,000 testing images generated from MNIST\n and FashionMNIST [ref]32 by overlaying\nan image on top of another: one in the top-left corner and one in\nthe bottom-right corner. Lenet  (22,350 params) is employed\nas the backbone architecture and trained for 100 epochs with SGD in this experimental setup. Baselines: In multi-task experiments, the introduced MT-SGD\nis compared with state-of-the-art baselines including MGDA ,\nPareto MTL , MOO-SVGD .\nWe note that to reproduce results for these baselines, we either use\nthe author’s official implementation released on GitHub\nor ask the authors for their codes. For MOO-SVGD and Pareto MTL, the\nreported result is from the ensemble prediction of five particle models.\nAdditionally, for linear scalarization and MGDA, we train five particle\nmodels independently with different initializations and then ensemble\nthese models. Evaluation metrics: We compare MT-SGD against baselines regarding both average accuracy and predictive uncertainty. Besides\nthe commonly used accuracy metric, we measure the quality and diversity\nof the particle models by relying on two other popular Bayesian metrics: Brier\nscore [ref]3  and expected\ncalibration error (ECE)  . From Figure 4, we observe that MT-SGD consistently\nimproves model performance across all tasks in both accuracy and Brier\nscore by large margins, compared to existing techniques in the literature.\nThe network trained using linear scalarization, as expected, produces\ninferior ensemble results while utilizing MOO techniques helps yield\nbetter performances. Overall, our proposed method surpasses the second-best\nbaseline by at least 1% accuracy in any experiment. Furthermore,\nTable 1 provides a comparison between these methods\nin terms of expected calibration error, in which MT-SGD also consistently\nprovides the lowest expected calibration error, illustrating our method’s\nability to obtain well-calibrated models (the accuracy is closely\napproximated by the produced confidence score). It is also worth noting\nthat while Pareto MTL has higher accuracy, MOO-SVGD produces slightly\nbetter calibration estimation. .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\nTask\nLinear scalarization\nMGDA\nPareto MTL\nMOO-SVGD\nMT-SGD\n\n\n\nMulti-Fashion+MNIST\nTop left\n21.33 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.83\n19.91 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.26\n9.44 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.65\n9.47 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.89\n4.65 ±plus-or-minus\\mathbf{\\pm} 0.11\n\nBottom right\n17.76 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.60\n16.29 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 1.35\n4.73 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.46\n4.95 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.49\n3.17 ±plus-or-minus\\mathbf{\\pm} 0.20\n\nMulti-MNIST\nTop left\n17.37 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.62\n15.29 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.49\n5.45 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.85\n5.37 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.51\n3.28 ±plus-or-minus\\mathbf{\\pm} 0.20\n\nBottom right\n18.09 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 1.11\n16.87 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.67\n7.34 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 1.08\n6.74 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.50\n4.00 ±plus-or-minus\\mathbf{\\pm} 0.19\n\nMulti-Fashion\nTop left\n15.86 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 1.20\n14.48 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.95\n8.55 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.69\n5.48 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.53\n3.80 ±plus-or-minus\\mathbf{\\pm} 0.38\n\nBottom right\n15.98 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 1.32\n14.70 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 1.63\n9.01 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 1.77\n6.11 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.54\n4.47 ±plus-or-minus\\mathbf{\\pm} 0.21\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: We apply the proposed MT-SGD method on multi-task learning, following Algorithm 2.
