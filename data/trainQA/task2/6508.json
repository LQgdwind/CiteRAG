      "content": "Paper Title: Graph Neural Networks based Log Anomaly Detection and Explanation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLog anomaly detection methods can be roughly divided into: 1) traditional, ‘shallow’ methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA) , one-class SVM (OCSVM) [ref]33, isolation forest (iForest) [ref]21, and histogram-based outlier score (HBOS) , which take a log event count matrix as input and analyse quantitative relationships; 2) deep learning based methods, such as DeepLog , LogAnomaly , and AutoEncoder , which employ sequences of log events (and sometimes their semantic embeddings) as input, analysing sequential information and possibly semantic information of log events to identify anomalies; and 3) graph-based methods, such as TCFG  and GLAD-PAW , which first convert logs into graphs and then perform graph-level anomaly detection. To our knowledge, only a few works   [ref]39  have capitalised on the powerful learning capabilities of graph neural networks for log anomaly detection. GLAD  transforms logs into undirected, weighted, and attributed heterogeneous graph, and propose a temporal-attentive graph edge anomaly detection model to detect anomalous relations. However, converting logs into undirected graphs may result in loss of important sequential information. Further, DeepTraLog  combines traces and logs to generate a so-called Trace Event Graph, which is an attributed and directed graph. On this basis, they train a Gated Graph Neural Networks based Deep Support Vector Data Description model to identify anomalies. However, their approach requires the availability of both traces and logs, and is unable to handle edge weights. In contrast, like LogGD [ref]39 and GLAD-PAW , our proposed Logs2Graphs approach is applicable to generic logs by converting logs into attributed, directed, and edge-weighted graphs. However, LogGD is a supervised method that requires fully labelled training data, which is usually impractical and even impossible. Moreover, LogGD and GLAD-PAW  are not capable of providing explanations for identified anomalies. In contrast, our proposed algorithm OCDiGCN is a general unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection method for attributed, directed, and edge-weighted graphs, able to provide explanations for identified anomalies. Although anomaly explanation has received much attention in traditional anomaly detection  , only a few studies  considered log anomaly explanation. Specifically, PLELog  offers explanations by quantifying the significance of individual log events within an anomalous log sequence, thereby facilitating improved identification of relevant log events by operators. Similarly, our method provides explanations for anomalous log groups by identifying and visualising a small subset of important nodes.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: Log anomaly detection methods can be roughly divided into: 1) traditional, ‘shallow’ methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA) , one-class SVM (OCSVM) [ref]33, isolation forest (iForest) [ref]21, and histogram-based outlier score (HBOS) , which take a log event count matrix as input and analyse quantitative relationships; 2) deep learning based\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
