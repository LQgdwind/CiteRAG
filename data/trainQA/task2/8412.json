      "content": "Paper Title: Asymptotics for the reciprocal and shifted quotient of the partition function\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA partition λ\\lambda of a positive integer nn is a weakly decreasing sequence of positive integers λ=(λ1,…,λr)\\lambda=\\left(\\lambda_{1},\\dots,\\lambda_{r}\\right) such that ∑j=1rλj=n\\sum_{j=1}^{r}\\lambda_{j}=n. The total number of partitions of nn is denoted by p​(n)p(n) with p​(0):=1p(0):=1. A rigorous study on p​(n)p(n) from the analytic point of view began with the seminal work of Hardy and Ramanujan . In , developing a widely celebrated tool known as Circle Method, they established the asymptotic growth of p​(n)p(n) which states that Later Rademacher  refined the Circle Method to give an exact formula for p​(n)p(n). Lehmer   estimated the error term after truncating Rademacher’s convergent series for p​(n)p(n). Among many other applications, Rademacher’s formula along with Lehmer’s estimate have been used to prove inequalities for p​(n)p(n). The first such instance has been documented in Nicolas’ work [ref]26 on the log-concavity of p​(n)p(n), where a sequence (of positive real numbers) (an)n≥0(a_{n})_{n\\geq 0} is called log-concave if an2≥an−1​an+1a_{n}^{2}\\geq a_{n-1}a_{n+1} for all n≥1n\\geq 1. We refer to   for a more detailed study on log-concavity and its higher order analogues known as higher order Turán inequalities. After a standstill for more than thirty years, DeSalvo and Pak’s work  on the log-concavity of p​(n)p(n) and its associated inequalities not only confirmed the conjectures of Chen  but also resurrected this particular area of research on p​(n)p(n). Since then an extensive amount of work on inequalities for p​(n)p(n) and its variations have been recorded. Among many others, we refer the readers to the work of Bringmann, Kane, Rolen, and Tripp  on inequalities for the fractional partition function pα​(n)p_{\\alpha}(n) arising from the famous Nekrasov–Okounkov formula  and to Ono, Pujahari, and Rolen’s work  on Turán inequalities for the plane partition function PL​(n)\\text{PL}(n). For a detailed study on PL​(n)\\text{PL}(n), see . In the following we shall restrict ourselves to inequalities for p​(n)p(n). The motivation for doing so is as follows. We call a polynomial with real coefficients hyperbolic if all roots are real. The sequence of so-called Jensen polynomials associated with p​(n)p(n) is defined as From work of Nicolas [ref]26 and DeSalvo and Pak  we already know that Jp2,n​(x)J^{2,n}_{p}(x) is hyperbolic for n≥26n\\geq 26. The case for d=3d=3 has been settled by Chen, Jia, and Wang . Soon after, in their fundamental work on a problem entangled with variants of the Riemann hypothesis, Griffin, Ono, Rolen, and Zagier  confirmed that for any d∈ℤ≥0d\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0}, Jpd,n​(x)J^{d,n}_{p}(x) is eventually hyperbolic which settled the conjecture of Chen, Jia, and Wang . In [16, Theorem 3], Griffin, Ono, Rolen, and Zagier developed a generic framework to decide the hyperbolicity of Jensen polynomials associated with a family of sequences satisfying certain growth conditions. In particular, for p​(n)p(n) they proved the hyperbolicity of Jpd,n​(x)J^{d,n}_{p}(x) for sufficiently large nn by showing the following uniform convergence property: with Hd​(x)H_{d}(x) the dd-th Hermite polynomial and where the sequences (δ​(n))n≥0(\\delta(n))_{n\\geq 0}, (A​(n))n≥0(A(n))_{n\\geq 0} are determined by Larson and Wagner [21, Theorem 1.3] derived an effective cutoff N​(d)N(d) for nn such that Jpd,n​(x)J^{d,n}_{p}(x) is hyperbolic for all n≥N​(d)n\\geq N(d). In order to arrive at their main result, one of the quintessential steps was to get an asymptotic expansion of the quotient p​(n+j)/p​(n)p(n+j)/p(n); see [21, Lemmas 2.2 and 2.3]. Recently, Gomez, Males, and Rolen [14, Theorem 1.1] obtained a more effective error bound for the asymptotic expansion of the ratio p​(n−j)/p​(n)p(n-j)/p(n) truncating after the first three terms of the asymptotic series, which, in turn, has many applications including a shifted convexity property of p​(n)p(n) (see     ) and new estimates of the kk-rank partition function Nk​(m,n)N_{k}(m,n) defined by Garvan . In this article we generalize the result [14, Theorem 1.1] of Gomez, Males, and Rolen as stated below in Theorem 1.1 but with a slight variant; namely, for quotients with positive shifts p​(n+k)/p​(n)p(n+k)/p(n). Throughout, we write f​(x)=O≤c​(g​(x))f(x)=O_{\\leq c}\\left(g(x)\\right) if |f​(x)|≤c​g​(x)\\left|f(x)\\right|\\leq cg(x) for a positive function gg and for a domain of xx which we will specify in each given context. With this convention we can state the main result of this article. Moreover, we use ℕ\\mathbb{N} to denote the set of positive integers. Let (k,N)∈ℕ2(k,N)\\in\\mathbb{N}^{2}. Then for all n≥nN​(k)n\\geq n_{N}(k) where ck​(0)=1c_{k}(0)=1, the constants (ck​(m))m≥1(c_{k}(m))_{m\\geq 1}, nN​(k)n_{N}(k), and EN​(k)E_{N}(k) are determined effectively for any fixed NN. The (ck​(m))m≥1(c_{k}(m))_{m\\geq 1}, nN​(k)n_{N}(k), and EN​(k)E_{N}(k) are stated explicitly in (5.3), (5.1), and (5.28) respectively. In their study on asymptotic rr-log-concavity for p​(n)p(n), Hou and Zhang [19, Theorem 1.3] determined an asymptotic expansion of p​(n+1)/p​(n)p(n+1)/p(n). Theorem 1.1 is a straightforward generalization of their result. In particular, now we have estimated effectively the cutoff nN​(k)n_{N}(k), the error bound EN​(k)E_{N}(k), and also provided a concrete description of the coefficient sequence (ck​(m))m≥0(c_{k}(m))_{m\\geq 0}. In light of the remark [14, Remark 1.3] made by Gomez, Males, and Rolen on positivity of Δjr​(p​(n))\\Delta^{r}_{j}(p(n)), where Δjr\\Delta^{r}_{j} is the rr-fold application of the difference operator Δj\\Delta_{j} defined by (Δj​p)​(n)=p​(n)−p​(n−j)\\left(\\Delta_{j}p\\right)(n)=p(n)-p(n-j), it seems that by making the shift n↦n+jn\\mapsto n+j, one might use Theorem 1.1 by choosing the truncation point N​(r)N(r)111For instance, one can choose N​(r)=r+1N(r)=r+1, see [5, Chap. 6, Sec. 6.7.2]. (depending on r∈ℕr\\in\\mathbb{N}) in the asymptotic expansion of p​(n+k)/p​(n)p(n+k)/p(n) appropriately so as to obtain the asymptotic growth of Δjr​(p​(n))\\Delta^{r}_{j}(p(n)). In addition to that, we can estimate a cutoff nN​(r),r​(j)n_{N(r),r}(j) such that Δjr​(p​(n))≥0\\Delta^{r}_{j}(p(n))\\geq 0 for all n≥nN​(r),r​(j)n\\geq n_{N(r),r}(j). The case r=2r=2 was settled in [14, Theorem 1.2]. We summarize in brief the main tools which will be used in proving Theorem 1.1. First, we will start with the infinite family of inequalities for p​(n)p(n) given in [7, Theorem 4.4] that states: for m∈ℤ≥2m\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 2} and n>g​(m)n>g(m) (see Theorem 2.1 below), This result has twofold applications in the present context: (i) by considering the shift n↦n+kn\\mapsto n+k, after Taylor series expansion of the major term 12​eμ​(n+k)24​(n+k)−1​(1−1μ​(n+k))\\frac{\\sqrt{12}e^{\\mu(n+k)}}{24(n+k)-1}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{\\mu(n+k)}\\right), we extract the coefficient sequence in the asymptotic expansion of p​(n+k)p(n+k) and similarly, (ii) for exhibiting the coefficient sequence in the asymptotic expansion of 1/p​(n)1/p(n), we use Taylor series expansion for the inverse of the major term; i.e., 24​n−112​eμ​(n)​(1−1μ​(n))−1\\frac{24n-1}{\\sqrt{12}e^{\\mu(n)}}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{\\mu(n)}\\right)^{-1}. In addition, we shall use the symbolic summation package Sigma, developed by the third author , to simplify the coefficients appearing in the asymptotic expansion for 1/p​(n)1/p(n) so as to obtain precise error bound estimates for the asymptotic expansion under consideration. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we will recall a list of preliminary results from   which will be helpful in carrying out estimates in the subsequent sections. In Sections 3 and 4, we will provide asymptotic expansions for the shifted partition function p​(n+k)p(n+k) (see Theorem 3.1) and the inverse 1/p​(n)1/p(n) (see Theorem 4.18), respectively. The proof of Theorem 1.1 is given in Section 5. Finally in Section 6, we lay out a detailed exposition on the usage of the symbolic summation package Sigma.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: Among many other applications, Rademacher’s formula along with Lehmer’s estimate have been used to prove inequalities for p​(n)p(n).
