Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Mind Reasoning Manners: Enhancing Type Perception for Generalized Zero-shot Logical Reasoning over Text\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe include all the previous SOTA baselines in the main paper for comparison, as\nwell as the results from some classical language models. Random The results in this setting are based on the random\npredictions. RoBERTa-Large [ref]32 The results are\nobtained simply utilizing the RoBERTa language model for the predictions. It is\nsimilar to the baseline of BERT-Large [ref]36 and XLNet-Large\n. Human Performance  In ReClor, the average\nscore of different graduate students on the test split is utilized as the human\nperformance. DAGN  It is the first work to propose\nthe construction of the text graph based on the extracted EDUs. It mainly\nrelies on the RoBERTa-Large [ref]32 to encode the tokens and\ngraph neural network [ref]17 to update the features. FocalReasoner  It constructs a\nsupergraph for reasoning, which consists of the fact units extracted from the\ntext. LReasoner  It explores the context\nextension based on the defined logical rules (e.g., De Morganâ€™s laws). Also, it\nemploys the data augmentation method to improve the performance. Since\nconstructing more training data is proved to be of great help to the zero-shot\nperformance of most of the current models, we do not consider the data\naugmentation strategy when reproducing. MERIt  It proposes a meta-path-guided\ncontrastive learning method to reason over the text. The supervised pretraining\nis performed on the abundant unlabeled text data. Due to the employment of the\nexternal data, we do not consider this method in the zero-shot baselines for\nthe fair comparison. AdaLoGN  It proposes a neuro-symbolic\nsystem to adaptively update the text graph. Additionally, a novel\nsubgraph-to-node mechanism is utilized aggregate the information. Logiformer  It introduces two\ndifferent strategies to construct the logical graph and the syntax graph\nrespectively. Through the two-branch graph transformer network, the text\nfeatures are updated to conduct the reasoning.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: SOTA baselines in the main paper for comparison, as\nwell as the results from some classical language models. Random The results in this setting are based on the random\npredictions. RoBERTa-Large [ref]32 The results are\nobtained simply utilizing the RoBERTa language model for the predictions.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
