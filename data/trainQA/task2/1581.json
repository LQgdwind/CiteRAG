      "content": "Paper Title: Enumerating maximal consistent closed sets in closure systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper, we consider binary inconsistency relations (i.e., graphs) over\nimplicational bases, a well-known representation for closure systems  .\nMore precisely, we seek to enumerate maximal closed sets of a closure system given by an\nimplicational base that are consistent with respect to an inconsistency relation.\nWe call this problem Maximal Consistent Closed Sets Enumeration, or\nMCCEnum for short. This problem finds applications for instance in minimization of sub-modular\nfunctions  or argumentation frameworks\n.\nIt is moreover a particular case of dualization in closure systems given by an\nimplicational bases, ubiquitous in computer science   .\nThis latter problem however cannot be solved in output-polynomial time unless P=NPPNP\\operatorname{{\\textsf{P}}}=\\operatorname{{\\textsf{NP}}}\n even when the input implicational base has premises of\nsize at most two .\nWhen restricted to graphs and implicational bases with premises of size one, or posets\nequivalently, the problem can be solved in polynomial delay\n . More generally, inconsistency relations combined with posets appear also in event\nstructures , representations of median-semilattices\n or cubical complexes [ref]2 in\nwhich the term “inconsistency” is used.\nRecently in  , the authors derive a\nrepresentation for modular semi-lattices based on inconsistency and projective ordered\nspaces .\nFurthermore, they characterize the cases where given an implicational base and an\ninconsistency relation, maximal consistent closed sets coincide with maximal independent\nsets of the inconsistency relation, seen as a graph. In our contribution, we show first that enumerating maximal consistent closed sets\ncannot be solved in output-polynomial time unless P=NPPNP\\operatorname{{\\textsf{P}}}=\\operatorname{{\\textsf{NP}}}, a surprising result which\nfurther emphasizes the hardness of dualization in lattices given by implicational bases\n .\nIn fact, we show that this problem is already intractable for the well-known\nclass of lower bounded lattices   .\nOn the positive side, we show that when the maximal size of minimal generators is bounded\nby a constant, the problem can be solved in incremental-polynomial time.\nAs a direct corollary, we obtain that MCCEnum can be solved efficiently in\na several classes of convex geometries where this parameter, also known as the\nCarathéodory number, is constant\n.\nFinally, we focus on biatomic atomistic closure systems  .\nWe show that under an independence condition, the size of a minimal generator is\nlogarithmic in the size of the groundset.\nAs a consequence, we get a quasi-polynomial time algorithm for enumerating maximal\nconsistent closed sets which can be applied to the well-known class of atomistic modular\nlattices  1  8. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.\nSection 2 gives necessary definitions about closure\nsystems and implicational bases.\nIn Section 3 we show that MCCEnum cannot be solved in\noutput-polynomial time, in particular for lower bounded closure systems.\nIn Section 4, we show that if the size of a minimal generator is bounded\nby a constant, MCCEnum can be solved efficiently.\nSection 5 is devoted to the class of biatomic atomistic closure systems.\nWe conclude with open questions and problems in 6.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: can be solved in polynomial delay\n . More generally, inconsistency relations combined with posets appear also in event\nstructures , representations of median-semilattices\n or cubical complexes [ref]2 in\nwhich the term “inconsistency” is used.\nRecently in  , the authors derive a\nrepresentation for modular semi-lattices based on inconsistency and projective ordered\nspaces .\nFurthermore, they\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
