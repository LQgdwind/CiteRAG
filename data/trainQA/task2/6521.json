      "content": "Paper Title: Temporal Graph Benchmark for Machine Learning on Temporal Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTemporal Graph Datasets and Libraries.\nRecently, Poursafaei et al. [ref]33 collected six novel datasets for link prediction on continuous-time dynamic graphs while proposing more difficult negative samples for evaluation. In comparison, we curated seven novel temporal graph datasets spanning both edge and node level tasks for realistic evaluation of machine learning on temporal graphs. Yu et al. [ref]52 presented DyGLib, a platform for reproducible training and evaluation of existing TG models on common benchmark datasets. DyGLib demonstrates the discrepancy of the model performance across different datasets and argues that diverse evaluation protocols of previous works caused an inconsistency in performance reports. Similarly, Skarding et al.  provided a comprehensive comparative analysis of heuristics, static GNNs, discrete dynamic GNN, and continuous dynamic GNN on dynamic link prediction task. They showed that dynamic models outperforms their static counterparts consistently and heuristic approaches can achieve strong performance. In all of the above benchmarks, the included datasets only contain a few million edges. In comparison, TGB datasets are orders of magnitude larger in scale in terms of number of nodes, edges and timestamps. TGB also includes both node and edge-level tasks. Huang et al.  collected a novel dynamic graph dataset for anomalous node detection in financial networks and compared the performance of different graph anomaly detection methods. In this work, TGB datasets have more edges and timestamps while covering both edge and node tasks. Temporal Graph Methods.\nWith the growing interest in temporal graph learning, several recent models achieved outstanding performance on existing benchmark datasets. However, due to the limitations of the current evaluation, many methods achieve over-optimistic and similar performance for the dynamic link prediction task [ref]46     . In this work, TGB datasets and evaluation show a clear distinction between SOTA model performance, which helps facilitate future advancement of TG learning methods. Temporal graphs are categorized into discrete-time and continuous-time Temporal graphs . In this work, we focus on the continuous-time temporal graphs as it is more general. Continuous-time TG methods can be divided into node or edge representation learning methods. Node-based models such as TGN , DyRep  and TCL  first leverage the node information such as temporal neighborhood or previous node history to generate node embeddings and then aggregate node embeddings from both source and destination node of an edge to predict its existence. In comparison, edge-based methods such as CAWN [ref]46 and GraphMixer  aim to directly generate embeddings for the edge of interest and then predict its existence. Lastly, the simple memory-based heuristic EdgeBank [ref]33 without any learning component has shown surprising performance based on existing evaluation. We compare these methods on TGB datasets in Section 5. For more discussion on TG methods see Appendix D.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: Temporal Graph Datasets and Libraries.\nRecently, Poursafaei et al. [ref]33 collected six novel datasets for link prediction on continuous-time dynamic graphs while proposing more difficult negative samples for evaluation.
