      "content": "Paper Title: Rumor Detection with Hierarchical Representation on Bipartite Adhoc Event Trees\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning research solves the automatic feature extraction problem while achieving fine granularity and diversity. Researchers are no longer limited to the single processing and use of features because of richer and more accurate feature information. However, they are instead exploring the fusion of multiple features and structural modeling. Serialized propagation topology representation.\nSome methods place less emphasis on the propagation topology and instead focus on propagation time sequence properties. These researchers hoped to explore relevant clues generated over time to characterize the different characteristics of the rumor at different times by modeling the propagation process of information with time characteristics. Yu et al.  designed a CNN-based model called CAMI to extract flexible content sequence between key characteristics, formation of high-level interactions, and aids in the effective classification. Extensive mixed features, such as time series and content-related features, are increasingly important to research. Thus Ma et al. [ref]14 used an RNN network to process each time step in the rumor propagation sequentially. Chen et al.  proposed an attention mechanism to capture longer-term dependencies and enhance the long-term temporal features . In addition, attention networks [ref]20 and Transformers  were adopted to better mine the posts’ features with time sequences as a clue to identify rumors. Author traits, on the other hand, are frequently used to define authors’ personality information, such as authors’ profile information and social relationships, which are used to vividly describe the authors’ involvement in propagation and their behavior . Shu et al.  argued that fake news could imitate real news, which means that the dissemination of authors’ information must be thoroughly researched. Ruchansky et al.  developed a tri-relationship embedding framework TriFN that can learn the characteristics of forwarded texts and author profiles while also generating credibility scores to help with rumor detection. Shu et al.  built five novel metrics to interactively model the relationships between news and users (publishers, social participants, etc.). Recently, Wu et al.  constructed a decision tree mechanism to address rumor interpretability issues, using users’ credibility scores as evidence to help identify rumors. Lu et al.  built a graph-aware joint attention network to detect fake news by taking into account the root article’s text content (claim), forwarding author sequence (sequential propagation) and author information (author profile). These methods, however, cannot accurately reflect the characteristics of actual rumor propagation and spreading because they focus on mining the characteristics of authors and posts changing over time via simple temporality while ignoring the internal topology of rumor propagation. Structured propagation topology representation. The rumor propagation topology representation is concerned with modeling the rumor propagation structure, gathering various information such as stances and sentiments in the topology, and mining the interactive information of multiple features of posts and authors to enrich the rumor representation. Simultaneously, understanding the process and mode of rumor propagation aids in identifying rumors at an early stage of rumor propagation and achieves a good explanatory effect in detecting the authenticity of rumors. Rumor propagation topology enables us to better abstract rumor propagation patterns and further excavate the correlations between hybrid features via propagation aggregation   , resulting in good interpretability on the veracity of rumors. Wu et al.  calculated the substructural similarity of two propagation trees on Sina Weibo datasets for detection. Similarly, Ma et al.  employed the tree kernel to compute similar substructures and identify various types of rumors in Twitter datasets. The above two methods rely on the similarity of the two trees. But they cannot distinguish between individual trees and are still based on feature engineering rather than deep learning. Moreover, considering that RvNN   were originally used to learn phrase or sentence representations for semantic parsing, Wong et al. [ref]18 proposed two types of recursive tree-structured neural network models to learn representations from their structure and contents. Ma et al.  recently developed an improved rumor detection model based on Wong et al. [ref]18 with designed discriminative attention mechanisms for model optimization. Bian et al.  believed that Wong et al. [ref]18 only considered propagation depth, ignoring spread. Two graph convolutional networks (GCN) were used to learn the top-down propagation depth and the down-top disperse breadth simultaneously. Wei et al. [ref]20 is also based on GCN networks and considers the reliability of the rumor propagation relationship when optimizing the propagation model for a better rumor classification effect. Graph attention networks (GAT) are also used in various research fields. Lin et al.  proposed a new ClaHi-GAT model to represent the action graph between the post content and the author and learn the characteristics of rumors by the multi-layer attention mechanism of the root post layer and event layer. In addition, Liu et al.  proposed a novel rumor detection framework based on structure-aware retweeting GNNs based on a converted tractable tree. Wei et al.  further considered the uncertainty of interactions caused by users’ various subjective factors and proposed fuzzy graph convolutional networks to model uncertain interactions in the information cascade of a tweet graph. Although such methods are constantly improving the modeling of rumor propagation topological structure to obtain better rumor representations, most ignore author-level information, including simple user personality characteristics (author profiles) and the structured interaction relationship formed between users during the spread process.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: high-level interactions, and aids in the effective classification.
