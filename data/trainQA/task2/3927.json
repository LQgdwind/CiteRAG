      "content": "Paper Title: ST-ExpertNet: A Deep Expert Framework for Traffic Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, with the maturity of perception technology and computing environment, various kinds of big data have quietly emerged in cities, such as traffic flow, weather data, road networks, points of interest, movement trajectories, and social media. Among them, the task of traffic flow prediction is of great significance to urban traffic management and public safety and has received extensive attention from academia in recent years. Existing efforts have mainly considered that traffic flow is affected by recent time intervals, daily periodicity, and weekly trend [ref]1   , which can help the model distinguish functional regions. For instance, we can recognize between\nresidential areas and office areas by recent traffic flows. Specifically, people go out to work on weekdays morning, so the outflow of residential regions will increase, and the inflow will grow in office areas. Furthermore, by observing periodic flows, we can find that both inflow and outflow remain stable during the week in the residential area, but will drop significantly on weekends in the office area. However, in the literature, these factors are mainly considered as purely time-series signals rather than the unique features of each functional region. Moreover, they ignored the fact that the flows of the different functional areas only influence relevant parts rather than citywide. For instance, the entertaining region’s flow growing up on weekends will not affect the flow state in the office areas. This ignorance will finally result in the improper design of the previous citywide prediction model, which aims to use a single network to predict the flows of all functional regions, inevitably causing difficulties in thoroughly understanding the different flow patterns. Further, when an abnormal prediction is produced from the previous model, it can’t tell why this happens. This will be solved if we can see the knowledge of the area learned by the model.\nFor instance, if the region is an entertaining district, the model considers it an office area and outputs tiny values on weekends. We will know if the misunderstanding of the model causes this. Most of the previous work has successfully exploited the laws of human mobility in the flow tensor and provided a new perspective for researchers to understand the human flow pattern   . Recently, the crowd flow tensor has been demonstrated can be decomposed into several basic patterns of human life , each of which has its law, such as the commuting pattern that focuses mainly on the morning and evening peaks on weekdays and the entertaining pattern that focuses on the entire day of the weekends. The flow pattern distribution is greatly affected by both time and the distribution of functional regions geographically. For example, the commuting pattern dominates highways all day while the working pattern only occupies office area till evenings. A functional region can be filled with many flow patterns at each timestamp, but only one or two of them is the main component. Figure 1 shows an example of using three same networks (experts) trained with attention mechanism on real-world taxi data in Beijing [ref]1 during rush hours. The attention mechanism assigns weights to the experts so that each region of the 32×32323232\\times 32 mesh grids (i.e., the Beijing city map) might receive predictions from a number of experts but with different weightings. In Figure 1 (a), there are 32×32323232\\times 32 points representing all regions of Beijing, and each region receives attention from three experts, whose relatively proportional weight can be viewed from the axis. We further cluster regions with similar relatively proportional weights of three experts using KMeans, and one of the classes has been represented in Figure 1 (b), which is the primary commuting road section in Beijing, demonstrating that the experts have successfully mined the commuting flow patterns and the underneath Beijing ring road structure. However, as we can see in the Figure 1 (a), the flow patterns are closely connected to each other, which suggests that a single attention mechanism without regularization can not fulfill our needs. By summing up the conclusions proposed by previous work, this paper considers that the traffic flow prediction task could be divided into two-part: 1) building a set of expert models to automatically disentangle the mixed-flow tensors with several inherent patterns. 2) predicting the future flow state of each pattern. The task of training multiple functional experts could be considered as the MoE (mixture of experts) problem   , which generates expert systems through differentiated learning strategies to improve the precision and robustness of the deep neural network.\nWe propose the ST-ExpertNet framework based on MoE [ref]12, which divides the sample space by a gating network.\nIn ST-ExpertNet, the flow of a region is equal to the combination of multiple basic flow patterns, which enhances the robustness and certainty of the model compared to a single model. For example, we can see the reasonableness of the model’s predictions through the components of different flow patterns. Meanwhile, as mentioned above, the combination of multiple models improves the fault tolerance of the model compared to a traditional model, which is a kind of approach widely used in adversarial robustness. For better performance and\ninterpretability of ST-ExpertNet, this paper considers the following criteria: Comprehensiveness: The data distributions learned by each expert should be as different as possible. To achieve that, each expert should have enough knowledge to distinguish different types of flow patterns caused by time and the characteristic distribution of functional regions. In our approach, the factors of hour, day, and week and metadata have been concatenated together to provide each expert the distinctive features for each region and flow patterns. This is different from the traditional strategy [ref]1 [ref]14 . Sparsity: The expert should be discrepant in both spatial and temporal aspects. For instance, in terms of the temporal aspects, while one expert is in charge of the peaking hours in residential areas, the other one is responsible for the midnight periods. From spatial aspects, the experts should pay attention to different functional regions. Therefore, for each input, only a few “activated” experts are encouraged. In this paper, the penalty term Expert Inter Discrepancy Loss which bases on Determinant Point Process (DPP) has been proposed to\npunish the similarity between experts. Additionally, redundant experts should be avoided, as they\nadd to the complexity of the explanation but do not add additional\nperformance. Therefore, the number of experts should be controlled in small numbers to provide a clear explanation for users in ST-ExpertNet. Preciseness:\nEach expert should assume full responsibility for its prediction. Therefore, Expert Responsibility Loss has been proposed to improve the prediction performance in the flow patterns charged by experts. Two types of gating networks have been proposed in terms of spatial and temporal aspects. The former intends to\ngenerate the attention for each expert and\nto provide the opportunity to peek inside the experts by attention mechanisms , and the latter aims to adjust the output signal amplitude from a global perspective. To further evaluate the interpretability and performance of the ST-ExpertNet framework, we\nintegrate ST-ResNet [ref]1, convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) , and convolutional neural networks (CNN), which are popular baselines in the flow prediction task, into our framework. We test our explainable framework in real-world taxi and bike datasets: TaxiBJ, TaxiNYC, BikeNYC-I, and BikeNYC-II in Beijing and New York respectively. ST-ExpertNet can give embedded representations for each region or pattern in our city with spatial and temporal aspects. For temporality, we show the evolutionary process between the office and residential areas of Beijing. For spatiality, we show the knowledge distribution of each expert at the citywide level, which is well-aligned with the human cognition of our city. We summarize our contributions to the field as follows: We provide a new perspective of viewing the crowd flow prediction problem by decomposing the mixed flow pattern into several basic ones and training ”specialized” experts to gain better performances. We propose a novel and efficient architecture based on the mixture of experts (MoE), which can adopt every ST-model by making it as an expert. We design Experts Inter Discrepancy Loss and  Experts Responsibility Loss  for regularizing the expert learning paradigm. We conduct experiments on several real-world traffic datasets. The popular baselines in flow prediction: ST-ResNet, ConvLSTM, CNN have been employed in our framework, and the results show that our model is consistently better and more explainable than other state-of-the-art methods. The remainder of our paper is arranged as follows: Section 2 introduces the related work, including mixture of experts, crowd flow prediction and data mining in human mobility. Section 3 gives the primary definition of flows and the flow prediction problem. It also describes our basic idea to solve crowd flow prediction based on the general framework of mixture of experts. Section 4 introduces our ST-ExpertNet framework in detail. Section 5 conducts both the quantitative and qualitative experiments on our ST-ExpertNet.\nSection 6 discusses the conclusion and future works.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: has received extensive attention from academia in recent years.
