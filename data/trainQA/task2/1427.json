      "content": "Paper Title: ORDisCo: Effective and Efficient Usage of Incremental Unlabeled Data for Semi-supervised Continual Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe adapt the representative continual learning strategies, including weight regularization methods [ref]29 and memory replay ones [ref]29, to SSCL by considering unlabeled data and provides a systematical analysis. In particular, we conduct extensive SSCL experiments on the SVHN dataset, where we equally split the training set into 30 batches with 3 labels per class in each batch. Notably, we learn various strong semi-supervised classifiers, including MT , VAT , PL [ref]14 and PI  models in SSCL. We consider four learning strategies for all classifiers to verify the existence of catastrophic forgetting and analyze the underling reason, as follows: Joint Training (JT): The classifier is jointly trained on all the partially labeled data ever seen. Sequential Training (ST): The classifier is sequentially trained on the incremental partially labeled data. Weight Regularization: Representative approaches of weight regularization, including SI , MAS [ref]1 and EWC , are implemented to the classifier to selectively stabilize parameters. Memory Replay: A memory buffer is implemented to replay old training data. Classical methods   in CL use mean-of-feature to select samples, while in SSCL we do not have sufficient labels to perform selection. Therefore, we select data through uniform sampling, which is indeed competitive to existing selection methods as analyzed in  (See empirical results in Appendix A). We extensively search the hyperparameters of all baselines and summarize the best results. For details like the search space, we refer the readers to Appendix B.\nWe compare the performance of different learning strategies based on the MT classifier in Fig. 1.\nThe results of other classifiers are similar and detailed in Appendix A. In Fig. 1, it can be seen that\nST on the incremental partially labeled data significantly underperforms JT, suggesting the existence of catastrophic forgetting.\nBesides, simply adopting weight regularization methods [ref]29  [ref]1  on a semi-supervised classifier cannot address the issue in SSCL. We hypothesize that the regularization of parameter changes in such methods limits the learning of incremental data, see more experiments and detailed discussion in Appendix B. A potential future work can be designing proper regularization terms in SSCL. In comparison, using a supervised memory buffer (SMB), whose maximum size is of 900 images, to replay labeled data  [ref]29  can effectively reduce the gap from JT but still has a large space to improve.\nFurther, we evaluate a strategy with an additional unsupervised memory buffer (SMB+UMB), whose maximum size is of 10,000 images, to replay unlabeled data. Indeed, the extra buffer is about twice the size of a typical generator used in our method. Given an extra large memory buffer for unlabeled data, however, we observed that the performance of the memory replay approach cannot be further improved, implying that the unlabeled data are not fully exploited. In fact, we visualize the coverage of the UMB on the distribution of all the training data using t-SNE  embedding (see details in Appendix A). As shown in Fig. 2 (a), although the UMB has already stored around 10%percent1010\\% data of the entire dataset, it still cannot cover the distribution of training data very well. Therefore, a common issue of existing CL strategies in the semi-supervised scenarios is that they cannot effectively capture and exploit the distribution of unlabeled data. We identify this as the catastrophic forgetting of unlabeled data problem, which is challenging because the incremental unlabeled data are massive and lack annotations. This motivates us to propose two new strategies to continually learn a generative model that can successfully capture the data distribution (see Fig. 2, b) given partially labeled data.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: We adapt the representative continual learning strategies, including weight regularization methods [ref]29 and memory replay ones [ref]29, to SSCL by considering unlabeled data and provides a systematical analysis.
