      "content": "Paper Title: Spiker+: a framework for the generation of efficient Spiking Neural Networks FPGA accelerators for inference at the edge\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIntegrating Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) at the edge is a pivotal computing advancement, enabling direct application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities in devices and systems at the periphery of networks, resulting crucial in domains like autonomous vehicles, industrial automation, and healthcare . Using ANNs at the edge allows systems to process substantial data locally, reducing latency, power consumption, and reliance on external data centers or cloud services. Additionally, it enhances privacy and security by keeping sensitive data within the edge device . This approach boosts the effectiveness and agility of embedded applications, paving the way for innovative breakthroughs across sectors and ushering in a new era of intelligent, decentralized computing. Neural networks, tailored for diverse computational tasks, include feed-forward networks for pattern recognition, recurrent networks for sequential data, convolutional networks for image analysis, and transformers for Natural Language Processing (NLP) . Amidst this variety, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) emerge as a promising paradigm for edge computing in resource-constrained environments, particularly intriguing for researchers in neurosciences and Machine Learning (ML) . Unlike traditional models, SNNs closely mimic biological neurons that efficiently process dynamic, time-sensitive data , making them valuable in edge computing scenarios, where real-time decision-making is crucial . In this context, hardware accelerators are vital for SNNs applications, significantly improving computational efficiency and speed for real-time processing in resource-constrained environments [ref]4. However, the flexibility of specialized hardware design poses a challenge, with applications often requiring diverse network architectures, encoding methods, and neuron models. While awaiting the maturity of SNN accelerators based on emerging technologies, existing literature proposes various digital hardware solutions (refer to section 3). Unfortunately, these solutions often constrain network topology to circuit architecture, limiting exploration of the broader design space, whether considering Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) or Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) . We propose an alternative strategy, optimizing the network architecture for specific needs and leveraging FPGAs for deploying custom hardware blocks. This approach enables efficient and low-power SNN inference engines at the edge, supporting real-time data processing. FPGAs provide high parallelism and reconfigurability, making them ideal for accelerating complex neural network computations with minimal latency. To support this trend, this paper presents Spiker+, a complete framework for generating efficient low-power and low-area customized SNN accelerators on FPGAs for inference at the edge. Spiker+ introduces several pivotal contributions. At its core, it provides a fully configurable multi-layer hardware architecture implementing both fully connected and recurrent SNNs. This architecture is a significant step from the preliminary Spiker model, initially presented in . It introduces a library of highly efficient architectures delving into a range of approximation techniques to implement remarkably low-area and low-power neurons, thus optimizing resource utilization while maintaining high performance. Notably, Spiker+ brings a complete design framework to the forefront, a comprehensive toolkit for developing complex SNNs accelerators. This framework empowers researchers and developers to describe target network architectures with great flexibility, enabling the specification of layers, neuron types, and input encoding techniques using a few lines of Python code. Integrating sophisticated off-line server-based training algorithms like Back-Propagation Through Time (BPTT)  and Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) ensures the network has cutting-edge learning capabilities. Additionally, Spiker+ emphasizes the significance of optimizing networks through quantization techniques, reducing complexity while judiciously balancing approximation and accuracy. Finally, the framework seamlessly generates a VHDL model of the accelerator, primed for deployment on Xilinx™ FPGA boards. These contributions make Spiker+ a robust solution in the hardware-accelerated SNN landscape.\nSpiker+ has been tested on the well-known MNIST dataset [ref]7 and compared to state-of-the-art SNN accelerators for FPGAs, demonstrating superior performance. Moreover, an accelerator for the Spiking Heidelberg Dataset (SHD) [ref]8 has been generated and evaluated to illustrate the framework’s flexibility when handling different problems. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 presents some background on SNNs, focusing on the models used in Spiker+; section 3 reviews relevant literature on accelerating SNNs. Section 4 describes the Spiker+ architecture, with all the design choices that it involves, and section 5 introduces the framework able to configure, design, and generate custom hardware accelerators. Finally, section 6 presents the results obtained by applying the designed accelerators on the MNIST and the SHD and section 7 concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: .
