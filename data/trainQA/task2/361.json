      "content": "Paper Title: Scalable Mining of Maximal Quasi-Cliques: An Algorithm-System Codesign Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA few seminal works devised branch-and-bound subgraph searching algorithms for mining quasi-cliques, such as Crochet [ref]30  and Cocain  which finally led to the Quick algorithm  that integrated all previous search space pruning techniques and added new effective ones.\nHowever, we find that some pruning techniques\nare not utilized or fully utilized by Quick. Even worse, Quick may miss results. We will elaborate on these weaknesses in Section 6. Sanei-Mehri et al.  noticed that if γ′superscript𝛾′\\gamma^{\\prime}-quasi-cliques (γ′>γsuperscript𝛾′𝛾\\gamma^{\\prime}>\\gamma) are mined first using Quick which are faster to find, then it is more efficient to expand these “kernels” to generate γ𝛾\\gamma-quasi-cliques than to mine them from the original graph. Their kernel expansion is conducted only on those largest γ′superscript𝛾′\\gamma^{\\prime}-quasi-cliques extracted by postprocessing, in order to find big γ𝛾\\gamma-quasi-cliques as opposed to all of them to keep time tractable. However, this work does not fundamentally address the scalability issue: (1) it only studies the problem of enumerating k𝑘k big maximal quasi-cliques containing kernels rather than all valid ones, and these subgraphs can be clustered in one region (e.g., they overlap on a smaller clique) while missing results on other parts of the data graph, compromising result diversity; (2) the method still needs to first find some γ′superscript𝛾′\\gamma^{\\prime}-quasi-cliques to grow from and this first step is still using Quick; and (3) the method is not guaranteed to return exactly the set of top-k𝑘k maximal quasi-cliques. We remark that the kernel-based acceleration technique is orthogonal to our parallel algorithm and can be easily incorporated; however, as Section 8 shall show, the performance of this solution is only faster than our exact solution when k𝑘k is very small. Other than , quasi-cliques have seldom been considered in a big graph setting. Quick  was only tested on two small graphs: one with 4,932 vertices and 17,201 edges, and the other with 1,846 vertices and 5,929 edges.\nIn fact, earlier works [ref]30   formulate quasi-clique mining as frequent pattern mining problems where the goal is to find quasi-clique patterns that appear in a significant portion of small graph transactions in a graph database. Some works consider big graphs but not the problem of finding all valid quasi-cliques, but rather those that contain a particular vertex or a set of query vertices    to aggressively narrow down the search space by sacrificing result diversity, with some additional pruning rules beyond Quick, some in the query-vertex context. There is another definition of quasi-clique based on edge density    rather than vertex degree, but it is essentially a different kind of dense subgraph definition. As  indicates, the edge-density based quasi-cliques are less dense than our degree-based quasi-cliques, and thus we focus on degree-based quasi-cliques in this paper as in .\nBrunato et al.  further consider both vertex degree and edge density. There are also many other definitions of dense subgraphs       , and they all follow a similar divisible algorithmic framework as Quick (c.f. Section 3). A recent work proposed to use machine learning to predict the running time of graph computation for workload partitioning , but the graph algorithms considered there are iterative algorithms that do not have unpredictable pruning rules and thus the running time can be easily estimated. This is not the case in quasi-clique mining (c.f. Section 4), and dense subgraph mining in general which adopts divide-and-conquer (and often recursive) algorithms, calling for a new solution for effective task workload partitioning.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: A few seminal works devised branch-and-bound subgraph searching algorithms for mining quasi-cliques, such as Crochet [ref]30  and Cocain  which finally led to the Quick algorithm  that integrated all previous search space pruning techniques and added new effective ones.\nHowever, we find that some pruning\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
