      "content": "Paper Title: Real-Time Evaluation in Online Continual Learning: A New Hope\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare OCL methods under our proposed real-time evaluation setup given two stream speeds: fast and slow, which capture different application scenarios.\nWe benchmark the majority of OCL methods, which we group into three categories. (1) Regularization-based OCL methods regularize training by modifying the classification loss. For example, RWalk¬†[ref]8 uses a regularizer to penalize abrupt changes in the parameters of the model. ACE¬†[ref]6 introduces an asymmetric loss to treat memory buffer samples differently from incoming stream samples, while LwF¬† distills knowledge from previous steps. (2) Learning rate scheduler methods, in this case PoLRS¬†[ref]7, dynamically adapt the learning rate to changes in the stream distribution. (3) Sampling-based methods alter the strategy used to update the memory buffer, e.g. GSS¬†, or change the memory retrieval strategy, e.g. MIR¬†. Datasets. We use the large-scale online continual learning dataset CLOC¬†[ref]7, which contains 39 million time-stamped images exhibiting natural distribution shifts. The task is to identify the geolocation of a given image where the total number of geolocation labels is 712. To ensure consistency with CLOC¬†[ref]7, we adopt the same dataset split approach. Specifically, we use the first 5% of the stream for hyperparameter selection, uniformly sample 1% from the remaining stream to build a held-out set for measuring backward/forward transfer (reported in the appendix), and utilize the rest of the stream for training and online evaluation.\nSimilar to CLOC¬†[ref]7, we compare OCL methods using the Average Online Accuracy metric, which measures the ability of models to adapt to incoming stream samples111This metric should not be mistaken for a training accuracy, as it evaluates the model on the next unseen training batch before the batch is used for model training.. Implementation Details.\nAt each step tùë°t during the experiments, ùíÆùíÆ\\mathcal{S} reveals a set of 128128128 images,\nand OCL methods augment the training batch with another 128128128 images sampled from a memory buffer. This routine is performed until a single pass over the stream is completed. We use ImageNet¬† pre-trained ResNet50¬† [ref]7 as a backbone. We use SGD with a learning rate of 5√ó10‚àí35superscript1035\\times 10^{-3} for all OCL methods except for PoLRS¬†[ref]7, which works best with a learning rate of 1√ó10‚àí31superscript1031\\times 10^{-3}.\nUnless otherwise stated, we set the size of the replay buffer to 4√ó1044superscript1044\\times 10^{4} for all considered methods.\nWe use the same hyperparameters reported in all corresponding papers with the exception of the regularization parameter for RWalk¬†[ref]8. We find that their reported regularization Œª=0.1ùúÜ0.1\\lambda=0.1 is too small for the CLOC dataset; we cross validate it and find that Œª=2ùúÜ2\\lambda=2 works best. Our implementation extends the codebase of Avalanche¬†1, which is a popular continual learning framework. We leave all the remaining implementation details and ablations to the appendix.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: benchmark the majority of OCL methods, which we group into three categories.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
