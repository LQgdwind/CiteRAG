      "content": "Paper Title: Aesthetic Preference Prediction in Interior Design: Fuzzy Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe current paper presents a novel approach to evaluating the personalized aesthetics score of an interior design considering color preferences and a general aesthetic score obtained based on visual features such as color harmony, lightness, and complexity. This research supports previous studies that have endorsed the 2AFC task as the favored measurement technique for assessing aesthetic preferences [ref]58, . Our findings on the average hit rate of the 2AFC method in predicting aesthetic scores were similar to recent studies , . The proposed approach has certain limitations, like the relatively small dataset for aesthetic feature extraction and the small number of participants in the 2AFC experiment. As for future works, this algorithm can be used for aesthetic assessment in other areas, such as fashion clothing compatibility, car aesthetics, website color classifier, etc. The practical significance is reflected in the model’s potential applications in content creation, recommendation systems, and human-computer interaction, emphasizing its ability to align with human aesthetic perceptions as revealed through 2AFC.\n This research can assist designers and experts in better understanding and meeting people’s interior design preferences, particularly in today’s digitally driven environment.\n\nReference markers found: [58]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]58: such as color harmony, lightness, and complexity.
