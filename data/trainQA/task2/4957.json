Their statistics are presented in Tab. II. Alibaba Dataset222https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=56  is a public advertising dataset released by Alibaba. It randomly samples 1,140,000 users from the website of Taobao from 8 days of click logs (26 million records) to generate the original dataset. Following , we use the first 7 days’ samples as the training set (2017-05-06 to 2017-05-12), and the next day’s samples as the testing set (2017-05-13).\nWe keep users’ most recent 50 behaviors.\nPlease note that we only extract the user click behaviors whose click time is before the target item to prevent information leakage. Tencent CTR Dataset is collected by sampling user click logs for one week from Tencent’s advertising CTR log. We use samples from 2021-09-05 to 2021-09-10 as the training set, and samples on 2021-09-11 as the testing set. The data preprocessing strategy is the same as that of the Alibaba dataset.\n We compare AutoAttention with the following baseline approaches: Sum Pooling conducts a sum pooling without weights on the user’s behavior embeddings to generate a fixed-length user interest representation. DIN [ref]4 conducts a weighted sum pooling over user behaviors. The attention weight is calculated over the user behavior and several manually selected fields from the item side. The attention is implemented as an out product between the user behavior embedding and those selected item side embedding, followed by an MLP.\n DIEN [ref]5 uses a GRU encoder to capture the behavior dependencies, followed by another GRU with an attentional update gate to depict interest evolution. DSIN  captures users’ homogeneous interests in each session and heterogeneous interests in different sessions. GRU4Rec [ref]19 uses a GRU with ranking based loss to model user sequences for session based recommendation. SASRec  uses a left-to-right Transformer to capture users’ behaviors for sequential recommendation. BERT4Rec  uses a bi-directional self-attention to model user behaviors. BST  uses self-attention and target-attention together to model user behaviors. CFI  considers the corresponding field interactions for sequential recommendation.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: with the following baseline approaches: Sum Pooling conducts a sum pooling without weights on the user’s behavior embeddings to generate a fixed-length user interest representation. DIN [ref]4 conducts a weighted sum pooling over user behaviors. The attention weight is calculated over the user behavior and several manually selected fields from the item side.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
