      "content": "Paper Title: Fully Spiking Actor Network with Intra-layer Connections for Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFollowing the surrogate gradient method , the spike-based backpropagation (BP) algorithm has quickly become the mainstream solution for training multi-layer SNNs [ref]8 . Tang et al. [ref]33 first propose the hybrid framework, composed of a SAN and a deep critic network. Through the co-learning of the two networks, the hybrid framework avoids the problem of value estimation using SNNs. However, the method of scaling the firing rate makes it difficult to accurately characterize the continuous action space, which greatly limits the choice of actions. To improve the representation capacity of SNNs, Tang et al. [ref]22 propose a population-coded spiking actor network (PopSAN), which achieves the same level of performance as the deep network. Based on this work, a multiscale dynamic coding improved spiking actor network (MDC-SAN)  is proposed and performs better than its counterpart deep actor network (DAN). In the decoding stage, the two methods use the fully-connected layer to convert the firing rate into continuous action. Recently, Liu et al.  propose a direct spiking learning algorithm for the deep spiking Q-network (DSQN), using a fully-connected layer to decode the firing rate into Q-value (i.e., the state-action value). Sun et al.  implement the Q-value in the same way. Nevertheless, these methods also bring new problems. Since the neuromorphic hardware only accepts the spike input in the form of 0 or 1, matrix operations of decoders need to be completed by other traditional hardware (i.e., CPU, GPU, or embedded AI chip). The resulting energy consumption problem is not reflected in the analysis of previous work [ref]22, which makes the energy consumption analysis have great defects. Different from these methods, we use the membrane voltage of non-spiking neurons to represent the continuous value in RL algorithms, such as value estimate or continuous action space, so that our method can be directly applied to neuromorphic hardware. Take Loihi as an example, the internal structure of the neuromorphic core mainly includes four primary operating modes: input spike handling, neuron compartment updates, output spike generation, and synaptic updates . By skipping the process of output spike generation that simulates axons, Loihi supports non-spiking compartments without voltage reset. Besides, Akl et al.  use the membrane potential readout as the decoding method. However, it lacks a detailed analysis of membrane potential readout methods. Moreover, they encode the observation into a two-neuron input scheme first and then multiply the encoded vector by the weight matrix. Qin et al.  use a learnable matrix to compress spike-trains in the temporal dimension through matrix multiplication, which is also a feasible decoding method. Both of these two methods require floating-point matrix multiplication, and cannot be completed only using the neuromorphic hardware. Compared with them, the proposed method employs the population encoder to realize full spike-based RL. In addition, we propose a novel intra-layer connection mechanism to enhance the action decoding.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Following the surrogate gradient method , the spike-based backpropagation (BP) algorithm has quickly become the mainstream solution for training multi-layer SNNs [ref]8 .
