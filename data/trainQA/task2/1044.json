Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: MaskNet: A Fully-Convolutional Network to Estimate Inlier Points\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInspired by classical feature-based inlier estimation techniques, Qi et al. [ref]27 introduced PointNet, a learning-based approach to learning task specific features from point clouds. PointNet [ref]27 paved the way for using unordered point clouds in a learning paradigm. Recent works such as PointNet++  [ref]28, DGCNN ,Deep sets [ref]50, PointCNN , point pillars  and PCPNet  improve the performance of PointNet by generating features that consider local neighbourhoods of points. More recently, a point cleaning network  was developed based on the PCPNet. PointCleanNet estimates robust local features and use this information to denoise the point cloud. Another variant of learning-based inlier estimation includes SampleNet   which finds only a small subset of inliers. In addition to supervised learning techniques such as PointNet, other self-supervised , and unsupervised  feature-learning techniques have been introduced. While all these algorithms continue to remain locally optimal, they are faster than conventional geometry-based methods, owing to computationally inexpensive matrix operations. However, as the point clouds become denser, the neural networks suffer as much as their hand-crafted counterparts in terms of computational complexity.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: Inspired by classical feature-based inlier estimation techniques, Qi et al. [ref]27 introduced PointNet, a learning-based approach to learning task specific features from point clouds.
