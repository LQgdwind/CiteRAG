It consists of cascaded convolutional and fully-connected layers with batch normalization and ReLU activations between each layer. It takes as input the concatenated images for current and goal states (i.e., shape B×C×H×W𝐵𝐶𝐻𝑊B\\times C\\times H\\times W), and outputs a vector of Q-values for each action (i.e., shape B×n​u​m​_​a​c​t​i​o​n​s𝐵𝑛𝑢𝑚_𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠B\\times num\\_actions). It is trained through offline DDQN  with hindsight goal-relabelling .

The perceptual backbone fϕ​(s)subscript𝑓italic-ϕ𝑠f_{\\phi}(s) uses a standard Resnet-18 architecture. It takes as input the images for a given state (i.e., B×C×H×W𝐵𝐶𝐻𝑊B\\times C\\times H\\times W), and outputs a low-dimensional representation vector z=fϕ​(s)𝑧subscript𝑓italic-ϕ𝑠z=f_{\\phi}(s) (i.e., shape B×D𝐵𝐷B\\times D). All other components take as input these low-dimensional representations, rather than operating over images. pf​w​d​(zt+1′|zt,at)subscript𝑝𝑓𝑤𝑑conditionalsubscriptsuperscript𝑧′𝑡1subscript𝑧𝑡subscript𝑎𝑡p_{fwd}(z^{\\prime}_{t+1}\\ |\\ z_{t},a_{t}), πi​n​v​(at′|zt,zg)subscript𝜋𝑖𝑛𝑣conditionalsubscriptsuperscript𝑎′𝑡subscript𝑧𝑡subscript𝑧𝑔\\pi_{inv}(a^{\\prime}_{t}\\ |\\ z_{t},z_{g}), and pt​(T′|zt,zg)subscript𝑝𝑡conditionalsuperscript𝑇′subscript𝑧𝑡subscript𝑧𝑔p_{t}(T^{\\prime}\\ |\\ z_{t},z_{g}) all consist of fully-connected layers with ReLU activations. To train them, we first sample t∼U​n​i​f​o​r​m​(0,d​a​t​a​s​e​t​_​s​i​z​e)similar-to𝑡𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚0𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑡_𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒t\\sim Uniform(0,dataset\\_size). We then sample T𝑇T according to T∼U​n​i​f​o​r​m​(0,Tm​a​x)similar-to𝑇𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚0subscript𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥T\\sim Uniform(0,T_{max}) or T∼U​n​i​f​o​r​m​(Tm​a​x,d​a​t​a​s​e​t​_​s​i​z​e−t)similar-to𝑇𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚subscript𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑡_𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑡T\\sim Uniform(T_{max},dataset\\_size-t), half the time from the former distribution, half the time from the latter. We retrieve from the replay buffer a transition and a goal state as (st,at,st+1,sg:=st+T)assignsubscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝑎𝑡subscript𝑠𝑡1subscript𝑠𝑔subscript𝑠𝑡𝑇(s_{t},a_{t},s_{t+1},s_{g}:=s_{t+T}), and project them into low dimensional representations (zt,at,zt+1,zg)subscript𝑧𝑡subscript𝑎𝑡subscript𝑧𝑡1subscript𝑧𝑔(z_{t},a_{t},z_{t+1},z_{g}) using fϕsubscript𝑓italic-ϕf_{\\phi}. These are concatenated and passed to models pf​w​d​(zt+1′|zt,at),πi​n​v​(at′|zt,zg),pt​(T′|zt,zg)subscript𝑝𝑓𝑤𝑑conditionalsubscriptsuperscript𝑧′𝑡1subscript𝑧𝑡subscript𝑎𝑡subscript𝜋𝑖𝑛𝑣conditionalsubscriptsuperscript𝑎′𝑡subscript𝑧𝑡subscript𝑧𝑔subscript𝑝𝑡conditionalsuperscript𝑇′subscript𝑧𝑡subscript𝑧𝑔p_{fwd}(z^{\\prime}_{t+1}\\ |\\ z_{t},a_{t}),\\pi_{inv}(a^{\\prime}_{t}\\ |\\ z_{t},z_{g}),p_{t}(T^{\\prime}\\ |\\ z_{t},z_{g}) in a way compatible with their arguments. pf​w​dsubscript𝑝𝑓𝑤𝑑p_{fwd} outputs the mean for the predicted next state distribution (i.e., shape B×D𝐵𝐷B\\times D), and is trained using the MSE loss Lf​w​dsubscript𝐿𝑓𝑤𝑑L_{fwd} with zt+1subscript𝑧𝑡1z_{t+1} as the target. πi​n​vsubscript𝜋𝑖𝑛𝑣\\pi_{inv} outputs a vector of probabilities over actions (i.e., shape B×n​u​m​_​a​c​t​i​o​n​s𝐵𝑛𝑢𝑚_𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠B\\times num\\_actions), and is trained with the cross-entropy loss Li​n​vsubscript𝐿𝑖𝑛𝑣L_{inv} with atsubscript𝑎𝑡a_{t} as the target. ptsubscript𝑝𝑡p_{t} also outputs a discrete probability distribution over [0,Tm​a​x]0subscript𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥[0,T_{max}] that predicts the distribution of time-steps to reach the goal, where the last bin Tm​a​xsubscript𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥T_{max} serves as a catch-all for all values above it. It is trained using the cross entropy loss LTsubscript𝐿𝑇L_{T}, with T𝑇T as the target. As mentioned in the main paper, all components fϕsubscript𝑓italic-ϕf_{\\phi}, pf​w​d​(zt+1′|zt,at)subscript𝑝𝑓𝑤𝑑conditionalsubscriptsuperscript𝑧′𝑡1subscript𝑧𝑡subscript𝑎𝑡p_{fwd}(z^{\\prime}_{t+1}\\ |\\ z_{t},a_{t}), πi​n​v​(at′|zt,zg)subscript𝜋𝑖𝑛𝑣conditionalsubscriptsuperscript𝑎′𝑡subscript𝑧𝑡subscript𝑧𝑔\\pi_{inv}(a^{\\prime}_{t}\\ |\\ z_{t},z_{g}), pt​(T′|zt,zg)subscript𝑝𝑡conditionalsuperscript𝑇′subscript𝑧𝑡subscript𝑧𝑔p_{t}(T^{\\prime}\\ |\\ z_{t},z_{g}) are trained jointly, with an additional loss function LQsubscript𝐿𝑄L_{Q} that regularizes fϕsubscript𝑓italic-ϕf_{\\phi}. What do the terms in the contrastive loss-function LQsubscript𝐿𝑄L_{Q} mean: The loss function LQ​(st,sg)=lh​i​n​g​e​(dϕ​(st,sg)−dp)​ 1dQ​(st,sg)≤cQ+lh​i​n​g​e​(dp−dϕ​(st,sg))​ 1dQ​(st,sg)≥cQsubscript𝐿𝑄subscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝑠𝑔subscript𝑙ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑒subscript𝑑italic-ϕsubscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝑠𝑔subscript𝑑𝑝subscript1subscript𝑑𝑄subscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝑠𝑔subscript𝑐𝑄subscript𝑙ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑒subscript𝑑𝑝subscript𝑑italic-ϕsubscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝑠𝑔subscript1subscript𝑑𝑄subscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝑠𝑔subscript𝑐𝑄L_{Q}(s_{t},s_{g})=l_{hinge}(d_{\\phi}(s_{t},s_{g})-d_{p})\\ \\mathbbm{1}_{d_{Q}(s_{t},s_{g})\\leq c_{Q}}+l_{hinge}(d_{p}-d_{\\phi}(s_{t},s_{g}))\\ \\mathbbm{1}_{d_{Q}(s_{t},s_{g})\\geq c_{Q}} consists of two penalty terms lh​i​n​g​e​(dϕ​(st,sg)−dp)subscript𝑙ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑒subscript𝑑italic-ϕsubscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝑠𝑔subscript𝑑𝑝l_{hinge}(d_{\\phi}(s_{t},s_{g})-d_{p}) (i.e., only active when dϕ≥dpsubscript𝑑italic-ϕsubscript𝑑𝑝d_{\\phi}\\geq d_{p}) and lh​i​n​g​e​(dp−dϕ​(st,sg))subscript𝑙ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑒subscript𝑑𝑝subscript𝑑italic-ϕsubscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝑠𝑔l_{hinge}(d_{p}-d_{\\phi}(s_{t},s_{g})) (i.e., only active when dϕ≤dpsubscript𝑑italic-ϕsubscript𝑑𝑝d_{\\phi}\\leq d_{p}). These penalty terms are gated through two complementary indicator functions 𝟙dQ​(st,sg)≤cQsubscript1subscript𝑑𝑄subscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝑠𝑔subscript𝑐𝑄\\mathbbm{1}_{d_{Q}(s_{t},s_{g})\\leq c_{Q}} and 𝟙dQ​(st,sg)≥cQsubscript1subscript𝑑𝑄subscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝑠𝑔subscript𝑐𝑄\\mathbbm{1}_{d_{Q}(s_{t},s_{g})\\geq c_{Q}}. This essentially means that for LQsubscript𝐿𝑄L_{Q} to be zero, dϕ≤dpsubscript𝑑italic-ϕsubscript𝑑𝑝d_{\\phi}\\leq d_{p} should hold (i.e., perceptual representations are close) if and only if dQ​(st,sg)≤cQsubscript𝑑𝑄subscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝑠𝑔subscript𝑐𝑄d_{Q}(s_{t},s_{g})\\leq c_{Q} holds (i.e., states are physically close). The reason for employing such a conservative switching mechanism with a hinge loss in LQsubscript𝐿𝑄L_{Q} (i.e., rather than a continuous penalty term as in  ) is because Q-value estimates are quite inaccurate (especially when scsubscript𝑠𝑐s_{c} and sgsubscript𝑠𝑔s_{g} are far apart), and their exact value is generally unreliable (i.e., they can indicate whether two-states are close sufficiently well, but cannot robustly answer how close they are). To pick the hyperparameter cQsubscript𝑐𝑄c_{Q}, we compute the average Q-value between states in the replay buffer that were observed to be within one-step proximity, and use a fraction of this value to as a conservative estimate. While conceptually the choice for the hyperparameter dpsubscript𝑑𝑝d_{p} is arbitrary, we heuristically pick it by examining the average dϕsubscript𝑑italic-ϕd_{\\phi} distance between subsequent states in the replay buffer, obtained from a preliminary fϕsubscript𝑓italic-ϕf_{\\phi} backbone trained without LQsubscript𝐿𝑄L_{Q}.\n\nReference markers found: [53]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]53: Q_{\\theta}(s_{t},a_{t},s_{g})-(\\mathbbm{1}_{s_{t+1}=s_{g}}+\\gamma\\mathbbm{1}_{s_{t+1}\\neq s_{g}}\\ max_{a}\\ Q_{\\theta^{-}}(s_{t+1},a,s_{g}))\\ ]^{2}, as in [ref]53.
