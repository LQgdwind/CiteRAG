      "content": "Paper Title: Proposal-Free Temporal Action Detection via Global Segmentation Mask Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlthough all existing TAD methods use proposals, they differ in how the proposals are generated. Anchor-based proposal learning methods \nThese methods generate proposal based on a pre-determined set of anchors. Inspired by object detection in static images ,\nR-C3D  proposes to use anchor boxes.\nIt follows the structure of proposal generation and classification in design.\nWith similar model design, TURN  aggregates local features to represent snippet-level features, which are then used for temporal boundary regression and classification.\nLater, GTAN \nimproves the proposal feature pooling procedure with a learnable Gaussian kernel for weighted averaging.\nPBR-Net  improves the detection performance using a pyramidal anchor based detection and fine-grained refinement using frame-level features.\nG-TAD \nlearns semantic and temporal context via graph convolutional networks for better proposal generation.\n\nMUSES  further improves the performance by handling intra-instance variations caused by shot change.\nVSGN  focuses on short-action detection in a cross-scale multi-level pyramidal architecture.\nNote that these anchor boxes are often exhaustively generated so are high in number. Anchor-free proposal learning methods \nInstead of using pre-designed and fixed anchor boxes, these methods directly learn to predict temporal proposals (i.e., start and end times/points)\n  [ref]18.\nFor example, SSN  decomposes an action instance into three stages (starting, course, and ending)\nand employs structured temporal pyramid pooling\nto generate proposals.\nBSN  predicts the start, end and actionness at each temporal location and generates proposals using locations with high start and end probabilities.\nLater, BMN [ref]18\nadditionally generates a boundary-matching confidence map to improve proposal generation.\nBSN++  further extends BMN with a complementary boundary generator to capture rich context.\nCSA  enriches the proposal temporal context via attention transfer.\nRecently, ContextLoc  further pushes the boundaries by adapting global context at proposal-level and handling the context-aware inter-proposal relations.\nWhile no pre-defined anchor boxes are required, these methods often have to exhaustively\npair all possible locations predicted with high scores.\nSo both anchor-based and anchor-free TAD methods\nhave a large quantity of temporal proposals to evaluate. This results in complex model design, high computational cost and lack of global context modeling.\nOur TAGS is designed to address all these limitations by being proposal-free. Self-attention \nOur snippet representation is learned based on self-attention, which has been firstly introduced in Transformers for natural language processing tasks .\nIn computer vision, non-local neural networks  apply the core self-attention block from transformers for context modeling and feature learning.\nState-of-the-art performance has been achieved in classification , self-supervised learning , semantic segmentation  , object detection   ,\nfew-shot action recognition  ,\nand object tracking \nby using such an attention model. Several recent works [ref]35  [ref]29     also use\nTransformers for TAD.\nThey focus on either temporal proposal generation [ref]35 or refinement [ref]29.\n\nIn this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of self-attention in a novel proposal-free TAD architecture.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: number.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
