      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Partial Correlation based Deep Visual Representation for Image Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLearning effective visual representation is a central issue in computer vision. In the past two decades, describing images with local features and pooling them to a global representation has shown promising performance. As one of the pooling methods, covariance matrix based pooling has attracted much attention due to its exploitation of second-order correlation information of features. A variety of tasks such as fine-grained image classification , image segmentation [ref]16, generic image classification [ref]24  , image set classification [ref]44, action recognition , few-shot classification  and few-shot detection    have benefited from the covariance matrix based representation. A few pioneering works have integrated covariance matrix as a pooling method within convolutional neural networks (CNN) and investigated associated issues such as matrix function backpropagation [ref]16, matrix normalisation   , compact matrix estimation   and kernel based extension . The above works further improved visual representations based on covariance matrix. Despite the above progress, covariance matrix merely measures the pairwise correlation (more accurately, covariance) of two variables without taking any other variables into account. This can be easily verified because its (i,j)ùëñùëó(i,j)-th entry solely depends on the iùëñi-th and jùëój-th variables on a sample set. In Statistics, it is known that such a pairwise correlation will give misleading results once a third variable is correlated with both variables of interest due to the ‚Äúconfounding‚Äù effect. For this situation, the partial correlation is the right measure to use. It regresses out the effects of other variables from the two variables and then calculates the correlation of their residuals instead. Partial correlation can be conveniently obtained by computing inverse covariance matrix, also known as the precision matrix  in the statistical community. Figure 1 illustrates the geometrical interpretation of partial correlation. The above observation motivates us to investigate a visual representation for image classification based on the inverse covariance matrix. After all, it has better theoretical support on characterising the essential relationship of variables (e.g., the channels in a convolutional feature map) when other variables are present. Note that inverse covariance matrix can be used for many vision tasks but in this paper, we investigate it from the perspective of image classification. Nevertheless, reliably estimating inverse covariance matrix from the local descriptors of a CNN feature map is a challenging task. This is primarily due to the small spatial size of the feature map, i.e., sample size, and a higher number of channels, i.e., feature dimensions, and this issue becomes more pronounced for advanced CNN models. An unreliable estimate of inverse covariance matrix will critically affect its effectiveness as a visual representation.\nOne might argue that by increasing the size of input images or using a dimension reduction layer to reduce the number of feature channels, such an issue could be resolved. In this paper, we investigate this issue from the perspective of robust precision matrix estimation. To achieve our goal, we explore the use of sparsity prior for inverse covariance matrix estimation in the literature. Specifically, the general principle of ‚Äúbet on sparsity‚Äù  is adopted in estimating the structure of high-dimensional data, and this leads to an established technique called sparse inverse covariance estimation (SICE) . It solves an optimisation in the space of symmetric and positive definite (SPD) matrix to estimate the inverse covariance matrix by imposing the sparsity prior on its entries. SICE is designed to handle small sample problem and it is known for its excellent effectiveness to that end . An initial attempt to apply SICE for visual representation is based on handcrafted or pre-extracted features of small size and an off-the-shelf SICE solver, and it does not have the ability to backpropagate through SICE due to optimisation of the SPD matrix with the imposed non-smooth sparsity term . Our work is the first one that truly integrates SICE into CNN for end-to-end training. Clearly, such an integration will fully take advantage of the feature learning capability of CNN and the partial correlation offered by inverse covariance matrix. On the other hand, realising such an integration is not trivial. Unlike covariance matrix, which is obtained by simple arithmetic operations, SICE is obtained by solving an SPD matrix based optimisation. How to incorporate this optimisation process into CNN as a layer is an issue. Furthermore, this SICE optimisation needs to be solved for each training image during both forward and backward phases to generate a visual representation. Directly solving this optimisation within CNN will not be practical even for a medium-sized SICE problem. To efficiently integrate SICE into CNN, we propose a fast end-to-end training method for SICE by taking inspiration from Newton-Schulz iteration . Our method solves the SICE optimisation with a smooth convex cost function by re-parameterising the non-smooth term in the original SICE cost function (see Eq. (1)), and it can therefore be optimised with standard optimisation techniques such as gradient descend. Furthermore, we effectively enforce the SPD constraint during optimisation so that the obtained SICE solution remains SPD as desired. Figure 2 shows our ‚ÄúIterative Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation (iSICE)‚Äù. In contrast to SICE, iSICE works with end-to-end trainable deep learning models.\nOur iSICE involves simple matrix arithmetic operations fully compatible with GPU. It can approximately solve large SICE problems within CNN efficiently. Our main contributions are summarised as follows. To more precisely characterise the relationship of features for visual representation, this paper proposes to integrate sparse inverse covariance estimation (SICE) process into CNNs as a novel layer. To achieve this, we develop a method based on Newton-Schulz iteration and box constraints for ‚Ñì1subscript‚Ñì1\\ell_{1} penalty to solve the SICE optimisation with CNN and maintain the end-to-end training efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, our iSICE is the first end-to-end SICE solution for CNN. Our iSICE method requires a minimal change of network architecture. Therefore, it can readily be integrated with existing works to replace those using deep network models to learn covariance matrix based visual representation. The iSICE is fully compatible with GPU and can be easily implemented with modern deep learning libraries. As the objective of SICE is a combination of log‚Äãdet\\log\\det term (may change rapidly) and sparsity (changes slowly), achieving the balance between both terms during optimisation by the gradient descent is hard. To this end, we propose a minor contribution: a simple modulating network whose goal is to adapt on-the-fly learning rate and sparsity penalty. Experiments on multiple image classification datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed iSICE method.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: pooling has attracted much attention due to its exploitation of second-order correlation information of features.
