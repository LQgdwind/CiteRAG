A preliminary version of this paper appeared in WADS 2023 [16]. A full version of this paper also appeared as a chapter in Anthony D’Angelo’s thesis [24]. This paper has undergone minor corrections since publication.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe are not aware of other work tackling the subject of this paper,\nbut\nbelow we highlight\nrelated work on\ngeodesic discs in polygons. A region Q𝑄Q is geodesically convex relative to a polygon P𝑃P if for all\npoints u,v∈Q𝑢𝑣𝑄u,v\\in Q, the geodesic shortest path from u𝑢u to v𝑣v in\nP𝑃P is in Q𝑄Q.\nThe geodesic convex hull C​Hg𝐶subscript𝐻𝑔CH_{g} of a set of points S𝑆S in a polygon\nP𝑃P is the intersection of all geodesically convex regions in P𝑃P that\ncontain S𝑆S.\nThe geodesic convex hull of n𝑛n points in a simple m𝑚m-gon\ncan be computed in O​(n​log⁡(m​n)+m)𝑂𝑛𝑚𝑛𝑚O(n\\log(mn)+m) time\n(or O​(n​log⁡(m​n))𝑂𝑛𝑚𝑛O(n\\log(mn)) time once the shortest-path data structure\nof Guibas and Hershberger  \nis built) using O​(n+m)𝑂𝑛𝑚O(n+m) space\n .\nThe expression of the runtime can be simplified\nto O​(n​log⁡n+m)𝑂𝑛𝑛𝑚O(n\\log n+m)\nusing the following argument   .\nIf n≤m/log⁡m𝑛𝑚𝑚n\\leq m/\\log m, then we have\nn​log⁡m≤(m/log⁡m)​log⁡m=m𝑛𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚n\\log m\\leq(m/\\log m)\\log m=m.\nIf m/log⁡m<n𝑚𝑚𝑛m/\\log m<n, then we have\nlog⁡(m/log⁡m)<log⁡n𝑚𝑚𝑛\\log(m/\\log m)<\\log n\nwhich implies that log⁡m𝑚\\log m is O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n). The geodesic centre problem asks for a smallest\nenclosing geodesic disc\nthat lies in the polygon and encloses all vertices of the polygon\n(stated another way, a point that minimizes the geodesic distance to the farthest point).\nThis problem is well-studied    [ref]50 \nand can be solved in O​(m)𝑂𝑚O(m) time and space\n.\nThe geodesic centre for polygonal domains666As defined in Bae et al. , a polygonal domain with hℎh holes and m𝑚m corners is a connected and closed subset of ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2} having hℎh holes whose boundary consists of h+1ℎ1h+1 simple closed polygonal chains of m𝑚m total line segments.\nhas also been studied\n  and can\nbe solved in O​(m11​log⁡m)𝑂superscript𝑚11𝑚O(m^{11}\\log m) time .\nThe geodesic centre problem for simple polygons has been generalized\nto the geodesic j𝑗j-centre problem777The j𝑗j-centre problem\nin the Euclidean plane, and thus also\nin our geodesic setting, is NP-hard 5.\nwhere we seek a set of j𝑗j geodesic discs of minimum radii such that all\nvertices of the simple polygon are contained in some disc, though\nonly j=2𝑗2j=2 has been studied so far\n9 .\nThe current best algorithm by Oh et al. 9 runs\nin O​(m2​log2⁡m)𝑂superscript𝑚2superscript2𝑚O(m^{2}\\log^{2}m) time and O​(m)𝑂𝑚O(m) space.\nThe geodesic j𝑗j-centre problem has been generalized to finding the geodesic\nj𝑗j-centre of a set of points S𝑆S inside a simple polygon, though we still only have\nresults for j=1𝑗1j=1 and j=2𝑗2j=2.\nFor j=1𝑗1j=1, the problem can be solved by finding the geodesic centre of\nthe weakly simple polygon formed by the geodesic convex hull\nof the point set S𝑆S ,\nand thus runs in\nO​(n​log⁡n+m)𝑂𝑛𝑛𝑚O(n\\log n+m) time.\nFor this approach,\ncomputing the solution\nis dominated by the time to compute C​Hg𝐶subscript𝐻𝑔CH_{g}.\nOh et al. 8\nrecently gave an algorithm for j=2𝑗2j=2 that runs in\nO​(n​(m+n)​log3⁡(m+n))𝑂𝑛𝑚𝑛superscript3𝑚𝑛O(n(m+n)\\log^{3}(m+n)) time.\nThere is also the notion of the geodesic edge centre of a simple polygon\n(which is a point in the polygon that minimizes the maximum geodesic distance to any edge of the polygon)\nfor which Lubiw and Naredla have presented a linear-time algorithm to compute 1. Vigan \nhas worked on packing and covering a simple polygon with geodesic\ndiscs.\nHe provides a 222-approximation for the maximum cardinality\npacking of geodesic unit discs in simple polygons in\nO​(Y​(m+Y)​log2⁡(m+Y))𝑂𝑌𝑚𝑌superscript2𝑚𝑌O(Y(m+Y)\\log^{2}(m+Y)) time,\nwhere Y𝑌Y is the output size, and shows that finding a packing of geodesic\nunit discs is NP-hard in polygons with holes;\nhe shows that a minimum-size covering of\na polygon with holes using geodesic unit discs\nis NP-hard;\nhe shows that covering a polygon using j𝑗j geodesic discs whose maximal\nradius is minimized is NP-hard and provides a 222-approximation algorithm\nthat runs in O​(j2​(m+j)​log⁡(m+j))𝑂superscript𝑗2𝑚𝑗𝑚𝑗O(j^{2}(m+j)\\log(m+j)) time;\nhe shows that packing j𝑗j geodesic discs whose minimum radius is maximized\ninto a polygon is NP-hard and gives an\nO​(j2​(m+j)​log⁡(m+j))𝑂superscript𝑗2𝑚𝑗𝑚𝑗O(j^{2}(m+j)\\log(m+j))-time 444-approximation algorithm;\nlastly, he gives an O​(m8​log⁡m)𝑂superscript𝑚8𝑚O(m^{8}\\log m)-time exact algorithm for covering a simple\npolygon with two geodesic discs of minimum maximal radius. Rabanca and Vigan \nworked on covering the boundary of a simple\npolygon with the minimum number of geodesic unit discs\nand gave an O​(m​log2⁡m+j)𝑂𝑚superscript2𝑚𝑗O(m\\log^{2}m+j)-time 222-approximation algorithm,\nwhere j𝑗j is the number of discs, and they also showed that if the perimeter\nL𝐿L of the polygon is such that L≥m1+δ,δ>0formulae-sequence𝐿superscript𝑚1𝛿𝛿0L\\geq m^{1+\\delta},\\delta>0, then a\nsimple O​(m)𝑂𝑚O(m)-time algorithm achieves an approximation ratio that goes to\n111 as L/m𝐿𝑚L/m goes to infinity. Borgelt, van Kreveld, and Luo \nstudied geodesic discs in simple polygons\nto solve the following clustering problem:\ngiven a set S𝑆S of n𝑛n points inside a simple polygon P𝑃P with m𝑚m\nvertices, determine all subsets of S𝑆S of size at least k𝑘k for which\na point q𝑞q in P𝑃P exists that has geodesic distance at most ρ𝜌\\rho to all\npoints in the subset.\nThe input parameters are k𝑘k and ρ𝜌\\rho.\nThey solve their problem by generating\nthe boundaries of radius-ρ𝜌\\rho\ngeodesic discs centred at the points of S𝑆S and finding points that lie\nin at least k𝑘k discs.\nThey provide an output-sensitive algorithm\nto compute the set of geodesic discs centred at the point sites with the\ngiven radius that runs in O​((m+(Y​m)(2/3)+Y)​logc⁡m)𝑂𝑚superscript𝑌𝑚23𝑌superscript𝑐𝑚O((m+(Ym)^{(2/3)}+Y)\\log^{c}m) time\nfor some constant c𝑐c and output size Y𝑌Y.\nWith m𝑚m vertices of the polygon and n𝑛n input points,\neach of the n𝑛n discs could have O​(m)𝑂𝑚O(m) arcs/pieces\ndue to reflex vertices as well as the edges of the polygon\nthat contain points closer than ρ𝜌\\rho to the centre.\nThus, the upper bound on Y𝑌Y is O​(n​m)𝑂𝑛𝑚O(nm).\nAfter computing the boundaries of the discs individually,\nthey then build the arrangement of the discs, count the depth of\na cell of the arrangement, then traverse the arrangement\nupdating the depth as they enter new cells.\nThe runtime to solve the clustering problem\nalso comes to depend on the number of intersections\nin the arrangement, which is\nO​(Y+n2)𝑂𝑌superscript𝑛2O(Y+n^{2}) .\nThe runtime becomes\nO​((m+(Y​m)(2/3)+Y)​logc⁡m+Y​log⁡Y+n2)𝑂𝑚superscript𝑌𝑚23𝑌superscript𝑐𝑚𝑌𝑌superscript𝑛2O((m+(Ym)^{(2/3)}+Y)\\log^{c}m+Y\\log Y+n^{2}). Dynamic k𝑘k-nearest neighbour queries were studied by\nde Berg and Staals .\nThey presented a static data structure for geodesic\nk𝑘k-nearest neighbour queries for n𝑛n sites in a simple m𝑚m-gon\nthat is built in O​(n​(log⁡n​log2⁡m+log3⁡m))𝑂𝑛𝑛superscript2𝑚superscript3𝑚O(n(\\log n\\log^{2}m+\\log^{3}m)) expected time\nusing O​(n​log⁡n​log⁡m+m)𝑂𝑛𝑛𝑚𝑚O(n\\log n\\log m+m) expected space\nand answers queries in\nO​(log⁡(n+m)​log⁡m+k​log⁡m)𝑂𝑛𝑚𝑚𝑘𝑚O(\\log(n+m)\\log m+k\\log m) expected time.888\nWe note that depending on the relations of the values m𝑚m, r𝑟r, and n𝑛n to each other,\nthere may be situations in which our algorithms may be improved by polylogarithmic factors\nby using the\nk𝑘k-nearest neighbour query data structure.\nDetails of these trade-offs are discussed in Section 5.1. If Pi​nsubscript𝑃𝑖𝑛P_{in} has no reflex vertices, it is a convex polygon\nand the SKEG\ndisc problem is solved by the algorithm for planar instances which uses\na grid-refinement strategy.\nThis works in the plane because\nℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2} with\nthe Euclidean metric, de​(⋅,⋅)subscript𝑑𝑒⋅⋅d_{e}(\\cdot,\\cdot), is a doubling metric space,\nmeaning that for any point c𝑐c in the space ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2} and any radius ρ>0𝜌0\\rho>0,\nthe closed disc\nB​(c,ρ)={u∈ℝ2:de​(u,c)≤ρ}𝐵𝑐𝜌conditional-set𝑢superscriptℝ2subscript𝑑𝑒𝑢𝑐𝜌B(c,\\rho)=\\{u\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}:d_{e}(u,c)\\leq\\rho\\} can be covered\nwith the union of O​(1)𝑂1O(1) closed discs of radius ρ/2𝜌2\\rho/2\n (i.e., unlike the geodesic metric,\nthe Euclidean metric has bounded doubling dimension).\nThe advantage of bounded doubling dimension to the gridding strategy is that\na cell of the grid has a constant number of neighbours that need to be\nconsidered when processing the cell, allowing us\nto locate O​(k)𝑂𝑘O(k) candidate neighbour points when processing a point  .\nIt is straightforward to prove\n(using an example such as the one in Fig. 7 from Appendix A)\nthat the geodesic metric does not have bounded doubling dimension\n(its doubling dimension is Θ​(r)Θ𝑟\\Theta(r) in a simple polygon with r𝑟r reflex vertices).\nThus, it is not clear whether\na gridding strategy can be used with the geodesic\nmetric to get efficient algorithms.\nThe straightforward\nadaptation\nto simple polygons\nof the expected linear-time\napproximation algorithm that relies on grids \nno longer seems to run in expected linear time;\nin a simple polygon with r𝑟r reflex vertices,\na given cell of a traditional grid approach could have Ω​(r)Ω𝑟\\Omega(r)\nneighbours to be considered when processing a cell,\nand it is not straightforward to process a cell that contains\na reflex vertex. Another difficulty of the geodesic metric is that\nfor two points u𝑢u and v𝑣v of S𝑆S on opposite sides of\na given chord, their geodesic bisector (formed by concatenating their\nbisector and hyperbolic arcs) can cross the chord\nmore than once.\nSee Figs. 8, 9, and 10\nin Appendix B.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: disc\nthat lies in the polygon and encloses all vertices of the polygon\n(stated another way, a point that minimizes the geodesic distance to the farthest point).\nThis problem is well-studied    [ref]50 \nand can be solved in O​(m)𝑂𝑚O(m) time and space\n.\nThe geodesic centre for polygonal domains666As defined in Bae et al. , a polygonal domain with hℎh holes and m𝑚m corners is a connected and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
