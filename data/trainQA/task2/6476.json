      "content": "Paper Title: Fine-grained reductions around CFL-reachability\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHere we give definitions for several problems that are connected with CFL recognition and reachability. Popular problems\nBoolean satisfiability problem (SAT, k𝑘k-SAT) is to determine if there exists an interpretation of variables that satisfies a given Boolean formula on n𝑛n variables written in k𝑘k-conjunctive normal form, k≥2𝑘2k\\geq 2 (k𝑘k-CNF). The hypotheses about SAT, that we are interested about, are: which proposes that there is no ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0 such that k𝑘k-SAT can be solved in time 𝒪​(2(1−ϵ)​n)𝒪superscript21italic-ϵ𝑛\\mathcal{O}(2^{(1-\\epsilon)n}) for any k𝑘k. which proposes that there is no ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0 such that k𝑘k-SAT can be solved co-nondeterministically in time 𝒪​(2(1−ϵ)​n)𝒪superscript21italic-ϵ𝑛\\mathcal{O}(2^{(1-\\epsilon)n}) for any k𝑘k. The 3SUM problem  is as follows: given a set S𝑆S of n𝑛n integers from {−nc,…,nc},c>0superscript𝑛𝑐…superscript𝑛𝑐𝑐0\\{-n^{c},\\ldots,n^{c}\\},c>0, determine whether there are a triple that sums in zero, i.e. a,b,c∈S𝑎𝑏𝑐𝑆a,b,c\\in S such that a+b+c=0𝑎𝑏𝑐0a+b+c=0. 3SUM hypothesis states that there exists no algorithm that runs in time 𝒪​(n2−ϵ),ϵ>0𝒪superscript𝑛2italic-ϵitalic-ϵ0\\mathcal{O}(n^{2-\\epsilon}),\\epsilon>0 for this problem. In All-Pairs Shortest Path (APSP) problem  one is given an n𝑛n node edge-weighted graph U=(V,E)𝑈𝑉𝐸U=(V,E). As in the previous problem all weights are integers from {−nc,…,nc},c>0superscript𝑛𝑐…superscript𝑛𝑐𝑐0\\{-n^{c},\\ldots,n^{c}\\},c>0. It is supposed that there are no cycles of total negative weight in the graph. For each pair of vertices v,u𝑣𝑢v,u one needs to find the weighted distance between them, i.e. the minimum over all paths from v𝑣v to u𝑢u of the total weight sum of the edges of the path. Hypothesis states that no algorithm with time 𝒪​(n3−ϵ),ϵ>0𝒪superscript𝑛3italic-ϵitalic-ϵ0\\mathcal{O}(n^{3-\\epsilon}),\\epsilon>0 can solve APSP problem. In Boolean Matrix Multiplication (BMM) problem  it is needed to calculate matrix product of the two given n×n𝑛𝑛n\\times n matrices over boolean semiring. The fastest algorithm currently known  solves the task in 𝒪​(n2.372..)\\mathcal{O}(n^{2.372..}) using algebraic methods. The minimal constant c𝑐c such that the BMM problem can be solved in 𝒪​(nc)𝒪superscript𝑛𝑐\\mathcal{O}(n^{c}) is known as ω𝜔\\omega, matrix multiplication exponent. Combinatorial BMM hypothesis  states that there is no 𝒪​(n3−ϵ),ϵ>0𝒪superscript𝑛3italic-ϵitalic-ϵ0\\mathcal{O}(n^{3-\\epsilon}),\\epsilon>0 combinatorial algorithm for BMM. Combinatorial algorithms are not explicitly defined but the idea behind the term is that the algorithm does not use algebraic tricks to get smaller degree in polynomial; also combinatorial algorithms are more often used in practice because algebraic tricks lead to big constants behind 𝒪𝒪\\mathcal{O}-notation. Orthogonal Vectors (OV) problem decides whether two sets X,Y𝑋𝑌X,Y of n𝑛n boolean d=ω​(log⁡n)𝑑𝜔𝑛d\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ =\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ \\omega(\\log n)-dimensional vectors contain a pair x∈X,y∈Yformulae-sequence𝑥𝑋𝑦𝑌x\\in X,y\\in Y which dot product equals zero. Conjecture states that OV problem cannot be solved in 𝒪​(n2−ϵ⋅p​o​l​y​(d)),∀ϵ>0𝒪⋅superscript𝑛2italic-ϵ𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑦𝑑for-allitalic-ϵ0\\mathcal{O}(n^{2-\\epsilon}\\cdot poly(d)),\\forall\\epsilon>0 time. Given an undirected graph U𝑈U on n𝑛n vertices the k𝑘k-Clique problem  seeks the clique on k𝑘k vertices in U𝑈U. If 0≤F≤ω0𝐹𝜔0\\leq F\\leq\\omega and 0≤C≤30𝐶30\\leq C\\leq 3 are the smallest numbers such that k𝑘k-Clique can be solved combinatorially in 𝒪​(nC​k3)𝒪superscript𝑛𝐶𝑘3\\mathcal{O}(n^{\\frac{Ck}{3}}) time and in 𝒪​(nF​k3)𝒪superscript𝑛𝐹𝑘3\\mathcal{O}(n^{\\frac{Fk}{3}}) time by any algorithm, for any constant k≥1𝑘1k\\geq 1, a conjecture  is that C=3𝐶3C=3 and F=ω𝐹𝜔F=\\omega. Triangle detection problem 7 is a case of k𝑘k-Clique problem with k=3𝑘3k=3, it asks whether an undirected graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) contains three nodes i,j,k∈V𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑉i,j,k\\in V with (i,j),(j,k),(k,i)∈E𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑘𝑘𝑖𝐸(i,j),(j,k),(k,i)\\in E. It can be solved in 𝒪​(n3)𝒪superscript𝑛3\\mathcal{O}(n^{3}) time by combinatorial algorithms, and in O​(nω)𝑂superscript𝑛𝜔O(n^{\\omega}) time in general. Language Editing Distance (LED) problem is about determining the minimum number of corrections: insertions, deletions, substitutions, that are needed to transform the given string w∈Σ∗𝑤superscriptΣw\\in\\Sigma^{*} into the string w′superscript𝑤′w^{\\prime} that lies in the given context-free language ℒ​(G)ℒ𝐺\\mathcal{L}(G) over the same alphabet ΣΣ\\Sigma. This problem is known [ref]3 to be solvable in 𝒪​(n3)𝒪superscript𝑛3\\mathcal{O}(n^{3}) time, where n𝑛n is the length of the string and the grammar is considered to be fixed. Dynamic problems\nThe following problems are connecting CFL reachability with dynamic problems, where for one input there can be multiple queries or updates. In the Online boolean Matrix-Vector multiplication (OMV) problem 9 we are given an n×n𝑛𝑛n\\times n boolean matrix M𝑀M, we receive n𝑛n boolean vectors v1,…,vnsubscript𝑣1…subscript𝑣𝑛v_{1},\\ldots,v_{n} one at a time, and are required to output M​vi𝑀subscript𝑣𝑖Mv_{i} (over the boolean semiring) before seeing the vector vi+1subscript𝑣𝑖1v_{i+1}, for all i𝑖i. It is conjectured that there is no algorithm with total time 𝒪​(n3−ϵ)𝒪superscript𝑛3italic-ϵ\\mathcal{O}(n^{3-\\epsilon}) for this problem, even with polynomial time to preprocess M𝑀M. The incremental Dynamic Transitive Closure (DTC) 6 problem asks to maintain reachability information in a directed graph D=(V,E)𝐷𝑉𝐸D=(V,E) between arbitrary pairs of vertices under insertions of edges. Conditional lower bound on DTC follows from OMV hypothesis and reduction from it 9: there is no algorithm with total update time 𝒪​((m​n)1−ϵ)𝒪superscript𝑚𝑛1italic-ϵ\\mathcal{O}((mn)^{1-\\epsilon}) (n=|V|,m=|E|formulae-sequence𝑛𝑉𝑚𝐸n=|V|,m=|E|) even with p​o​l​y​(n)𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑦𝑛poly(n) time preprocessing of the input graph and mδ−ϵsuperscript𝑚𝛿italic-ϵm^{\\delta-\\epsilon} time per query for any δ∈(0,1/2]𝛿012\\delta\\in(0,1/2] such that m=Θ​(n1/(1−δ))𝑚Θsuperscript𝑛11𝛿m=\\Theta(n^{1/(1-\\delta)}) under OMV hypothesis. Problems with lower bound based on SAT, 3SUM or APSP\nBelow are listed two problems that have conditional lower bounds under SAT, 3SUM or APSP hypotheses and thus reductions from them to CFL reachability problem will create conditional lower bounds based on widely believed conjecture. Our first problem of interest is AE-MonoΔΔ\\Delta problem where we are presented with a graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) on n𝑛n vertices in which every edge eu​vsubscript𝑒𝑢𝑣e_{uv} is colored with color c​(eu​v)𝑐subscript𝑒𝑢𝑣c(e_{uv}), where c𝑐c is color function. AE-MonoΔΔ\\Delta problem asks for every edge eu​vsubscript𝑒𝑢𝑣e_{uv} whether there exists a monochromatic triangle that includes this edge, i.e. there is vertex w𝑤w that eu​w,ev​w∈E​(G)subscript𝑒𝑢𝑤subscript𝑒𝑣𝑤𝐸𝐺e_{uw},e_{vw}\\in E(G) and c​(eu​v)=c​(eu​w)=c​(ev​w)𝑐subscript𝑒𝑢𝑣𝑐subscript𝑒𝑢𝑤𝑐subscript𝑒𝑣𝑤c(e_{uv})=c(e_{uw})=c(e_{vw}). This problem is known 4 3 to be solvable in n(3+ω)/2superscript𝑛3𝜔2n^{(3+\\omega)/2} time and has  n2.5superscript𝑛2.5n^{2.5} conditional lower bound under 3SUM and APSP hypotheses (which is tight if ω=2𝜔2\\omega=2). Second problem is really a pair of problems, both of them have  n3superscript𝑛3n^{3} conditional lower bound under SETH, 3SUM and APSP hypotheses, where n𝑛n is the number of vertices in the given graph. In the Triangle collection problem one is given a node-colored graph, and the question is whether for all triples of distinct colors there exists a triangle in a graph which vertices have these colors. ΔΔ\\Delta Matching Triangles problem have the same input but in this problem one is asked about existence of a triple of colors for which there are at least ΔΔ\\Delta triangles in a graph which vertices are colored in this triple.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: w∈Σ∗𝑤superscriptΣw\\in\\Sigma^{*} into the string w′superscript𝑤′w^{\\prime} that lies in the given context-free language ℒ​(G)ℒ𝐺\\mathcal{L}(G) over the same alphabet ΣΣ\\Sigma. This problem is known [ref]3 to be solvable in 𝒪​(n3)𝒪superscript𝑛3\\mathcal{O}(n^{3}) time, where n𝑛n is the length of the string and the grammar is considered to be fixed.
