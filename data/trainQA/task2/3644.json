      "content": "Paper Title: Meta-attention for ViT-backed Continual Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nContinual learning involves incrementally training a model with a new stream of tasks while preserving its previous knowledge basis, which has attracted much interest in recent years .\nGenerally, there are two kinds of settings for continual learning: (1) task continual learning that extends knowledge with new tasks which have clear domain boundaries; (2) class continual learning that accumulates knowledge over different sets of categories separated from the same dataset.\nIn this work, we mainly focus on task continual learning.\nPrevious continual learning methods can be broadly categorized into replay methods, regularization methods and mask methods.\nThe replay methods   7   expect to store a subset of samples of previous tasks and retrain the model on old samples to review knowledge of old tasks. The regularization-based methods      4 utilize the knowledge distillation technique ,\nspecial regularization terms to avoid catastrophic forgetting.\nThe other mask methods of continual learning are devoted to expanding the network capacity\nvia introducing extra masks for each new task 1 0 2 [ref]41   .\nThe knowledge of previous tasks can be preserved by sequentially increasing\nnew masks (weight masks 1 0 2   or unit masks [ref]41 ) and masking out parameters of old tasks simultaneously. For example, PackNet 1 iteratively performs pruning a well-trained base network and maintains binary sparsity masks to fix necessary parameters for incoming tasks. Piggyback 0 introduces binary masks on all parameters of a base network for each task without the forgetting problem. HAT [ref]41 designs unit masks and keeps the feature embeddings of learned tasks to preserve information of old tasks. Our proposed MEAT builds upon mask methods: given a well-initialized transformer, we assign attention masks to the self-attention mechanism and a portion of parameters to fully leverage the architectural characteristics of ViTs for continual learning. Besides incremental learning in computer vision mainly designed for CNN structures, a growing body of research in NLP has equipped the transformer with incremental learning. Adaptor-BERT  adds two fully connected layers as an adaptor in each layer and freezes old parameters\n (except for normalization layers)\nduring training. Inspired by this work, B-CL  adopts capsules and dynamic routing 9 to transfer old knowledge to new tasks for aspect sentiment classification tasks.\n presents an information disentanglement-based regularization method to further generalize old task knowledge. We also compare MEAT with Adaptor-BERT to verify the effectiveness of our methods.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: regularization terms to avoid catastrophic forgetting.\nThe other mask methods of continual learning are devoted to expanding the network capacity\nvia introducing extra masks for each new task 1 0 2 [ref]41   .\nThe knowledge of previous tasks can be preserved by sequentially increasing\nnew masks (weight masks 1 0 2   or unit masks [ref]41 ) and masking out parameters of old tasks simultaneously.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
