      "content": "Paper Title: Manthan: A Data Driven Approach for Boolean Function SynthesisThe open source tool is available at https://github.com/meelgroup/manthan\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe origins of the problem of Boolean functional synthesis traces back to Boole’s seminal work , which was subsequently rigorously pursued, albeit focused on decidability, by Lowenheim and Skolem . The complexity theoretic studies have shown that there exist instances where Boolean functional synthesis takes super polynomial time and was also shown that there exist instances for which polynomial size Skolem function vector does not suffice unless Polynomial Hierarchy (PH) collapses . Motivated by the success of the CEGAR (Counter-Example Guided Abstraction Refinement) approach in model checking, CEGAR-based approaches have been pursued in the context of synthesis as well, where the key idea is to use a Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) SAT solver to verify and refine the candidate Skolem functions [ref]4   . Another line of work has focused on the representation of specification, i.e., F​(X,Y)𝐹𝑋𝑌F(X,Y), in representations that are amenable to efficient synthesis for a class of functions. The early approaches focused on ROBDD representation building on the functional composition approach proposed by Balabanov and Jiang . Building on Tabajara and Vardi’s ROBDD-based approach , Chakraborty et al. extended the approach to factored specifications . It is worth mentioning that factored specifications had earlier been pursued in the context of CEGAR-based approaches. Motivated by the success of knowledge compilation in the field of probabilistic reasoning, Akshay et al. achieved a significant breakthrough over a series of papers    to propose a new negation normal form, SynNNF [ref]4. The generalization and a functional specification presented in SynNNF is amenable to efficient functional synthesis [ref]4. Another line of work focused on the usage of incremental determinization to incrementally construct the Skolem functions     . Several approaches have been proposed for the particular case when the specification, ∃Y​F​(X,Y)𝑌𝐹𝑋𝑌\\exists YF(X,Y) is valid, i.e., ∀X​∃Y​F​(X,Y)for-all𝑋𝑌𝐹𝑋𝑌\\forall X\\exists YF(X,Y) is True. Inspired by the sequential relational decomposition, Chakraborty et al.  recently proposed an approach focused on viewing each CNF clause of the specification consisting of input and output clauses and employing a cooperation-based strategy. The progress in modern CDCL solvers has led to an exploration of usage of heuristics for problems in complexity classes beyond NP. This has led to work on the extraction of Skolem functions from the proofs constructed for the formulas expressed as ∀X​∃Y​F​(X,Y)for-all𝑋𝑌𝐹𝑋𝑌\\forall X\\exists YF(X,Y)  . The performance of Manthan crucially depends on its ability to employ constrained sampling, which has witnessed a surge of interest with approaches ranging from those based on hashing-based techniques , knowledge compilation  , augmentation of SAT solvers with heuristics . The recent success of machine learning has led to several attempts to the usage of machine learning in several related synthesis domains such as program synthesis , invariant generation, decision-tree for functions in Linear Integer Arithmetic theory using pre-specified examples , strategy synthesis for QBF .\nUse of data-driven approaches for invariant synthesis has been investigated in the ICE learning framework    aimed with data about the program behavior from test executions, it proposes invariants by learning from data, checks for inductiveness and, on failure, extend the data by the generated counterexamples.\nThe usage of proof-artifacts such as unsat cores has been explored in verification since early 2000s  and in program repair in Wolverine , while MaxSAT has been used in program debugging in  .\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: approaches have been pursued in the context of synthesis as well, where the key idea is to use a Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) SAT solver to verify and refine the candidate Skolem functions [ref]4   .
