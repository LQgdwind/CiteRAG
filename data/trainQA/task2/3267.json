      "content": "Paper Title: Symptoms of Architecture Erosion in Code Reviews: A Study of Two OpenStack Projects\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMacia et al.  explored the impact of code anomalies on architecture erosion, and their results revealed that certain kinds of early architectural smells (e.g., ambiguous interface, module concern overload) can be regarded as key architecture erosion symptoms and accelerate the erosion of architecture. Uch√¥a et al.  analyzed the impact of code review on design degradation evolution. They analyzed various erosion symptoms to investigate the relationships between the density and diversity of symptoms and design degradation. Oizumi et al.  conducted an exploratory study to investigate whether symptoms of structural degradation (e.g., broken modularization, cyclic hierarchy, unutilized abstraction) with higher density and diversity in classes can be used as indicators of the need for root canal refactorings (a refactoring tactic). Their results indicated that certain symptoms might be indeed strong indicators of structural degradation, despite not being removed by refactoring. Mair et al. [ref]25 considered architecture violations as a type of symptom of architecture erosion and investigated how software engineers repaired eroded software systems. Le et al. ,  mentioned that architectural smells can be regarded as symptoms of architecture erosion and they proposed algorithms and metrics to detect instances of architecture erosion by analyzing the detected smells. Compared to the aforementioned studies that focus on the erosion symptoms by source code analysis (e.g., density of code smells , architectural smells , ), our work investigated the discussions on architecture erosion symptoms in code reviews, including the frequently discussed erosion symptoms and their trends, as well as the actions (i.e., code changes) taken by developers.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: refactorings (a refactoring tactic). Their results indicated that certain symptoms might be indeed strong indicators of structural degradation, despite not being removed by refactoring. Mair et al.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
