      "content": "Paper Title: Robust Reinforcement Learning in Continuous Control Tasks with Uncertainty Set Regularization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful algorithmic paradigm used to solve sequential decision-making problems and has resulted in great success in various types of environments, e.g., mastering the game of Go¬†, playing computer games¬†[ref]2 and operating smart grids . The majority of these successes rely on an implicit assumption that the testing environment is identical to the training environment. However, this assumption is too strong for most realistic problems, such as controlling a robot. In more detail, there are several situations where mismatches might appear between training and testing environments in robotics: (1) Parameter Perturbations indicates that a large number of environmental parameters, e.g. temperature, friction factor could fluctuate after deployment and thus deviate from the training environment¬†; (2) System Identification estimates a transition function from limited experience. This estimation is biased compared with the real-world model¬†[ref]5; (3) Sim-to-Real learns a policy in a simulated environment and performs on real robots for reasons of safety and efficiency¬†. The difference between simulated and realistic environments renders sim-to-real a challenging task. In this paper, we aim to model the mismatch between training environments and testing environments as a robust RL problem, which regards training environments and testing environments as candidates in an uncertainty set including all possible environments. Robust Markov Decision Processes (Robust MDPs)¬†  is a common theoretical framework to analyze the robustness of RL algorithms. In contrast to the vanilla MDPs with a single transition model P‚Äã(s‚Ä≤|s,a)ùëÉconditionalsuperscriptùë†‚Ä≤ùë†ùëéP(s^{\\prime}|s,a), Robust MDPs consider an uncertainty set of transition models ‚Ñô={P}‚ÑôùëÉ\\mathbb{P}=\\{P\\} to describe the uncertain environments. This formulation is general enough to cover the various scenarios for the robot learning problems aforementioned. The aim of Robust RL is to learn a policy under the worst-case scenarios among all transition models P‚àà‚ÑôùëÉ‚ÑôP\\in\\mathbb{P}, named robust policy. If a transition model PùëÉP is viewed as an adversarial agent with the uncertainty set ‚Ñô‚Ñô\\mathbb{P} as its action space, one can reformulate Robust RL as a zero-sum game¬†[ref]9. In general, solving such a problem is an NP-hard problem¬† 0, however, the employment of Legendre-Fenchel transform can avoid excessive mini-max computations through converting minimization over the transition model to regularization on the value function. Furthermore, it enables more feasibility and tractability to design novel regularizers to cover different types of transition uncertainties. The complexity of these value-function-based regularizers increases with the size of the state space, which leads to a nontrivial extension to continuous control tasks with infinitely large state space. This directly motivates the work of this paper. Due to the page limit, we conclude other related work in Appendix¬†A. We now summarize the contributions of this paper: (1) the robustness-regularization duality method is extended to continuous control tasks in parametric space; (2) the Uncertainty Set Regularizer (USR) on existing RL frameworks is proposed for learning robust policies; (3) the value function is learnt through an adversarial uncertainty set when the actual uncertainty set is unknown in some scenarios; (4) the USR is evaluated on the Real-world Reinforcement Learning (RWRL) benchmark, showing improvements for robust performances in perturbed testing environments with unknown uncertainty sets; (5) the sim-to-real performance of USR is verified through realistic experiments on the Unitree A1 robot.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: algorithmic paradigm used to solve sequential decision-making problems and has resulted in great success in various types of environments, e.g., mastering the game of Go¬†, playing computer games¬†[ref]2 and operating smart grids .
