      "content": "Paper Title: Diffusion Policies for Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Offline Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOffline Reinforcement Learning (RL) has garnered significant attention for learning from previously collected datasets without interacting with the real world . Leveraging large datasets and generalizing to unforeseen situations are critical components of intelligent systems. Humans can continuously use and accumulate a range of visual, auditory, and motor skills throughout their lives. Large datasets used for learning attempt to mimic humans’ vast and multimodal growing experience. Thus, results obtained from large language models that use large datasets resemble human intelligence [ref]3   . Similarly, out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, is crucial for developing reliable systems that can adapt to unexpected conditions. While offline RL methods have shown significant potential in learning skills, especially in safety-critical settings such as autonomous driving [ref]7, they struggle in cases not encountered in the training set. Hence, we design a generalizable generative offline RL model, State Reconstruction for Diffusion Policies (SRDP), to learn robust skills from offline datasets by extrapolating sequential decision-making to OOD states. Offline RL focuses on creating the best decision-making agent supported by the dataset instead of interacting with the environment online through a feedback loop. The benefits of this approach include reusing available datasets instead of going through the expensive and dangerous data collection procedure. Thus, offline RL has many applications, including robotics, healthcare, and finance. Offline RL aims to find a better policy than the behavior policy that generated the trajectories in the dataset without making assumptions about the experience of the agents that collected the data. In contrast to imitation learning, where the agent seeks to imitate the expert trajectories, offline RL can leverage non-expert data. While diverse datasets can improve sample efficiency and the robustness of the policy, out-of-distribution states can still be encountered after training. The main challenges of offline RL are the distribution shift and uncertainty estimation . Since state and action distributions in the offline dataset can differ from those encountered in the evaluation environment, dealing with OOD state and action samples is a prominent topic in offline RL . Thus, we are interested in policy-regularized offline RL algorithms where the divergence from the behavior policy that collected the dataset is discouraged. Wang et al. show that prior policy regularization-based methods fail to represent multimodal actions accurately in multi-armed bandit environments. Diffusion-QL 0 and Diffusers 1 are recent RL algorithms that utilize diffusion models by guiding the diffusion process toward regions that can yield a high reward. Diffusers 1 use diffusion models in the planning procedure to generate trajectories from the diffusion model 1, while diffusion-QL generates actions based on a state-conditional diffusion model and uses Q-function maximization with behavior cloning loss. Even though Diffusion-QL can represent multimodal actions, it is often unstable in OOD state regions. Auto-encoders can reconstruct a subset of OOD samples with low error via learning representations in the bottleneck layer 2. Denouden et al. highlight that OOD samples close to a linear or a nonlinear latent dimension manifold of the training data can have a low reconstruction loss 2. Hence, guidance from a reconstruction loss and similar architectural designs can benefit OOD generalization. For instance, Mutlu et al. 3 use reconstruction loss to provide hints to the generator. Although we employ separate output heads to integrate the state reconstruction loss, we use a shared representation layer to generalize OOD samples close to the latent dimension manifold. Our key contributions include State Reconstruction for Diffusion Policies (SRDP), a new offline RL method that alleviates the distribution shifts incurred by OOD states using representation learning. SRDP is tailored to guide diffusion policies using a state reconstruction signal. In addition, we propose a novel 2D multimodal contextual bandit environment designed to illustrate the performance of the trained policy in OOD state regions. We show that integrating an auxiliary state reconstruction loss promotes learning more descriptive features from the OOD-state samples and faster convergence. Finally, we evaluate our methods on the D4RL benchmarks  on a variety of ant, half cheetah, hopper, and walker2d agent datasets with varying amounts of suboptimal data and obtain superior performance compared to the prior offline RL algorithms.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: datasets used for learning attempt to mimic humans’ vast and multimodal growing experience.
