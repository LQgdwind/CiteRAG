      "content": "Paper Title: Distributed Pruning Towards Tiny Neural Networks in Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFederated Learning has recently gained attention as a promising approach to address data privacy concerns in collaborative machine learning. FedAvg [ref]27, one of the most widely used methods in federated learning, utilizes locally updated on-device models instead of raw data to achieve private knowledge transferring.\nSince data is locally stored and cannot be shared, the aforementioned pruning approaches that rely on training data cannot be used in federated learning. Enlighten by pruning at initialization, Xu et al. proposed to prune the original full-size model at the server and fine-tune at devices with their local data [ref]8. Existing pruning at initialization approaches, such as SNIP , GraSP , and SynFlow , can be directly converted to server-side pruning. However, server-side pruning usually results in significantly biased pruned models, especially for heterogeneous (non-iid) local data distributions. To mitigate such bias, recent research pushes pruning operations under federated settings to devices. By locally training a full-size model, SCBF  dynamically discards the unimportant channels on devices. Such local training with a full-size model is assigned to a part of devices in FedPrune to guide pruning based on the updated activations .\nBesides, LotteryFL [ref]10 iteratively prunes a full-size model on devices with a fixed pruning rate to find a personalized local subnetwork. However, the above research suffers from large memory and computational cost on the device side because devices need to locally compute the importance scores of all parameters. Although PruneFL  reduces the local computational cost by finer pruning a coarse-pruned model rather than a full-size model, it still requires a large local memory footprint to record the updated importance scores of all parameters in the full-size model.\nZeroFL  partitions weights into active weights and non-active weights in the inference and sparsified weights and activations for backward propagation. However, this approach still needs a large memory space because the non-active weights and the gradients generated through the training process are still stored in a dense fashion.\nFedDST  deploys the mask adjustment on the devices, and the server generates a new global model via sparse aggregation and magnitude pruning. It needs much more computation cost because it needs extra training epochs to recover the growing weights before uploading, which may lead to straggling issues in federated learning. The coarse-pruned model still suffers from bias issues in the server-side pruning.\nExisting federated neural network pruning fails to obtain a specialized tiny model without bias and memory-/compute-budget concerns. Therefore, we develop FedTiny to achieve this.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: Federated Learning has recently gained attention as a promising approach to address data privacy concerns in collaborative machine learning.
