      "content": "Paper Title: Pluralistic Aging Diffusion Autoencoder\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets.\nWe relabeled a new facial aging dataset based on the images of FFHQ 4, FFHQ-AT. We roughly divided the FFHQ into 7 age groups: 0-5, 6-15, 16-25, 26-35, 36-50, 51-70, 70+ and accordingly pre-defined 14 age-related descriptions, including ‘a toddler girl’s/boy’s face’, ‘woman’s/man’s face in her/his tens’, ‘woman’s/man’s face in her/his twenties’, ‘woman’s/man’s face in her/his thirties’, ‘woman’s/man’s face in her/his forties’, ‘woman’s/man’s face in her/his sixties’, and ‘woman’s/man’s face in her/his eighties’. Then, we use a pre-trained DEX††https://github.com/siriusdemon/pytorch-DEX to predict the age value of the image in FFHQ. According to the\nabsolute difference value between the predicted age and the pre-defined age, we annotate the image with the pre-defined text description.\nNote that, with these simple text descriptions, our PADA can achieve face aging based on arbitrary age-related descriptions, such as ‘a face of teenager’.\nWe choose 66,928 images as training set and 3,072 images as test set, which contains 1,528 males and 1,544 females. Finally, we train our model on the new relabeled FFHQ-AT and evaluate it on both FFHQ-AT and CelebA-HQ  test sets. Implementation Details.\n\nThe conditional DDIM decoder and semantic encoder [ref]33 are pre-trained on the FFHQ dataset 4.\nIn our Lr​e​csubscript𝐿𝑟𝑒𝑐L_{rec}, we randomly set the reference images equal to the source images with the probability of 0.167.\nAging results are generated with T=25𝑇25T=25 steps in all cases.\nOur implementations are based on the MindSpore.\nDuring training, we choose our hyperparameters with λ1=0.6subscript𝜆10.6\\lambda_{1}=0.6, λ2=0.01subscript𝜆20.01\\lambda_{2}=0.01, λ3=0.2subscript𝜆30.2\\lambda_{3}=0.2, λ4=0.01subscript𝜆40.01\\lambda_{4}=0.01, and λ5=0.1subscript𝜆50.1\\lambda_{5}=0.1. We set the margin m𝑚m in La​g​esubscript𝐿𝑎𝑔𝑒L_{age} as 0.15 and the sampling intensity ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon as 0.001, respectively. The Adam optimizer  is used with l​r=0.0001𝑙𝑟0.0001lr=0.0001, β1=0.9subscript𝛽10.9\\beta_{1}=0.9, β2=0.999subscript𝛽20.999\\beta_{2}=0.999. PADA is trained for 20 epochs with a batch size of 24. Evaluation Metrics. We automatically and manually compare our method with three state-of-the-art aging methods, including DLFS2, SAM, and CUSP0. We compare them from three aspects: aging accuracy, identity preservation, and aging quality.\nFor automatically evaluation,\n1) since the pre-trained DEX  is used for training, we employ Face++ API ††Face++ Face detection API: https://www.faceplusplus.com. for aging accuracy (Age MAE) evaluation;\n2) since the pre-trained Arcface  is used for training, we employ the pre-trained SFace  for identity preservation evaluation;\n3) for the aging quality evaluation,\nwe employ Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)  3 to assess the discrepancy between the generated images and the real ones with the same age.\nFor manual evaluation, we perform a human evaluation to reliably compare the performance with different aging methods 2  0.\nBesides, we conduct the ablation study and explore more interesting properties of PADA, including diversity exploration, text-guided, and reference-guided face aging.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: females.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
