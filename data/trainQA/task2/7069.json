      "content": "Paper Title: RobustEdge: Low Power Adversarial Detection for Cloud-Edge Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTowards adversarial detection, a line of works have trained the classifier model for adversarial detection.\nXu et al. [ref]12 propose a method that uses outputs of multiple classifier models to estimate the difference between natural and adversarial data. Here, the classifier models are trained on natural inputs with different feature squeezing techniques at the inputs. Moitra et al. [ref]13 uses the features from the first layer of the classifier model to perform adversarial detection. In particular, they perform adversarial detection using hardware signatures in analog crossbar accelerators. While Grosse et al.  train the classifier model with an additional class label indicating adversarial data, Gong et al.  train a separate binary classifier on the natural and adversarial data generated from the classifier model to perform adversarial detection. Lee et al.  use a metric called the Mahalanobis distance classifier to train the classifier model. The Mahalanobis distance is used to distinguish natural from adversarial data. Other works have trained detector networks attached to classifier models for adversarial detection.\nMetzen et al. [ref]10 and Sterneck et al.  use the intermediate features of the classifier model to train a simple binary adversarial detector. While Metzen et al. [ref]10 use a heuristic-based method to determine the point of attachment of the detector with the classifier model, Sterneck et al.  use a structured metric called adversarial noise sensitivity to do the same. Similarly, Yin et al.  use asymmetric adversarial training to train detectors on the intermediate features of the classifier model for adversarial detection. Further, Huang et al.  use the confidence scores from the classifier model to estimate the relative score difference corresponding to the clean and the adversarial input to perform adversarial detection. Further, they also recommend classifier model training on noisy data to improve the adversarial detection performance. Although prior detection works have achieved state-of-the-art performance, they have overlooked the practicality and the implication of such techniques for cloud-edge computing scenarios. As the detector is attached to the classifier, 1) Adversarial detection cost is high as both classifier and detector work in tandem. 2) The detector needs to be retrained if the classifier model changes. RobustEdge performs low-cost adversarial detection while being agnostic of the classifier DNN deployed at the cloud. At the same time, the detection occurs at the edge eliminating wasteful adversarial data transmission to the cloud.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Towards adversarial detection, a line of works have trained the classifier model for adversarial detection.\nXu et al.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
