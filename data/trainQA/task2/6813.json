      "content": "Paper Title: Audio-Visual Glance Network for Efficient Video Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe exponential growth of diverse video contents, particularly those involving human-related actions, has prompted the development of deep learning algorithms [ref]2 [ref]35   that can effectively process and understand such data.\nVideo recognition can bring benefits to multiple fields, such as sports for performance analysis , military for situational awareness , transportation for traffic monitoring , security for threat detection  and surveillance for public safety .\nHowever, the current state-of-the-art methods often require high computational costs, especially when dealing with lengthy and heavy videos, hindering their practical application in real-world scenarios.\nThis has led to an increasing demand for efficient video understanding methods . To address this issue, various approaches have been proposed, such as developing efficient and lightweight architecture  8, or adaptively selecting only the most informative subset of given videos 6 0 0, or training a policy network using policy gradient  [ref]25. On the other hand, some approaches manipulate the spatial resolution of input video frames to achieve efficiency, such as extracting only important spatial patches  0 or adaptively changing the resolution frames based on the importance [ref]25. From all those approaches, we found that for efficient action recognition, we need to selectively locate and process only the important temporal and spatial location of the video. Intuitively, we need to know when and where to look at. For example in Fig. 1, to determine the action class “skiing”, we only need the frames that contain a person riding the ski, not the frames that only show the snowfield or the person doing no action. This inspires us to create a network that can do efficient action recognition by glancing through the video to selectively find the important frames in a low-cost manner. Further, we aim to utilize the additional audio modality which is naturally available together with the visual modality in video recording, mimicking the human intuition of skimming through long sequences using both visual and audio cues to find important keyframes. Compared to the visual modality, the action-discriminative features of audio modality are easier to compute , and it also helps to distinguish actions that are visually similar 6. We propose Audio-Visual Glance Network (AVGN), a comprehensive framework designed to enhance efficiency in both spatial and temporal dimensions. For temporal efficiency, AVGN aims to make the correct recognition of a video sequence with only a few important frames that actually contain distinctive cues. To achieve this, we construct an Audio-Visual Temporal Saliency Transformer (AV-TeST) that estimates the temporal saliency of a frame using coarse features generated by lightweight audio and visual backbones. Furthermore, to ensure spatial efficiency, we construct an Audio-Enhanced Spatial Patch Attention (AESPA) module that learns the relationship between audio feature sequences and visual features. This module generates audio-enhanced visual features that can be used by a patch extraction network to extract important spatial patches. For each frame, the patch contains only the important area of the image frame and has a lower pixel size compared to the original image. In addition to these modules, we also devise an appropriate feature fusion for classifier input and the training techniques to optimize these modules. Our experimental results demonstrate that AVGN effectively incorporates audio and visual modalities for efficient action recognition. Our comparison with other state-of-the-art methods in Fig. 2 shows that AVGN achieves a higher mAP and lower FLOP cost on the ActivityNet dataset, indicating that it achieves pareto optimality. To conclude, our contributions are as follows: We show that incorporating audio modality into the video recognition process can lead to a pareto optimal solution, i.e., improved accuracy without sacrificing efficiency. Our approach combines audio and visual information to improve temporal and spatial efficiency in a unified manner, and incorporates tailored training strategies that further optimize the performance of our AVGN. AVGN achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple video recognition benchmarks as a result of the model building blocks and training techniques.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: The exponential growth of diverse video contents, particularly those involving human-related actions, has prompted the development of deep learning algorithms [ref]2 [ref]35   that can effectively process and understand such data.\nVideo recognition can bring benefits to multiple fields, such as sports for performance analysis , military for situational\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
