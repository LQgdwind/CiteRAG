      "content": "Paper Title: AKF-SR: Adaptive Kalman Filtering-based Successor Representation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOnce the approximation structure of the SR and the reward function have been defined, a suitable algorithm needs to be designed to learn (estimate) the reward function R‚Äã(ùíî,a)ùëÖùíîùëéR(\\bm{s},a) and the SR vector ùíéœÄ‚Äã(ùíî,a)superscriptùíéùúãùíîùëé\\bm{m}^{\\pi}(\\bm{s},a). For these estimations, sample transition of the system, the feature vectors, and the received reward from the environment are used as the measurements.\nDNN-based RL methods¬†   [ref]37 , require to store all these measurements together with the network‚Äôs parameters and activations to be learned in batches. In the learning process, one needs to store the activations from a forward propagation to be utilized later for computation of the error gradients in a back propagation process. Therefore, considerably high memory is required for implementation of deep learning-based techniques. For instance, there are 262626 million parameters in a 505050-layer ResNet network resulting in the need to compute 161616 million activations during the forward pass. Approximately, the memory required for training of a ResNet-505050 network with a mini-batch of 323232, is over 7.57.57.5 GB of local DRAM. Furthermore, similar to other standard TD learning-based algorithm, most of the DNN-based frameworks¬†  [ref]37 do not consider uncertainty within the value approximation context. The difficulty between exploration and exploitation should use from such uncertainty information. Finally, reliability of a learning algorithm is another important factor which needs to be verified for applications to real word scenarios. For a learning process to be reliable in different applications, it should be capable of regenerating consistent performances over multiple runs with the least frangibility to the model‚Äôs parameters (reproducibility aspect of reliability)¬†. However, performance of a DNN model, is highly affected by its large number of parameters required to be tuned. Tuning of such a large number of parameters, therefore, leads to high sensitivity and considerable time and effort needed to tune the parameters, which make DNN-based RL algorithms unreliable for practical applications. By contrast, filtering algorithms¬† , which are efficient techniques to process sequential data, can be implemented based only on the last measurement. Such approaches eliminate the necessity of the learning process to record the complete measurement history, which, in turn, translates into significant reduction in time and memory requirements in comparison to DNN-based techniques. It also has been shown that applied filtering-based algorithms (such as KTD¬†) estimate uncertainty of the value function and consider that for action selection during the learning process in order to make a balance between exploring unknowns and exploiting the agent‚Äôs knowledge. Furthermore, despite DNNs, a small number of parameters is required to be tuned in filtering-based methods resulting in less time and effort required for the parameters tuning and also less vulnerability of its performance to the model‚Äôs parameters in comparison to its DNN-based counterpart.\nThe performance of filtering-based algorithms, however, are highly related to the filter‚Äôs parameters and complete information about theses parameters is not accessible. In order to tackle this problem and tune the filter‚Äôs parameters, earlier studies proposed adaptive multiple model filters¬† [ref]54 to adapt the filter‚Äôs parameters. The proposed AKF-SR framework is, therefore, based on development of KTD framework to the SR learning and adaptable KF in order to provide a powerful efficient means for estimation the reward function. The AKF-SR consists of the following four main modules as follows: RBF-based Feature Vector Construction, which projects a pair (ùíî,aùíîùëé\\bm{s},a) into a feature vector consisting of RBFs in order to generalize the SR and the reward function (consequently, value function) to continuous state spaces such that the SR and the reward function can be modeled as linear functions of the feature vectors. Reward Learning, which estimates the reward weight vector ùúΩùúΩ\\bm{\\theta} via a KF. To tune the measurement noise covariance of the KF a multiple model adaptive estimation method is utilized within KF formulation for reward learning.\nFurthermore, restricted gradient descent is adopted which regularizes the measurement mapping function of the KF by updating the means and covariances of the underlying RBFs. KTD-based SR Learning, which estimates the SR weight matrix ùëæùëæ\\bm{W} using KTD algorithm in order to estimate uncertainty of the SR (consequently, the value function). An Active Learning Process, which uses the value function‚Äôs uncertainty achieved from utilized KTD in the SR learning process to select the action that reduces the system‚Äôs uncertainty more than any other potential actions. Fig.¬†1 provides a block diagram of the proposed AKF-SR framework.\nThe aforementioned four components of the proposed AKF-SR framework are detailed in the following sub-sections.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: For these estimations, sample transition of the system, the feature vectors, and the received reward from the environment are used as the measurements.\nDNN-based RL methods¬†   [ref]37 , require to store all these measurements together with the network‚Äôs parameters and activations to be learned in batches.
