The first and only attempt at global stabilization of a class of general nonlinear PDE systems\nwas made in  7, using infinite Volterra series. The complexity of that result highlights the importance of seeking methodologies that fall in between such complex nonlinear designs and linear designs such as . In fact, for parabolic PDEs with nonlinear growth exceeding |u|‚Äãlog2‚Å°(1+|u|)ùë¢superscript21ùë¢|u|\\log^{2}(1+|u|), [ref]8 shows that finite-time blow up cannot be prevented with boundary control, hence, the pursuit of global stabilization is in vain, in general.\nA few CLF-based control designs for nonlinear PDEs include  . Only a few particular cases admit a linearizing transformation [ref]15 . Hardly any results exist on GS for PDEs. The paper  focuses on finite-dimensional approximations. In , GS is used for time-varying (not nonlinear) PDEs. Our paper builds on 5, where exact‚Äîand explicit‚ÄîGS for a special example of hyperbolic PDEs with recirculation is considered.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: that fall in between such complex nonlinear designs and linear designs such as .
