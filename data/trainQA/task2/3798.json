      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Equilibrium Optical Flow Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOptical flow estimation is the classic computer vision task of predicting the pixel-level motions between video frames  [ref]5  [ref]7 [ref]1. Learning-based approaches to this problem, which outperformed classical approaches, proposed the use of conventional deep convolutional networks to learn a flow estimate   [ref]7.\nRecent progress has shown that finite-step, unrolled and recurrent update operations significantly improve the estimation performance, exemplified by the emergence of the RAFT [ref]1 method. Contemporary optical flow models that employ this approach typically rely on a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)  to iteratively refine the optical flow estimate.\nThis approach was motivated to emulate traditional optimization-based methods, and the update operators defined accordingly have become the standard design for state-of-the-art flow models [ref]1    . Despite their superior performance, these rolled-out recurrent networks suffer from a few drawbacks.\nFirst, training these models involves tracking a long hidden-state history in the backpropagation-through-time (BPTT) algorithm , which yields a significant computational and memory burden. Therefore, these models tend to scale poorly with larger images and more iterations.\nSecond, although these models were designed to emulate traditional optimization approaches which solve for a “stable estimate\" with as many steps as needed, the recurrent networks do not directly model such a minimum-energy optima state. Rather, they stop after a predefined L𝐿L update steps, and are still trained in a path-dependent way using BPTT. We also show later in Fig. 2 that the GRUs frequently oscillate instead of converging. In this work, we introduce deep equilibrium (DEQ) flow estimators based on recent progresses in implicit deep learning, represented by DEQ models     .\nOur method functions as a superior and natural framework to replace the existing recurrent, unrolling-based flow estimation approach. There are multiple reasons why this method is preferable.\nFirst, instead of relying on the naïve iterative layer stacking, DEQ models define their outputs as the fixed points of a single layer fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f_{\\theta} using the input 𝐱𝐱{\\mathbf{x}}, i.e., 𝐳∗=fθ​(𝐳∗,𝐱)superscript𝐳subscript𝑓𝜃superscript𝐳𝐱{\\mathbf{z}}^{*}=f_{\\theta}\\left({\\mathbf{z}}^{*},{\\mathbf{x}}\\right), modeling an “infinite-layer” equilibrium representation. We can directly solve for the fixed point using specialized black-box solvers, e.g., quasi-Newton methods  , in a spirit much more consistent with the traditional optimization-based perspective 0 [ref]5. This approach expedites the stable flow estimation process while often yielding better results.\nSecond, we no longer need to perform BPTT. Instead, DEQ models can directly differentiate through the final fixed point 𝐳∗superscript𝐳{\\mathbf{z}}^{*} without having to store intermediary states during the forward computation, considerably lowering the training memory cost.\nThird, this fixed-point formulation justifies numerous implicit network enhancements such as 1) fixed-point reuse from adjacent video frames; and 2) inexact gradients 1 2 3. The former helps avoid redundant computations, thus substantially accelerating flow estimations; and the latter makes the backward pass computationally almost free!\nFourth, the DEQ approach is not predicated on any specific structure for fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f_{\\theta}. Therefore, DEQ is a framework that applies to a wide range of these SOTA flow estimation model designs (e.g., RAFT [ref]1, GMA , and Depthstillation 4), and we can obtain the aforementioned computational and memory benefits with even additional gain based on the specific structure of fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f_{\\theta}. In addition to suggesting DEQ flow estimators as a superior replacement to the existing recurrent approach, we also tackle the longstanding instability challenge of training DEQ networks 5  6 . Inspired by the RAFT model, we propose a novel, sparse fixed-point correction scheme that substantially stabilizes our DEQ flow estimators. The contributions of this paper are as follows.\nFirst, we propose the deep equilibrium (DEQ) approach as a new natural starting point for formulating optical flow methods. A DEQ approach directly models and substantially accelerates the fixed-point convergence of the flow estimation process, avoids redundant computations across video frames, and comes with an almost-free backward pass.\nSecond, we show that the DEQ approach is orthogonal to, and thus compatible with, the prior modeling efforts (which focus on the model design and feature extraction) [ref]1  and data-related efforts . With DEQ, these prior arts are now more computationally and memory efficient as well as more accurate. For instance, on KITTI-15 7 (train) a zero-shot DEQ-based RAFT model further reduces the state-of-the-art F1-all measure by 21.0%percent21.021.0\\% while using the underlying RAFT design.\nThird, we introduce a sparse fixed-point correction scheme that significantly stabilizes DEQ models on optical flow problems while only adding minimal cost, and show that on flow estimation tasks this approach is superior to the recently proposed Jacobian-based regularization 6.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Optical flow estimation is the classic computer vision task of predicting the pixel-level motions between video frames  [ref]5  [ref]7 [ref]1.
