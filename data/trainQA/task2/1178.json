Firstly, miniaturizing processors to sub-micron size while keeping the rest of the components (such as buses) above the centimeter scale. Secondly, single-processor performance has stalled [ref]26, mainly because of reaching the limits,\nthe laws of nature enable  (but, as we present, also because of tremendously extending its inherent idle waiting times). Thirdly, making truly parallel computers failed , and we can reach the needed high computing performance only through putting together an excessive number of segregated processors. This latter way replaced parallel computing with parallelized sequential computing (aka distributed computing),\ndisregarding that the operating rules of the latter [ref]28 sharply differ from those experienced with segregated processors.\nFourthly, the utilization mode (mainly multitasking) forced us to use an OS, which imitates a ”new processor” for a new task, at serious time expenses 01.\nFinally, the idea of ”real-time connected everything” introduced geographically large distances with their corresponding several millisecond data transfer times.\nDespite all of this, the idea of non-temporal behavior was confirmed by accepting the idea of ”weak scaling” 2,\nsuggesting that all housekeeping times, such as organizing the joint work of parallelized serial processors, sharing resources, using exceptions and OS services, delivering data between processing units and data storage units, are negligible.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: reasons.
