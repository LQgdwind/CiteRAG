      "content": "Paper Title: A Neural Network Ensemble Approach to System Identification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper we use a Lipschitz regularized ensemble of neural networks to learn governing equations from data. There are two main differences between our method and other neural network system identification methods in the literature. First, we add a Lipschitz regularization term to our loss function to force the Lipschitz constant of the interpolation network to be small. This regularization results in a smoother approximating function and better generalization properties when compared with non-regularized models, especially in presence of noise. These results are in line with the theoretical work of Calder and Oberman  and with the empirical findings of our previous paper . Second, we use an ensemble of neural networks instead of a single neural network for the reconstruction. It has been shown in [ref]10 that the generalization ability of a neural network architecture can be improved through ensembling, but while this technique has been applied in the past for multiple problems (see for instance , , ), to our knowledge this is the first time that Lipschitz regularization is added to the ensemble to overcome the sensitivity to noise in a system identification problem.\nThe results shown in the examples, which are representative of a larger testing activity with several different types of right-hand sides f‚Äã(x,t)ùëìùë•ùë°f(x,t), show multiple strengths of our method: In all of the examples when noise is present in the data, the Lipschitz regularization term in the loss function results in an improvement of generalization gap of one order of magnitude, when compared to the non-regularized architecture. The ensemble architecture is robust to noise and is able to avoid overfitting even when large amounts of noise are present in the data (up to 10%). The ability of the ensemble to avoid overfitting is numerically confirmed by the fact that test errors are larger than recovery errors in all of the examples. In fact, while the test error measures the distance of the ensemble prediction from the noisy RHS data, the recovery error measures the distance to the true RHS data, so that the disparity between test and recovery errors means that the ensemble is able to avoid fitting the noise in the data. This robustness to noise is especially an advantage over methods that do not use ensembling such as [ref]26, as can be seen from the examples in Section 4.3. The ensemble architecture is completely data-driven and it is based on weak notion of solution using integration (see formula 3). For this reason, it can be used to reconstruct non-smooth RHS functions (see Example 4.2.1). This is especially an advantage over models that rely on the notion of classical solution like the Splines Method . Since neural networks are universal approximators, we do not need any prior knowledge on the ODE system, in contrast with sparse regression approaches in which a library of candidate functions has to be defined. As shown in Section 4.3.1, direct comparison with polynomial regression and SINDy shows that our model is a better fit when learning from noisy data. Since our method is applied componentwise, it can be used to identify systems of any dimension, which makes it a valuable approach for high-dimensional real-world problems. However, because of the curse of dimensionality, the higher the problem dimension, the larger the amount of data and trainable parameters needed to obtain accurate predictions. We explicitly note that, while our ensemble model is able to reconstruct the RHS function fùëìf with high accuracy even for very noisy data, it is computationally more expensive than the other methods we compared with (splines and multistep methods, polynomial regression and SINDy). This is because of the ensemble nature of the algorithm: in order to generate the target data for the interpolation network, we need to train as many networks as the number of time instants at which we observe the data. Consequently, this algorithm is a good choice for applications where high reconstruction accuracy is need but where the computational cost is not a concern. Future research directions include applying our method to real-world data and generalize it to learn partial differential equations. In contrast with the most common choices of regularization terms found in machine learning literature, in this work we impose a regularization on the network statistical geometric mapping properties, instead of on its parameters. The Lipschitz regularization results, however, in an implicit constraint on the network parameters since the minimization of the loss function is done with respect to such parameters. An interesting future direction is to theoretically study the Lipschitz regularization term, how it relates to the size of the weights of the network, in line with Bartlett work about generalization [ref]2, and express it as an explicit constraint on the network learnable parameters. In this way one could avoid approximating the Lipschitz constant of the network numerically. This would decrease considerably the computational cost of the algorithm which, as explained, is one limitation of the proposed method.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: and Oberman  and with the empirical findings of our previous paper .
