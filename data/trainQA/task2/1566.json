      "content": "Paper Title: Generative deep learning for decision making in gas networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the intersection of MILP and ML is currently an area of active and growing research. For a thorough overview of Deep Learning (DL), the relevant subset of ML used throughout this article, we refer readers to , and for MILP to . We will highlight previous research from this intersection that we believe is either tangential, or may have shared applications to that presented in this paper. Additionally, we will briefly detail the state-of-the-art in transient gas transport, and highlight why our design is of practical importance. It should be noted as-well, that there are recent research activities aiming at the reverse direction, with MILP applied to ML instead of the orientation we consider, see  for an interesting example. Firstly, we summarise applications of ML to adjacent areas of the MILP solving process. 6 creates a method for encoding MILP structure in a bipartite graph representing variable-constraint relationships. This structure is the input to a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN), which imitates strong branching decisions. The strength of their results stem from intelligent network design and the generalisation of their GCNN to problems of a larger size, albeit with some generalisation loss.  take a different approach, and use a NN design that incorporates the branch-and-bound tree state directly. In doing so, they show that information contained in the global branch-and-bound tree state is an important factor in variable selection. Furthermore, they are one of the few publications to present techniques on heterogeneous instances. 2 show a successful implementation of reinforcement learning for variable selection.  show preliminary results of how reinforcement learning can be used in cutting-plane selection. By restricting themselves exclusively to Gomory cuts, they are able to produce an agent capable of selecting better cuts than default solver settings for specific classes of problems. There exists a continuous trade-off between model exactness and complexity in the field of transient gas optimisation, and as such, there is no standard model for transient gas transportation problems.  presents a piece-wise linear MILP approach to the transient gas transportation problem, [ref]8 a non-linear approach with a novel discretisation scheme, and  and  a linearised approach. For the purpose of our experiments, we use the model of , which uses linearised equations and focuses on active element heavy subnetworks. The current research of ML in gas transport is still preliminary.  use a dual NN design to perform online calculations of a compressors operating point to avoid re-solving the underlying model. The approach constraints itself to continuous variables and experimental results are presented for a gunbarrel type network.  present a NN combined with a genetic algorithm for learning the relationship between compressor speeds and the fuel consumption rate in the absence of complete data.\nMore often ML has been used in fields closely related to gas transport, as in , with ML used to track the degradation of compressor performance, and in  to forecast demand values at the boundaries of the network. For a more complete overview of the transient gas literature, we refer readers to . Our Discriminator design, which predicts the optimal objective value of an induced sub-MILP, can be considered similar to  in what it predicts and similar to 4 in how it works. In the first paper , a neural network is used to predict the associated objective value improvements on cuts. This is a smaller scope than our prediction, but is still heavily concerned with the MILP formulation. In the second paper 4, a technique is developed that performs backward passes directly through a MILP. It does this by solving MILPs exclusively with cutting planes, and then receiving gradient information from the KKT conditions of the final linear program. This application of a neural network, which produces input to the MILP, is very similar to our design. The differences arise in that we rely on a NN Discriminator to appropriately distribute the loss instead of solving a MILP directly, and that we generate variable values instead of parameter values with our Generator. While our discriminator design is heavily inspired from GANs 7, it is also similar to actor-critic algorithms, see 6. These algorithms have shown success for variable generation in MILP, and are notably different in that they sample from a generated distribution for down-stream decisions instead of always taking the decision with highest probability. Recently,  generated a series of coordinates for a set of UAVs using an actor-critic based algorithm, where these coordinates were continuous variables in a MINLP formulation. The independence of separable sub-problems and the easily realisable value function within their formulation resulted in a natural Markov Decision Process interpretation. For a better comparison on the similarities between actor-critic algorithms and GANs, we refer readers to 6. Finally, we summarise existing research that also deals with the generation of decision variable values for MIPs.   attempt to learn optimal solutions of parametric MILPs and MIQPs, which involves both outputting all integer decision variable values and the active set of constraints. They mainly use Optimal Classification Trees in  and NNs in . Their aim is tailored towards smaller problems classes, where speed is an absolute priority and parameter value changes are limited.  learn binary warm start decisions for MIQPs. They use NNs with a loss function that combines binary cross entropy and a penalty for infeasibility. Their goal of a primal heuristic is similar to ours, and while their design is much simpler, it has been shown to work effectively on very small problems. Our improvement over this design is our non-reliance on labelled optimal solutions which are needed for binary cross entropy. 1 present a GCNN design which is an extension of 6, and use it to generate binary decision variable values. Their contributions are a tripartite graph encoding of MILP instances, and the inclusion of their aggregated generated values as branching decisions in the branch-and-bound tree, both in an exact approach and in an approximate approach with local branching 5. Very recently, 2 combined the branching approach of 6 with a novel neural diving approach, in which integer variable values are generated. They use a GCNN both for generating branching decisions and integer variables values. Different to our generator-discriminator based approach, they generate values directly from a learned distribution, which is based on an energy function that incorporates resulting objective values.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: gas optimisation, and as such, there is no standard model for transient gas transportation problems.  presents a piece-wise linear MILP approach to the transient gas transportation problem, [ref]8 a non-linear approach with a novel discretisation scheme, and  and  a linearised approach.
