      "content": "Paper Title: Exploiting Counter-Examples for Active Learning with Partial labels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe community of artificial intelligence has witnessed great progress owing to deep learning, whose success heavily relies on the quality and volume of accurately annotated datasets. To ease the pressure of such costing labeling work, numerous researchers have been investigating active learning (AL) , which aims to achieve as high-performance gain as possible by labeling as few samples as possible. A popular setting in AL is pool-based AL , where a fixed number of samples selected by a selector are sent to an oracle for labeling iteratively until the exhaustion of the sampling budget. Pool-based AL has a wide range of applications, including but not limited to semantic segmentation  and object detection [ref]3. Most existing pool-based AL frameworks   [ref]6 [ref]7   assume that the oracle is perfect, i.e., the oracle always provides accurate labels for selected samples. However, due to inherent label ambiguity and noise, we cannot expect such a “perfect” oracle to exist in real-world applications 0. Let us consider a birdsong classification problem 1. The\nsongs of different bird species are usually recorded simultaneously in one field-collected recording. Thus, it would be difficult for experts to localize each specie to the corresponding\nspectrogram simply by virtue of this recording. To apply AL in a more practical way, we turn to a new type of imperfect oracle, which would provide the selected samples with a special but prevailing form of the weak label, i.e., partial label. A partial label of an instance, essentially a set of candidate labels that includes the true label, is intuitively adaptable to various real-world tasks, including image retrieval 2 and face recognition 3. With the full potential of partial labels seen in these real-world scenarios, partial-label learning (PLL), has naturally emerged and boomed in the community 4 5 6 7. Motivated by the industrial and academic value of PLL, we propose a new setting for AL, i.e., active learning with partial labels (ALPL). Formally, ALPL is built on a pool-based AL learning problem but with only one imperfect oracle that assigns partial labels to samples. Figure 1 illustrates the pipelines of AL and ALPL. Compared with AL, the oracle in ALPL shall provide noise-tolerant partial labels instead of the exact true label when annotating confusing objects, highly improving the labeling efficiency while easing the annotation pressure of the oracle. To address ALPL, we first focus on building a group of promising baselines by adopting the RC loss 8, as one of the state-of-the-art milestones in PLL 9 0 6 7, to train the predictor with the given partial labels from the oracle.\nBy doing so, we are able to establish a robust baseline for ALPL that can be seamlessly integrated into various pool-based AL frameworks. Though encouraging and effective, ALPL with RC loss, similar to all AL frameworks, confronts the inevitable overfitting challenge 1 2 3 during the training process with simply few annotated samples provided. Besides, this simple baseline also falls short of the selection of the representative samples with partial labels during the query process. To move toward better prediction, we turn to an interesting concept from cognitive science named counter-examples (CEs). According to the mental models in cognitive science 4 5 6, humans are able to assess the deductive validity of inference with the help of CEs, leading to drawing an accurate conclusion.\nInspired by such an adversarial working mechanism, we aim to excavate useful knowledge from CEs to address ALPL by guiding the predictor to deduce in an explicit way.\nFirstly, we construct CEs for the predictor\nby directly reversing their partial labels to the inverse version.\nBuilding upon the proposed CEs, we propose a simple but effective WorseNet to learn in a way complementary to the predictor. To this end, we propose Worse loss, which contains the\ninverse RC (IRC) loss and the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) regularization, to guide WorseNet to learn from the inverse partial labels from CEs. Figure 2 illustrates the overall framework. Compared with the predictor, WorseNet would possess lower confidence toward the labels inside the partial label. Based on the complementary learning pattern between WorseNet and the predictor, we propose to take advantage of the predicted probability gap between these two networks to separately improve the evaluating and selecting process (shown in Figure 2). To improve the predicting accuracy, we treat the class with the maximum distribution gap, rather than the maximum predictor score, as the predicted true label during the evaluation. On the other hand, we propose to enhance the sample selector by focusing solely on labels with positive probability gaps, as these labels predominantly cover the true label. This narrows down the range for calculating the uncertainty score, thereby refining the selection process and reducing uncertainty. Consequently, we propose three new selectors in ALPL by adopting this selecting strategy. Experimental results on benchmark-simulated and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed WorseNet in improving both the selector and the predictor in ALPL. Our main contributions are summarized here: We for the first time propose a practical setting, i.e., active learning with partial labels (ALPL), to economically facilitate the annotation process for the experts. In this way, we provide a solid baseline on top of any AL approach to address ALPL. We turn to exploring and exploiting the learning pattern from counter-examples (CEs), and propose a simple but effective WorseNet to explicitly improve the predictor and the selector in ALPL in a complementary manner. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets and five real-world datasets show that our proposed WorseNet achieves promising performance elation over compared baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in ALPL.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: oracle for labeling iteratively until the exhaustion of the sampling budget.
