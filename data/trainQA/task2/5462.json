Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

Specifically, we consider continuous control MuJoCo benchmarks¬†[ref]17, higher-dimensional tasks in the DeepMind Control Suite (DMControl)¬†, as well as Atari video games¬†[ref]19.\nWe provide an overview of the control complexity in terms of state-action dimensions in Table¬†II.\nFor continuous control tasks, we use Gaussian distribution for the policy whose mean and covariance are parameterized by neural networks.\nFor discrete Atari domains, we use the same policy network architecture as used in .\nWe evaluate SD-TRPO, SD-PPO, and SD-ESPO by comparing them with baseline counterparts, i.e., TRPO, PPO, and ESPO.\nFollowing a common practice in [ref]11 , we normalize observations, rewards and advantages for all algorithms.\nGiven the concerns in reproducibility¬†0, we run all experiments across a large number of random seeds (10 random seeds) and report the mean and standard deviation of training curves.\nOur code is built upon the OpenAI baselines¬†. We provide the implementation details and all hyperparameter settings. Table¬†III presents hyperparameters of TRPO and SD-TRPO. Note that the main difference between TRPO and SD-TRPO is the additional hyperparameter threshold of KL divergence (i.e., œÅùúå\\rho) used in the KL-based dropout indicator. For TRPO and SD-TRPO, the epoch number KùêæK in Algorithm¬†1 is set to 1 and the sampling number LùêøL is set to NùëÅN.\nTable¬†IV shows hyperparameters of PPO and SD-PPO, where SD-PPO involves an additional hyperparameter Œ¥ùõø\\delta representing the threshold of ratio deviation.\nTable¬†V shows hyperparameters of ESPO and SD-ESPO. SD-ESPO also involves an extra hyperparameter Œ¥ùõø\\delta compared to ESPO.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: We conduct experiments using environments that have been widely used in prior works [ref]11 .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
