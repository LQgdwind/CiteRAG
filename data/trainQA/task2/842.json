      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Competitive Self-Play Policy Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReinforcement learning trains a single agent to maximize the expected return through interacting with an environment . Multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL), where two-agent is a special case, concerns multiple agents taking actions in the same environment . Self-play is a training paradigm to generate data for learning in MARL and has led to great successes, achieving superhuman performance in many domains   [ref]9. Applying RL algorithms naively as independent learners in MARL sometimes produces strong agents , but often does not converge to the equilibrium. People have studied ways to extend RL algorithms to MARL, e.g., minimax-Q , Nash-Q , WoLF-PG , etc. However, most of these methods are designed for tabular RL only therefore not readily applicable to continuous state action spaces and complex policy functions where gradient-based policy optimization methods are preferred. Very recently, there is some work on the non-asymptotic regret analysis of tabular self-play RL . While our work roots from a practical sense, these work enrich the theoretical understanding and complement ours. There are algorithms developed from the game theory and online learning perspective   , notably Tree search, Fictitious self-play 8 and Regret minimization  7, and Mirror descent  . Tree search such as minimax and alpha-beta pruning is particularly effective in small-state games. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is also effective in Go . However, Tree search requires learners to know the exact game dynamics.\nThe latter ones typically require maintaining some historical quantities. In Fictitious play, the learner best responds to a historical average opponent, and the average strategy converges. Similarly, the total historical regrets in all (information) states are maintained in (counterfactual) regret minimization 7. The extragradient rule in  is a special case of the adversarial perturbation we rely on in this paper. Most of those algorithms are designed only for discrete state action environments. Special care has to be taken with neural net function approximators . On the contrary, our method enjoys last-iterate convergence under proper convex-concave assumptions, does not require the complicated computation of averaging neural nets, and is readily applicable to continuous environments through policy optimization. In two-player zero-sum games, the Nash equilibrium coincides with the saddle point. This enables the techniques developed for finding saddle points. While some saddle-point methods also rely on time averages 6, a class of perturbation-based gradient method is known to converge under mild convex-concave assumption for deterministic functions 5 4 [ref]33.\nWe develop an efficient sampling version of them for stochastic RL objectives, which leads to a more principled and effective way of choosing opponents in self-play. Our adversarial opponent-selection rule bears a resemblance to [ref]34. However, the motivation of our work (and so is our algorithm) is to improve self-play RL, while [ref]34 aims at attacking deep self-play RL policies.\nThough the algorithm presented here builds upon policy gradient, the same framework may be extended to other RL algorithms such as MCTS due to a recent interpretation of MCTS as policy optimization . Finally, our way of leveraging Eq.Â 1 in a population may potentially work beyond gradient-based RL, e.g., in training generative adversarial networks similarly to [ref]33 because of the same minimax formulation.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: taking actions in the same environment .
