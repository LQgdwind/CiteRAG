First, the dynamic memory capacity demand is difficult to predict in the short, medium, and long term. As a result, memory capacity is usually over-provisioned     , which wastes resources and energy. Second, workloads are limited to using the memory available in the local server (even though other servers might have unused memory), which could cause memory-intensive workloads to slow down. Third, memory maintenance might cause availability issues ; in case a memory module fails, all running applications on the node may have to be interrupted to replace the faulty module. A promising solution to overcome these issues is to disaggregate the main memory from the computing cores [ref]35. As depicted in Figure 1, the key idea is to organize and cluster the memory resources such that they are individually addressable and accessible from any processor in the data center . Memory disaggregation provides flexibility in memory allocation, improved utilization of the memory resources, lower maintenance costs, and lower energy consumption in the data center . Disaggregating memory and processors remains a challenge, although the disaggregation of some resources (e.g., storage) is common in production data centers . Electrical interconnections in rack-distances do not fulfill the low latency and high bandwidth requirements of modern DRAM modules. The primary limitation of an electrical interconnect is that it constrains the memory bus to onboard distance  because the electrical wire’s signal integrity loss increases at higher frequencies. This loss dramatically reduces the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when distances are large. An optical interconnect is more appealing than an electrical interconnect for memory disaggregation due to three properties: its (1) high bandwidth density significantly reduces the number of IO lanes, (2) power consumption and crosstalk do not increase with distance, and (3) propagation loss is low. Silicon Photonic (SiP) devices are likely suitable for disaggregation, delivering ≥\\geq Gbps range bandwidth, as well as efficient and versatile switching . The goal of this work is to pave the way for designing high-performance optical memory channels (i.e., the optical equivalent of an electrical memory channel) that enable main memory disaggregation in data centers.\nOur work provides an optical link design for DDR DRAM memory disaggregation, and it defines its physical characteristics, i.e., i) number of Micro-Ring Resonator (MRR) devices, ii) bandwidth per wavelength, iii) energy-per-bit, and iv) area. We evaluate the performance (see Section IV-A) and energy consumption (see Section IV-B) of a system with disaggregated commodity DDR DRAM modules. We make three key contributions: (1) we propose the Optically Connected Memory (OCM) architecture for memory disaggregation in data centers based on state-of-the-art photonic devices, (2) we perform the first evaluation of the energy-per-bit consumption of a SiP link using the bandwidth requirements of current DDR DRAM standards, and (3) we model and evaluate OCM in a system-level simulator and show that it performs up to 5.5x faster than a 40G NIC-based disaggregated memory.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: running applications on the node may have to be interrupted to replace the faulty module.
