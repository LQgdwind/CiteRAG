      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to schedule job-shop problems: Representation and policy learning using graph neural network and reinforcement learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere has been some research on developing RL-based schedulers for JSSPs [ref]4   . However, only few of them, such as multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)  and multi-class DQN (MDQN) , have shown that the trained RL-based scheduler can be used to schedule new JSSP instances. The details of these transferability tests found in the literature are summarized in Table¬†2. Two MARL schedulers were trained with 5√ó\\times15 and 10√ó\\times10 instances and tested on LA06-10 and ORB01-10 instances, respectively [ref]22 . The MDQN scheduler was trained with 15√ó\\times20 instances and tested on DMU01-05 and DMU41-45 instances . We compared the scheduling performance of the proposed GNN scheduler with those of the RL-based schedulers. Note that the training and test data sets had the same sizes of machines and jobs. Therefore, only a limited generalization test could be conducted for the case where the conjunctive constraints and processing times are different from the training and test data sets. To mimic the experimental procedures reported in  and , we trained the three GNN schedulers (GNN1subscriptGNN1\\mathrm{GNN}_{1}, GNN2subscriptGNN2\\mathrm{GNN}_{2}, and GNN3subscriptGNN3\\mathrm{GNN}_{3}) with the training JSSP instances with sizes 5√ó\\times15, 10√ó\\times10 and 15√ó\\times20, respectively. We then employed the three trained GNN schedulers on the test data set shown in Table¬†2. Furthermore, to investigate the generalization performance of the proposed method, we employed the GNN scheduler that was used for the previous experiment, GNN0subscriptGNN0\\mathrm{GNN}_{0}, to test the JSSP instances listed in Table¬†2. Figure¬†7 shows that the proposed schedulers (GNN1subscriptGNN1\\mathrm{GNN}_{1}, GNN2subscriptGNN2\\mathrm{GNN}_{2}, and GNN3subscriptGNN3\\mathrm{GNN}_{3}) gave the lowest errors for each test data set when the training and test data sets contained JSSP instances whose sizes were the same but whose processing times and order distributions were different. In particular, the GNN schedulers performed significantly better than the other learning models. Also, GNN0subscriptGNN0\\mathrm{GNN}_{0} trained with random JSSPs whose generating distributions were different from the test data set was still able to schedule all test JSSPs with slightly increased error compared with GNN1subscriptGNN1\\mathrm{GNN}_{1}, GNN2subscriptGNN2\\mathrm{GNN}_{2}, and GNN3subscriptGNN3\\mathrm{GNN}_{3}.\nBased on the observation that the performance gaps between GNN0subscriptGNN0\\mathrm{GNN}_{0} and GNNisubscriptGNNùëñ\\mathrm{GNN}_{i} (i‚àà1,2,3ùëñ123i\\in{1,2,3}) are small, we can conclude that the node embedding scheme learned from small sized JSSPs can be generalized to solve large-sized JSSPs. This property is indeed desirable in that the GNN scheduler trained on a set of small JSSP instances can be directly used to schedule large JSSP instances that are impossible to solve with conventional models.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: There has been some research on developing RL-based schedulers for JSSPs [ref]4   .
