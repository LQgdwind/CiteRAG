Due to the various advantages of satellite communication, including scalability, high bandwidth capabilities, and the ability to reach remote and underserved areas, it plays a crucial role in various applications such as telecommunication services, broadcasting, navigation systems, and weather monitoring. In recent years, a number of ambitious satellite projects are underway, reshaping the future landscape of communication. SpaceX is one of the most notable participants in this arena , the companyâ€™s Starlink project aims to establish a satellite network to provide communication services globally, especially in remote areas. Another key player is OneWeb , which seeks to construct a satellite constellation to provide enhanced broadband connectivity worldwide. In addition, satellite initiatives like those from SES Networks (formerly known as O3b) and Telesat  are also advancing, with their objective being to offer high-speed and low-latency internet access services with global coverage. Hence, it is evident that satellite communication has become an integral part of future communication systems. To explore the benefits of integrating satellite communication, many recent studies have investigated its implementation across various domains such as the Internet of Things (IoT) , cognitive communications  and edge computing [ref]7. Moreover, considering the stringent requirements of the fifth-generation (5G) and sixth-generation (6G) in terms of communication latency and spectral efficiency, integrating terrestrial wireless networks with low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites has emerged as a highly promising solution in wireless communications  [ref]9. To analyze the performance in LEO satellite communications, a user grouping method was designed to enhance the communication rate in massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems 0. In 1, a deep learning-based algorithm was proposed to improve the drain efficiency in LEO satellite communications. To reduce the error in channel estimation of LEO satellite communications, a deep learning-based approach was designed to extract the channel features and output predictions in massive MIMO satellite communications 2. In 3, collaborative LEO satellites were introduced to realize secure and green transmissions in IoT. Recently, the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) has gained significant attention as an advanced communication framework that seamlessly integrates satellites, high-altitude platforms (HAPs), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground-based networks, providing improved connectivity and enhanced communication capabilities 4. Satellites play a vital role in SAGINs by providing ubiquitous global coverage, ensuring communication accessibility even in remote and underserved regions. HAPs and UAVs offer unparalleled flexibility, mobility, and rapid deployment capabilities. Ground-based networks serve as a robust backbone, providing localized connectivity and essential infrastructure support. Through the integration of these components, SAGIN enables efficient and reliable communication across diverse domains, including target localization 5, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) 6, cognitive communications 7 and IoT networks 8. The authors in 5 investigated ocean target localization in SAGIN with multi-UAV cooperative assistance. To enhance the average data to overhead ratio, UAVs were utilized in SAGIN to improve the transmission quality for the IoV 6. A learning-based UAV trajectory and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) phase shift design was proposed to enhance the secrecy performance in UAV-RIS enabled cognitive SAGIN networks 7. In 8, UAVs were adopted to enhance the wireless power transmission in the SAGIN-IoT. This integration of space-air-ground resources unlocks unprecedented potential for advanced communication systems in a wide range of environments. On the other hand, multi-access edge computing (MEC) is a revolutionary concept in mobile communications that aims to meet the increasing demand for low-latency and high-bandwidth applications and services 9. It achieves this by shifting computational tasks from the cloud to the network edge, thereby bringing computing resources closer to mobile devices. Various MEC frameworks have been studied in current works 0 1 2. In 0, a convex optimization-based method was proposed to reduce the energy consumption in MEC frameworks. To reduce the latency in MEC, the authors of 1 applied non-convex optimization algorithms to MEC networks. In 2, an alternative optimization (AO)-based algorithm was proposed to minimize the latency of MEC in millimeter-wave communications.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: satellite communication, many recent studies have investigated its implementation across various domains such as the Internet of Things (IoT) , cognitive communications  and edge computing [ref]7.
