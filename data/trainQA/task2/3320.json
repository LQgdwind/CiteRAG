      "content": "Paper Title: Automatic Sparse Connectivity Learning for Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDESPITE the great success in improving neural networks and learning systems      , state-of-the-art deep neural networks usually consist of dozens of stacked layers and a huge number of parameters. It is difficult to deploy these over-parameterized and over-redundant neural networks on resource-constrained computing platforms [ref]7. To address this challenge, network pruning has received great attention. Network pruning tends to remove unimportant trainable parameters in a neural network architecture while maintaining its high accuracy. Effective network pruning leads to less computing operations, memory usage, and power consumption with little performance degeneration. After performing network pruning, sparse models are often implemented in hardware (e.g., GPUs, ASICs111https://www.kneron.com/solutions/soc/ or FPGAs222https://www.xilinx.com/applications/megatrends/machine-learning.html) for AI acceleration. Network pruning can be divided into two categories: human-designed pruning and automatic pruning. The former requires some pruning criteria or hyper-parameters defined by designers (e.g., importance measure or pruning threshold), while automatic pruning generates optimized sparse networks with little human intervention. Human-designed pruning usually consists of three steps: (1) training weight parameters in a selected baseline neural network, (2) eliminating unimportant network connections based on designer-defined criteria or hyper-parameters, and (3) training weight parameters again in this pruned network architecture. Human-designed network pruning can be further divided into two types: unstructured [ref]7   0 1 2 3 or structured 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6. It has been reported that performing unstructured pruning on deep neural networks does not cause much loss of accuracy. On the other hand, structured pruning especially filter 4 5 6 7 8 9 and channel 0 1 2 3 4 pruning, has been used to accelerate neural networks in general hardware platforms (i.e., GPUs). Since zero-masked feature maps can be deleted, less computational cost is required after network pruning. Note that some existing neural networks with multi-branch or multi-group structures may be considered as human-designed sparse architectures (e.g., Inception , ShuffleNet 7, MobileNet 8, ResNeXt 9), even though these sparse architectures do not involve network pruning. Up to date, three major bottlenecks have hindered the use of human-designed pruning methods to generate sparse networks. First, although human-designed pruning can provide good network performance under a low pruning rate, the network performance under a high pruning rate is severely degraded. Second, there is a lack of appropriate methods to effectively prune network connections for high-compression and high-performance neural networks. In most human-designed pruning methods, network connections are pruned based on the assumption of ‚Äúsmaller-norm-less-important‚Äù. Network connections with smaller weights are generally considered trivial and eliminated during network pruning. However, researchers have found that sometimes the amount of information in smaller weights is important and cannot be ignored 0. Therefore, considering the variability of loss function sensitivity with respect to different weights, eliminating network connections with smaller weights does not guarantee a slight decrease in network performance. Third, the biggest weakness is the need for designer-defined pruning criteria (e.g., L1subscriptùêø1L_{1} [ref]7 or L2subscriptùêø2L_{2} 6 norm of filters) and hyper-parameters (e.g., pruning threshold or ratio) for each network layer during network pruning. Because the selection of pruning criteria or hyper-parameters is manually determined, it heavily depends on the designer‚Äôs prior experience and varies from application to application. Consequently, since the pruning criteria and hyper-parameters are not guaranteed to be the best choice, the resulting network connectivity and performance are not optimal. Note that even though weight importance estimation methods have been proposed in 1 2, layer-wise hyper-parameters are still needed to determine a pruning threshold or ratio for all layers during network pruning. Unfortunately, as the optimal pruning threshold or ratio varies with local network structures, the use of only one hyper-parameter for all layers leads to inferior pruning performance. Recently, it is proposed that a proper criterion may be selected from a set of designer-defined criteria to learn pruning criteria for each network layer 3. Yet, the pruning performance of this method still depends on the quality of candidate criteria defined by designers. To get rid of shortcomings of human-designed pruning, researchers have investigated automatic pruning, which trains sparse network connectivity through task-aware loss or a sparse regularization term 4 5 6 7 8. Note automatic pruning does not require designer-defined pruning criteria or layer-wise hyper-parameters.\nLouizos et al.4 train sparse neural networks through L0subscriptùêø0L_{0}-norm regularization. They use the Gumbel-Softmax trick 9 0 (also known as a concrete distribution) and apply gates to weights for connectivity training. Note a stochastic gate produces zero connectivity only when the probability is zero, which is almost impossible to reach during network training. To address this problem, threshold operation is applied on gates to made zero connectivity. The drawback of 4 is that the expected L0subscriptùêø0L_{0}-norm of stochastic training does not reflect the L0subscriptùêø0L_{0}-norm of deterministic inference. Therefore, as will be discussed in Section V-D3, although the expected L0subscriptùêø0L_{0} norm of weights is significantly reduced, it is still not low enough to produce sparse connections. Kang et al.5 propose soft channel pruning (SCP), which assumes that feature maps follow a Gaussian distribution and features are pruned if the cumulative density function is larger than a certain threshold. The Gumbel-Softmax trick is used to tackle the non-differentiable Bernoulli distribution sampling. Unfortunately, the assumption of Gaussian distribution for feature maps is too strict to derive accurate gradients. Moreover, SCP shows good pruning performance in network layers that are followed by both batch normalization (BN) and ReLU. According to evaluation results in 5, its pruning performance is severely degraded if only BN exists. Since many neural networks do not include both BN and ReLU, the application scope of SCP is limited. Herrmann et al.6 jointly consider conditional computation and network pruning. The Gumbel-Softmax trick is used to relax the discrete masks to a continuous form. The researchers focus on dynamic inference using conditional computation. Depending on network inputs, masks are dynamically applied on channels. Unfortunately, these masks are data-dependent rather than being fixed, and the dynamically pruned structures are not friendly to hardware implementation. Huang et al.7 introduce a series of non-negative scaling factors that are associated with neural network connectivity. To encourage sparse network connectivity, these scaling factors are penalized by an L1subscriptùêø1L_{1}-norm regularization term. During the training process, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and a proposed stochastic Accelerated Proximal Gradient (APG) are used to train weight parameters and scaling factor parameters, respectively. The scaling factor parameters are converted into scaling factors through a soft-threshold operation. Xiao et al.8 utilize STE to relax binary masks. Even though empirical experiments have shown potential, the fundamental principle of using STE in network pruning has not been explored. From the above discussion, it is clear that existing network pruning methods, either human-designed or automatic, do not fully address the requirement of highly effective spare connectivity learning. It is attractive to develop new pruning methods to overcome the drawbacks and limitations of existing pruning methods. In this work, we propose a new automatic network pruning technique - sparse connectivity learning (SCL). This work makes the following contributions: We theoretically prove the fundamental principle of using STE for network pruning. After finding Leaky ReLU, Softplus, and Identity STEs can satisfy this principle, we propose to adopt Identity STE in SCL for discrete mask relaxation. Thus, SCL guarantees the convergence of mask variables at their minima. We observe that mask gradients on different features have a wide range of magnitudes and hence are unbalanced. Therefore, we propose to normalize mask gradients of each feature to optimize mask variable training. The pruning principle of our proposed SCL method is the significance of weight, instead of the magnitude of weight. SCL can automatically learn and determine critical network connections of baseline networks (e.g., DenseNets, ResNets, VGGs, EfficientNets, and RNNs). SCL enables highly effective weight-level sparsity learning on neural networks under high pruning rates. Experimental results in the MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and WikiText-2 datasets demonstrate the enhanced performance of SCL-induced sparse neural networks than the state-of-the-art network pruning methods in the literature. SCL automatically learns optimized neural network connectivity in a task-aware manner, ensuring that performance-sensitive network connections are ultimately preserved. As it does not need any designer-defined pruning criteria or layer-wise pruning hyper-parameters, SCL gets rid of the limitation of human designers. Compared to the state-of-the-art pruning methods, experimental results demonstrate that SCL results in high-performance neural networks with higher sparsity and fewer FLOPs. Since this work focuses on the algorithm aspect of network pruning, the hardware implementation of spare models generated from our proposed pruning algorithm is beyond the scope of this paper. Sparse neural network models generated from SCL can be implemented in FPGAs or Kneron edge AI hardware products. This paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces related works about pruning criteria and binary mask relaxation. Section III describes the proposed automatic sparse connectivity learning theory. Section IV introduces the baseline network architectures and experimental setups. Section V demonstrates various experimental results and comparisons with the state-of-the-art works in the literature.
