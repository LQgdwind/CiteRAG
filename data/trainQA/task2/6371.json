      "content": "Paper Title: ATLAS: Automatically Detecting Discrepancies Between Privacy Policies and Privacy Labels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) has been a cornerstone in semantically understanding and parsing privacy policies. Automated compliance systems, such as MAPS and ATLAS, require the use of NLP to analyze hundreds of thousands of privacy policies that would otherwise take human annotators years to accomplish. Past research has detailed the effectiveness of using NLP techniques to analyze privacy policies for compliance analysis using high-quality annotator labeled data (i.e. annotations per privacy policy segment) from the APP-350 corpus [ref]26. The authors formulated the identification of privacy practice statements as a classification problem using one classifier per privacy practice. [ref]26. This paper replicates the approach, with several key differences. First, instead of focusing on policy segments, this work formulates identification of data collection as a document classification problem. Second, instead of using annotator labeled data (such as from the APP-350 corpus), we use developer reported iOS privacy labels as ground truth to describe the text of privacy policies. Unlike annotator labeled data, privacy labels may not be consistent with the text of privacy policies because developers struggle to accurately create them  . Finally, we experiment with additional state-of-the-art model architectures for document classification. Document classification is an extensively researched field  2  8. Current state-of-the-art techniques are based on the transformer model (such as BERT and RoBERTa), which sidesteps traditional methods such as recurrence   . However, documents are typically longer than the maximum sequence length allowed by models such as BERT and RoBERTa – 512 tokens. The Longformer model increases input sequence length to 4096 tokens, which is better suited for document classification . However, transformer-based models have large computational overhead. The RegLSTM model was proposed as a lightweight alternative for document classification and has been shown to outperform transformers .\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: of using NLP techniques to analyze privacy policies for compliance analysis using high-quality annotator labeled data (i.e. annotations per privacy policy segment) from the APP-350 corpus [ref]26.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
