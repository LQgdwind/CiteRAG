      "content": "Paper Title: Repo2Vec: A Comprehensive Embedding Approach for Determining Repository Similarity\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEstablishing a way to measure similarity between software repositories is an essential building block for studying the plethora of repositories in online Open Source Software (OSS) platforms.\nThese OSS platforms contain a massive number of repositories and engagement of millions of users [ref]1.\nThere are significant collaborations and code reuses   on these platforms, which are openly supported and encouraged.\nResearchers are interested in studying the dynamics of such repositories, which include the ability to\nidentify: (a) derivative repositories, (b) families of repositories, (c) the evolution of software projects, and (d) coding and technology trends.\nGitHub is arguably the largest such platform with more than 32 million repositories and 34 million users exhibiting significant collaborative interactions . How can we quantify the level of similarity between two repositories?\nThis is the problem that we address here.\nFocusing on GitHub, every repository consists of metadata, source code, and auxiliary files. Given a repository, how can we identify the most similar repositories among a large set?\nThe input here is a large number of repositories and a set of queries. The desired output is: (a) the most similar repositories for a given query repository and (b) clusters of similar repositories. The key challenge here is to represent the repository data into a numeric feature vectors to enable ML approaches to compute the similarities and cluster among repositories. In addition, combining vectors from different types of information, as we will do here, is also a challenge. There are relatively few efforts that focus on establishing similarity between repositories, and most of them use either metadata or source code level information, while none of them\nuse the three types of information that we do here.\nFirst, LibRec , SimApp , Collaborative Tagging , and RepoPal  utilize only metadata to find similarity among repositories.\nSecond, MUDABLUE  and CLAN  are two similarity computation approaches using only source code of repositories as plain text.\nThird, CrossSim   proposes a graph representation to compute similarity between repositories using both metadata and source code.\nWe discuss the related works in more detail in Section VII. As our key contribution,\nwe propose Repo2Vec, an embedding approach to represent software repositories with a multi-dimensional distributed continuous vector which can be used to measure the similarity between repositories.\nWe briefly describe the key features of our approach.\nFirst,\nour method represents a repository as a distributed continuous vector in an embedding space.\nSecond,\nwe consider three types of information: (a) metadata, (b) source code, and (c) the repository directory structure.\nOur approach provides a flexible way to combine these three types\nusing our default values which can be customized to match\nthe niche needs of a savvy user.\nThe significance of our approach is that it\ngenerates a relatively-low dimensional vector\nthat can enable follow up repository analysis.\nSuch follow up studies can leverage the plethora of ML techniques:\nwe provide a proof of concept for two such applications here.\n We deploy our approach and study the similarity on a malware dataset of 433 repositories and a benign dataset of 580 repositories. First, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by comparing it\nagainst state of the art works.\nSecond, we show how our Repo2Vec can enable algorithms for:\n(a) distinguishing between malware and benign repositories, and (b) identifying a meaningful hierarchical clustering. The key results are briefly discussed below.\n a. Repo2Vec outperforms prior works.\nFor this comparison, we select the best approach to date, CrossSim, which has been shown to outperform previous approaches   .\nFor consistency, we also follow their evaluation methodology and use their\ndataset with 580 benign repository.\nWe show that our approach identifies similar repositories with 93% precision compared to 78% as shown in Figure 1.\nFurther, our approach finds nearly twice as many strongly similar repositories and 30% fewer False Positives, as we see in Figure 6. b. Metadata and structure provide significant performance. We assess the information contribution of three types of information. Interestingly, we can identify similarity fairly well without the use of source code as shown in Figure 1.\nUsing only metadata and structure leads to a 76% precision, which is comparable to the previous best method, which uses source code. c. Application: identifying malware repositories accurately.\nWe show that our approach can enable a supervised classification approach.\nWe focus on distinguishing malware from benign repositories, which is\na practical problem [ref]13.\nUsing our embedding,\nwe can identify malware repositories with 98% precision and 97% recall, which outperforms the previous approaches. d. Application: identifying a meaningful hierarchy.\nWe show that our approach can form the basis for\na meaningful (unsupervised)\nhierarchical clustering of repositories. We show that\nthe emerging structure aligns with their purpose and lineage.\nIn our evaluation, we focus at two levels of granularity: a coarse and a fine level with 3 and 26 clusters respectively.\nUsing an LDA-based topic extraction method,\nwe find that the clusters are cohesive:\nmore than 80% of the repositories per cluster have the same focus.\nWe discuss the clustering in Section V. Our work in perspective.\nOur approach can be seen as\na first step towards the use of embedding approaches in repository analysis. In fact, it can be seen as a general framework where the selection of individual features can be driven by the intention of the application. For example,\none can focus on different primary features depending on whether we want to identify: (a) plagiarism or function level similarity,\n(b) programming styles, or (c) software intention.\nWe intend to share our method and our dataset to facilitate follow up research in this direction.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: block for studying the plethora of repositories in online Open Source Software (OSS) platforms.\nThese OSS platforms contain a massive number of repositories and engagement of millions of users [ref]1.\nThere are significant collaborations and code reuses   on these platforms, which are openly supported and encouraged.\nResearchers are interested in studying the dynamics of such repositories,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
