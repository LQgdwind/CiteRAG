      "content": "Paper Title: Gradient Masking and the Underestimated Robustness Threats of Differential Privacy in Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper, the intersection of privacy and security in DNNs is investigated.\nMore specifically, the impact of using a state-of-the-art training method to increase ML models‚Äô privacy levels, namely the DP-SGD optimizer, on model robustness is examined.\nPrevious work suggests that using this optimizer with certain parameters might have positive effects on the robustness of the trained DNNs [ref]20.\nThe experiments of this work show that this first indication of increased robustness may be due to masked gradients.\nTo validate this hypothesis, extensive experiments using two model architectures and four attack methods were conducted.\nAs can be seen in previous guidelines on the evaluation of adversarial robustness  , the selection of used attack methods heavily influences the perception of robustness.\nTherefore, in the following, the experimental setup used to shed more light on the robustness of privately trained DNNs is summarized. The experiments in this paper were conducted using the MNIST dataset  consisting of 60000 train and 10000 test gray-scale images of size 28 √ó 28 pixel. Two different model architectures were evaluated: an adaptation of the LeNet architecture  (1), and a custom conv-net architecture (2), both depicted in Table I.\nThe networks were implemented using TensorFlow  version 2.4.1 and trained for 50 epochs using a learning rate of 0.05, and a batch size of 250.\nStochastic gradient descent and TensorFlow Privacy‚Äôs [ref]37 implementation of the DP-SGD were used as optimizers to train the models without and with privacy, respectively.\nThe privacy parameters œÉùúé\\sigma and Cùê∂C of the DP-SGD were specified during the experiments.\nIn accordance to [ref]20 the value ranges were œÉ‚àà{0,1.3,2,3}ùúé01.323\\sigma\\in\\{0,1.3,2,3\\} and C‚àà{1,3,5,10}ùê∂13510C\\in\\{1,3,5,10\\}. The adversarial examples were generated using the Foolbox framework [ref]38.\nAs shown in Section¬†II-D PGD‚àû, CW2, and BA2 were used as examples of a multi-step gradient-based, multi-step optimization-based, and a multi-step gradient-free attack, respectively.\nFor every experiment, 1000 adversarial examples were generated based on 1000 random test data points that were predicted correctly by the model under attack.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: the DP-SGD optimizer, on model robustness is examined.\nPrevious work suggests that using this optimizer with certain parameters might have positive effects on the robustness of the trained DNNs [ref]20.\nThe experiments of this work show that this first indication of increased robustness may be due to masked gradients.\nTo validate this hypothesis, extensive experiments using two model\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
