      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Feature Learning with Emergent Data-Driven Prototypicality\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPrototypicality. The study of prototypical examples in machine learning has a long history. In , the authors select typical instances based on the fact that typical instances should be representative of the cluster. In , prototypical examples are defined as the examples that have maximum mean discrepancy within the data. Li et al. [ref]26 propose to discover prototypical examples by architectural modifications: project the dataset onto a low-dimensional manifold and use a prototype layer to minimize the distance between inputs and the prototypes on the manifold. The robustness to adversarial attacks is also used as a criterion for prototypicality¬†. In [ref]5, the authors propose multiple metrics for prototypicality¬†discovery. For example, the features of prototypical examples should be consistent across different training setups. However, these metrics usually depend heavily on the training setups and hyperparameters. The idea of prototypicality¬†is also extensively studied in meta-learning for one-shot or few-shot classification . No existing works address the prototypicality¬†discovery problem in a data-driven fashion. Our proposed HACK naturally exploits hyperbolic space to organize the images based on prototypicality. Unsupervised Learning in Hyperbolic Space. Learning features in hyperbolic space have shown to be useful for many machine learning problems [ref]34   . One useful property is that hierarchical relations can be embedded in hyperbolic space with low distortion [ref]34. Wrapped normal distribution, which is a generalized version of the normal distribution for modeling the distribution of points in hyperbolic space , is used as the latent space for constructing hyperbolic variational autoencoders (VAEs) . Poincar√© VAEs is constructed in  with a similar idea to  by replacing the standard normal distribution with hyperbolic normal distribution. Unsupervised 3D segmentation  and instance segmentation  are conducted in hyperbolic space via hierarchical hyperbolic triplet loss. CO-SNE  is recently proposed to visualize high-dimensional hyperbolic features in a two-dimensional hyperbolic space. Although hyperbolic distance facilitates the learning of hierarchical structure, how to leverage hyperbolic space for unsupervised prototypicality¬†discovery is not explored in the current literature. Sphere Packing. Sphere packing aims to pack a set of particles as densely as possible in space . It can be served as a toy model for granular materials and has applications in information theory  to find error-correcting codes . Sphere packing is difficult due to multiple local minima, the curse of high dimensionality, and complicated geometrical configurations. Packing in hyperbolic space is also studied in the literature. It is given in  a universal upper bound for the density of sphere packing in an nùëõn-dimensional hyperbolic space when nùëõn ‚â•\\geq 2. We are interested in generating uniform packing in a two-dimensional hyperbolic space. Uniformity has been shown to be a useful criterion for learning good features on the hypersphere 2. We opt to find the configuration with an optimization procedure that is easily applicable even with thousands of particles.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: based on the fact that typical instances should be representative of the cluster.
