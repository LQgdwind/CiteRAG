      "content": "Paper Title: Adversarial Robustness of Neural-Statistical Features in Detection of Generative Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGenerative text models capable of producing human-like text are a rapidly developing area of deep neural network development. The release of Generative Pretrained Transformer 2 (GPT-2)  – a model capable of high-quality unsupervised text generation – was accompanied from the beginning by concerns that the model might be abused for malicious purposes. This resulted in a careful release schedule, where the largest GPT-2 model, a 1.5 billion parameter variant, was withheld following publication. The paper in which the subsequent GPT-3 model was introduced was not accompanied by an open-source release at all . The model instead is being offered as an API, and has been licensed exclusively to Microsoft [ref]3. While limiting access to models of GPT-3 scale may reduce the scope of abuse in the near term, the widespread availability of the 1.5 billion parameter GPT-2 model (and other implementations of generative pre-trained Transformers with similar scale, such as Grover ) have already opened a number of new attack possibilities. Fine-tuned variants already exist for simulating human comments, such as the GPT-2 Reddit project, which simulates submissions and comment threads at a very large scale [ref]5. Should someone use such a model, and direct its generation through the selection of the correct prompt – potentially with an auxiliary model to perform filtering of generated samples – the result could allow a threat actor to effectively generate enormous volumes of text that mimics regular online discourse while promoting a specific agenda. Such a system is already feasible with widely-available open-source machine learning models today. The likely proliferation of high-capacity generative text models is further increased by the promise shown by model distillation for large Transformer models [ref]6, which allows large neural network models to be distilled into a smaller network with comparable performance. This reduces the hardware requirements and barrier to entry for those attempting to abuse such technologies, and has already been demonstrated successfully with GPT-2 . Furthermore, as companies provide access to APIs that give third-party developers access to massive-scale models, there is increased possibility that some portion of users may abuse the model. Finally, the Transformer architecture  that underpins the current crop of state-of-the-art generative text models is well known, and any well-funded groups with access to sufficient computational power has the ability to recreate a model of similar scale. As such, the threat that these models may be exploited for the purposes of fake news articles, fraudulent reviews, phishing campaigns, and similar is likely to increase over time. With the understanding that technologies for generating human-like text at large scale are not only possible, but are already becoming increasingly accessible, research has increased in the area of developing techniques for detection of text that has been written by a computer. While methods have been developed to improve detection of generative text models, with specific focus specifically on large neural network Transformer models such as GPT-2, there has yet to be an in-depth assessment of the robustness of these models to adversarial attacks. Past research has shown that neural network models have difficult-to-mitigate vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks . Such attacks allow an attacker to force an erroneous result from a neural network model through subtle perturbation of the input. The imagery domain in particular has been the subject of extensive research on adversarial attacks in assessment of specific target models, with particular focus on domains such as self-driving car systems 0 and facial identification systems 1. Given the potential scale of automated spam or influence campaigns when powered by generative text models, it is likely that human moderation alone will not be adequate for accurate detection of computer-generated text. Algorithmic approaches based on current machine learning models for detection of computer-written text are therefore the most practical solution to the problem, and are likely to be adopted by major technology and social media companies. Attackers are likely well aware of the types of detection models that such companies might employ, and may realistically use adversarial attacks to attempt to undermine detection methodologies. This motivates our assessment of the resilience of detection methods against concerted efforts to evade them. With this environment in mind, this work evaluates the robustness of modern techniques for detection of computer-generated text by testing their performance in the presence of adversarial attacks in the text domain. We assess not only state-of-the-art neural networks, but prior work on statistical features as well. We demonstrate that while neural network features outperform statistical features, incorporation of statistical features may improve adversarial robustness against specific adversarial attacks. As part of this process, we investigate the relative predictive power of previously-effective statistical features, and provide guidance for future work. We finally offer an assessment of vulnerability to adversarial attack that incorporates a proxy measure of human judgement, ΔΔ\\DeltaMauve, providing a more concrete comparison of how perturbed an adversarial input must be to cause an erroneous classification. The remainder of this work is structured as follows. Section II covers background knowledge and related work for understanding this research. Section III covers the experiment methodology. Section IV covers datasets and preprocessing procedures. Section V covers experiment settings. Section VI includes results of experiments. Section VII includes discussion of the results. Finally, conclusions are presented in Section VIII.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: in which the subsequent GPT-3 model was introduced was not accompanied by an open-source release at all .
