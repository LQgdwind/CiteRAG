      "content": "Paper Title: A Brief Survey and Comparative Study of Recent Development of Pronoun Coreference Resolution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe question of how human beings resolve pronouns111Some pronouns may refer to non-nominal antecedents. For example, the pronoun “it” in “It is too cold in the Winter here” does not refer to any real object . But in this survey, we only focus on pronouns that refer to nominal antecedents. has long been of interest to both linguistic and natural language processing (NLP) communities, for the reason that a pronoun itself only having weak semantic meaning brings challenges to natural language understanding.\nTo explore solutions for that question, pronoun coreference resolution (PCR)  was proposed.222Previous studies   mainly focus on three kinds of pronouns: third personal pronoun (e.g., she, her, he, him, them, they, it), possessive pronoun (e.g., his, hers, its, their, theirs), and demonstrative pronoun (e.g., this, that, these, those).\nThe first and second personal pronouns are typically not considered as they often refer to the current speakers, which are normally out of the conversation or document.\nBesides that, conventional PCR works    mostly focusing on identifying coreference relations between pronouns and noun phrases rather than coreference relation between pronouns.\nAs a challenging yet vital natural language understanding task, pronoun coreference resolution is to find the correct reference for a given pronominal anaphor in the context and has been shown to be crucial for a series of downstream tasks, such as machine translation , summarization , and dialog systems [ref]8. To investigate the difference between PCR and the general coreference resolution task, which tries to identify not only the coreference relations between noun phrases (NP) and pronouns (P) but also potential coreference relations between noun phrases or coreference relations between pronouns, we conduct experiments with one recent breakthrough model (i.e., End-to-end model ) on the CoNLL-2012 shard task 0 under two settings: one without the gold mention and one with the gold mention.\nIn the ‘without gold mention’ setting, models are required to first identify spans from the documents as the mentions and then predict the coreference relations among these mentions.\nAs a comparison, if gold mentions are provided, models only need to predict the coreference relations.\nFrom the results in Table 1 we can see that, without gold mention, the model performs well on P-P coreference relations while not that well on the other two kinds of relations. However, if gold mentions are provided, the model can achieve very good performance on the NP-NP coreference relations.\nCompare with other kinds of coreference relations, no matter whether the gold mention is provided or not, resolving pronouns to noun phrases is always the most challenging one. The correct resolution of pronouns typically requires reasoning over both linguistic knowledge (e.g., ‘they’ typically can only refer to plural objects333The only exception is the organisation named entities. For example, “they” can refer to “the company” 1.) and commonsense knowledge (e.g., in sentence “The fish ate the worm, it was hungry”, ‘it’ refers to ‘fish’ because hungry things tend to eat rather than being eaten.).\nConsidering that the ordinary PCR task evaluates the inference over both types of knowledge at the same time, the performance on ordinary PCR tasks cannot clearly reflect models’ performance regarding different knowledge types.\nTo address this problem, the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) 2 task is proposed. The influence of all commonly used linguistic knowledge is avoided during the creation of WSC such that WSC can be used to reflect how current PCR models can understand commonsense knowledge.\nIn Section 2 and 3, we introduce the progress and remaining challenges on the ordinary PCR and WSC tasks respectively.\nAfter that, we introduce other PCR tasks that are developed for different research purposes in Section 4.\nIn the end, we conclude this survey with Section 5.\nThe contribution of this survey is three-fold: (1) we broadly introduce available PCR tasks, datasets, and models; (2) We summarize the main contribution of recent models; (3) We conduct experiments to analyze the limitations of current models, which can help the community think about how to better solve PCR in the future.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: correct reference for a given pronominal anaphor in the context and has been shown to be crucial for a series of downstream tasks, such as machine translation , summarization , and dialog systems [ref]8.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
