      "content": "Paper Title: Anomaly Rule Detection in Sequence Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere exists a considerable number algorithms of pattern mining for anomaly detection (PM4AD)  . Up until now, there are many existing pattern-based anomaly detection algorithms that focusing on a particular combination of rare pattern representation, pattern mining, and computation of the anomaly score. In general, there are many kinds of rare pattern, such as rare association rule, rare itemset, rare sequential rule, and details can be referred to . In the past decades, pattern-based anomaly detection has been widely studied. Wong et al.  proposed a rule-based anomaly pattern detection for detecting disease outbreaks. Graph-based anomaly detection was also studied in . Nandi et al.  utilized program control flow graph to address the problem of anomaly detection from execution logs. In the field of anomaly detection on trajectory data, a framework called MT-MAD [ref]34 was proposed to find anomalous movement behavior. In these frameworks and algorithms, the processed data usually consists mostly of normal records, along with a very small percentage of anomalous records. Recently, there are some deep learning-based methods that designed for anomaly detection, as reviewed in [ref]35 . How to efficiently discover the anomaly behavior from large-scale dataset is still challenging. Although pattern-based anomaly detection have been applied to the problem of discovery anomalies. In the literature, little attention considers the external constraints (e.g., utility, risk, unit price)  for discovering abnormal patterns, even for reducing the runtime and memory cost of a PM4AD algorithm. In the set of discovered patterns, their frequency is one of the objective statistical properties, while their utility is a subjective measure [ref]4. In other words, a subjective measure is mainly depending on the prior knowledge from human and different from the objective one. In the past, as an alternative interestingness measure, utility has been adopted in many data mining algorithms to discover useful patterns and knowledge [ref]4 . This motivates us to incorporate utility-aware measure into anomaly detection in sequence data.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: .
