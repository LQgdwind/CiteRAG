MTL learning aims to help improving the learning of a model by leveraging the domain-specific knowledge contained in the training signals of related tasks. Usually, relatedness among tasks are learned in two ways in deep neural networks: hard parameter sharing and soft parameter sharing of hidden layer. Hard parameter sharing MTL was first proposed in , which shares the hidden layer between all tasks and keep task-specific output layers. Collobert et al. describe a single convolutional neural network architecture trained jointly on NLP tasks such as part-of-speech tags, chunks, named entity tags, and semantic roles. Zheng et al.[ref]40 propose a module in which all tasks share the same sentence representation and each task can select the task-specific information from the shared sentence representation with attention mechanism. On the other hand, each task in soft parameter MTL contains its own model and parameters, and the parameters are encouraged to be similar with regularization. Misra et al. connect two separate networks in a soft parameters sharing way. Then the model leverages a unit called cross-stitch to determine how to combine the knowledge learned in other related tasks to task-specific networks. We first introduced MTL into the study of code summarization. Hu et al. use a fine-tuning approach; however, their pre-training is mainly used to capture features (e.g., API call sequences) from the input data of the same task, rather than share knowledge of different tasks. They declared their work as a transfer learning approach, but we believe it is more about designing better code features, since datasets used for pre-training and fine-tuning are generally the same. We believe that our research provides a reference for code learning tasks based on deep learning. The method of mining the association between different tasks and large-scale corpus pre-training has great potential in the field of program representation and comprehension.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: Collobert et al. describe a single convolutional neural network architecture trained jointly on NLP tasks such as part-of-speech tags, chunks, named entity tags, and semantic roles.
