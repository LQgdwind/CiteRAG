      "content": "Paper Title: Low-complexity Deep Video Compression with A Distributed Coding Architecture\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraining Data. We use the training part of the Vimeo-90k dataset  to train the proposed video compression framework, and randomly crop the videos into 256√ó256256256256\\times 256 patches. During training, we set the batch size as 16. Test Settings. We evaluate the compression performance of our proposed method on two 1080p test datasets with diversified content, including UVG  and MCL-JCV . The GOP size is set as 8 by default. Our competing benchmarks contain traditional video codecs (WZ video coding , H.264  and H.265 ), and recently proposed learning-based methods (DVC , DVC-Lite  and DCVC [ref]5). For H.264 and H.265, we report the sequential-P order and hierarchical-B order with very slow mode.\nFor details about H.264 and H.265 settings, please refer to Appendix B-A. Evaluation Metrics. Since most benchmarks achieve values above 0.9 in MS-SSIM, we follow 4 to convert the quantity to decibels for improving legibility, where MS-SSIM (dB) is calculated by 10log10(1/(1‚àí10\\log_{10}(1/(1-MS-SSIM)))). The Bj√∏ntegaard Delta bitrate (BDBR) [ref]42 is reported to denote the average bitrate savings at the same reconstruction quality. Moreover, we calculate BD-PSNR and BD-MSSSIM to indicate the average gains of reconstruction quality at the same bitrate. Implementation Details. In our experiments, we use the pretrained model mbt-2018 5 provided by CompressAI  for key frame compression. For WZ frame compression, we train five models with different ŒªùúÜ\\lambda values (MSE: 0.0018, 0.0035, 0.0067, 0.0130, 0.0250; MS-SSIM: 2.40, 4.58, 8.73, 16.64, 31.73). During training, the Adam optimizer  is used with an initial learning rate as 0.001. When the evaluation loss reaches a plateau, the learning rate is reduced by a factor of 2. We use a patience of 10 epochs and 5 epochs for the first and second stage, respectively. As for the total number of epochs, we set it as 100 and 50 for the two stages respectively. The whole system is implemented by PyTorch and trained on an NVIDIA RTX A5000 GPU.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: size is set as 8 by default. Our competing benchmarks contain traditional video codecs (WZ video coding , H.264  and H.265 ), and recently proposed learning-based methods (DVC , DVC-Lite  and DCVC [ref]5). For H.264 and H.265, we report the sequential-P order and hierarchical-B order with very slow mode.\nFor details about H.264 and H.265 settings, please refer to Appendix B-A. Evaluation\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
