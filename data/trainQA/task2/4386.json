      "content": "Paper Title: NDF: Neural Deformable Fields for Dynamic Human Modelling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLearning-based Scene Representations. According to the dimensionality of representation, several paradigms have been investigated for 3D content embedding in the context of image-based novel view synthesis. Multiplane image (MPI)  9, voxels [ref]28 , point cloud  , and neural radiance fields [ref]20 0 8  3 have all been under intense research focus recently. MPI learns scene representation in the form of fronto-parallel color and Œ±ùõº\\alpha planes, and novel views are rendered via homography-wraping. Sitzmann et al. [ref]28 proposed to learn a deepvoxel representation by dividing the 3D space into discrete 3D units that embed learned features, which was further replaced with a continuous learnable function . Mildenhall et al. [ref]20 proposed to represent the scene as a neural radiance Ô¨Åeld (NeRF) by directly mapping a continuous 5D coordinate to the volume density and view-dependent emitted radiance. NeRF has special advantages in that it can represent a continuous scene in arbitrary resolution and it can be effectively learned from multi-view images. Our method follows NeRF to reconstruct scenes from images and further extends it to dynamic scenes. Neural Implicit Representation for Human. Habermann et al.  leverage a 3D scanned person-specific template to learn motion-dependent geometry as well as motion- and view-dependent dynamic textures from multi-view videos. The requirement of a high-quality 3D scanning restricted its use. Several recent works resort to learning a shared representation via deformable functions (in the form of NeRF    ). Restricted by the design choice of the function, it is difficult for these methods to model relatively large movements efficiently and they show limited generalizability to novel poses. Liu et al. 5 learns a person-speciÔ¨Åc embedding of the actor‚Äôs appearance given a monocular video and a textured mesh template of the actor. Neural Body  learns neural representations over the same set of latent codes anchored to the deformable human model SMPL 7, and naturally integrate observations across frames. The sparsity allows it to effectively aggregate observations across frames but the result shows it losses details like wrinkles of clothes. Neural Actor 4 learns an unposed implicit human model via inverse linear blend skinning functions (LBS). The model cannot handle surface dynamics and certain geometric information has been lost during the generation of 2D texture maps. Animatable NeRF¬† can animate the performer to novel poses however it requires fine-tuning on the novel pose frames. This would be impossible when applied to a completely novel pose that the performer has never done. Our method does not require fine-tuning and can be directly applied to completely novel poses after training.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: to the dimensionality of representation, several paradigms have been investigated for 3D content embedding in the context of image-based novel view synthesis.
