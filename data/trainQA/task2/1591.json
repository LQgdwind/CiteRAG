Its performance is measured in accuracy, precision, recall,\nand F1 score . The image data of this work consist of artificial (TORCS) and real-world (LLAMAS  and TuSimple ) images summarized in Table 1, where TuSimple includes images augmented by mirroring in training phase. The ratio between the numbers of training and test images is about 10. We annotate TORCS images (collected by Host driving on Tracks 1 to 6 [ref]26) to binary images of ego-lane lines, which are similar to those annotated from real-world images . A second test set of 3,200 images from curvy Track 7 [ref]26 is used to evaluate the overall performance (Figs. 2b-2d) of the integrated CNN-PP model from Host’s perspective in real-time and dynamic traffic with other Agents. UNet and DSUNet are trained on separate TORCS, LLAMAS, TuSimple, and TuSimple-mirror images with Adam optimizer, a batch size of 1, momentum 0.9, and learning rate 10−4superscript10410^{-4} and 10−5superscript10510^{-5} for first 75 and last 25 epochs, respectively. The trained models are evaluated on the first test set for their performance of lane detection. We then evaluate the static and dynamic performance (as shown in Fig. 2) of the integrated CNN-PP model in TORCS for Host driving with 6 Agents on Track 7 having a total length of 3919 m. All cars drive autonomously by default control algorithms  with the maximum speed of 70 and 67 km/h for Host and Agents, respectively, as displayed in\nFig. 2d.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: includes images augmented by mirroring in training phase.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
