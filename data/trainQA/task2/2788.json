      "content": "Paper Title: Collective eXplainable AI: Explaining Cooperative Strategies and Agent Contribution in Multiagent Reinforcement Learning with Shapley Values\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCooperative multi-agent RL has been studied in different settings, e.g., the emergence of different behaviors in the context of the Commons Tragedy game [ref]19. These studies show, for instance, that certain inequity aversion improves intertemporal social dilemmas [ref]20. However, these works analyze the game from a theoretical point of view and not from the XAI angle. This article specifically focuses on studying to which degree the most relevant factors (or those contributing the most) in a black-box deep RL model\ncan be explained. Notably, this article focuses on pointing out at particular agents, episodes, agents, actions or policies. Recent techniques to attain eXplainable Reinforcement Learning (or XRL) [ref]6 can be categorized in two main families or categories: transparent methods or post-hoc explainability methods (according to XAI taxonomies in ). On the one hand, transparent algorithms include, by definition, every ML model that is understandable by itself, such as a decision-tree. On the other hand, post-hoc explainability includes all methods that craft an explanation of an RL algorithm after its training, such as LIME , BreakDown  or SHAP . Other studies    try to transpose Shapley values into XAI but, to the best of our knowledge, none applies SHAP to explain the specific issues of cooperative multi-agent RL. In fact, most XRL methods are based on transparent algorithms [ref]6. Wang et al.  developed an approach to solve global reward games in a multi-agent RL context by making use of Shapley values to distribute the global reward more efficiently across all agents.Their focus was not on explainability nor interpretability but performance. All Shapley-based XAI methods listed above consider model features as participants of a cooperative multiplayer game. In this article, Shapley values are applied to a cooperative multi-agent RL context by considering agents as players instead, an approach closer to the original game theory method presented by Lloyd Shapley in 1953 . Exact computation methods for both BreakDown and SHAP exist only for linear regression and tree ensemble models.\nIn more complex models, the dependence of these methods on the number of samples or number of subsets of predictors p𝑝p to be used makes the approximated vs exact computation of contributions to be different and, potentially, point in opposite directions . This indicates that these generic methods are not the universal response to XAI yet. This article, despite some remaining issues against attaining a general XRL framework, shows that in a cooperative multi-agent RL setting, Shapley values can be used to accurately estimate the contributions of different agents.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: Cooperative multi-agent RL has been studied in different settings, e.g., the emergence of different behaviors in the context of the Commons Tragedy game [ref]19.
