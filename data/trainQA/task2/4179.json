      "content": "Paper Title: Benchmarking Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Models through the Lens of Interpretability\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we benchmark different types of CATE estimators on their ability to identify predictive covariates through feature importance scores. We study 3 different characteristics of the data generating process which we expect to impact this ability:  1 The relative strength between the prognostic contribution μprogsubscript𝜇prog\\mu_{\\mathrm{prog}} and the predictive contributions μpred0,μpred1subscript𝜇pred0subscript𝜇pred1\\mu_{\\mathrm{pred0}},\\mu_{\\mathrm{pred1}} to the POs Y​(0),Y​(1)𝑌0𝑌1Y{(0)},Y{(1)} (Sec. 5.1);  2 The presence of nonlinearities in the prognostic and predictive functions μprog,μpred0,μpred1subscript𝜇progsubscript𝜇pred0subscript𝜇pred1\\mu_{\\mathrm{prog}},\\mu_{\\mathrm{pred0}},\\mu_{\\mathrm{pred1}} (Sec. 5.2), and  3 the fact that the treatment assignment might be biased according to a nontrivial propensity score π𝜋\\pi (Sec. 5.3). All the experiments are done by varying the inputs of Algorithm 1. Datasets. We extract covariates to use in our our benchmarking environment from the following four datasets: TCGA , Twins , News [ref]51 and ACIC2016 , which were selected due to their diverse characteristics in terms of the number of features, mixture of categorical/continuous features and population size. The number of covariates in these datasets range from d=39𝑑39d=39 to d=100𝑑100d=100 and we set nℐ=⌊0.2⋅d⌋subscript𝑛ℐ⋅0.2𝑑n_{\\mathcal{I}}=\\lfloor 0.2\\cdot d\\rfloor. Refer to Appendix C for details of the datasets. Learners. We consider a number of CATE estimators based on neural networks throughout our experiments. As direct estimators, we use ’s DR-learner, which relies on a doubly robust pseudo-outcome, and ’s X-learner, which uses a weighted average of two direct (singly-robust) treatment effect estimates from both treatment groups. As indirect estimators, we use ’s T-learner, which fits two regression models μ^w​(x)subscript^𝜇𝑤𝑥\\hat{\\mu}_{w}(x) (one for each treatment group) and sets τ^​(x)=μ^1​(x)−μ^0​(x)^𝜏𝑥subscript^𝜇1𝑥subscript^𝜇0𝑥\\hat{\\tau}(x)=\\hat{\\mu}_{1}(x)-\\hat{\\mu}_{0}(x), and S-learner, which includes the treatment assignment variable W𝑊W as a standard feature in a single regression μ^​(x,w)^𝜇𝑥𝑤\\hat{\\mu}(x,w) and sets τ^​(x)=μ^​(x,1)−μ^​(x,0)^𝜏𝑥^𝜇𝑥1^𝜇𝑥0\\hat{\\tau}(x)=\\hat{\\mu}(x,1)-\\hat{\\mu}(x,0). Finally, we consider ’s TARNet which can be seen as a hybrid between S- and T-learner : it learns a representation Φ​(x)Φ𝑥\\Phi(x) shared between treatment groups, which is used by treatment-specific outcome heads hw​(Φ​(x))subscriptℎ𝑤Φ𝑥h_{w}(\\Phi(x)) so that τ^​(x)=h1​(Φ​(x))−h0​(Φ​(x))^𝜏𝑥subscriptℎ1Φ𝑥subscriptℎ0Φ𝑥\\hat{\\tau}(x)=h_{1}(\\Phi(x))-h_{0}(\\Phi(x)). In the experiments with confounding, we also use ’s CFRNet, which differs from TARNet only in a regularization term that encourages the representation to be balanced (follow a similar distribution) across treatment groups. We discuss all models in more detail in Appendix C, where we also detail how we fix hyperparameters across all models to ensure similar capacity.\n\nReference markers found: [51]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]51: All the experiments are done by varying the inputs of Algorithm 1.
