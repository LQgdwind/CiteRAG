      "content": "Paper Title: On the Fine-Grained Query Complexity of Symmetric Functions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe need for structure in quantum speedups has been studied extensively. Beals, Buhrman, Cleve, Mosca and de Wolf 0 showed that there exists at most polynomial quantum speedups for total Boolean functions in the query model. Thus, the exponential speedups may only occur at partial functions. Furthermore, Aaronson and Ambainis  showed that symmetric functions do not allow super-polynomial quantum speedups, even if the functions are partial. Chailloux 7 improved this result for a broader class of symmetric functions. Ben-David, Childs, Gilyén, Kretschmer, Podder and Wang 3 further showed that hypergraph symmetries in the adjacency matrix model allow at most polynomial separations between quantum and randomized query complexities. Ben-David 1 proved a classical and quantum polynomial equivalence for a class of functions satisfying a certain symmetric promise. Aaronson and Ben-David  showed that there exists at most polynomial quantum speedups to compute an n𝑛n-bit partial Boolean function if the domain\nD=poly​(n)𝐷poly𝑛D=\\mathrm{poly}(n). Nonetheless, all these results concern the algorithms with a constant probability of success. They do not cover the query complexity with a subconstant probability of success. We also survey some results about the optimal success probability of quantum algorithms when the number of queries is fixed.\nFor the unstructured search problem, Zalka  showed an optimal success probability of a quantum algorithm given the number of queries. For the collision finding problem, Zhandry  gave the upper bound on the success probability of quantum algorithms when the number of queries is fixed, which matched the algorithm proposed by Brassard, Høyer and Tapp 5.\nAmbainis and Iraids  analyzed the optimal success probability of one-query quantum algorithms to compute EQUALITYnsubscriptEQUALITY𝑛\\text{EQUALITY}_{n} and ANDnsubscriptAND𝑛\\text{AND}_{n} functions. Montanaro, Jozsa, and Mitchison  indicated the optimal success probability of small symmetric Boolean functions when given any number of queries by numerical results. There is not much study about the optimal success probability with a given number of queries for symmetric Boolean functions.\nOur work will fill the gap in this field. For a nonconstant n𝑛n-bit total symmetric Boolean function f𝑓f, it has been known that some fundamental complexity measures are Θ​(n)Θ𝑛\\Theta(n),\nand Q​(f)=Θ​(𝖽𝖾𝗀~⁡(f))=Θ​(n​(n−Γ​(f)))𝑄𝑓Θ~𝖽𝖾𝗀𝑓Θ𝑛𝑛Γ𝑓Q(f)=\\Theta\\left(\\operatorname{\\mathsf{\\widetilde{deg}}}(f)\\right)=\\Theta\\left(\\sqrt{n(n-\\Gamma(f))}\\right),\nwhere Γ​(f)=min⁡{|2​k−n+1|:f​(k)≠f​(k+1)}Γ𝑓:2𝑘𝑛1𝑓𝑘𝑓𝑘1\\Gamma(f)=\\min\\left\\{|2k-n+1|:f(k)\\neq f(k+1)\\right\\} . Mittal, Nair and Patro  further explored the best possible separation between sensitivity, block sensitivity and certificate complexity of total symmetric functions. Sherstov  gave an almost tight characterization of 𝖽𝖾𝗀ϵ⁡(f)subscript𝖽𝖾𝗀italic-ϵ𝑓\\operatorname{\\mathsf{deg}}_{\\epsilon}(f) for specific ϵ∈[1/2n,1/3]italic-ϵ1superscript2𝑛13\\epsilon\\in[1/2^{n},1/3]. Afterward, de Wolf  obtained the optimal bound. Regarding the complexity measures of partial symmetric Boolean functions, Aaronson and Ambainis  showed for any partial symmetric Boolean function f𝑓f, R​(f)=O​(Q​(f)2)𝑅𝑓𝑂𝑄superscript𝑓2R(f)=O\\left(Q(f)^{2}\\right) as mentioned before. Researchers also studied the exact quantum query complexity for many instances of partial symmetric Boolean functions. For example,\nDeutsch and Jozsa [ref]21 studied the first partially symmetric Boolean function.\nAfterward, generalized Deutsch-Jozsa problems were studied in   .\nHe, Sun, Yang and Yuan  established the asymptotically optimal bound for the exact quantum query complexity of distinguishing whether |x|=k𝑥𝑘|x|=k or l𝑙l. Qiu and Zheng   studied the exact quantum query complexity of symmetric Boolean functions with degree 1 or 2. Additionally, several works   8 explored the connections between block sensitivity, fractional block sensitivity and degree for bounded functions. In a similar work, Montanaro, Nishimura and Raymond  studied the unbounded error query complexity of Boolean functions in a scenario where\nit is only required that the query algorithm succeeds with a probability strictly greater than\n1/2. They proved quantum and classical query complexities are related by a constant factor for any (possibly partial) Boolean function. Similar results are also known in the communication complexity model 2 1.\nCompared to the result in , we aim to analyze the relation between quantum/classical query complexity and bias more precisely. For instance, we show for any quantum algorithm computing fnksuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝑛𝑘f_{n}^{k} and fnk,lsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝑛𝑘𝑙f_{n}^{k,l} using T𝑇T queries, there exist randomized algorithms using poly​(T)poly𝑇\\mathrm{poly}(T) queries that have the same bias as the quantum algorithm. Such a conclusion is not implied by  since the unbounded error model only cares about a strictly positive bias without a more accurate quantitative analysis.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: as mentioned before. Researchers also studied the exact quantum query complexity for many instances of partial symmetric Boolean functions.
