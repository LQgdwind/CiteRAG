Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

(2) VQGAN-CLIP  fine-tunes VQGAN  with CLIP embedding [ref]30 similarity between generated image and target text.\nThen it generates the image with the optimized VQGAN embedding. (3) SD-SDEdit  is a tuning-free method built upon Stable Diffusion [ref]33.\nBased on the target description, SDEdit adds stochastic differential equation noise to the source image and then denoises the target image through that prior. (4) Text2LIVE  fine-tunes Vision Transformer  to generate the edited object on the extra edited layer with data augmentation and CLIP [ref]30 supervision.\nThe target image is the composite of the extra edit layer and the original layer. (5) Null Text Inversion 4 optimizes DDIM  trajectory to restore the source image and then performs image editing on the denoising process with text-image cross-attention control . (6) InstructPix2Pix [ref]4 is pre-trained with automatically curated instruction-following editing data, initialized from Stable Diffusion [ref]33.\nIt edits the source image by controlling the faithfulness to instruction and similarity with the source image, without any test-time tuning. (7) HIVE  is trained with more data synthesized using a method similar to InstructPix2Pix [ref]4 and is further fine-tuned with a reward model trained with human-ranked data. For mask-provided baselines, we consider: (1) GLIDE 5 is trained with 67M text-image pairs where all images are person-free.\nTo edit, it fills in the masked region of an image conditioned on the local description with CLIP [ref]30 guidance. (2) Blended Diffusion  resorts to CLIP [ref]30 guidance during a masked region denoising process and blends it with the context in the noisy source image at each denoising timestep to increase the region-context consistency of the generated target image.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: with consistency loss.\nIt edits image by performing arithmetic operations on word embeddings within a shared vector space with visual features. (2) VQGAN-CLIP  fine-tunes VQGAN  with CLIP embedding [ref]30 similarity between generated image and target text.\nThen it generates the image with the optimized VQGAN embedding.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
