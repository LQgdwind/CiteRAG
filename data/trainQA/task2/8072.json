In this paper we consider LTSs with Act:=A⊎{τ,t}fragmentsActassignA⊎{τ,t}Act:=A\\uplus\\{\\tau,{\\rm t}\\}, where A𝐴A is a set of visible actions, τ𝜏\\tau is the hidden or invisible action, and tt{\\rm t} the time-out action. Let Aτ:=A∪{τ}fragmentsA𝜏assignA{τ}A_{\\tau}:=A\\cup\\{\\tau\\}. P→αP′fragmentsP𝛼→P′P\\xrightarrow{\\alpha}P^{\\prime} stands for (P,α,P′)∈→fragments(P,α,P′)→(P,\\alpha,P^{\\prime})\\in{\\rightarrow} and these triplets are called transitions. Moreover, P→(α)P′fragmentsPfragments(α)→P′P\\xrightarrow{\\mbox{\\tiny\\rm(}\\alpha\\mbox{\\tiny\\rm)}}P^{\\prime} denotes that either α=τfragmentsατ\\alpha=\\tau and P=P′fragmentsPP′P=P^{\\prime}, or P→αP′fragmentsP𝛼→P′P\\xrightarrow{\\alpha}P^{\\prime}. Furthermore, paths are sequences of connected transitions and ⟹⟹\\Longrightarrow is the reflexive-transitive closure of →τ𝜏→\\xrightarrow{\\tau}. The set of initial actions of a process P∈ℙfragmentsPPP\\in\\mathbb{P} is ℐ(P):={α∈Aτ∣P→α}fragmentsI(P)assign{αA𝜏∣P𝛼→}\\mathcal{I}(P):=\\{\\alpha\\in A_{\\tau}\\mid P{\\xrightarrow{\\alpha}}\\}. Here P→αfragmentsP𝛼→P{\\xrightarrow{\\alpha}} means that there is a Q𝑄Q with P→αQfragmentsP𝛼→QP\\xrightarrow{\\alpha}Q. A branching reactive bisimulation is a symmetric111meaning that (P,Q)∈ℛ⇔(Q,P)∈ℛfragments(P,Q)ℛ⇔(Q,P)ℛ(P,Q)\\in\\R\\Leftrightarrow(Q,P)\\in\\R and (P,X,Q)∈ℛ⇔(Q,X,P)∈ℛfragments(P,X,Q)ℛ⇔(Q,X,P)ℛ(P,X,Q)\\in\\R\\Leftrightarrow(Q,X,P)\\in\\R relation ℛ⊆(ℙ×ℙ)∪(ℙ×𝒫(A)×ℙ)fragmentsℛ(PP)(P𝒫(A)P)\\R\\subseteq(\\mathbb{P}\\times\\mathbb{P})\\cup(\\mathbb{P}\\times\\Pow(A)\\times\\mathbb{P}) such that, for all P,Q∈ℙfragmentsP,QPP,Q\\in\\mathbb{P} and X⊆AfragmentsXAX\\subseteq A, if ℛ(P,Q)fragmentsℛ(P,Q)\\R(P,Q) then if P𝑃P with α∈AτfragmentsαA𝜏\\alpha\\in A_{\\tau} then there is a path Q⟹Q1fragmentsQ⟹Q1Q\\Longrightarrow Q_{1} with ℛ(P,Q1)fragmentsℛ(P,Q1)\\R(P,Q_{1}) and ℛ(P′,Q2)fragmentsℛ(P′,Q2)\\R(P^{\\prime},Q_{2}), for all Y⊆AfragmentsYAY\\subseteq A, ℛ(P,Y,Q)fragmentsℛ(P,Y,Q)\\R(P,Y,Q); if ℛ(P,X,Q)fragmentsℛ(P,X,Q)\\R(P,X,Q) then if P→τP′fragmentsP𝜏→P′P\\xrightarrow{\\tau}P^{\\prime} then there is a path Q⟹Q1fragmentsQ⟹Q1Q\\Longrightarrow Q_{1} with ℛ(P,X,Q1)fragmentsℛ(P,X,Q1)\\R(P,X,Q_{1}) and ℛ(P′,X,Q2)fragmentsℛ(P′,X,Q2)\\R(P^{\\prime},X,Q_{2}), if P𝑃P with a∈XfragmentsaXa\\in X then there is a path Q⟹Q1fragmentsQ⟹Q1Q\\Longrightarrow Q_{1} with ℛ(P,X,Q1)fragmentsℛ(P,X,Q1)\\R(P,X,Q_{1}) and ℛ(P′,Q2)fragmentsℛ(P′,Q2)\\R(P^{\\prime},Q_{2}), if ℐ(P)∩(X∪{τ})=∅fragmentsI(P)(X{τ})\\mathcal{I}(P)\\cap(X\\cup\\{\\tau\\})=\\emptyset then there is a path Q⟹Q0fragmentsQ⟹Q0Q\\Longrightarrow Q_{0} with ℛ(P,Q0)fragmentsℛ(P,Q0)\\R(P,Q_{0}), if ℐ(P)∩(X∪{τ})=∅fragmentsI(P)(X{τ})\\mathcal{I}(P)\\cap(X\\cup\\{\\tau\\})=\\emptyset and P𝑃P then there is a path Q=:Q0⟹Q1fragmentsQfragments:Q0⟹Q1Q\\mathrel{=:}Q_{0}\\Longrightarrow Q_{1} with r>0fragmentsr0r>0, such that ∀i∈[0,r−1],ℛ(P,X,Q2i)∧ℐ(Q2i+1)∩(X∪{τ})=∅fragmentsfor-alli[0,r1],ℛ(P,X,Qfragments2i)I(Qfragments2i1)(X{τ})\\forall i\\in[0,r{-}1],\\R(P,X,Q_{2i})\\wedge\\mathcal{I}(Q_{2i+1})\\cap(X\\cup\\{\\tau\\})=\\emptyset and ℛ(P′,X,Q2r)fragmentsℛ(P′,X,Qfragments2r)\\R(P^{\\prime},X,Q_{2r}), if P／→τfragmentsP𝜏→P\\,\\not\\!\\xrightarrow{\\tau} then there is a path Q⟹Q0／→τfragmentsQ⟹Q0𝜏→Q\\Longrightarrow Q_{0}\\,\\not\\!\\xrightarrow{\\tau}. For P,Q∈ℙfragmentsP,QPP,Q\\mathbin{\\in}\\mathbb{P}, if there exists a branching reactive bisimulation ℛℛ\\R with ℛ(P,Q)fragmentsℛ(P,Q)\\R(P,Q) (resp. ℛ(P,X,Q)fragmentsℛ(P,X,Q)\\R(P,X,Q)) then P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q are said to be branching reactive bisimilar (resp. branching X𝑋X-bisimilar), which is denoted P↔¯brQfragmentsPfragments¯↔fragmentsbrQP\\mathrel{\\,\\raisebox{2.15277pt}{$\\underline{\\makebox[6.99997pt]{\\raisebox{-1.0pt}[0.0pt][0.0pt]{$\\leftrightarrow$}}}$}\\,_{br}\\!}Q (resp. P↔¯XbrQfragmentsPfragments¯↔𝑋fragmentsbrQP\\mathrel{\\,\\raisebox{2.15277pt}{$\\underline{\\makebox[6.99997pt]{\\raisebox{-1.0pt}[0.0pt][0.0pt]{$\\leftrightarrow$}}}$}\\,^{X}_{br}\\!}Q). To build the above definition, the definition of a strong reactive bisimulation [ref]11 was modified in a branching manner . Intuitively, a triplet ℛ(P,X,Q)fragmentsℛ(P,X,Q)\\R(P,X,Q) affirms that P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q behave similarly when the environment allows (only) the set of actions in X𝑋X to occur, whereas a couple ℛ(P,Q)fragmentsℛ(P,Q)\\R(P,Q) says that P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q behave in the same way when the environment has been triggered to change. As said before, the environment can be seen as a system executed in parallel while enforcing the synchronisation of all visible actions. Clause 1 captures the scenario of a triggered environment: if P𝑃P can perform a visible or invisible action then Q𝑄Q has to be able to match it; and the environment can settle on a set Y𝑌Y of allowed actions at any moment. Time-outs are not considered because these can occur only when the system idles, and idling can happen only when the environment has stabilised on a set of allowed actions. One might notice that, in [ref]11, the first clause was only required for invisible actions. However, there the case α≠τfragmentsατ\\alpha\\neq\\tau is actually implied by the other clauses. If in our definition Clause 1.a were restricted to invisible actions then ↔¯brfragments¯↔fragmentsbr\\mathrel{\\,\\raisebox{2.15277pt}{$\\underline{\\makebox[6.99997pt]{\\raisebox{-1.0pt}[0.0pt][0.0pt]{$\\leftrightarrow$}}}$}\\,_{br}\\!} would not be a congruence for the parallel operator, as shown in Appendix A. Clause 2 depicts the scenario of an environment allowing X𝑋X. τ𝜏\\tau-transitions have to be matched since the environment cannot disallow them, and their execution does not trigger the environment to change. Visible actions have to be matched only if they are allowed, and their execution triggers the environment. Triggering the environment or not explains why Clause 2a matches Q2fragmentsQ2Q_{2} in a triplet and Clause 2b in a couple. If P𝑃P idles (i.e. ℐ(P)∩(X∪{τ})=∅fragmentsI(P)(X{τ})\\mathcal{I}(P)\\cap(X\\cup\\{\\tau\\})=\\emptyset) then the environment can be triggered, thus, Q𝑄Q has to be able to instantaneously reach a state Q0fragmentsQ0Q_{0} related to P𝑃P in a triggered environment.222By Lemma 2.11.4 we can even choose Q0fragmentsQ0Q_{0} such that Q0／→τfragmentsQ0𝜏→Q_{0}\\,\\not\\!\\xrightarrow{\\tau}, so that ℐ(Q0)=ℐ(P)fragmentsI(Q0)I(P)\\mathcal{I}(Q_{0})=\\mathcal{I}(P). If P𝑃P idles and has an outgoing time-out transition then Q𝑄Q has to be able to match it in a branching manner. This involves Q𝑄Q performing any sequence of τ𝜏\\tau and tt{\\rm t}-transitions, such that all states encountered prior to the last optional tt{\\rm t} are related to P𝑃P.333Clause 2.d requires this only for states of the form Q2ifragmentsQfragments2iQ_{2i} with i∈[0,r−1]fragmentsi[0,r1]i\\in[0,r{-}1], but by Lemma 2.11.1 it holds for all of them. Clause 2.c further implies that in Clause 2.d we have ℛ(P,Q2i+1)fragmentsℛ(P,Qfragments2i1)\\R(P,Q_{2i+1}) for all i∈[0,r−1]fragmentsi[0,r1]i\\in[0,r{-}1]. Lastly, a stability respecting clause [ref]7 was added for practical reasons. In Appendix A, an example shows that without it ↔¯brfragments¯↔fragmentsbr\\mathrel{\\,\\raisebox{2.15277pt}{$\\underline{\\makebox[6.99997pt]{\\raisebox{-1.0pt}[0.0pt][0.0pt]{$\\leftrightarrow$}}}$}\\,_{br}\\!} would not even be an equivalence. For the important class of divergence-free systems, without infinite sequences Q0→τQ1→τ…fragmentsQ0𝜏→Q1𝜏→…Q_{0}\\xrightarrow{\\tau}Q_{1}\\xrightarrow{\\tau}\\dots, Clause 2.e is easily seen to be redundant. Let ℛℛ\\R be a branching reactive bisimulation. If ℛ(P,X,Q)fragmentsℛ(P,X,Q)\\R(P,X,Q), P／→τfragmentsP𝜏→P\\,\\not\\!\\xrightarrow{\\tau} and Q⟹Q′fragmentsQ⟹Q′Q\\Longrightarrow Q^{\\prime} then also ℛ(P,X,Q′)fragmentsℛ(P,X,Q′)\\R(P,X,Q^{\\prime}). If ℛ(P,Q)fragmentsℛ(P,Q)\\R(P,Q) or ℛ(P,X,Q)fragmentsℛ(P,X,Q)\\R(P,X,Q), P／→τfragmentsP𝜏→P\\,\\not\\!\\xrightarrow{\\tau} and Q／→τfragmentsQ𝜏→Q\\,\\not\\!\\xrightarrow{\\tau} then ℐ(Q)=ℐ(P)fragmentsI(Q)I(P)\\mathcal{I}(Q)=\\mathcal{I}(P). If ℛ(P,X,Q)fragmentsℛ(P,X,Q)\\R(P,X,Q), ℐ(P)∩(X∪{τ})=∅fragmentsI(P)(X{τ})\\mathcal{I}(P)\\cap(X\\cup\\{\\tau\\})=\\emptyset and Q／→τfragmentsQ𝜏→Q\\,\\not\\!\\xrightarrow{\\tau} then ℛ(P,Q)fragmentsℛ(P,Q)\\R(P,Q). If ℛ(P,X,Q)fragmentsℛ(P,X,Q)\\R(P,X,Q) and ℐ(P)∩(X∪{τ})=∅fragmentsI(P)(X{τ})\\mathcal{I}(P)\\cap(X\\cup\\{\\tau\\})=\\emptyset then there is a path Q⟹Q0fragmentsQ⟹Q0Q\\Longrightarrow Q_{0} with ℛ(P,Q0)fragmentsℛ(P,Q0)\\R(P,Q_{0}), Q0／→τfragmentsQ0𝜏→Q_{0}\\,\\not\\!\\xrightarrow{\\tau} and ℐ(Q0)=ℐ(P)fragmentsI(Q0)I(P)\\mathcal{I}(Q_{0})=\\mathcal{I}(P). This is an immediate consequence of the symmetric counterpart of Clause 2.a (where Q𝑄Q takes a τ𝜏\\tau-step).\nWhen that clause yields P⟹P1fragmentsP⟹P1P\\Longrightarrow P_{1} we have P2=PfragmentsP2PP_{2}=P. This is a direct consequence of Clause 1.a or 2.b and its symmetric counterpart. By Clause 2.e there is path Q⟹Q0fragmentsQ⟹Q0Q\\Longrightarrow Q_{0} with Q0／→τfragmentsQ0𝜏→Q_{0}\\,\\not\\!\\xrightarrow{\\tau}. By Claim 1 of this lemma, ℛ(P,X,Q0)fragmentsℛ(P,X,Q0)\\R(P,X,Q_{0}). Thus, by Clause 2.c there is a path Q0⟹Q1fragmentsQ0⟹Q1Q_{0}\\mathbin{\\Longrightarrow}Q_{1} with ℛ(P,Q1)fragmentsℛ(P,Q1)\\R(P,Q_{1}), but Q1=Q0=QfragmentsQ1Q0QQ_{1}\\mathop{=}Q_{0}\\mathop{=}Q since Q／→τfragmentsQ𝜏→Q\\!\\,\\not\\!\\xrightarrow{\\tau}. By Clause 2.e there is path Q⟹Q0fragmentsQ⟹Q0Q\\Longrightarrow Q_{0} with Q0／→τfragmentsQ0𝜏→Q_{0}\\,\\not\\!\\xrightarrow{\\tau}. By Claim 1 of this lemma, ℛ(P,X,Q0)fragmentsℛ(P,X,Q0)\\R(P,X,Q_{0}). That ℐ(Q0)=ℐ(P)fragmentsI(Q0)I(P)\\mathcal{I}(Q_{0})=\\mathcal{I}(P) and ℛ(P,Q0)fragmentsℛ(P,Q0)\\R(P,Q_{0}) follows by Claims 2 and 3 of this lemma. Definition 2.1 enables us to elide some time-outs. Using the process algebra notation to be formally introduced in Section 4, the processes a.t.b.0fragmentsa.t.b.0a.{\\rm t}.b.0 and a.t.t.b.0fragmentsa.t.t.b.0a.{\\rm t}.{\\rm t}.b.0 (as well as a.t.τ.t.b.0fragmentsa.t.τ.t.b.0a.{\\rm t}.\\tau.{\\rm t}.b.0) are branching reactive bisimilar. Both require an unquantified positive but finite amount of rest between the actions a𝑎a and b𝑏b. To support this example, Clause 2.d of Definition 2.1 must allow a single time-out transition of one process to be matched by either zero or multiple time-outs of the other. An alternative definition, treating time-outs more like visible transitions, is obtained by replacing Clause 2.d by if ℐ(P)∩(X∪{τ})=∅fragmentsI(P)(X{τ})\\mathcal{I}(P)\\cap(X\\cup\\{\\tau\\})=\\emptyset and P𝑃P then there is a path Q⟹Q1fragmentsQ⟹Q1Q\\Longrightarrow Q_{1} with ℛ(P′,X,Q2)fragmentsℛ(P′,X,Q2)\\R(P^{\\prime},X,Q_{2}). Requiring that the matching time-out is executable (i.e. ℐ(Q1)∩(X∪{τ})=∅fragmentsI(Q1)(X{τ})\\mathcal{I}(Q_{1})\\cap(X\\cup\\{\\tau\\})=\\emptyset) is not necessary here, as it is implied by the other clauses. Indeed, Lemma 2.11.3, which is not affected by changing Clause 2.d, implies the existence of a path Q⟹Q1／→τfragmentsQ⟹Q1𝜏→Q\\Longrightarrow Q_{1}\\,\\not\\!\\xrightarrow{\\tau} such that ℛ(P,Q1)fragmentsℛ(P,Q1)\\R(P,Q_{1}) and ℐ(Q1)∩(X∪{τ})=∅fragmentsI(Q1)(X{τ})\\mathcal{I}(Q_{1})\\cap(X\\cup\\{\\tau\\})=\\emptyset. Since Q1／→τfragmentsQ1𝜏→Q_{1}\\,\\not\\!\\xrightarrow{\\tau}, ℐ(P)∩(X∪{τ})=∅fragmentsI(P)(X{τ})\\mathcal{I}(P)\\cap(X\\cup\\{\\tau\\})=\\emptyset and P𝑃P, Clause 2d yields Q1fragmentsQ1Q_{1} with ℛ(P′,X,Q2)fragmentsℛ(P′,X,Q2)\\R(P^{\\prime},X,Q_{2}). This version of the definition has been studied  and has properties similar to ↔¯brfragments¯↔fragmentsbr\\mathrel{\\,\\raisebox{2.15277pt}{$\\underline{\\makebox[6.99997pt]{\\raisebox{-1.0pt}[0.0pt][0.0pt]{$\\leftrightarrow$}}}$}\\,_{br}\\!} , which are recapped in Appendix B.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. Generate exactly 40 titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning."
