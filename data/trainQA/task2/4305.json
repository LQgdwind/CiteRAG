      "content": "Paper Title: Open- and Closed-Loop Neural Network Verification using Polynomial Zonotopes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlg. 1 and Alg. 2 both require some special operations on polynomial zonotopes, the implementation of which we present now.

For the Cartesian product used in Line 4 of Alg. 2 we can exploit the special structure of the sets to calculate the Cartesian product of two polynomial zonotopes 𝒫​𝒵1=⟨c1,G1,GI,1,E1⟩P​Z⊂ℝn𝒫subscript𝒵1subscriptsubscript𝑐1subscript𝐺1subscript𝐺𝐼1subscript𝐸1𝑃𝑍superscriptℝ𝑛\\mathcal{PZ}_{1}=\\langle c_{1},G_{1},G_{I,1},E_{1}\\rangle_{PZ}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n} and 𝒫​𝒵2=⟨c2,[G2​G^2],[GI,2​G^I,2],[E1​E2]⟩P​Z⊂ℝo𝒫subscript𝒵2subscriptsubscript𝑐2delimited-[]subscript𝐺2subscript^𝐺2delimited-[]subscript𝐺𝐼2subscript^𝐺𝐼2delimited-[]subscript𝐸1subscript𝐸2𝑃𝑍superscriptℝ𝑜\\mathcal{PZ}_{2}=\\langle c_{2},[G_{2}~{}\\widehat{G}_{2}],[G_{I,2}~{}\\widehat{G}_{I,2}],[E_{1}~{}E_{2}]\\rangle_{PZ}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{o} as In contrast to [25, Prop. 11], this implementation of the Cartesian product explicitly preserves dependencies between the two sets, which is possible since both polynomial zonotopes have identical dependent factors. Computing the exact bounds of a polynomial zonotope in Line 6 of Alg. 1 would be computationally infeasible, especially since this has to be done for each neuron in the network. We therefore compute a tight enclosure of the bounds instead, which can be done very efficiently: (Interval enclosure) Given a polynomial zonotope 𝒫​𝒵=⟨c,G,GI,E⟩P​Z⊂ℝn𝒫𝒵subscript𝑐𝐺subscript𝐺𝐼𝐸𝑃𝑍superscriptℝ𝑛\\mathcal{PZ}=\\langle c,G,\\linebreak[ref]3G_{I},E\\rangle_{PZ}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n}, an enclosing interval can be computed as with where x​mod​y𝑥mod𝑦x\\,\\mathrm{mod}\\,y, x,y∈ℕ0𝑥𝑦subscriptℕ0x,y\\in\\mathbb{N}_{0} is the modulo operation and ∖\\setminus denotes the set difference. We first enclose the polynomial zonotope by a zonotope 𝒵⊇𝒫​𝒵𝒫𝒵𝒵\\mathcal{Z}\\supseteq\\mathcal{PZ} according to [25, Prop. 5], and then compute an interval enclosure ℐ⊇𝒵𝒵ℐ\\mathcal{I}\\supseteq\\mathcal{Z} of this zonotope according to [1, Prop. 2.2]. The core operation for Alg. 1 is the computation of the image through a quadratic function. While it is possible to obtain the exact image by introducing new dependent factors, we compute a tight enclosure for computational reasons: (Image quadratic function) Given a polynomial zonotope 𝒫​𝒵=⟨c,G,GI,E⟩P​Z⊂ℝ𝒫𝒵subscript𝑐𝐺subscript𝐺𝐼𝐸𝑃𝑍ℝ\\mathcal{PZ}=\\langle c,G,\\linebreak[ref]3G_{I},E\\rangle_{PZ}\\subset\\mathbb{R} and a quadratic function g​(x)=a1​x2+a2​x+a3𝑔𝑥subscript𝑎1superscript𝑥2subscript𝑎2𝑥subscript𝑎3g(x)=a_{1}\\,x^{2}+a_{2}\\,x+a_{3} with a1,a2,a3,x∈ℝsubscript𝑎1subscript𝑎2subscript𝑎3𝑥ℝa_{1},a_{2},a_{3},x\\in\\mathbb{R}, the image of 𝒫​𝒵𝒫𝒵\\mathcal{PZ} through g​(x)𝑔𝑥g(x) can be tightly enclosed by with where and the squares in G2superscript𝐺2G^{2} as well as GI2superscriptsubscript𝐺𝐼2G_{I}^{2} are interpreted elementwise.
