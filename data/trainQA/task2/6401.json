      "content": "Paper Title: LaDe: The First Comprehensive Last-mile Delivery Dataset from Industry\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLaDe contains the package data with information that records when and where the package order is placed. Based on this, the package number of a region within a certain period can be calculated. In this way, LaDe also contributes as a new dataset to another well-known task – spatio-temporal graph forecasting [ref]18 [ref]19 , which aims to predict future graph signals given its historical observations.

Dataset. LaDe-P is used to conduct this experiment. More experiment details can be found in Appendix B.3. Each node corresponds to a region within the city. The signal of each node represents the number of packages picked up during a particular time stamp. We set the time interval to be 1 hour. Our objective is to leverage the data from the previous 24 hours to predict the package volume for the subsequent 24 hours. We use the ratio of 6:2:2 for training, evaluation, and testing sets based on the chronological order of the timestamps. Baselines & Hyperparameters. We evaluate eight baselines, including a traditional method (i.e., HA [ref]35), and recent deep learning models, including DCRNN [ref]18, STGCN , GWNET , ASTGCN , MTGNN , AGCRN  and STGNCDE . We set the hidden size, learning rate, and batch size to 32, 0.001, and 32 for all models. Results. MAE and RMSE are used as the metrics, and results are shown in Table 5. Comparing the methods, we can observe that the baseline method, HA (Historical Average), achieves relatively higher MAE and RMSE values across all three cities. This indicates that simply using historical averages to predict future spatio-temporal graph data is not as effective as the other methods. The results of the different methods may vary slightly depending on the city. For instance, in Shanghai, GWNET, ASTGCN, and MTGNN exhibit similar performance, while in Hangzhou and Chongqing, MTGNN and ASTGCN achieve the lowest errors, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: on this, the package number of a region within a certain period can be calculated.
