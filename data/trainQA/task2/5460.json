      "content": "Paper Title: Sample Dropout: A Simple yet Effective Variance Reduction Technique in Deep Policy Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPolicy optimization methods in deep reinforcement learning\nhave achieved notable success in a variety of applications,\nincluding complicated board games [ref]1,\nhigh-dimensional robotic controls ,\nand challenging modern video games  [ref]4   .\nThis family of methods features in an iterative update procedure,\nwith simultaneously a surrogate objective to optimize\nand a trust region constraint to enforce in each iteration    [ref]11 .\nThe surrogate objective prescribes a practical objective to maximize,\nfor which the policy is directly optimized through multiple epochs with empirical samples.\nThe trust region constraint, on the other hand, specifies an explicit constraint over the update step-size,\nwhich can be implemented as either KL divergence  or ratio deviations .\nCombined, the policy optimization is guaranteed a monotonic improvement . One intriguing feature in the surrogate objective is the use of policy ratios.\nSpecifically, the theory in the seminal work \nstrictly requires the surrogate objective to be estimated over the on-policy distribution\n– the distribution that is induced by the policy to be optimized.\nThis requirement significantly increases the sample complexity\nbecause the samples can only be used once in each iteration [ref]11.\nTrust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)  and the follow-up studies,\nincluding Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)[ref]11 and Early Stopping Policy Optimization (ESPO) ,\nleverage the importance sampling scheme to re-formulate the objective estimate with respect to an off-policy distribution\n– the distribution from which the samples are collected,\nwhich yields importance ratios in the surrogate objective.\nNamely, in practical optimization,\nthe surrogate objective is empirically estimated with samples generated by a different policy\nand then re-weighted via the importance weights,\ni.e., the policy ratios between the policy to be optimized and the policy used to collect samples.\nThe use of this importance sampling enables the sample reuse through multiple optimization epochs\nand significantly improves the sample efficiency. However, we show in this paper that the use of importance sampling does not come for free:\nthe variance introduced by this importance sampling to the objective estimate could be very high in each iteration\nand would consequently jeopardize the effectiveness of the surrogate objective optimization.\nWe prove in a principled way that the variance in the importance sampling estimate grows quadratically with policy ratios.\nThis side-effect is detrimental to the policy optimization\nsince the importance sampling subjective may not be a valid substitute for the true surrogate objective.\nThe monotonic improvement guarantee can thus no longer hold even if the trust region constraint is satisfied.\nMany works point out a fact that the ratio clipping can fail to enforce the trust region     ,\nbut largely overlook this detrimental high variance in the policy optimization. We propose a simple technique to overcome the high variance in the surrogate objective estimate, called sample dropout.\nWe first present an analysis for the variance in the objective estimate\nthrough deriving an upper bound of the variance, which involves a quadratic term of policy ratios.\nThis theoretical result indicates that the variance of estimating the true surrogate objective could grow quadratically with the importance ratios.\nTo alleviate this quadratic growth,\nwe propose the sample dropout technique, which discards samples when their ratio deviation is too large.\nBy doing so, the ratios can be bounded and consequently a low variance can be achieved for the objective estimate. Our technique is simple to implement and can be easily combined with existing policy optimization algorithms.\nWe instantiate it on a range of representative policy optimization algorithms, including TRPO , PPO [ref]11, and ESPO .\nWe evaluate our proposed method in many high-dimensional continuous control benchmarks as well as discrete-action environments\nand show that our technique consistently improves a wide range of representative policy optimization algorithms across a variety of benchmarks. We summarize our contributions as follows:\n1) We prove that the use of importance sampling could introduce high variance to the objective estimate, which potentially harms the surrogate objective optimization.\n2) We propose sample dropout, a simple yet very effective technique for variance reduction that can be easily integrated into many existing policy optimization methods.\n3) We demonstrate that the proposed method consistently improves the performance of a wide range of policy optimization algorithms across many benchmarks including MuJoCo , DeepMind Control Suites  and Atari games .\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Policy optimization methods in deep reinforcement learning\nhave achieved notable success in a variety of applications,\nincluding complicated board games [ref]1,\nhigh-dimensional robotic controls ,\nand challenging modern video games  [ref]4   .\nThis family of methods features in an iterative update procedure,\nwith simultaneously a surrogate objective\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
