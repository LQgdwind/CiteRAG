      "content": "Paper Title: Transductive Visual Verb Sense Disambiguation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEvery language has ambiguous words, e.g., in English, the word apple can be referred to as either an IT company, a fruit, or a city.\nWord Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a common task in natural language processing , where the goal is to automatically recognize the correct sense of a word within a sentence. Verb Sense Disambiguation (VSD) is a sub-problem of WSD where the correct sense of a verb in a sentence is aimed to be identified .\nFor instance, while\nthe most common sense of the verb run is the one related to moving quickly,\nit might have a different sense regarding to its context, such as the one\nrelated to machine operations (the washing machine is running) or covering a distance (this train runs hundreds of miles every day); all these senses share the same verb, but they have quite different meanings. VSD is an utmost important task, affecting different domains. For example, in an NLP retrieval scenario, it is required the search engine to group\nthe results by senses, hence disambiguate the verb senses in queries to retrieve the correct results [ref]8. VSD also takes an important role in other NLP tasks such as, machine translation , semantic role labeling  and question answering . In addition to the typical NLP tasks, VSD can be brought to a Computer Vision (CV) domain, taking into account problems like Action Recognition (AR) and Human Object Interaction (HOI)  ;\nthe authors exploit the identification of objects and entities in an image to infer either the action that is being performed or the correct verb that links those entities and objects. Even if there are some clear overlappings between VSD and AR/HOI, the latter do not take into account the ambiguity of verbs.\nThe analogy between these tasks in NLP and CV fields can be exploited by combining the features of both domains to improve a disambiguation system’s overall performances. Motivated by this fact, recently, 2 introduced the Visual Verb Sense Disambiguation (VVSD). In a VVSD task, the goal is to disambiguate the sense of a verb paired with an image.\nDifferently from a standard NLP disambiguation task, in which the context is provided by a phrase, here the context is provided by an image. In 2 the authors proposed the first (and only) well curated dataset to assess algorithms’ performances for VVSD tasks. The reported baselines comprise both supervised and unsupervised models using both unimodal (textual or visual) and multimodal features (textual and visual). Annotating a dataset for this task is very expensive, since it requires both non-trivial language and visual knowledge .\nToward this direction, in this work, we tackle the multimodal VVSD problem, offering a new perspective based on semi-supervised learning which brings significant performance gain at a lower labeling-cost.\nThe strength of SSL\nalgorithms arises when the available labeled set size is not significant to train a fully-supervised classifier or when annotating a full dataset is too expensive or unfeasible. In SSL, only a small amount of labeled data is needed because both labeled and the unlabeled samples embeddings are exploited during inference.\nThus, we assume to have a small amount of labeled data (<<image,verb>> and its sense) to infer the senses of the unlabeled ones. Among the possible SSL algorithms , we choose a game-theoretic model called Graph Transduction Games (GTG) 1. The GTG has been succesfully applied in many different SSL contexts, like deep metric learning 0, matrix factorization , image recognition , protein-function prediction [ref]39 and, indeed, traditional text-based WSD setting . Moreover, it works consistently better  than other graph-based SSL methods like Label Propagation  and Gaussian Fields . Our contributions are thus three-fold: We proposed a new model for multimodal visual verb sense disambiguation based on semisupervised learning. We reported an extensive ablation study on the effect of using an increasing number of labeled data. We outperformed the state-of-the-art by a large margin exploiting only a small fraction of labeled data.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: domains.
