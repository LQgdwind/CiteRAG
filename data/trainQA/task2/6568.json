      "content": "Paper Title: LakeBench: Benchmarks for Data Discovery over Data Lakes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEnterprises keep critical data in data lakes–large repositories of tabular data–and, for both governance and analytics , they need to find related tables within the lake, e.g. unionable, joinable, and tables that are subsets of each other.\nSuch data discovery enhances decision-making processes, statistical analysis, training machine learning models, and more . Large language models have been adapted to tabular tasks  . Also, foundation models have been pretrained with tabular datasets [ref]10  4 5. But downstream tasks have mostly focused on either table metadata or queries over individual cells.\nAs a recent work surveyed , such tasks include table-based fact checking, question answering over a single table, converting natural language to SQL, table retrieval for a given question, table cell content population, and table metadata prediction. These tasks, while useful, do not address data navigation in a data lake. Finding related tables is challenging because crucial metadata is often absent , or suffers from issues of ambiguity, inconsistency, and imprecision. For instance, without context, it is unclear if a column Name holds individuals’ names or city names. Also, a table name uubd-eei2_t_pos_1.csv gives no hint as to its content. Thus, it is hard to find relevant tables unless tables are contextualized, and metadata semantics is understood. Existing tabular foundation models\nmay help [ref]10  4 5, but we need data (table) discovery benchmarks over data lakes to understand their performance. Existing benchmarks target mostly web tables  or non-public data (see a survey of datasets ). Such data is unlike enterprise data: e.g., web tables\noften have few rows and columns to ease human consumption . Furthermore, they focus on entities popular on the web (e.g., football teams). Since language models are often trained on unstructured versions of that data, their performance on such tables may not generalize to enterprise data, where entities are often highly domain-specific, contain cryptic code words, and have a lot of numerical information. In this work, our contributions are as follows: We present LakeBench, a collection of new benchmarks for table unionability , table joinability , and table subset tasks. LakeBench contains tables from a variety of sources: open government data from CKAN and Socrata, economic data from the European Central Bank , Spider 6, and synthesized data from large knowledge graphs such as Wikidata 2. The benchmarks cover binary classification, regression, and multi-label classification. Using new benchmarks, we evaluate four existing tabular foundation models, along with a BERT-based baseline . Existing tabular foundation models generally perform much worse on our data navigation benchmarks than the tasks they were designed for. We show there is significant room for improvement over the new benchmarks. We will make the benchmarks and our code base publicly available111The datasets have been cleared for legal use and will be shared at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8014643. More details on the code and data and how to reproduce our baseline results can be found in the supplementary material.\nas a resource to the community to spur the development of foundation models for data lake navigation.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: statistical analysis, training machine learning models, and more .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
