      "content": "Paper Title: Predicting Deterioration in Mild Cognitive Impairment with Survival Transformers, Extreme Gradient Boosting and Cox Proportional Hazard Modelling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis study aimed to further explore the potential of survival-based ML as a tool for predicting time to AD diagnosis. This paper demonstrates the clear utility of such methods when predicting on the ADNI dataset. This supports the work of  and thus provides further support for the utility of these survival based techniques in the context of dementia prediction modelling. Furthermore, this study also aimed to explore the value of blood-derived biomarkers as predictors in survival-based machine learning and deep learning techniques. Although a number of recent studies have provided evidence for the utility of blood-derived biomarkers in Alzheimer’s modelling [ref]29, as far as we are aware, this work is the first to use these biomarkers for survival-based modelling. As has been mentioned by  these biomarkers would allow a much less invasive way of alerting clinicians and patients to the risk of cognitive decline. If we are also able to predict, not just a binary outcome indicating AD or not, but also the risk of deterioration as a function of time, we are both able to provide more information to clinicians and patients, whilst also providing a better experience through minimally invasive data collection. The current study is therefore a demonstration of good predictive ability, using survival-based techniques and minimally invasive biomarkers. This both lends support for survival based techniques, supporting the work of  and , and for the use of blood derived biomarkers in these models, supporting the work of . A further novelty for this paper is the use of a survival-based transformer to predict deterioration in the context of AD. Although there is a small but growing body of literature adapting transformers for survival modelling [ref]32 the present work is the first to apply these techniques to predict deterioration in AD. To that end, this study demonstrated that survival-based transformers have superior performance when compared to survival-based extreme gradient boosting and the standard Cox Proportional Hazards model. This result is notable as previous work which have compared tree-based and neural network-based survival techniques have found that the less complex tree-based methods have performed better than deep learning methods . However, previous work using survival deep learning to predict on deterioration in dementia have focused on recurrent or convolutional neural networks. Survival transformers adopt a wholly different approach, using multiheaded attention and treating each participant as a ’sentence’ where each ’word’ is the interaction between the participant and time . Thus, the transformer attempts to predict the complement of the hazard function for all participants at all points in time . Transformers, therefore, represent a new and substantially different approach to all survival based deep learning techniques that have previously been proposed. This may explain why this technique appears superior to the other deep learning techniques presented in the literature. However, transformers are computationally intensive, even when compared to other neural network techniques. If they are to be implemented in health infrastructure and practices, the intensive training required for the models needs to be taken into consideration. Furthermore, inference is difficult with transformers as it is challenging to see how predictions are reached. This means clinicians and researchers are unable to observe potentially modifiable risk factors which increase the risk of AD. Although this paper presents work with several aspects of novelty, the study contains a number of limitations. Firstly, the Bayesian Optimisation technique was employed for hyperparameter tuning for the survival-based models where appropriate. Due to time and computational limitations, the search for optimal hyperparameters using this technique was not exhaustive and it is possible that subsequent work may improve on the current results using different combinations of hyperparameters. Secondly, the sample used in this work is comparatively small, with just 385 observations and 200 candidate predictors. It is essential, therefore, that this work be validated on larger datasets before being adopted into healthcare practice and decision making. Finally, as has been mentioned elsewhere  ADNI is a US based study with roughly 80% white participants. Future validational work for these models should therefore seek to employ non white western datasets to test how well the models perform on these groups.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: in survival-based machine learning and deep learning techniques.
