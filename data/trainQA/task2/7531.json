      "content": "Paper Title: Objective and Interpretable Breast Cosmesis Evaluation with Attention Guided Denoising Diffusion Anomaly Detection Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAdvancements in anomaly detection have been significantly driven by unsupervised learning methods, which are trained on normal data and utilize scoring mechanisms to identify anomalies, or data points that deviate significantly from the norm . These techniques can be categorized into feature-based and reconstruction-based methods. Feature-based methods employ self-supervised learning to acquire image features and detect anomalies by identifying differences in feature representations between normal and abnormal samples. Notable early work in this field includes DN2 [ref]5, which utilized simple ResNets pretrained on ImageNet. Recent approaches have expanded upon this model. For example, PaDiM  employs locally constrained bag-of-features, SPADE 1 utilizes a memory bank of extracted features, and PatchCore [ref]36 incorporates a memory bank with neighborhood-aware patch-level features. Reconstruction-based methods capitalize on the ability of models to accurately reconstruct normal data while exhibiting higher reconstruction errors for anomalies, using the extent of reconstruction error as an anomaly indicator. Early efforts utilized Variational Autoencoders  to detect anomalies in skin disease images but were hindered by blurry reconstructions. The advent of GANs gave rise to models such as AnoGAN  and Ganomaly , which leveraged the increased reconstruction errors of GANs for abnormal data, surpassing prior SOTA models in anomaly detection. However, GANs faced difficulties with high-resolution images, poor reconstruction quality, and unstable training. Recently, denoising diffusion models have gained increased attention for generating various data types due to their ability to produce high-quality images. This led to their application in anomaly detection. In the medical field, AnoDDPM demonstrated that diffusion models , when employing simplex noise instead of Gaussian noise, outperformed GANs in anomaly detection. Similarly, DiffusionAD , which utilizes two sub-networks for denoising and segmentation, further exemplified the success of diffusion models in this domain. Concurrently,  introduced DDAD, a novel method employing a target image-conditioned denoising process for reconstruction, thereby eliminating the need for sub-networks.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: learning to acquire image features and detect anomalies by identifying differences in feature representations between normal and abnormal samples.
