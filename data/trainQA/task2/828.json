      "content": "Paper Title: Dialogue-adaptive Language Model Pre-training From Quality Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPre-trained language models (PrLMs) have achieved impressive performance in a series of natural language processing tasks. Some prominent examples of PrLMs are BERT , GPT [ref]2, XLNet [ref]3, RoBERTa , ERNIE  , ALBERT  and ELECTRA . They can also be used in more expansive fields like Bioinformatics  0.\nThe PrLMs are commonly employed through a pre-training then fine-tuning paradigm: the models are first trained on large-scale unlabeled task-independent corpora with general training objectives, like masked language modeling (MLM) 1 or next sentence prediction (NSP) , to learn universal language representations; then, the trained models are fine-tuned on the smaller datasets of downstream tasks by leveraging extra task-specific modules for adaption.\nHowever, the learned universal language representations for dialogue tasks would not sufficiently and accurately cover the dialogue-aware features because the literary style of dialogues and plain texts varies dramatically. More specifically, as opposed to general plain texts, dialogue involves multiple speakers, intentions, topics; thus, the utterances are full of transitions. As a result, directly fine-tuning PrLMs on the dialogue datasets would be sub-optimal to model dialogues that contain exclusive attributes. To help PrLMs adapt to dialogue-related tasks, recent studies have investigated further dialogue-adaptive pre-training on PrLMs before fine-tuning them on dialogue tasks. 2 pre-trained GPT further with a conventional Language Model (LM) objective on a large dialogue corpus, Reddit, and get DialoGPT for response generation tasks; 3 and 4 pre-trained BERT with Mask Language Model (MLM) objective on the target datasets before fine-tuning on response selection tasks. Besides merely pre-training on dialogue datasets with general objectives, some\nstudies propose particular auxiliary tasks or objectives for dialogue-adaptive pre-training. Notably, 5 proposed a response contrastive loss to match the context with the corresponding response and distinguish from the randomly sampled negative response. 6 employed auxiliary objectives to measure the utterance consistency of a dialogue session and restore the corrupted utterances when fine-tuning models for response selection tasks. Despite the progress made by the methods mentioned above, the guideline of dialogue-adaptive pre-training is still not fully exploited, especially for open-domain dialogues as the main focus of this work. The major focus of existing dialogue-adaptive pre-training strategies revolves around merely one attribute, coherence, either on token-level or sentence-level. Therefore, the previous studies can be referred to as coherence-oriented objectives 6, which are commonly implemented in a discriminative way: corrupting the dialogue context by masking, randomly sampling, or re-ordering as negative samples, and restoring the original context as the positive ones. As opposed to written language texts, dialogues, as spoken language texts, are full of redundant or uninformative utterances. As it is pointed out by recent dialogue evaluation studies 7 8 9  , estimating whether an open-domain dialogue is informative is also essential for assessing its quality, which motivates us to improve dialogue-adaptive pre-training by considering informativeness to better simulate dialogue-specific characteristics. In addition, measuring the informativeness of the utterance would provide a more fine-grained self-supervision like informativeness degree during training, and guide the model to get rid of meaningless utterances. Therefore, in this work, we make a first attempt to bridge comprehensive dialogue quality estimation and pre-training and present dialogue-adaptive pre-training objectives (DAPO) by considering the salient characteristics, including coherence and specificity. The overall workflow of utilizing DAPO and the comparison between existing methods are shown in Figure 1. A detailed explanation of the terms are shown as follows: coherence: whether a dialogue is coherent in its semantics and logic so that readers feel easy to read it. specificity: whether the tokens, phrases, and expressions in a dialogue are specific and diverse to avoid being dull and monotonous. As the foundation for model pre-training, we first synthesize a new open-domain dialogue corpus used for pre-training with each dialogue in it as a positive sample to facilitate discriminative pre-training. Inspired by   , we propose coherence-oriented context corruption, including utterance ordering, utterance insertion and utterance replacement, to generate incoherent dialogues as negative samples.111The negative samples are scored as 0 while the positive ones as 1. Next, we do specificity-oriented automatic rescoring by multiplying the scores of positive samples with a token-specificity coefficient measured by n-gram normalized inverse document frequency (N-NIDF) to further distinguish the samples by quantifying how specific they are. Finally, the PrLMs are trained on all these unsupervised annotated samples with a regression task.222Our codes are publicly available in https://github.com/lockon-n/DAPO. In summary, our contributions in the paper are three-fold: We bridge the gap between dialogue-adaptive pre-training and dialogue estimation to facilitate a new research line of dialogue-adaptive pre-training from quality estimation by considering the salient characteristics, including coherence and informativeness. To simulate dialogue-specific features, we propose dialogue-adaptive pre-training objectives\nincluding coherence-oriented context corruption and token-specificity rescoring, for open-domain dialogue modeling; We empirically verify that the quality estimation methods improve PrLMs on both response selection and quality evaluation tasks by modeling the diverse aspects of dialogue-related characteristics.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Pre-trained language models (PrLMs) have achieved impressive performance in a series of natural language processing tasks.
