      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Directly-Trained Spiking Neural Networks for Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nObject detection is a key and challenging problem in computer vision. It aims to recognize multiple overlapped objects and locate them with precise bounding boxes. This task has many applications in various fields, such as autonomous driving [ref]3, security surveillance , and medical imaging . Most existing frameworks (e.g., YOLO series , RCNN series ) for object detection use artificial neural networks (ANNs), which have high performance but also high computational complexity and energy consumption. Spiking neural networks (SNNs), known as the third generation of neural networks  [ref]39, potentially serves as a more efficient and biologically inspired way to perform object detection. Specifically, SNNs utilize binary signals (spikes) instead of continuous signals for neuron communication, which reduces data transfer and storage overhead. Furthermore, the SNNs exhibit asynchronous computation and event-driven communication, which could avoid unnecessary computation and synchronization overhead. When deployed on neuromorphic hardware  , SNNs show great energy efficiency. However, most SNNs for object detection are converted from ANNs, which have some limitations. For example, Spiking-Yolo  2 needs at least 3500 time steps to match the performance of the original ANN. Spike Calibration  can reduce the time steps to hundreds, but it still depends on the performance of the original ANN model. Moreover, most methods for converted SNNs are only applicable for static images, and not suitable for sparse event datas, because their dynamics are designed to approximate the expected activation of the ANN and fail to capture the spatiotemporal information of DVS data . A promising approach is to train SNNs directly with surrogate gradient, which can achieve high performance with few time steps and process both static images and event data efficiently. Another challenge is to deal with the multi-scale object features in object detection, which demands the network has sufficient representation capability. Correspondingly, deep structure training is needed. Existing models on object detection are limited to shallow structures  or hybrid structures   that may not be deployed on some neuromorphic hardware   9 where only spike operation is allowed. To achieve deep direct training of SNNs, Hu et al.  and Fang et al.  explored on classification tasks and proposed MS-ResNet and SEW-ResNet respectively to overcome the vanishing/exploding gradient problems and advanced the directly-trained SNNs to depths greater than 100 layers. Unfortunately, multi-scale transformation of channels and dimensions when extracting features of objects of different sizes will cause the problem of increased energy consumption due to non-spike convolutional operations in their networks to be prominent in the object detection task. Therefore, the problem of high energy consumption caused by the non-spike convolutional operations urgently needs to be addressed. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel directly trained SNN for object detection based on the YOLO framework (EMS-YOLO). Our model is the first to use surrogate gradients to train a deep and large-scale SNN for object detection without converting from ANNs. Specially, to deal with the multi-scale object features in object detection, we design a new full-spike energy-efficient residual block, EMS-ResNet, that avoids redundant MAC operations caused by non-spike convolution. Our model can achieve high performance with few time steps and handle both static images and event data efficiently. Compared with other converted or hybrid SNNs for object detection, our model has higher performance and lower energy consumption. Our major contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: We propose EMS-YOLO, a novel directly trained spiking neural network for object detection, which could achieve better performance than the advanced ANN-SNN conversion methods while requiring only 4 time steps and inferencing in real time. We design an Energy-efficient Membrane-Shortcut ResNet, EMS-ResNet, that enables full spiking in the network thus reducing power consumption. Moreover, we theoretically analyze that it can be trained deeply since it avoids gradient disappearance or explosion. The experiments on COCO and the Gen1 Datasets demonstrate that our models could achieve comparable performance to the ANN with the same architecture meanwhile reducing 5.83×5.83\\times energy consumption.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: in computer vision.
