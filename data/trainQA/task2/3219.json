      "content": "Paper Title: CGIBNet: Bandwidth-constrained Communication with Graph Information Bottleneck in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n1) Policy-based MARL: Independent actor-critic (IAC)  is the simplest multi-agent policy gradient method, which treats each agent as an independent learner. For each agent i𝑖i, the main idea is to directly adjust the parameters θisubscript𝜃𝑖\\theta_{i} of the actor policy πisubscript𝜋𝑖\\pi_{i} in order to maximize the objective by taking steps in the direction of its gradient. By the policy gradient theorem [ref]25, the gradient of the objective is where 𝔼πi​[⋅]subscript𝔼subscript𝜋𝑖delimited-[]⋅\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi_{i}}[\\cdot] represents the sampled training data produced by the current policy πisubscript𝜋𝑖\\pi_{i}. Ai​(oi,ai)subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝑜𝑖subscript𝑎𝑖A_{i}(o_{i},a_{i}) represents the advantage function.\nHowever, the decision-making of each agent is influenced by the non-stationarity problem [ref]36 in multi-agent systems, so the advantage function based on local information oisubscript𝑜𝑖o_{i} may be estimated inaccurately.\nA reasonable alternative is the centralized advantage function Ai​(s,𝒂)subscript𝐴𝑖𝑠𝒂A_{i}(s,\\bm{a}) that incorporates global information s𝑠s and 𝒂𝒂\\bm{a} to alleviate this problem. Further, to reuse historical data, importance sampling is applied in (1), as where 𝔼πi,old​[⋅]subscript𝔼subscript𝜋𝑖olddelimited-[]⋅\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi_{i,{\\rm old}}}[\\cdot] represents the sampled training data produced by the old policy πi,oldsubscript𝜋𝑖old\\pi_{i,{\\rm old}} and ρi=πi​(oi|ai)/πi,old​(oi|ai)subscript𝜌𝑖subscript𝜋𝑖conditionalsubscript𝑜𝑖subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝜋𝑖oldconditionalsubscript𝑜𝑖subscript𝑎𝑖\\rho_{i}=\\pi_{i}(o_{i}|a_{i})/\\pi_{i,{\\rm old}}(o_{i}|a_{i}) represents the importance weight to correct the bias.\nUnfortunately, (2) would lead to an excessively large policy update if without constraints. To penalize changes of policy and ensure the efficiency of importance sampling, Yu et al.  propose a multi-agent version of the clipped PPO [ref]38 where ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon is a hyperparameter to control the feasible range of the policy update. In this article, MAPPO will be used as one of the basic MARL frameworks for multi-agent communication. 2) Value-based MARL: Value decomposition is a popular technical line in the value-based MARL , among which QMIX  is a representative work.\nIt assumes that the total action-value function Qt​o​tsubscript𝑄𝑡𝑜𝑡Q_{tot} can be decomposed into individual action-value functions Qisubscript𝑄𝑖Q_{i}, which satisfies the following relation Further, the authors observe this representation can be generalized to the larger family of monotonic functions that are also sufficient but not necessary to satisfy (4). Monotonicity can be enforced through the constraint QMIX uses a mixer hypernetwork  to implement this constraint. Then all network parameters can be optimized by a Q𝑄Q-learning style  loss function as follows where yt​o​t=r+γ​max𝒂′⁡Qt​o​t−​(s′,o1′,…,a1′,…)subscript𝑦𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑟𝛾subscriptsuperscript𝒂′superscriptsubscript𝑄𝑡𝑜𝑡superscript𝑠′superscriptsubscript𝑜1′…superscriptsubscript𝑎1′…y_{tot}=r+\\gamma\\max_{\\bm{a}^{\\prime}}Q_{tot}^{-}(s^{\\prime},o_{1}^{\\prime},\\dots,a_{1}^{\\prime},\\dots) and\n(⋅)−superscript⋅(\\cdot)^{-} represents target networks. (⋅)′superscript⋅′(\\cdot)^{\\prime} represents the variable at the next timestep. In this article, we choose QMIX as one MARL framework for the evaluation of communication modules.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: the parameters θisubscript𝜃𝑖\\theta_{i} of the actor policy πisubscript𝜋𝑖\\pi_{i} in order to maximize the objective by taking steps in the direction of its gradient.
