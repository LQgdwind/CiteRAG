      "content": "Paper Title: Foundations for Grassroots Democratic Metaverse\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe consider issues that need to be addressed for the coding of digital social contracts for democratic governance, namely democratic DAOs. Democratic DAOs are related to today’s DAOs  , but with important differences: Today’s DAOs are usually among anonymous accounts, or wallets; their governance is typically plutocratic (one coin – one vote; or one coin – square-root vote, as in quadratic voting ); it is executed by anonymous third parties – miners that require remuneration (gas); and it is executed on a predetermined platform and protocol. In contrast, a democratic DAO is among digitally identified individuals; its intended governance is democratic; it is executed by its participants; it is amenable to encompassing constitutional governance, as every aspect of the digital social contract, including the underlying protocol of execution as well as the democratic decision process itself, may be subject to democratic amendment. The challenges of encoding a practical democratic DAO are immense, as it requires formalizing and integrating all aspects of digital democratic governance. These include: sybil-resilient social choice theory that allows a digital community to govern itself democratically despite a bounded penetration of sybils  ; digital constitutional governance, which provides for the constitutional democratic governance of a digital community, including the democratic amendment of the constitution itself ;\nsybil-resilient community formation, which provides for constitutionally-instated sybil-resilient community admission and expulsion protocols; effective egalitarian decision making, in which members are equal as proposers, discussants, coalition-builders and voters, addressing elections, legislation, and budgeting within a uniform framework  ;\ndemocratic coalition formation, merging, and forking, which includes democratic procedures for deliberation and coalition formation within a community , and for deciding on the merging of communities and the forking of a community [ref]11 [ref]1. ‘On-Chain’ Constitutional Governance:\nLeading cryptocurrencies employ an informal governance process that often causes so-called hard forks , in which an off-chain social decision process results in the previous protocol being abandoned by some or all of the participants; and a new protocol is initialized, ideally in a state (e.g. account balances) that reflects the state of all participants in the abandoned protocol. On-chain governance 1 aims to avoid hard forks by providing a decision process in which the cryptocurrency’s protocol can be amended ‘from within’ according to the rules of the protocol itself. On-chain governance of cryptocurrencies is an open challenge ,\nin particular as the governance shall not be limited only to the contract (e.g., as in Ethereum), but shall include governing the platform itself.\nA recent work  provides an initial axiomatization of relevant constitutional amendments and corresponding algorithmic methods, by considering a multiagent system of agents with preferences over the constitution. Research challenges: Developing the theory of democratic amendments of governance procedures, including the constitution itself. Suggesting social choice mechanisms for on-chain forking, following recent work . Sybil-Resilient Social Choice Theory:\nA cornerstone of the democratic metaverse is the ability to make joint community decisions. Viewing elections and voting as a standard tool for making joint community decisions, it is natural to look at computational social choice (COMSOC)  for answers;\nbut keeping in mind that the problem of sybils poses a serious threat to any online community wishing to use some of these mechanisms:\nAs a simple example, consider a community of 100100100 agents, out of which 515151 are sybils (i.e., fake accounts);\nthen, if a single binary decision is to be made – for which the majority rule is a natural choice 4 – then the sybils effectively “control” the election. More generally, in any classical (non-sybil-resilient) voting scheme, a single sybil may tilt the decision or the elections result. More concretely, a sybil-resilient election consists of a community of n𝑛n agents, out of which at most a σ𝜎\\sigma-fraction of the agents are sybils; and a sybil-resilient voting rule gets a corresponding set of n𝑛n votes—without knowing which of the votes are from the sybils—and shall output an election winner, while satisfying some form of sybil safety.\nCOMSOC has yet to consider the problem of sybils in earnest for its methods and results to be applicable for a digital democracy; but there is some initial progress in that direction:\nTo define sybil-resiliency, Shahaf et al. 3 and Meir et al.  follow reality-aware social choice  in treating reality (i.e., the status quo) as a distinguished alternative that must always be present. Based on this, sybil safety requires that the status quo should change only if a majority among the non-sybils support the change; and sybil liveness requires that the status quo can be changed even if all the sybils oppose the change. They show that supermajority voting rules—for various degrees of supermajority used—can satisfy both sybil safety and liveness, provided the fraction of sybils is below 1/313\\nicefrac{{1}}{{3}}.\nSlightly farther away, the works of Tran et al.  and Waggoner et al.  (as well as others), can be viewed as showing some theoretical impossibility results regarding the possibility of voting rules that are resistent to sybils. Research Challenges: Evaluating the theoretical lower bounds on the supermajority degree that guarantees certain safety-liveness tradeoffs practically. Studying sybil-resiliency for further COMSOC settings, such as multiwinner elections 0, participatory budgeting , and constitutional amendments  . Practical Egalitarian Decision Making:\nPractical decision making mechanisms are critical for the success of democratic DAOs. Research Challenges: Developing egalitarian decision making procedures, in which members are equal as proposers, discussants, negotiators, coalition-builders, and voters , addressing elections, legislation, and budgeting within a uniform framework , to facilitate egalitarian and effective democratic governance. Investigating democratic coalition formation, merging, and forking, that are democratic procedures for deliberation and coalition formation within a community , and for deciding on the merging of communities and the forking of a community [ref]11 [ref]1. Developing unified, generic decision making processes that can encompass different COMSOC settings, similarly to metric-based aggregation methods, that, together with metric embeddings for these different social choice settings, may be useful ), particularly if it can also be integrated with a uniform process for deliberation, voting, and ad-hoc coalition formation  3. Grassroots Community Formation:\nGiven adequate sybil-resilient voting rules, a digital community can tolerate some sybils, but not so if the fraction of sybils is too large (specifically above 1/313\\nicefrac{{1}}{{3}} ). Considering the dynamic nature of community formation, the question arises how can a digital community grow while retaining a bounded-fraction of sybils? This relates to sybil identification  and prevention 3 1. First, one has to distinguish between genuine personal identifiers and sybils 5:\nEssentially, genuine personal identifiers are unique and singular, while while sybils are either duplicate or fake. Put differently, an honest person would only declare a single identifier as their genuine personal identifier (or declare a new identifier as a replacement, e.g. if their private key was lost or compromised), while a dishonest (‘Byzantine’) person would peddle sybils – they would create multiple identifiers and claim each of them to be their own genuine personal identifier (duplicates); create identifiers and claim them to be genuine identifiers of people that do not exist (fake); or knowingly perpetuate sybils created by others. The dynamics of community formation can be modeled via a transition-based system:\nInitializing with some community seed, the system transitions by adding or removing community members; while some upper bound on the fraction of sybils shall be maintained.\nIn particular, if an initial digital community consists of identifiers of honest people; if honest people tend to trust honest people more than they trust non-honest ones; and if the trust graph of a digital community—the graph depicting the trust relations in the community—is rich enough, then new people can be safely added to the community while maintaining a bound on the sybil penetration of the community. Intuitively, this can be done by ensuring sufficient connectivity in the trust graph. E.g., ensuring that the conductance of the community’s trust graph (which relates to the vertex and edge expansion of the graph) does not decrease following the addition of new (identifiers of) community members guarantees that the fraction of sybils that penetrate the community can be bounded 9. Research challenges: Proposing local connectivity measures—in contrast to graph conductance that is a global measure—that make it easier to understand what does a person need to do in order to be admitted to the community. Performing extensive simulations to assess the quality of solutions for sybil-resilient community growth. Developing mechanisms to encourage honest people to be judicious in granting their trust, encourage sybil hunting, and reward sybil detection; investigating the integration of a due process for sybil determination, and the cross-community interaction for strengthened sybil-resilience.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: merging, and forking, which includes democratic procedures for deliberation and coalition formation within a community , and for deciding on the merging of communities and the forking of a community [ref]11 [ref]1. ‘On-Chain’ Constitutional Governance:\nLeading cryptocurrencies employ an informal governance process that often causes so-called hard forks , in which an off-chain social decision\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
