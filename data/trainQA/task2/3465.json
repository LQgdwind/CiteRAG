      "content": "Paper Title: On the Complexity of Scheduling Problems With a Fixed Number of Parallel Identical Machines\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe now turn our attention to problems on two or more machines.\nFor standard jobs, a straightforward reduction from Partition yields the following result (for a formal proof, see Appendix A): For every ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, there is a δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0 such that P2||Cmax{P2||C_{\\max}} cannot be solved in time 𝒪​(2δ​n​(y+P)1−ε)𝒪superscript2𝛿𝑛superscript𝑦𝑃1𝜀\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{\\delta n}(y+P)^{1-\\varepsilon}\\right), unless the SETH fails. This lower bound also applies to the harder objectives (e.g. Tmaxsubscript𝑇T_{\\max}) and in particular to P2||∑wjUj{P2||\\sum w_{j}U_{j}} (see Appendix C); the dynamic program by Lawler and Moore  (which is also sometimes attributed to Rothkopf ) solves most common objectives like Cmaxsubscript𝐶C_{\\max} and Tmaxsubscript𝑇T_{\\max} in time 𝒪​(n​y)𝒪𝑛𝑦\\mathcal{O}\\left(ny\\right) but needs 𝒪​(n​y2)𝒪𝑛superscript𝑦2\\mathcal{O}\\left(ny^{2}\\right) for P2||∑wjUj{P2||\\sum w_{j}U_{j}} (see , in particular exercise 8.10). So the gap is likely closed in the Cmaxsubscript𝐶C_{\\max}, Tmaxsubscript𝑇T_{\\max}, ……\\ldots-cases, but there is still a factor-y𝑦y-gap for the ∑wj​Ujsubscript𝑤𝑗subscript𝑈𝑗\\sum w_{j}U_{j}-objective. In general, the dynamic program by Lawler and Moore  solves Pm||Cmax{Pm||C_{\\max}} in a running time of 𝒪​(n​m​ym−1)≤𝒪​(n​m​Pm−1)𝒪𝑛𝑚superscript𝑦𝑚1𝒪𝑛𝑚superscript𝑃𝑚1\\mathcal{O}\\left(nmy^{m-1}\\right)\\leq\\mathcal{O}\\left(nmP^{m-1}\\right). Our matching lower bound for m=2𝑚2m=2 gives rise to the question whether the running time is optimal for general m>1𝑚1m>1. In Appendix A, we prove the following result: There is no 𝒪​(n​m​Po​(mlog2⁡(m)))𝒪𝑛𝑚superscript𝑃𝑜𝑚superscript2𝑚\\mathcal{O}\\left(nmP^{o\\left(\\frac{m}{\\log^{2}(m)}\\right)}\\right)-time algorithm for Pm||Cmax{Pm||C_{\\max}}, unless the ETH fails. So the algorithm by Lawler and Moore  is indeed almost optimal, as we can at best hope to shave off logarithmic factors in the exponent (assuming the weaker assumption ETH). Since the algorithm not only works for Cmaxsubscript𝐶C_{\\max}, one might ask whether we can find similar lower bounds for other objectives as well. For most common objective functions, we answer this question positively in Appendix C, but it remains open for ∑wj​Cjsubscript𝑤𝑗subscript𝐶𝑗\\sum w_{j}C_{j}. Note that the unweighted Pm||∑Cj{Pm||\\sum C_{j}} is polynomial-time solvable . An alternative dynamic program by Lee and Uzsoy  solves Pm||∑wjCjPm||\\sum w_{j}C_{j} in time 𝒪​(m​n​Wm−1)𝒪𝑚𝑛superscript𝑊𝑚1\\mathcal{O}\\left(mnW^{m-1}\\right). In order to get a matching lower bound (i.e. one that depends on the weights) for m=2𝑚2m=2, we examine another classical reduction: For every ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, there is a δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0 such that P2||∑wjCj{P2||\\sum w_{j}C_{j}} cannot be solved in time 𝒪​(2δ​n​(y+P+W)1−ε)𝒪superscript2𝛿𝑛superscript𝑦𝑃𝑊1𝜀\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{\\delta n}(\\sqrt{y}+P+W)^{1-\\varepsilon}\\right), unless the SETH fails. We show that the lower bound for Partition can be transferred to P2||∑wjCj{P2||\\sum w_{j}C_{j}} using the reduction by Lenstra et al.  and Bruno et al. . Given a Partition instance a1,…,ansubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑛a_{1},\\dots,a_{n}, we construct a P2||∑wjCj{P2||\\sum w_{j}C_{j}} instance in the following way: Define pj=wj=ajsubscript𝑝𝑗subscript𝑤𝑗subscript𝑎𝑗p_{j}=w_{j}=a_{j} for all j∈[n]𝑗delimited-[]𝑛j\\in[n] and set the limit y=∑1≤i≤j≤naj​ai−14​A2𝑦subscript1𝑖𝑗𝑛subscript𝑎𝑗subscript𝑎𝑖14superscript𝐴2y=\\sum_{1\\leq i\\leq j\\leq n}a_{j}a_{i}-\\frac{1}{4}A^{2}. Of course, the idea of the reduction is that the limit y𝑦y forces the jobs to be equally distributed among the two machines (regarding the processing time). We formally prove the correctness of the reduction in the appendix. Assume that there is an algorithm that solves an instance of P2||∑wjCj{P2||\\sum w_{j}C_{j}} in time 𝒪​(2δ​N​K1−ε)𝒪superscript2𝛿𝑁superscript𝐾1𝜀\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{\\delta N}K^{1-\\varepsilon}\\right) for some ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 and every δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0, where N:=nassign𝑁𝑛N:=n and K:=y+P+Wassign𝐾𝑦𝑃𝑊K:=\\sqrt{y}+P+W. By the choice of y𝑦y, we can see that Since wj=pj=ajsubscript𝑤𝑗subscript𝑝𝑗subscript𝑎𝑗w_{j}=p_{j}=a_{j}, we also have P=W=A𝑃𝑊𝐴P=W=A. Hence, we have K=y+P+W=𝒪​(A+A+A)=𝒪​(A)𝐾𝑦𝑃𝑊𝒪𝐴𝐴𝐴𝒪𝐴K=\\sqrt{y}+P+W=\\mathcal{O}\\left(A+A+A\\right)=\\mathcal{O}\\left(A\\right) and an algorithm with running time would contradict the lower bound for Partition from Theorem 2.3. Here, c𝑐c covers the constants in the 𝒪𝒪\\mathcal{O}-term and the running time 𝒪​(N)𝒪𝑁\\mathcal{O}\\left(N\\right) of the reduction vanishes. So the 𝒪​(n​W)𝒪𝑛𝑊\\mathcal{O}\\left(nW\\right)-time algorithm by Lee and Uzsoy  is probably optimal for P2||∑wjCj{P2||\\sum w_{j}C_{j}}, as we cannot hope to reduce the linear dependency on W𝑊W without getting a super-polynomial dependency on n𝑛n. We briefly turn our attention towards rigid jobs. Clearly, P​2​|s​i​z​e|​Cmax𝑃2𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒subscript𝐶{P2|size|C_{\\max}} is a generalization of P2||Cmax{P2||C_{\\max}} (the latter problem simply does not have two-machine jobs), so we get the following lower bound (for a formal proof, see Appendix A): For every ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, there is a δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0 such that P​2​|s​i​z​e|​Cmax𝑃2𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒subscript𝐶{P2|size|C_{\\max}} cannot be solved in time 𝒪​(2δ​n​(y+P)1−ε)𝒪superscript2𝛿𝑛superscript𝑦𝑃1𝜀\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{\\delta n}(y+P)^{1-\\varepsilon}\\right), unless the SETH fails. Similarly, the algorithm by Lawler and Moore  can be used to find a feasible schedule for the one-machine jobs and the two-machine jobs can be scheduled at the beginning. This gives an 𝒪​(n​y)𝒪𝑛𝑦\\mathcal{O}\\left(ny\\right)-time algorithm for P​2​|s​i​z​e|​Cmax𝑃2𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒subscript𝐶{P2|size|C_{\\max}}, and the linear dependency on y𝑦y cannot be improved without getting a super-polynomial dependency on n𝑛n, unless the SETH fails.\nFor other objectives, the problem quickly becomes more difficult: Already P​2​|s​i​z​e|​Lmax𝑃2𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒subscript𝐿{P2|size|L_{\\max}} is strongly NP-hard, as well as P​2​|s​i​z​e|​∑wj​Cj𝑃2𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒subscript𝑤𝑗subscript𝐶𝑗{P2|size|\\sum w_{j}C_{j}} (for both results, see Lee and Cai ). It is still open whether the unweighted version P​2​|s​i​z​e|​∑Cj𝑃2𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒subscript𝐶𝑗{P2|size|\\sum C_{j}} is also strongly NP-hard or whether there is a pseudo-polynomial algorithm; this question has already been asked by Lee and Cai , more than 20 years ago. It is not hard to see that the hardness of P2||Cmax{P2||C_{\\max}} also transfers to moldable jobs (i.e. P​2​|a​n​y|​Cmax𝑃2𝑎𝑛𝑦subscript𝐶{P2|any|C_{\\max}}); we simply create an instance where it does not make sense to schedule any of the jobs on two machines (for a formal proof, see Appendix A): For every ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, there is a δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0 such that P​2​|a​n​y|​Cmax𝑃2𝑎𝑛𝑦subscript𝐶{P2|any|C_{\\max}} cannot be solved in time 𝒪​(2δ​n​(y+P)1−ε)𝒪superscript2𝛿𝑛superscript𝑦𝑃1𝜀\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{\\delta n}(y+P)^{1-\\varepsilon}\\right), unless the SETH fails. The problems P​2​|a​n​y|​Cmax𝑃2𝑎𝑛𝑦subscript𝐶{P2|any|C_{\\max}} and P​3​|a​n​y|​Cmax𝑃3𝑎𝑛𝑦subscript𝐶{P3|any|C_{\\max}} can be solved via dynamic programming, as shown by Du and Leung  (a nice summary is given in the book by Drozdowski ). We show that these programs can be improved to match our new lower bound for the two-machine case: The problem P​2​|a​n​y|​Cmax𝑃2𝑎𝑛𝑦subscript𝐶{P2|any|C_{\\max}} can be solved in time 𝒪​(n​P)𝒪𝑛𝑃\\mathcal{O}\\left(nP\\right) via dynamic programming. Assume that we are given processing times pj​(k)subscript𝑝𝑗𝑘p_{j}(k), indicating how long it takes to run job j𝑗j on k𝑘k machines. The main difficulty is to decide whether a job is to be processed on one or on two machines. Our dynamic program fills out a table F​(j,t)𝐹𝑗𝑡F(j,t) for every j∈[n]𝑗delimited-[]𝑛j\\in[n] and t∈[y]𝑡delimited-[]𝑦t\\in[y], where the entry F​(j,t)𝐹𝑗𝑡F(j,t) is the minimum load we can achieve on machine 222, while we schedule all the jobs in [j]delimited-[]𝑗[j] and machine 111 has load t𝑡t. To fill the table, we use the following recurrence formula: Intuitively speaking, job j𝑗j is executed on machine 111 in the first case, on machine 222 in the second case and on both machines in the third case. The initial entries of the table are F​(0,0)=0𝐹000F(0,0)=0 and F​(0,t)=∞𝐹0𝑡F(0,t)=\\infty for every t∈[y]𝑡delimited-[]𝑦t\\in[y]. There are n​y≤n​∑j=1nmax⁡{pj​(1),pj​(2)}=𝒪​(n​P)𝑛𝑦𝑛superscriptsubscript𝑗1𝑛subscript𝑝𝑗1subscript𝑝𝑗2𝒪𝑛𝑃ny\\leq n\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\max\\{p_{j}(1),p_{j}(2)\\}=\\mathcal{O}\\left(nP\\right) entries we have to compute.888The precise definition of P𝑃P in this context does not matter for the running time in 𝒪𝒪\\mathcal{O}-notation; we can either add both pj​(1)subscript𝑝𝑗1p_{j}(1) and pj​(2)subscript𝑝𝑗2p_{j}(2) to the sum or just the larger of the two. Then, we can check for every t∈[y]𝑡delimited-[]𝑦t\\in[y] whether F​(n,t)≤y𝐹𝑛𝑡𝑦F(n,t)\\leq y. If we find such an entry, this directly corresponds to a schedule with makespan at most y𝑦y, so we can accept. Otherwise, there is no such schedule and we can reject. The actual schedule can be obtained by traversing backwards through the table; alternatively, we can store the important bits of information while filling the table (this works exactly like in the standard knapsack algorithm). Note that we might have to reorder the jobs such that the jobs executed on two machines are run in parallel. But it can be easily seen that all two-machine jobs can be executed at the begin of the schedule. Computing the solution and reordering does not change the running time in 𝒪𝒪\\mathcal{O}-notation, so we get an 𝒪​(n​P)𝒪𝑛𝑃\\mathcal{O}\\left(nP\\right) algorithm. As LABEL:thm:P2|any|C_{max} shows, improving the dependency on P𝑃P to sub-linear is only possible if we get a super-polynomial dependency on n𝑛n, unless the SETH fails. In a similar way, one can also improve the dynamic program for three machines (the proof is given in Appendix A): The problem P​3​|a​n​y|​Cmax𝑃3𝑎𝑛𝑦subscript𝐶{P3|any|C_{\\max}} can be solved in time 𝒪​(n2​P)𝒪superscript𝑛2𝑃\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{2}P\\right) via dynamic programming. This improves upon the 𝒪​(n​P5)𝒪𝑛superscript𝑃5\\mathcal{O}\\left(nP^{5}\\right)-algorithm by Du and Leung . Even though the same approach could be applied to an arbitrary number of machines m𝑚m in time 𝒪​(n​m​Pm−1)𝒪𝑛𝑚superscript𝑃𝑚1\\mathcal{O}\\left(nmP^{m-1}\\right), the strong NP-hardness of P​m​|a​n​y|​Cmax𝑃𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑦subscript𝐶Pm|any|C_{\\max} for m≥4𝑚4m\\geq 4 shows that the information on which machine each job is scheduled is not enough to directly construct an optimal schedule in those cases, unless P=NP (see Henning et al. [ref]15 as well as Du and Leung ).\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: for m≥4𝑚4m\\geq 4 shows that the information on which machine each job is scheduled is not enough to directly construct an optimal schedule in those cases, unless P=NP (see Henning et al. [ref]15 as well as Du and Leung ).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
