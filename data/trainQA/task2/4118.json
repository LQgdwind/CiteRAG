      "content": "Paper Title: A Semantic Consistency Feature Alignment Object Detection Model Based on Mixed-Class Distribution Metrics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets. For domain adaptation experiments, six public datasets are used: Cityscapes , Foggy Cityscapes , BDD100k  for similar domain adaptation experiments, and PASCAL VOC [ref]31, Clipart1k , WaterColor2K  for dissimilar domain adaptation experiments. Cityscapes focuses on capturing images of outdoor street scenes in common weather conditions from various cities. It includes 2,975 training images and 500 validation images taken during clear weather. Foggy Cityscapes are rendered from Cityscapes using depth maps. It stimulates the change of weather conditions, which is suitable to conduct foggy weather adaptation experiments. And the number of datasets is same with Cityscapes. BDD100K consists of 100k images, with 70k training images and 10k validation images annotated with bounding boxes. We mainly extract the images labeled as daytime as a sub-dataset for city scene adaptation experiments, which contains 36,728 training sets and 5,258 validation sets and the categories are same with the Cityscapes. PASCAL VOC contains 20 categories of common objects with bounding box annotations. Following¬†[ref]5 [ref]7, we employ PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 (16,551 images in total) for dissimilar domain adaptation experiments. Clipart1k contains 1k clipart images and belongs to the same category as PASCAL VOC¬†[ref]31. All 1k images will be used as target datasets for training and testing in this paper. WaterColor2K shares 6 categories with PASCAL and a total of 2K images. During training, 1K training images were used, and the model was evaluated using the remaining 1K test images. Implementation Details. Following the default settings in [ref]5 [ref]7. all training and test images are resized such that the shorter side has a length of 600 pixels. By default, the backbone models for similar domain adaptation experiments are initialized using pre-trained weights of VGG-16  on ImageNet, and for others, we follow the practices in [ref]5 [ref]7 and use ResNet-101  as the detection backbone. We fine-tune the network with a learning rate of 10‚àí3superscript10310^{-3} for 50k iterations and then reduce the learning rate to 10‚àí4superscript10410^{-4} for another 20k iterations. The momentum of 0.9 and the weight decay of 5√ó10‚àí45superscript1045\\times 10^{-4} are used for VGG-16 based detectors, while for ResNet-101 based detectors, the weight decay is 1√ó10‚àí41superscript1041\\times 10^{-4}. In all experiments, we employ RoIAlign  for RoI feature extraction, Œ∂=0.6ùúÅ0.6\\zeta=0.6 and the output of adaptive mean pooling is 10‚àó10101010*10.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: Datasets.
