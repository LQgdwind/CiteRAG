      "content": "Paper Title: A Heterogeneous In-Memory Computing Cluster For Flexible End-to-End Inference of Real-World Deep Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA new generation of IMC accelerators targets emerging resistive memory technology, driven by the much higher density scaling factor that these technologies offer compared to the SRAM .\nMoreover, resistive memories such as Resistive RAM (ReRAM), magnetic RAM (MRAM), and phase-change memory (PCM), show other important advantages: non-volatility (NV), low power envelope, and multi-level storage . IMC based on NV memories suffers from similar precision issues as SRAM-based IMCs, compounded by additional challenges coming from memristive devices, such as write variability and conductance variations (temporal and temperature-induced) . From a system-level perspective, resistive memories serve not only as IMC primitives, but also as non-volatile storage blocks for DNN weights. This avoids moving weights across the system memory hierarchy, which is instead necessary for SRAM-based IMC. Contrarily to SRAM, re-programming the memristive cross-bars with new data during the network model execution is not affordable, due to the high latency and power consumption associated with re-writes of non-volatile memory cells, as well as their limited endurance (for ReRAM and PCM).\nThis forces rethinking architectures as memory-centric, with additional digital logic around to perform ancillary operations, as is the focus of this work. Considering ReRAM-based IMC, Chen et al.  demonstrate significant computing parallelism, performing 8k MAC operations simultaneously. Other works show ReRAM-based IMC arrays as dense as 2Mb  or 4Mb 5, with peak energy efficiencies in the range of 120-200 TOPS/W within a power envelope of few milliwatts, suitable for tiny edge AI devices. Moreover, the IMC array in , integrated within a PCB hosting also an FPGA, runs a ResNet-20 trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset with 90% top-1 accuracy. For the MRAM technology, Doevenspeck et al. [ref]13 present a SOT-MRAM-based IMC macro and demonstrate for the first time that resistive MRAM devices can be used for DNN applications. They claim software-like accuracy on a network targeted to the MNIST dataset. PCM-based IMC arrays have been applied in mixed-precision in-memory iterative computing, combining a computational memory unit to perform the bulk of a computational task, with a von Neumann machine, which implements a backward method to iteratively improve the accuracy of the solution. This approach has been demonstrated to solve linear equations  and in DNN inference and even training tasks , showing limited error in the computation and much higher efficiency compared to traditional approaches . Khaddam-Aljameh et al. 7 recently presented a state-of-the-art 256×\\times256 PCM-based IMC core targeting DNN inference, fabricated in 14nm, showing energy efficiency of 10.5 TOPS/W and performance density of 1.59 TOPS/mm2 on inference tasks of multi-layer perceptrons and ResNet-9 models trained on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, with comparable accuracies as software baseline. In this work, we adopt the PCM-based IMC presented in 7.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: Moreover, the IMC array in , integrated within a PCB hosting also an FPGA, runs a ResNet-20 trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset with 90% top-1 accuracy.
