A diffusion model defines the parameterized reverse diffusion process as: Fitting pθ​(x¯0)subscript𝑝𝜃subscript¯𝑥0p_{\\theta}(\\bar{x}_{0}) to match the real data distribution q​(x0)𝑞subscript𝑥0q(x_{0}) is done by optimizing a variational bound on the negative log-likelihood. This variational bound can be expressed as a sum of three terms (see eq.(5) in [ref]10): Since LTsubscript𝐿𝑇L_{T} is constant it can be ignored in the optimization process. Continuous diffusion models. We denote the functions in the continuous process with the superscript c𝑐c. Following [ref]10, the forward process is performed by adding a Gaussian noise where a constant variance βt∈(0,1)subscript𝛽𝑡01\\beta_{t}\\in(0,1) (a hyper-parameter) controls the sizes of the steps. When T→∞→𝑇T\\rightarrow\\infty we can approximate x¯T∼𝒩​(0,I)similar-tosubscript¯𝑥𝑇𝒩0𝐼\\bar{x}_{T}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,I). In this case, pθc​(x¯t−1|x¯t)subscriptsuperscript𝑝𝑐𝜃conditionalsubscript¯𝑥𝑡1subscript¯𝑥𝑡p^{c}_{\\theta}(\\bar{x}_{t-1}|\\bar{x}_{t}) is parameterized by a family of Gaussian distributions, and Ltcsubscriptsuperscript𝐿𝑐𝑡L^{c}_{t} can be computed in a closed form. In our setting, we apply the diffusion process on a set of all the bounding boxes in the layout: x¯0∈ℝN​X​4subscript¯𝑥0superscriptℝ𝑁𝑋4\\bar{x}_{0}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{NX4}, where N𝑁N is the maximal number of components. For the reverse diffusion process, we follow [ref]29 , and train a model Fθc​(x¯t,c,y¯t)subscriptsuperscript𝐹𝑐𝜃subscript¯𝑥𝑡𝑐subscript¯𝑦𝑡F^{c}_{\\theta}(\\bar{x}_{t},c,\\bar{y}_{t}) to directly predict x¯0subscript¯𝑥0\\bar{x}_{0} from the noise, where y¯tsubscript¯𝑦𝑡\\bar{y}_{t} carries the class information in the diffusion process, as described in the next paragraph. The final loss ℒb​o​xsubscriptℒ𝑏𝑜𝑥\\mathcal{L}_{box} is a reweighted version of the loss Ltcsubscriptsuperscript𝐿𝑐𝑡L^{c}_{t}, which simplifies the objective and empirically leads to better results: Discrete diffusion models. We denote the functions in the discrete process with the superscript d𝑑d.\nThe discrete diffusion process was defined in [ref]2. In this setting, we have discrete random variables with K categories, y0​…,yT∈{1,…,K}subscript𝑦0…subscript𝑦𝑇1…𝐾y_{0}\\ldots,y_{T}\\in{\\{1,\\ldots,K\\}}. y0subscript𝑦0y_{0} is drawn from the data distribution, and the forward noising process is defined by the Markov transition matrix: In our case, we apply the discrete diffusion process on the set of all the classes of layout components y¯0∈{0,..,K}N\\bar{y}_{0}\\in\\{0,..,K\\}^{N}. We follow [ref]2  and choose a transition matrix with an absorbing state as the K-th category, denote by [Mask]. In this case for i<K𝑖𝐾i<K: and for i=K𝑖𝐾i=K: In other words, if the class is [Mask], it will remain the same. If not, then with probability β𝛽\\beta the class remains the same, and with probability 1−β1𝛽1-\\beta it will be changed to [M​a​s​k]delimited-[]𝑀𝑎𝑠𝑘[Mask]. Observe that when T→∞→𝑇T\\rightarrow\\infty we can approximate y¯T=[M​a​s​k]Nsubscript¯𝑦𝑇superscriptdelimited-[]𝑀𝑎𝑠𝑘𝑁\\bar{y}_{T}=[Mask]^{N}.\nIn the reverse diffusion process, we train the model Fθd​(x¯t,c,y¯t)subscriptsuperscript𝐹𝑑𝜃subscript¯𝑥𝑡𝑐subscript¯𝑦𝑡F^{d}_{\\theta}(\\bar{x}_{t},c,\\bar{y}_{t}) to directly predict the class probabilities of the components Pθ~​(y0~|y¯t,x¯t,c)~subscript𝑃𝜃conditional~subscript𝑦0subscript¯𝑦𝑡subscript¯𝑥𝑡𝑐\\tilde{P_{\\theta}}(\\tilde{y_{0}}|\\bar{y}_{t},\\bar{x}_{t},c). The parameterization of the reverse diffusion probability is defined using the forward process In this case, the regular cross-entropy loss is a reweighted function of Ltdsubscriptsuperscript𝐿𝑑𝑡L^{d}_{t} (see A.3 in [ref]2): Following , our objective on the class category is Combined diffusion process. Our layout diffusion process is obtained by sampling (x¯0,y¯0)subscript¯𝑥0subscript¯𝑦0(\\bar{x}_{0},\\bar{y}_{0}) from the data distribution. The forward diffusion process is obtained by applying the continuous process qcsuperscript𝑞𝑐q^{c} and the discrete process qdsuperscript𝑞𝑑q^{d} independently on x¯0,y¯0subscript¯𝑥0subscript¯𝑦0\\bar{x}_{0},\\bar{y}_{0}. The model is trained with the combined objective: The theoretical motivation for the combined loss is explained by parameterizing the reverse process joint distribution as independent over the previous step: Observe that in this decomposition, the probabilities of the continuous part and the discrete part are still dependent on both the continuous coordinates and the discrete classes of the previous diffusion step.\nWith this parametrization, by the additive property of the KL-divergence for independent distributions we have: Therefore, our final loss is a simplified reweight optimization of the variational bound of the joint distribution negative log-likelihood function. Sampling. In the inference step, we sample x¯0∼𝒩​(0,I)similar-tosubscript¯𝑥0𝒩0𝐼\\bar{x}_{0}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,I), y¯0=[M​a​s​k]Nsubscript¯𝑦0superscriptdelimited-[]𝑀𝑎𝑠𝑘𝑁\\bar{y}_{0}=[Mask]^{N}. In each step t𝑡t, we apply Fθc​(x¯t,c,y¯t)subscriptsuperscript𝐹𝑐𝜃subscript¯𝑥𝑡𝑐subscript¯𝑦𝑡F^{c}_{\\theta}(\\bar{x}_{t},c,\\bar{y}_{t}), Fθd​(x¯t,c,y¯t)subscriptsuperscript𝐹𝑑𝜃subscript¯𝑥𝑡𝑐subscript¯𝑦𝑡F^{d}_{\\theta}(\\bar{x}_{t},c,\\bar{y}_{t}), getting x¯p​r​e​dsubscript¯𝑥𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑\\bar{x}_{pred}, y¯p​r​e​dsubscript¯𝑦𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑\\bar{y}_{pred} (where we keep class prediction as probability vector). We then apply the noise and sample according to\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: Following the framework in [ref]10, a diffusion process is modeled as a Markov noising process with T𝑇T steps {x¯t}t=0Tsubscriptsuperscriptsubscript¯𝑥𝑡𝑇𝑡0\\{\\bar{x}_{t}\\}^{T}_{t=0}, where\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
