      "content": "Paper Title: On Learning Necessary and Sufficient Causal Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExperiment design. Scenarios are generated as follows. We consider the dimension of variables in the graph as p=5𝑝5p=5 in Scenarios 1 to 3 (S1 to S3), p=20𝑝20p=20 in Scenario 4 (S4), and p=50𝑝50p=50 in Scenario 5 (S5), to examine the scalability of NSCSL. For each scenario, the DAG that characterizes the causal relationship among variables 𝑶=(𝒁,Y)𝑶𝒁𝑌\\bm{O}=(\\bm{Z},Y) is generated from the Erdős-Reńyi (ER) model with an expected degree as 2 for S1 to S3 and degree as 5 for S4 to S5. We also generate the graph from the scale-free (SF) model for S5 with the degree of 5 to examine the robustness of the proposed method under diverse synthetic graphs. Each edge is assigned positive weights. We set the last variable as the outcome of interest Y𝑌Y, and generate the data based on LSEM by\n𝒁=𝑩⊤​𝒁+ϵ𝒁superscript𝑩top𝒁bold-italic-ϵ\\bm{Z}=\\bm{B}^{\\top}\\bm{Z}+\\bm{\\epsilon}, where ϵbold-italic-ϵ\\bm{\\epsilon} is a random vector of jointly independent binary variables with equal probability taking value one or zero. Thus, the outcome is nonnegative and discrete. In addition, we also include a nonlinear structural equation model for S4 where Oi:=ψi​{PAOi​(𝒢)}+eOiassignsubscript𝑂𝑖subscript𝜓𝑖subscriptPAsubscript𝑂𝑖𝒢subscript𝑒subscript𝑂𝑖O_{i}:=\\psi_{i}\\{\\textsc{PA}_{O_{i}}(\\mathcal{G})\\}+e_{O_{i}} and ψi(x)=⌊2log(x+1)⌉\\psi_{i}(x)=\\lfloor 2\\log(x+1)\\rceil where ⌊x⌉delimited-⌊⌉𝑥\\lfloor x\\rceil rounds to nearest integer for x𝑥x.\nIn S1, the true causal graph contains one spurious node (indexed by 0) and three non-spurious nodes (indexed by 1, 2, and 3), as shown in sub-figures (a) of Fig. E.7, with the associated true NSCG in sub-figures (b) of Fig. E.7. Moreover, we design a balanced setting with half spurious variables and half non-spurious variables in S2, as depicted in Fig. E.8, and a baseline setting without any spurious variables in S3, shown in Fig. E.9. Finally, S4 contains 2 non-spurious variables with 17 spurious variables in Fig. E.10. The experiments are conducted on a Google Cloud Platform virtual machine with 8 processor cores and 32GB memory. Methods and benchmark specification. We apply the proposed NSCSL based on TE and DE as the criteria of necessity and sufficiency, respectively, to capture the marginal and conditional causal effect of the confounders. Note that we consider fully identifiable models in the experiments so that it is meaningful to evaluate causal effects from the estimated graph. The underlying causal structure learning algorithm is set to NOTEARS [ref]46. We also compare the proposed method against other methods, including PC  and LiNGAM  for S1 to S5; DAG-GNN [ref]44, GES with generalized score [GSGES,  11], fast causal inference [FCI,  36], and the causal additive model [CAM,  4], for all high-dimensional settings in S4 and S5.\nHere, we use a graph threshold of 0.3 (commonly used in the literature [46; 44; 48; 5]) to prune the noise edges for a fair comparison. The training details are provided in Table E.1. The true and estimated graphs with the associated matrix under different approaches are illustrated in Figs. E.2 to E.6 and Figs. E.7 to E.11 in App. E for S1 to S4. The comparison results across different sample sizes (n𝑛n) are presented in Table 2 for S1 to S3, in Table 3 for S4 to S5 with linear ER model, in Table 6 for S4 with nonlinear ER model, and in Table 6 for S5 with linear SF model. All the results are evaluated by false discovery rate (FDR), true positive rate (TPR), and the structural Hamming distance (SHD) to the true causal graph, with their standard errors, over 50 replications.\nThe average running time of these methods is also reported in Table 2 to Table 6 to reflect the computational complexities. In addition, the sensitivity analyses concerning all hyperparameters in Table E.1 are conducted using S4, as presented in Fig. 2. Results and conclusion. NSCSL performs the best in discovering NSCG in S1, S2, S4, and S5, and shows comparably best results in S3 (a setting without any spurious variables). To be specific, the benchmark methods for causal structural learning aim to reveal causal relationships in the whole graph (i.e., sub-figures (a) in Figs. E.2 to E.6), which contains spurious effects on the target outcome Y𝑌Y. The proposed algorithm overcomes this drawback by purely identifying the true important causal relationships (i.e., sub-figures (b) in Figs. E.2 to E.6). By comparing the sub-figures (c) and (d) in Figs. E.2 to E.6 as well as Table 2 to Table 6, NSCSL-TE detects all necessary and sufficient causal paths towards the outcome, while NSCSL-DE only extracts direct causal relationships between the features and the outcome, resulting in a slightly lower TPR and slightly higher SHD than NSCSL-TE. Furthermore, from Table 2 to Table 6, the results under the proposed algorithm approach the truth more closely as the sample size increases in all scenarios, regardless of the underlying graph models and data-generating process. In contrast, the benchmark methods all fail to discover NSCG in the high-dimensional setting, exhibiting extremely high FDRs and SHDs. In addition, Table 3 to Table 6 reveal that NSCSL is as fast as the quickest benchmarks such as PC, LiNGAM, and FCI, and significantly faster than others like DAGGNN, GSGES, and CAM. Our method’s integration of treatment effects into the optimization adds efficiency and restricts the searching space, making it practical and even beating NOTEARS in computation. The sensitivity analyses in Fig. 2 indicate that our method remains robust to these parameters set within a reasonable range. Figure 2: Sensitivity analyses. Figure 3: The causal signaling network in Sachs et al. , where the blue-colored sub-graph is the true NSCG for protein Akt (purple). Real data analysis - Sachs et al. . We conduct real data analysis using the benchmark data from Sachs et al. . To validate our method’s capacity to find the NSCG and align with Def. 3.2, we designated the protein Akt as the target outcome. This designation ensures that NSCG exists (see Fig. 3) and that finding an NSCG is meaningful. Our method (NSCSL-TE) and seven baseline methods were applied and evaluated against the true NSCG associated with the protein Akt. Table 6 shows that our method achieves the best performance in finding the NSCG concerning the protein Akt. Real data analysis - Brem & Kruglyak .\nFurthermore, we apply NSCSL to gene expression traits in yeast  using a dataset of 104 yeast segregants with diverse genotypes. The goal is to identify genes, known as quantitative trait loci (QTLs), influencing the expression level (nonnegative) of the genetic variant YER124C, a daughter cell-specific protein involved in cell wall metabolism. Following a similar approach as in Chakrabortty et al. , we include 492 QTLs by filtering out genes with missing or low variability in expression levels. The total sample size is 262. Given the high-dimensional QTLs, constructing an NSCG with only causally relevant variables for the outcome of interest is essential.\nWe apply NSCSL-TE and compare it with all baseline methods. The summarized results in Table 7 highlight our method’s ability to identify relevant genetic influencers for the variant YER124C without contamination by irrelevant genes. The estimated causal graph and causal effects as well as more detailed analyses are provided in § E.2.\nThese observations align with findings from our simulation studies, further supporting NSCSL’s superiority in revealing important causal features.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: fully identifiable models in the experiments so that it is meaningful to evaluate causal effects from the estimated graph.
