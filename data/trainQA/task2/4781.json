      "content": "Paper Title: Evaluating k-NN in the Classification of Data Streams with Concept Drift\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDue to the temporal and ephemeral characteristics of data streams, these are expected to change their data distributions, thus giving rise to concept drifts  .\nFollowing the definition in , we denote a concept C𝐶C as a set of class probabilities and a class-conditional probability density function as stated in C=⋃y∈Y{(P​[y],P​[x→∣y])}𝐶subscript𝑦𝑌𝑃delimited-[]𝑦𝑃delimited-[]conditional→𝑥𝑦C=\\bigcup_{y\\in Y}{\\{(P[y],P[\\vec{x}\\mid y])\\}}. Consequently, given a stream 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S}, instances (x→t,yt)superscript→𝑥𝑡superscript𝑦𝑡(\\vec{x}^{\\,t},y^{t}) are generated according to the current concept Ctsuperscript𝐶𝑡C^{t}.\nIf during every instant tisubscript𝑡𝑖t_{i} it follows that Cti=Cti−1superscript𝐶subscript𝑡𝑖superscript𝐶subscript𝑡𝑖1C^{t_{i}}=C^{t_{i-1}}, then the concept is stable.\nOtherwise, if between any two timestamps tisubscript𝑡𝑖t_{i} and tj=ti+Δsubscript𝑡𝑗subscript𝑡𝑖Δt_{j}=t_{i}+\\Delta it occurs that Cti≠Ctjsuperscript𝐶subscript𝑡𝑖superscript𝐶subscript𝑡𝑗C^{t_{i}}\\neq C^{t_{j}}, we have a concept drift.\nThe cause of concept drifts can neither be determined nor predicted by learning algorithms as the information behind their causes is often unavailable (hidden context), or it is too costly .\nAs a result, learners tailored for data streams must detect and adapt to these changes automatically and autonomously. Concept drifts are often categorized according to their speed.\nGiven that drift occurs at timestamp tisubscript𝑡𝑖t_{i} and that it becomes stable once again at a timestamp tj=ti+1subscript𝑡𝑗subscript𝑡𝑖1t_{j}=t_{i}+1, the drift is said to be abrupt.\nOtherwise, it takes more instances between the drift and the moment when the new concept becomes stable, and the drift is called gradual. It is relatively common to use a concept drift detection method together with a base classifier to learn from data streams.\nIn general, the drift detector analyses the prediction results of the base learner and applies a particular decision model to attempt to detect changes in the data distribution. As previously explained, many concept drift detection methods have been proposed over the years, and several of those have been previously compared [ref]2 .\nAccording to extensive experiments [ref]2, the best methods are RDDM  and HDDM A .\nBecause RDDM was the detector chosen for the experiments of this article and it evolved from DDM , these two detectors are briefly explained below. DDM detects concept drifts in streams by analyzing the error rate and its standard deviation.\nFor each position i𝑖{i}, DDM defines the error rate pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} as the probability of making an incorrect prediction and its standard deviation as si=pi×(1−pi)/isubscript𝑠𝑖subscript𝑝𝑖1subscript𝑝𝑖𝑖s_{i}=\\sqrt{p_{i}\\times(1-p_{i})~{}/~{}i}.\nBased on the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning model 0, the authors of DDM argue that, when the distribution of the examples is stationary, the error rate pisubscript𝑝𝑖{p}_{i} should decrease as the number of examples i𝑖{i} increases.\nIf the error rate increases, DDM signals a change in the data distribution, making the current base learner outdated. RDDM  was proposed to overcome/alleviate a performance loss problem of DDM when concepts are very large, caused by decreased sensitivity, requiring too many instances to detect the changes.\nRDDM adds an explicit mechanism to discard older instances of very long concepts, periodically recalculating the DDM statistics responsible for detecting the warning and drift levels.\nBesides, it forces concept drift when the number of instances of the warning period reaches a parametrized threshold.\nThe authors claim RDDM delivers higher global accuracy than DDM in most situations, especially in gradual concept drift datasets, by detecting more drifts and detecting them earlier, despite a slight increase in false positives and memory consumption.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: to detect changes in the data distribution.
