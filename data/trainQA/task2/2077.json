      "content": "Paper Title: A systematic review of Hate Speech automatic detection using Natural Language Processing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur systematic review has identified 96 documents related to the application of deep-learning technology/models to the task of automatic hate speech detection. In the sequel, we have analyzed two crucial aspects: the architecture of the deep learning model and the features employed. Figure 14 summarizes the finding in terms of the percentage of the various deep-learning algorithms employed. Notice that BERT (33%) becomes prevalent though it was only introduced recently in 2019. The next most popular deep-learning models are LSTM and CNN, which covered 20% and 12% of total identified records. Hybrid models (combination of multiple models) depicted in the plot are exemplified by BERT+CNN (2%), LSTM+CNN(9%), LSTM+GURU(1%) and BERT+LSTM(2%). In Table 8, we tracked different architectures of deep learning employed in the identified records. Surprisingly a total of 24 different deep learning models and feature combinations were found, possibly highlighting the diversity of research’s attempts to produce novel architectures building on existing HS detection architectures. Most of the architectures used two steps: (i) word embedding layer employing models such as Word2Vec, FastText, GloVe; (ii) deep learning layer, where one distinguishes, among others, CNN, LSTM, GRU architectures. During the course of this analysis, four significant insights are distinguished: \nI) Comparison between non deep-learning and deep-learning models revealed that deep-learning models outperformed popular classifiers (NB, LR, RF, SVM) in most studies    [ref]21. An early work by Badjatiya et al. [ref]21 has compared HS detection with different ML models (LR , SVM, GBDT) showed that deep learning models using either CNN or LSTM model performed on average 13-20% better that LR, SVM or GBDT models. Another recent work by Al-Hassan and Al-Dossari  compared SVM as a baseline model to CNN, CNN+LSTM, GRU, CNN+GRU. The authors found that, in all cases, CNN outperformed the baseline model by at least 7% in terms of accuracy.\n\n II) Comparison between CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU models revealed mixed results in terms of which deep-learning architecture performs most. For instance, a comparison between CNN and LSTM architecture showed a better CNN performance results in , whereas Badjatiya et al. [ref]21 found that LSTM architecture performs better than CNN. Besides, the difficulty in data full reconstruction, the difficulty to reproduce exact preprocessing stages or use of distinct embedding can render such comparison more challenging. Yin et al.  conducted a comparative study between two deep-neural network architectures: “RNN (with GRU and LSTM layers) and CNN”. They found that RNN is more suited for the long-ranged context dependencies, while CNN sounds better in extracting local features. They also revealed that GRU performs better in case of long sentences.\nHowever, several other papers suggested that the concatenation of two or more deep learning models perform better than a single deep learning model   [ref]68  . For example, CNN+LSTM and CNN+GRU both performed better than the single application of LSTM and CNN . Zhou et al.  suggested a fusion of three CNN models with different parameters as a viable way to improve the performance of hate speech detection. Kapil and Ekbal [ref]68 compared CNN, LSTM, and LSTM+GRU architectures for HS detection in five commonly used datasets, and concluded that in all cases, LSTM+GRU outperform a single LSTM and CNN model by 2-3%. Similarly, Shruthi and KM  proposed a hybrid fusion architecture BiLSTM + Random Embedding + TF-IDF + LR that achieves at least a 12% increase in performance compared to a single architecture. III) Comparison between word embedding revealed a lack of comparative studies in this area as well. However, from Table 8, we can see that Word2vec and FastText were regularly used with different deep learning architectures. Although this popularity does not entail systematically a better performance score. For instance, Saleh Alatawi et al.  compared word2Vec, GloVe, and Google NewsVec, and showed that word2Vec performed only 1% better than others. However, when compared to BERT model, BERT-Large showed the best accuracy and F1 score. Another work by Rizos et al.  comparing FastText, GloVe and GoogleNewsVec revealed no significance accuracy among these embeddings. On the other hand, since Word2Vec, FastText, GloVe use a vector representation to represent words in a way that captures semantic or meaning-related relationships as well as syntactic or grammar-based relationships, this also bears inherent limitation in the sense that this cannot capture polysemy relationship. That is, for the same word, even if it has different meanings in different contexts, the corresponding vector representation is unchanged. We shall mention the merits of the recently introduced ELMO word embedding model, which was designed to overcome the aforementioned shortcoming. A recent work by Zhou et al.  using ELMO embedding showed a better performance compared to CNN. However, since ELMO is a relatively new, the in-depth comparison with other embedding model is still in its infancy. This leaves the door wide for future experiments\n\n IV) The rise of BERT is a striking trend that can be seen in Figure 15, which testifies of its popularity in hate speech detection community (38% share of deep-learning models) in the past five years. This demonstrates the importance of this model as a key state-of-the-art method in the field. Several works explored BERT performance in HS detection 8    where almost all authors who compared BERT model to other deep learning models concluded on the superiority of BERT architecture. For instance, Ranasinghe et al.  compared BERT to FastText, CNN, and LSTM. Similarly, Saleh Alatawi et al.  compared BERT to BiLSTM and LSTM where BERT showed a significance performance increase. Also, BERT model achieved top performance in the multilingual tasks in     [ref]143. Some research performed a comparison among different BERT models. For instance, Wang et al. [ref]143 found that BERT-large model outperformed BERT-base model for HS detection. In addition, two different BERT architecture concatenations (e.g., XLMR-B + mBERT) are found to perform better than a single pretrained BERT. Furthermore, BERT architecture can be trained in a such a way that it can perform a specific task. For example, Gonzalez et al.  proposed TWiLBERT, a specialization of BERT architecture for the Spanish and Twitter domain. They performed an extensive evaluation of TWilBERT models on 14 different text classification tasks, such as irony detection, sentiment analysis and emotion detection. The results obtained by TWilBERT outperformed the state-of-the-art systems and mBERT. Another work by Caselli et al.  introduced HateBERT, a re-trained BERT model for abusive language detection in English. The model was trained on a large-scale dataset of Reddit comments in English from communities banned for being offensive, abusive, or hateful. In all cases, HateBERT outperformed the corresponding general BERT model. Besides, some other language-specific BERTs models developed over time for monolingual outperformed multilingual model mBERT: AraBERT (Arabic) , AlBERTo (Italian) , FinBERT (Finnish) , CamemBERT(French) , Flaubert (French ), BERT-CRF (Portuguese) , BERTje (Dutch) , RuBERT (Russian)  and BERTtweet (A pre-trained language model for English Tweets) 7. However, to best of our knowledge, not every model has yet been tested for HS domain except AraBERT   and AlBERTo  which shown better performance for HS detection. Table 10 summarizes selected key works from three major recent HS detection competitions SemEval-2019 , SemEval-2020 , and Hasoc-2020 . In SemEval-2019, Task A (offensive language detection) was the most popular sub-task with 104 participating teams. Among the top-10 teams, seven used BERT with variations in the parameters and in the pre-processing steps. The top-performing team Liu et al.  used BERT-base-uncased with default-parameters, but with a max sentence length of 64 and trained for 2 epochs and achieved 82.9% F1 score which was 1.4 points better than Nikolov and Radivchev 8. Although, the difference between the next five systems, ranked 2-6, is very marginal (less than one percent (81.5%-80.6%)). The top nonBERT model by Mahata et al.  was ranked fifth. They used an ensemble of CNN and BLSTM+BGRU, together with Twitter word2vec embeddings and token/hashtag normalization. In semEval-20, 145 teams submitted official runs on the test data and 70 teams submitted system description papers. The best team Wiedemann et al.  achieved an F1 score of 0.9204 using an ensemble of ALBERT models of different sizes. The second team Wang et al. [ref]143 achieved an F1 score of 0.9204, and it used RoBERTa-large that was fine-tuned with the dataset in an unsupervised way. The third team Dadu and Pant , achieved an F1 score of 0.9198, using an ensemble that combined XLM-RoBERTa-base and XLM-RoBERTa-large trained on Subtask A data for all languages. The top-10 teams were close to each other and employed BERT, RoBERTa or XLM-RoBERTa models; sometimes CNNs and LSTMs were also been mentioned either for comparison or hybridization purpose. Over 40 research groups participated in Hasoc-2020 competition. The top ranked submission for Hindi-hate speech detection, used a CNN with FastText embeddings as input 1. The best performance for German hate speech detection task was achieved using a fine-tuned versions of BERT, DistilBERT and RoBERTa . Similarly, the top performance in English-language HS detection was based on a LSTM architecture with GloVe embeddings as input .\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: insights are distinguished: \nI) Comparison between non deep-learning and deep-learning models revealed that deep-learning models outperformed popular classifiers (NB, LR, RF, SVM) in most studies    [ref]21.
