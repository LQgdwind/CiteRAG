      "content": "Paper Title: Instance Weighted Incremental Evolution Strategies for Reinforcement Learning in Dynamic Environments\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile RL algorithms have demonstrated the ability to learn control policies for complex and high-dimensional problems, it is still challenging to apply them to tasks in dynamic environments.\nA related class of methods in the context of dynamic environments is transfer reinforcement learning , which reuses the knowledge from a set of related source domains to help the learning task in the target domain.\nOne feasible approach is to use domain randomization to learn policies that can work under a large variety of environments.\nTraining a robust policy with domain randomization has been shown to improve the transfer from simulation to reality, also known as “sim-to-real”.\nTobin et al. [ref]36 first trained an object detector with randomized appearances in simulation and transferred it to perform the real robotic grasping task.\nMuratore et al.  randomized the parameters of the physics simulations to train robust policies that can be applied directly to real second-order nonlinear systems with an approximate probabilistic guarantee on the suboptimality.\nSheckells et al. [ref]38 showed that, with the aid of fitting a stochastic dynamics model, the learned robust policy can be transferred back to the real vehicle with little loss in predicted performance.\nThese methods require task-specific knowledge to design parameters and the range of the randomized domain.\nThe policy trained over an enormous range of domains may learn a conservative strategy or fail to learn the target task, while a small range may be insufficient of providing sufficient variation for the policy to transfer to uncertain environments. Instead of learning invariance to environmental dynamics, an alternative solution is to formulate an environment-conditioned policy as a function of the current state and task feature.\nChen et al. [ref]39 proposed an explicit representation of the hardware variations and used it as additional input to the policy function for each discrete instance of the environment.\nYu et al.  incorporated an online system identification module with history observations to explicitly predict the dynamics parameters, which are provided as the input to a policy to compute appropriate controls.\nSubsequently, Yu et al.  leveraged domain randomization for learning a family of policies conditioned on explicit environmental dynamics.\nWhen tested in unknown environments, it directly searched for the best policy in the family based on the task performance via covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategies (CMA-ES).\nConstructing these environment-conditioned policies necessarily requires structural assumptions about the system’s dynamics, which may not hold in the real world.\nIn addition, it may be difficult for more complex systems to identify the dynamics parameters at runtime. A similar idea is to train an adaptive policy that is able to identify the environmental dynamics and apply actions appropriate for different system dynamics.\nIn the absence of direct knowledge of parameters of interest, the dynamics can be inferred from a history of past states and actions.\nPeng et al.  implicitly embedded the system identification module into the policy by using a recurrent model, where the internal memory acts as the summary of past states and actions, thereby providing a mechanism for inferring the system’s dynamics from the policy itself.\nAndrychowicz et al.  formulated memory-augmented recurrent polices for in-hand manipulation tasks, which admits the possibility to learn an adaptive behavior and implicit system identification on the fly.\nThese adaptive policies can be trained in the assumed source tasks and deployed in the unknown dynamic environment without fine-tuning.\nHowever, policies trained over the source distribution may not generalize well when the discrepancy between the target environment and the source is too large. Another line of research that tries to address dynamic environments is meta-learning, also called learning-to-learn .\nA recent trend in meta-learning is to find good initial weights from which adaptation can be quickly performed to tasks sampled from a distribution.\nOne such approach is the gradient-based model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm .\nGajewski et al.  derived a novel objective that maximizes the diversity of exhibited behaviors and explicitly optimizes the evolvability of ES algorithms, i.e., the ability to further adapt to changing circumstances.\nHouthooft et al.  evolved a differentiable loss function that is meta-trained via temporal convolutions over the agent’s experiences, resulting in faster test time learning on novel tasks sampled from the same distribution.\nSong et al.  employed ES algorithms to solve the MAML problem and to train the meta-policy without estimating any second derivatives.\nIn general, existing methods require repeatedly accessing and processing a potentially large distribution of source tasks to provide a reliable knowledge base for target environments that are supposed to be consistent with the source distribution.\nIn contrast, our incremental learning mechanism concentrates on the ability to rapidly learn and adapt in a sequential manner, without any structural assumptions or prior knowledge on the dynamics of the ever-changing environment.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: under a large variety of environments.\nTraining a robust policy with domain randomization has been shown to improve the transfer from simulation to reality, also known as “sim-to-real”.\nTobin et al.
