Research on shortest paths in the 𝖧𝖸𝖡𝖱𝖨𝖣𝖧𝖸𝖡𝖱𝖨𝖣\\mathsf{HYBRID} model was started by , with a range of results. They introduce a technique for efficiently broadcasting messages in the network, which they leverage, for instance, to obtain an exact solution of APSP in O~​(n2/3)~𝑂superscript𝑛23\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}(n^{2/3}) rounds and a 1+ε1𝜀1\\!+\\!\\varepsilon approximation in O~​(n)~𝑂𝑛\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}(\\!\\sqrt{n}) rounds (for constant ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0), matching their lower bound of Ω~​(n)~Ω𝑛\\smash{\\widetilde{\\Omega}}(\\!\\sqrt{n}) (which holds even for randomized O​(n)𝑂𝑛\\smash{O}(\\!\\sqrt{n}) approximations).\nFor SSSP, they give a 1+ε1𝜀1\\!+\\!\\varepsilon approximation in O~​(n1/3)~𝑂superscript𝑛13\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}(n^{1/3}) rounds, a (1/ε)O​(1/ε)superscript1𝜀𝑂1𝜀(1/\\varepsilon)^{\\smash{O}(1/\\varepsilon)} approximation in O~​(nε)~𝑂superscript𝑛𝜀\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}(n^{\\varepsilon}) rounds and an exact solution in O~​(S​P​D)~𝑂𝑆𝑃𝐷\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}\\big{(}\\!\\sqrt{SPD}\\big{)} rounds, where S​P​D𝑆𝑃𝐷SPD is the shortest path diameter. Subsequently, [ref]42 improves APSP to O~​(n1/2)~𝑂superscript𝑛12\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}(n^{1/2}) for an exact solution based on a scheme for efficiently unicasting messages in the network, which settled the problem (up to logarithmic factors in the round complexity). They also give an exact solution for SSSP in O~​(n3/5)~𝑂superscript𝑛35\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}(n^{3/5}) rounds and constant stretch approximations for k𝑘k-SSP in O~​(n1/3+k)~𝑂superscript𝑛13𝑘\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}(n^{1/3}+\\sqrt{k}) rounds, which is tight with their lower bound of Ω~​(k)~Ω𝑘\\smash{\\widetilde{\\Omega}}(\\!\\sqrt{k}) rounds for k≥n2/3𝑘superscript𝑛23k\\geq n^{2/3}.\nThe stretch was later improved by  which combines the techniques of [ref]42 with a density sensitive approach. In particular,  gives exact solutions for k≥n2/3𝑘superscript𝑛23k\\geq n^{2/3} random sources in O~​(k)~𝑂𝑘\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}(\\!\\sqrt{k}) rounds and for n1/3superscript𝑛13n^{1/3}-SSP in O~​(n1/3)~𝑂superscript𝑛13\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}(n^{1/3}) rounds. In a subsequent work,  uses density awareness in a different way to solve SSSP in O~​(n5/17)~𝑂superscript𝑛517\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}(n^{5/17}) rounds for stretch (1+ε)1𝜀(1\\!+\\!\\varepsilon).\nA deterministic protocol for efficiently broadcasting local edges is given by  and then used to obtain a deterministic APSP-algorithm with stretch log⁡nlog⁡log⁡n𝑛𝑛\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n} in O~​(n1/2)~𝑂superscript𝑛12\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}(n^{1/2}) rounds.\nFor classes of sparse graphs (e.g., cactus graphs),  demonstrates that polylog⁡npolylog𝑛\\operatorname{polylog}n solutions are possible even with 𝖢𝖮𝖭𝖦𝖤𝖲𝖳𝖢𝖮𝖭𝖦𝖤𝖲𝖳\\mathsf{CONGEST} as local network.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: rounds and an exact solution in O~​(S​P​D)~𝑂𝑆𝑃𝐷\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}\\big{(}\\!\\sqrt{SPD}\\big{)} rounds, where S​P​D𝑆𝑃𝐷SPD is the shortest path diameter. Subsequently, [ref]42 improves APSP to O~​(n1/2)~𝑂superscript𝑛12\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}(n^{1/2}) for an exact solution based on a scheme for efficiently unicasting messages in the network, which settled the problem\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
