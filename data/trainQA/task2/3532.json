It is worth mentioning that the used numbers for the RAP and SAP are based on the currently available\ntechnologies (i.e., 16 nm node)  and not based on the reported numbers in Table I. Although RAP is outperforming SAP in the peak performance by 6.3×6.3\\times, the RAP is having one order of magnitude higher than SAP in the power density. While keeping the similar numbers for the peak performance per power density (∼similar-to\\sim 500 TOPS/W/m​m2𝑊𝑚superscript𝑚2W/mm^{2}). 2-D RAP and SAP show 20% and 30% increase in the peak performance compared to 1-D versions while keeping the same power density. This figure depicts an intra-class comparison against the performance of the state-of-the-art commercial digital accelerators such as Goya, Google TPUv4, GraphCore C2, Groq, Nvidia A100 , and Tenstorrent . Such digital accelerators have around 1 Peta OPS/W/m​m2𝑊𝑚superscript𝑚2W/mm^{2} with power density less than 0.5 W/m​m2𝑊𝑚superscript𝑚2W/mm^{2}.\nIn addition to an inner-class IMC comparison is shown against resistive neural accelerator such as PUMA [ref]41, Newton  and ISAAC . Such accelerators utilize resistive crossbar arrays for accelerating vector-matrix multiplication and are dedicated to deep neural networks acceleration. Such resistive accelerators have less than 100 TOPS/W/m​m2𝑊𝑚superscript𝑚2W/mm^{2} for ISAAC and PUMA and 350 TOPS/W/m​m2𝑊𝑚superscript𝑚2W/mm^{2} for Newton. APs outperform the inner-class IMC accelerators in terms of peak performance at the expense of higher power density. It is worth mentioning that the power density of RAP is around 5.5 W/m​m2𝑊𝑚superscript𝑚2W/mm^{2} which is not acceptable. Most of these accelerators are mainly targeted for DNN models acceleration, unlike APs that can be placed in between general-purpose accelerators, such as CPUs, and the domain-specific accelerators such as resistive neural accelerators, TPU, and others.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: with power density less than 0.5 W/m​m2𝑊𝑚superscript𝑚2W/mm^{2}.\nIn addition to an inner-class IMC comparison is shown against resistive neural accelerator such as PUMA [ref]41, Newton  and ISAAC .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
