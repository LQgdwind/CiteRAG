      "content": "Paper Title: Masked Autoencoding for Scalable and Generalizable Decision Making\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLarge-scale language models are highly successful  –after pretraining on a large amount of data, these pretrained representations generalize well to various downstream tasks.\nTaking inspiration from the success in NLP, Transformer  based methods have been proposed to model images [ref]7  [ref]3 . iGPT [ref]7 operates on sequences of pixels and predicts unknown pixels.\nBEiT [ref]3 proposes to predict discrete tokens  . MAE  proposes to randomly mask patches of the input image and reconstruct the missing pixels.\nSince we apply random mask across states and actions, our work is also related to prior work on masked prediction across multiple input modalities [see e.g. 35]. Sequence modeling for decision making has been studied in RL and other applications  4   0 .\nMVP  studies transferring pretrained visual representations to RL tasks.\nMWM  studies masked prediction over convolutional features, and learn a latent dynamics model.\nModeling inverse dynamics has also been studied for robot learning from demonstrations and sim-to-real transfer  .\nTT  studies autoregressive next token prediction for model-based RL applications.\nDT  0 study masking autoregressive next token prediction conditioned on return.\nTNP  and BONET  study autoregressive masking for sequential decision making for black-box optimization.\nICM  and SPR 4 study predicting masked state and action in a transition tuple for exploration.\nDifferent from these works, MaskDP randomly masks a portion of trajectories and generalizes prior masking strategies such as inverse dynamics. In addition, MaskDP generalizes well to downstream tasks while prior work is task-specific.\nConcurrent to our work, Uni[MASK]  proposes using the bidirectional transformer to predict masked states and actions and demonstrates that the resulting model performs well on a large variety of tasks. The main difference between our works is that Uni[MASK] is more interested in comparing the performance between training regimes with different masking schemes, while our work focuses on solving a range of downstream tasks with minimal task-specific designs during pretraining. Our work falls under the category of self-supervised pretraining in RL.\nSelf-supervised discovery of a set of task-agnostic behaviors by means of seeking to maximize an intrinsic reward has been explored as intrinsic motivation , often with the goal of encouraging exploration 8 1.\nAPT  studies nonparametric entropy maximization for pretraining and is extended to learning skills .\nProto-RL  further improves pretraining by representation learning.\nCIC  combines contrastive learning with skill discover and improves results on URL benchmarks .\nAPV 7 shows successful transfer of pretrained representation across domains.\nMany of these methods are used to pretrain agents that are later adapted to specific reinforcement learning tasks. Using offline data for pretraining agents has also been explored in prior work 5 9 . SGI 5 proposes combining self-predictive representation 4 and inverse dynamics prediction. ATC 9 studies contrastive pretraining on trajectories and shows transferring the representations to downstream tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: of data, these pretrained representations generalize well to various downstream tasks.\nTaking inspiration from the success in NLP, Transformer  based methods have been proposed to model images [ref]7  [ref]3 . iGPT [ref]7 operates on sequences of pixels and predicts unknown pixels.\nBEiT [ref]3 proposes to predict discrete tokens  .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
