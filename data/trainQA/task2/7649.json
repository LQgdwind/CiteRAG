      "content": "Paper Title: Real-Time Multimodal Cognitive Assistant for Emergency Medical Services\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nModern day Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models leverage deep learning architectures such as the Transformer [ref]13 and are trained using supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. Conformer [ref]14 and Whisper  are both models that utilize the Transformer architecture. In the domain of transcription for medical audio,  has developed specialized ASR models solely trained on speech from the medical domain. This requires the curation of a large medical-focused dataset, which is difficult due to financial constraints and patient privacy restrictions. A more feasible approach found to yield improved transcription performance is to fine-tune an existing pretrained model using a (relatively) small amount of domain-specific audio [ref]17. In addition, synthetic audio has previously been shown to improve the performance of ASR models in specific domains. For example, SynthASR proposes using synthetically generated audio to adapt existing ASR models for specific applications . Within the EMS domain,  utilizes cloud services (e.g., Google Cloud Speech-To-Text) for automatic speech recognition. While cloud services offer improved performance via larger models, they are a liability in a cognitive assistant system because they rely on stable network connections, which can be weak or nonexistent where responders are called.  proposes the EMSConformer, a fine-tuned Conformer model for offline ASR model for EMS. We find several limitations in this work. First, the mobile application developed in  requires responders to manually record and upload their speech on the mobile application, which may increase the cognitive overload on responders. Second, incidents progress at a dynamic and quick rate, with new information to process arising continuously from start to end. Due to the reliance on one-time recorded audio as input, EMSConformer is incapable of transcribing constantly changing information and supporting the decision-making of responders in real-time. Third, EMSConformer has been evaluated on unrealistic and non-conversational speech input. The evaluation data consists of isolated medical terminology and fragmented groups of words. However, responders’ conversations and verbalized observations during real incidents will be fully-formed phrases and include words outside of medical terminology to describe signs and symptoms, such as saying, “The patient says they feel a ton of bricks on their chest” instead of saying “chest pain” . Good-quality transcription of conversational audio typically heard at EMS scenes is crucial to obtain a holistic understanding of the incident scene and the status of patients. To our knowledge, EMS-Whisper is the first offline ASR model for EMS conversational data that can continuously transcribe an audio stream, allowing for effective edge deployment of an EMS cognitive assistant. In addition, we develop a novel method for generating synthetic EMS conversational audio to fine-tune pretrained ASR models.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: Modern day Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models leverage deep learning architectures such as the Transformer [ref]13 and are trained using supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.
