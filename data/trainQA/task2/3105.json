Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Benchmarking Shadow Removal for Facial Landmark Detection and Beyond\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep facial landmark detectors can be classified into two types: direct coordinate regression  [ref]40 [ref]25 and heatmap-based approaches [ref]5  . Coordinate-based landmark detection attempts to locate landmarks directly from images.\nValle et al. [ref]40 infer landmark locations by a combined network with a tree-structure regression. Heatmap-based methods estimate a likelihood heatmap for each landmark and then infer localization prediction, rendering promising performance over direct regressionÂ . Dong et al. [ref]5 propose a style-aggregated network (SAN) to reduce the effect of style variations. Wang et al.  propose High-Resolution Network (HRNet) to fully explore high resolution information via performing multi-resolution fusion. LUVLi  proposes a deep model to jointly estimate the landmark locations and uncertainty predictions. Graph-based deep learning can also be utilized for facial landmark detection with good robustness and accuracy [ref]25.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: Deep facial landmark detectors can be classified into two types: direct coordinate regression  [ref]40 [ref]25 and heatmap-based approaches [ref]5  .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
