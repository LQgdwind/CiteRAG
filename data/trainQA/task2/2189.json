      "content": "Paper Title: QFCNN: Quantum Fourier Convolutional Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nQuantum machine learning.\nQuantum machine learning algorithms can be roughly classified into two groups  . The first group is the algorithms proposed before the concept “NISQ” have been published, such as quantum PCA  and quantum SVM , and most of them are still in the developing period. The second group is mainly the deep models with quantum network layers. Previous research works [ref]26   have shown the feasibility of training the networks on NISQ devices. There are several quantum deep learning architectures [ref]21 , such as quantum recommendation systems [ref]30, quantum generative adversarial networks  .\nSome models like graph networks  and recurrent neural networks  have also been inspired by quantum computing. Convolution. As a popular neural network model, CNN usually contains four types of layer: the convolution layer, the activation function, the pooling layer and the fully connected (FC) layer. Recently, there have been a few attempts [ref]21  for designing quantum convolution models, and they mainly focus on\nusing the quantum gate to simulate the\nlayers in traditional CNNs. Differently, in our QFCN model, we exploit discrete quantum Fourier transform for the learnable convolutional modules, which still\nenables us to control the qubits with the number of kernel size. Besides, our designed quantum circuit makes it convenient to prepare the input signal to be involved in convolution. Also note that besides deep CNN, there are a few attempts focusing on pure quantum convolution without network architecture and learnable parameters , and our method is also different from them, since we aim to design a quantum Fourier convolutional neural network with trainable parameters, and the quantum optimization algorithm via back-propagation is also introduced in this paper to learn the parameters for our QFCN. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithm. While quantum computers still face considerable technological challenges, many quantum algorithms have daunting resource requirements . To handle this problem, some quantum algorithms  connected with classical computers are designed, which are often called hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. Besides saving quantum resources like quantum gates, hybrid quantum-classical algorithms also show other advantages. For instance, classical computers are able to perform rapid iteration. Thus some hybrid schemes make use of this advantage to optimize the parametric quantum circuit . Here the hybrid framework is exploited to design our QFCN model, considering its advantages.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: published, such as quantum PCA  and quantum SVM , and most of them are still in the developing period.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
