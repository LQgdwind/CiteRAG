      "content": "Paper Title: Transformer Training Strategies for Forecasting Multiple Load Time Series\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis section first presents related work on long time series forecasting and load forecasting with Transformers.\nMost of the load forecasting literature uses local models, but few works use global models, which are presented next.\nThe global training strategy can be understood as a transfer learning technique. We therefore discuss transfer learning in the field of load forecasting at the end of this section. As Transformer are often used for long time series forecasting with up to one month horizon, various extensions to the Transformer architecture exist that aim to reduce the time and space complexity. This is done by the Informer using ProbSparse self-attention , by the Autoformer using auto-correlation [ref]20, by the FEDformer using frequency enhanced decomposition  and by PatchTST using patching [ref]22.\nThe proposed models are multivariate or local, except for the global PatchTST [ref]22.\nThe experiments in these works are conducted on six datasets from different domains, including one load forecasting dataset, which we also use in our experiments (see section Datasets).\nA global linear model called LTSF-Linear  gives better results than the aforementioned multivariate Transformers.\nParallel to our work, global Transformers were shown to beat the aforementioned multivariate Transformers . However, this work does not optimize the model’s lookback size and therefore achieves sub-optimal results.\nPatchTST [ref]22 is a global Transformer with patched inputs and is superior to LTSF-Linear  on the six datasets. Transformer architectures for short-term load forecasting are designed to use external calendar and weather features  . An evaluation of different architectures is undertaken in . Further work modifies the architecture for multi-energy load forecasting .\nUpstream decompositions are used to improve the forecast quality .\nThese models are not compared on a common benchmark dataset, but evaluated on different datasets on city or national level. There, usually only one load time series is available, which only allows for local models. Furthermore, the models are not compared to the Transformer architectures for long time series. Global load forecasting models are already used with convolutional neural networks  and N-BEATS .\nA mixture between a multivariate and a global model is investigated in , where a single recurrent neural network (RNN) model is trained on randomly pooled subsets of the time series.\nSome works cluster the time series and then train global or multivariate models for each cluster  .\nPatchTST [ref]22 is a global Transformer with patched inputs. We compare to this approach in our experiments. The authors of  and  present current literature on transfer learning in the domain of energy systems. They define a taxonomy of transfer learning methods and discuss different strategies of using transfer learning with buildings from different domains.\nTwo works  [ref]34 use transfer learning by pre-training and fine-tuning Transformers.\nTransferability from one building to another is tested in , and from one district to another in [ref]34.\nIn contrast to these works, our transfer learning approach is to train a generalized model on the data from many clients, without fine-tuning for a target time series.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: to the Transformer architecture exist that aim to reduce the time and space complexity. This is done by the Informer using ProbSparse self-attention , by the Autoformer using auto-correlation [ref]20, by the FEDformer using frequency enhanced decomposition  and by PatchTST using patching [ref]22.\nThe proposed models are multivariate or local, except for the global PatchTST [ref]22.\nThe\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
