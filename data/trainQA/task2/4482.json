      "content": "Paper Title: Joint covariate-alignment and concept-alignment: a framework for domain generalization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnder the covariate-shift setting,\ndomain alignment methods focus on aligning the marginal distributions of the representation from different seen domains by minimizing distributional divergences or distances [ref]4       .\nFor instance, in  , the Wasserstein distance between distributions of the seen domains in representation space is minimized.\nIn [ref]4, Li et al. proposed the MMD algorithm to minimize the maximum mean discrepancy distance between seen domain distributions in the representation space. In a similar vein, the CORAL algorithm  is based on the idea of matching the mean and covariance of feature distributions from different domains.\nIn , the authors use deep neural networks to minimize the difference between the variances of transformed features from seen domains to achieve domain generalization.\nIn , the authors aim to learn the domain-invariant features with marginal distributions unchanged from domain to domain together with the domain-specific features to enhance the generalization performance. Since the conditional distribution of the label given the representation variable is directly related to the classification performance, there are many works that aim to deal with concept-shift, i.e., minimizing the divergence between the conditional distribution of the labels (concepts) given the representation [ref]12       .\nIn [ref]12 , linear and non-linear IRM algorithms are proposed for learning the invariant features such that their conditional distributions are unchanged across domains, leading to the construction of an optimal classifier for all seen domains.\nIn , Nguyen et al. developed a conditional entropy minimization principle to remove spurious invariant features from the invariant features learned by the IRM algorithm [ref]12. In , concept-alignment is achieved via minimizing the mutual information of the label given the representation variable for a given domain.\nIn , Wang et al. handle concept-shift by directly aligning the conditional distribution within each class regardless of domains via the use of Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence. To the best of our knowledge, there are only two works in the DG setting that simultaneously deal with both the covariate-shift and concept-shift [ref]25 But there are several works that simultaneously handle both covariate-shift and concept-shift under the Domain Adaptation (DA) setting, for example the work in  . However, DA is not considered in this paper..\nIn [ref]25, Nguyen et al. proposed an algorithm that is capable of achieving both covariate-alignment and concept-alignment by enforcing the latent representation to be invariant under all transformation functions. Their algorithm, however, requires the use of invertible and differentiable transformation functions together with a generative adversarial network which is known to be hard to train.\nIn , motivated by some examples where using concept-alignment alone is inadequate for achieving a good generalization, a covariate-alignment algorithm is heuristically combined with a concept-alignment algorithm to achieve a better out-of-distribution generalization.\nIn contrast to [ref]25 , our work appears to be the first work that uses the upper bound for the risk in the unseen domain to theoretically motivate the necessity of achieving both covariate and concept alignment in DG.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: covariate-shift setting,\ndomain alignment methods focus on aligning the marginal distributions of the representation from different seen domains by minimizing distributional divergences or distances [ref]4       .\nFor instance, in  , the Wasserstein distance between distributions of the seen domains in representation space is minimized.\nIn [ref]4, Li et al. proposed the MMD algorithm to minimize\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
