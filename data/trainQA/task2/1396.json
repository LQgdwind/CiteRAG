      "content": "Paper Title: Evolving Neural Architecture Using One Shot Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDataset: CIFAR-10  has 50,000 training\nimages and 10,000 testing images with a fixed resolution of 32x32. During\nthe architecture search, the training images are divided into two subsets of size\n25,000 each, out of which the first subset is used for training the one shot model\nand the other subset is the validation data, which is used for calculating the fitness\nof each architecture in the population. In the selection and evaluation stage, the normal\ntraining/testing split is used. Search Space: We follow the setup given in DARTS[ref]17. The one shot model is\ncreated by stacking normal cell with reduction cell inserted at 1/3 and 2/3 of the\ntotal depth of the model. Each cell has two input nodes, four intermediate node and one output\nnode resulting in 14 edges among them. The operations considered for the cells are as follows:\n3x3 and 5x5 dilated separable convolutions, 3x3 and 5x5 separable convolutions, 3x3 max pooling,\n3x3 average pooling, skip connect and zero. Thus, each architecture is represented by two\n14x8 matrices one for normal cell and one for reduction cell. Training Settings: The training setting mainly follows the setup proposed by DARTS\n[ref]17. Because of the high memory requirements of the one shot model, a smaller\nnetwork, called proxy network , with 8 stacked cells and\n16 initial channels is used during the architecture search process, i.e. stage 1.\nFor deriving the discrete architecture, a‚Äãr‚Äãc‚Äãhd‚Äãi‚Äãsùëéùëüùëêsubscript‚Ñéùëëùëñùë†arch_{dis}, each node in the discrete architecture\nis connected to two nodes among the previous nodes selected via the top-2 operations\naccording to the architecture parameter Œ±ùõº\\alpha. During the search process, we use SGD for\ntraining the one shot model with a batch size of 64, initial learning rate of 0.025, momentum of\n0.9, and weight decay of 3√ó10‚àí43superscript1043\\times 10^{-4}. The learning rate is annealed down to 0.001 by using\nthe cosine annealing schedule without any restart during the search process. For our evolutionary\nalgorithm, we use a population size of 50 in each generation, 0.1 as the mutation rate\nand 10 architectures are chosen randomly during the tournament selection. The search process runs\nfor 50 generations on a single GPU, NVIDIA 2080 Ti, and takes 4.4 days to complete stage 1. Number\nof generations was chosen to match the number of epochs in DARTS [ref]17. Population\nsize was chosen based on the experiments where we ran our method for population size of 20, 30, 50\nwith tournament size chosen as one-fifth of the population size, as shown in Figure\n2(b). We did not go beyond 50 population size as we wanted to have search time\nsimilar to that of DARTS. Mutation rate was chosen based on the experiments where we ran our\nmethod for mutation rate of 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, as shown in Figure 2(c). All our\narchitecture search in Table 1 are done with cutout . Architecture Evaluation: A larger network, called proxyless network\n, with 20 stacked cells and 36 initial channels is used during the selection\nand evaluation stage. Following DARTS[ref]17, the proxyless network is trained with a\nbatch size of 96, weight decay of 0.0003, cutout , auxiliary tower with\n0.4 as its weights, and path dropout probability of 0.2 for 600 epochs. The same setting is used\nto train and evaluate the proxyless network on the CIFAR-100 dataset\n. Search Results and Transferability to CIFAR-100: We perform the architecture search on\nCIFAR-10 three times with different random number seeds and their\nresults are provided in Table¬†1 as EvNAS-A, EvNAS-B and EvNAS-C, which are then\ntransferred to CIFAR-100. The cells discovered during EvNAS-A are shown in\nFigure¬†4 and those discovered by EvNAS-B and EvNAS-C are given in the\nsupplementary. EvNAS-A evaluates 10K architectures during the search time and achieves the\naverage test error of 2.47¬±0.06plus-or-minus2.470.062.47\\pm 0.06 and 16.3716.3716.37 on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 respectively with\nsearch time significantly less than the previous evolution based methods.\nEENA [ref]29 found a competitive architecture in lesser search time than EvNAS using\nevolution but EvNAS was able to achieve better result on both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with fewer\nparameters.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: for calculating the fitness\nof each architecture in the population. In the selection and evaluation stage, the normal\ntraining/testing split is used. Search Space: We follow the setup given in DARTS[ref]17.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
