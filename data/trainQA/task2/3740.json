      "content": "Paper Title: BatchFormerV2: Exploring Sample Relationships for Dense Representation Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the past five years, we have witnessed great success of deep neural networks with attention mechanisms, especially the Transformer architecture 9, for natural language processing (NLP). Recently, the Transformer architecture has been successfully extended to visual recognition tasks known as vision Transformer or ViT [ref]13, suggesting its great potential as a general deep architecture for learning through different modalities. Therefore, following previous attention mechanisms used in CNNs, such as channel and spatial attentions     , recent vision Transformer variants mainly focus on exploring more efficient and effective local/global attention structures  6  . However, from the perspective of information propagation, current vision Transformer architectures can only enable the spatial information propagation among pixels/patches within the same image, ignoring the possible information propagation among different data samples within each training mini-batch. An intuitive example showing the differences between channel, spatial, and batch attentions is illustrated in Figure 1. To enable vanilla vision Transformer with the ability of sample relationship modeling, Hou et al. present to incorporate a Transformer encoder module between the last hidden layer and the final classifier to explore image-level sample relationships using the attention mechanism, which is referred to as BatchFormer [ref]18 and achieves significant improvements over a wide range of data-scarce image classification tasks. However, BatchFormer mainly focuses on exploring sample relationships at the image-level for classification, leaving sample relationships for dense representations at the pixel/patch level poorly investigated. Inspired by this, we devise a new general batch Transformer module, BatchFormerV2, which further enables the sample relationship learning for dense representations, aiming to facilitate the research on a more powerful and general vision Transformer with not only the spatial attention but also the batch attention, from image-level to pixel/patch-level representation learning. Exploring sample relationships within each mini-batch using deep neural networks is usually non-trivial, since we do not always have a mini-batch of data for testing, which is also known as the training-and-testing inconsistency. For example, batch normalization requires to track running statistics (i.e., the mean and variance of each mini-batch) during training in a momentum way , which is then used as batch statistics for testing. When applying a parametric attention module in the batch dimension, it is even more difficult to handle the above-mentioned inconsistency problem. To this end, Hou et al. [ref]18 introduce a shared classifier positioned both before and after the batchformer module, aiming to learn a batch-invariant classifier. In this paper, we devise a more general batch Transformer module to further enable the information propagation between samples at different levels, i.e., both pixel/patch and image levels, by learning batch-invariant representations.\nTherefore, the proposed batchformer module can be applied to different hidden layers/blocks in typical vision Transformers.\nTo achieve this, we explore a two-stream pipeline for training, one stream with a batchformer module and the other stream without, where all other layers/blocks are shared by these two streams. By doing this, all these shared layers/blocks are trained to generalize well for the input with or without the batch Transformer module. During testing, we can directly remove the batch Transformer module without sacrificing performance. In this paper, with the proposed simple yet effective batch Transformer module, we further enable the information propagation along the pixels/patches of different samples within each mini-batch to facilitate dense representation learning. To evaluate the proposed batch Transformer module, named as BatchFormerV2, we perform extensive experiments on several popular visual recognition tasks, including image classification, object detection, and panoptic segmentation, where the experimental results show that the proposed module can be a general representation learning solution via sample relationship learning. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows. We introduce a new plug-and-play module, BatchFormerV2, as a general solution for sample relationship learning at different levels, which further facilitates robust dense representation learning. We develop a two-stream training strategy, making it possible to improve vision Transformers without any extra inference cost by directly removing the proposed BatchFormerV2 module during testing. We perform extensive experiments on three popular visual recognition tasks, i.e., image classification, object detection, and panoptic segmentation, demonstrating remarkable generalizability of the proposed method.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: architecture 9, for natural language processing (NLP).
