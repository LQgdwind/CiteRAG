      "content": "Paper Title: A Novel Machine Learning Approach to Data Inconsistency with respect to a Fuzzy Relation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOrdinal classification (also called ordinal regression) problems constitute a very important part of machine learning and statistical analysis . In ordinal classification, the goal is to predict for a certain instance uùë¢u from set UùëàU, one of KùêæK different ordinal class labels y‚àà{1,‚Ä¶,K}ùë¶1‚Ä¶ùêæy\\in\\{1,\\dots,K\\}. Usually, uùë¢u is characterised by its values for a given set of condition attributes, while yùë¶y is called a decision attribute. Ordinal classification problems exploit the existing ordering on the decision attribute.\nIn some cases, an ordering also exists on the condition attributes. One way to incorporate that knowledge is through so-called monotonicity constraints. For a given preorder (dominance) relation on the set of instances UùëàU based on the condition attributes, the monotonicity constraints can be formulated as follows: if instance u1subscriptùë¢1u_{1} dominates u2subscriptùë¢2u_{2} w.r.t. the given dominance relation on the condition attributes, then u1subscriptùë¢1u_{1} should be assigned to the same or to a better decision class than u2subscriptùë¢2u_{2}. In such a case, we say that u1subscriptùë¢1u_{1} is consistent with u2subscriptùë¢2u_{2}. Obviously, consistency is a symmetric relation and instances that are incomparable w.r.t.¬†condition attributes are consistent by default. Ordinal classification problems that include monotonicity constraints are called monotone classification problems. They arise in many areas, such as medical diagnosis , survey data , bankruptcy risk estimation , house pricing [ref]5 and others. A comprehensive survey of monotone classification methods is given in . In practice, not all pairs of instances satisfy the monotonicity constraints (are not consistent) due to some imperfectness of ordinal classification data, like missing attributes or instability of the assessment of decision attribute values at the stage of data generation. Hence, some initial preprocessing of data is often performed in order to enforce the monotonicity constraints. One of the main methods to handle inconsistencies in data is the rough set approach . For a given decision class in a classification problem, the approach outputs lower and upper approximations of that class. The lower approximation contains instances from the decision class that are consistent with all other instances, while the upper approximation contains instances that relate with instances from the decision class. The original rough set approach handles inconsistencies w.r.t.¬†an equivalence (indiscernibility) relation and not w.r.t.¬†a dominance relation (as is defined in the monotonicity constaints). To make it applicable for monotone classification problems, Greco et al.¬† extended the original rough set theory with their Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA) where the new approach replaces the indiscernibility relation by a dominance relation. After the introduction of DRSA, the original rough set theory is usually referred to as Indiscernibility-based Rough Set Approach (IRSA). Recently, the two were integrated into the Preorder-based Rough Set Approach (PRSA) . A more comprehensive analysis of monotone classification from the statistical learning point of view was given by Kot≈Çowski and S≈Çowi≈Ñski 0. They provided statistical foundations of the monotonicity constraints and developed a machine learning method to incorporate them into data analysis. This method removes inconsistencies in data (‚Äúmonotonizes‚Äù them) in result of an optimization procedure that minimizes the cost of label changes in the decision attribute. It produces a new set of labels called a monotone approximation. This approach also generalizes standard rough sets and provides another probabilistic view of them. The approach found its application in the same areas as DRSA 1, as well as in the development of rule induction and ensemble rules methods 2. In the remainder of the paper, we refer to this method as KS approach. On the other hand, fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory 3 study the gradual truth of logical statements, and are used extensively in modeling imprecise and vague information. One of the ways to utilize fuzzy logic in data analysis is through fuzzy relations that are able to model relationships between numerical vectors. Namely, the usual crisp relations may distinguish only between two extreme cases: either instances relate or do not. Fuzzy relations, on the other hand, can express a degree in which two instances relate on a scale between 0 and 1. This is suitable to model similarity between numerical vectors or other structures (graphs, strings, DNA chains ‚Ä¶). The integration of fuzzy logic and IRSA was initially proposed by Dubois and Prade 4, allowing to approximate fuzzy sets using a fuzzy indiscernibility relation. A similar extension of DRSA to fuzzy set theory was proposed by Greco et al. 5. This article is motivated by the KS approach introduced above in the sense that we generalize the monotonicity constraints using fuzzy relations while the ordinal classes are replaced with fuzzy membership degrees. Instead of a crisp preorder relation (or an equivalence relation if it is symmetric), we will now consider a fuzzy TùëáT-preorder relation to model the relationship between different instances on the condition attributes, where TùëáT refers to a given tùë°t-norm that models conjunction in fuzzy logic. The TùëáT-preorder relations also include TùëáT-equivalence relations that can measure (symmetric) similarity between numerical vectors. Moreover, the new approach requires that the decision attribute is a fuzzy set, i.e., it has to take values from interval  01 . Hence, it is appropriate for problems where the decision attribute can be modeled using values from this interval; concretely, for binary classification and regression problems. Just like the KS approach 0, our proposal is also interesting from the granular computing point of view. Granular computing is a paradigm which involves a partition of information into meaningful groups, classes or clusters called granules 6 7 8, and which has been applied to diverse models in data analysis. For example, in 9 and 0, granular computing using neighborhood systems for the interpretation of granules was studied, while in 1 2 3 4, granular aspects of rough set theory were examined. In particular, the sets obtained with the Kot≈Çowski-S≈Çowi≈Ñski approach, as well as with the novel approach, possess the property of granular representation: they can be represented as unions of meaningful granules  5 6. Such sets are called granularly representable sets . Due to the granular properties of our new approach, we call its result a granular approximation. Granularity of fuzzy rough sets has been already applied in rule induction 7, and we expect that the granular approximations we propose can serve the same purpose. Since granular approximations are natural generalizations of fuzzy rough sets, they can be applied in methods like Fuzzy-Rough Nearest Neighbours (FRNN) for classification 8 9, Fuzzy Rough Prototype Selection (FRPS) 0, Fuzzy Rough Feature Selection (FRFS) 1 2, and so on. The article is also an example of a successful integration of ideas and contributions of rough sets, fuzzy sets and machine learning. Handling inconsistency and granulation are main contributions of rough sets. The theory of fuzzy sets allows us to use fuzzy relations to model a non-binary interaction among instances. For example, fuzzy relations can be used in modeling similarities between instances represented by numerical vectors. At the end, including statistical/machine learning allows us to make data consistent, incurring the least possible cost (w.r.t. some loss function) using optimization methods. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we recall the required preliminaries about statistical learning theory, monotone approximations, fuzzy logic, and fuzzy rough sets. In Section 3, we develop the statistical foundations of granular approximations. Section 4 deals with optimization problems that output granular approximations, while their important properties with proofs are given in Section 5. Section 6 provides didactic examples for the approaches from Section 4. Section 7 contains our conclusion and outlines future work. In Appendix A‚ÄìD, we deal with the dual formulations of the optimization problems introduced in Section 4. Using the duality theory, we obtain greedy algorithms for the optimization problems from Section 4 that allow us to prove Proposition 5.2.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: that include monotonicity constraints are called monotone classification problems.
