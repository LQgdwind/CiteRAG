      "content": "Paper Title: Blockchain-Empowered Trustworthy Data Sharing: Fundamentals, Applications, and Challenges\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n* Pub., Pri., Con., and Hyb. stand for Public, Private, Consortium, and Hybrid respectively. * BC stands for blockchain. A series of work has also been done by integrating blockchain technology into data sharing in other fields such as education, government, and decarbonization. 1) Education: With the innovation of information technology, the education field has made strong shifts when paper physical records have been digitalized and stored on on-premise servers and cloud servers. Although the centralized management approach makes records, such as degrees, course grades, and awards, more accessible than traditional methods, it exposes educational records to a variety of hazards. For example, the test and student scores can be viewed and manipulated without permission. Furthermore, if the school server fails, there is a substantial danger of data loss. Furthermore, contemporary educational systems lack a trust-based data exchange environment. Each educational institution maintains a repository for students’ academic records. When students want to transfer to a different institution, it takes a lot of effort and time for them to request and certify these records. Fortunately, salient features of blockchain technology can promote trusted data storage and sharing for academic institutions. Therefore, in this part, related research on blockchain-based educational data sharing will be reviewed and discussed. The authors in [ref]202 proposed an educational record storage and sharing scheme based on consortium blockchain, storage servers, and smart contracts, named EduRSS. In the system, institutions are consensus nodes that form a consortium blockchain network that stores hash values of educational data, while the entirety of the encrypted original data is kept in the storage server, i.e., the MongoDB database. Moreover, three smart contracts are introduced to manage the joining, data storage, and data sharing processes of institutions. Via experimental results, the storage and encryption times of EduRSS prove to be lower than those of CP-ABE and multi-authority-based CP-ABE  schemes. In , the authors presented a secure and smart scheme, called BSSSQS, for question sharing in education systems. In the scheme, four key entities participate in the data-sharing process: the question setter, the question cloud, the BSSSQS master, and the BSSSQS minion. First, the question setter prepares questions and sends them through an encrypted channel to the question cloud. Following that, the questions are double-checked and organized into question papers. The question papers are then automatically withdrawn from the question cloud and forwarded to the BSSSQS master. To prevent unauthorized access to question papers, the BSSSQS master uses a two-phase encryption technique and creates a smart contract that defines access rules for the BSSSQS minions. The BSSSQS minions, which are universities, exam centers, etc., can access question papers under BSSSQS permission and only decrypt question papers at a specific time. As a result, BSSSQS is safe from the threat of question paper leaks and provides an effective question-sharing scheme for future educational systems. The study in  proposed a blockchain-based work-sharing or collaboration system to ensure authorship when multiple contributors, i.e., teachers, participate in educational content creation. The author designs a new block structure for storing a work’s authorship and work information, which can then be invoked by different teachers and exist in different blockchains of educational materials. When multiple teachers contribute to an educational resource, work blocks will be linked together to establish a blockchain. Besides, to evaluate the contribution of each contributor, a contribution share calculation function is given based on factors, e.g., file size. For system scalability, off-chain storage solutions are presented to keep the original work of contributors. 2) Government: To make wise decisions and create sustainable and far-reaching projects and services for the economy, society, and citizens, governments always collect, gather, analyze, and share data to capture and keep up with global and social information and events. With the brisk maturing of information communication technology, government systems have transformed paper-based data storage and sharing approaches into electronic counterparts, called electronic government (e-government), with goals of achieving fast and effective procedures, high transparency, ensuring accountability, and security and privacy preservation  . Besides, data stored by governments include very sensitive information about citizens, healthcare, and politics, such as identity cards, demographic data, immigration, land registration, and so on. Moreover, current centralized government data storage and sharing solutions are in danger of cyberattacks and data breaches, thus designing and developing a secure, transparent, accountable, and privacy-preserving data storage and data sharing solution is mandatory and urgent  . The essence of blockchain has assisted governments in moving closer to and reaching their objectives. Following that, we will discuss research on blockchain-based government data-sharing applications. In , the authors presented a blockchain-based information resource-sharing system among government departments to ensure data reliability, sharing efficiency, and accountability. A new block structure for storing government information resources is defined, where a block only associates with a transaction, keeping the owner’s control over their shared data. Besides, a consensus mechanism is proposed for data verification and achieving common agreement on a single version of the truth among distributed nodes. With the testbed environment including two local networks comprising ten PCs and two routers, analysis and experiment results demonstrate the efficiency, reliability, and security of the proposed system. The work in  proposed a blockchain-based E-government data sharing framework to safeguard the authenticity and ownership of DPs, and data confidentiality, called GovChain. The GovChain framework is constituted of three layers: 1) application, 2) blockchain system and two function modules, i.e., identity & key services module and CP-ABE, and 3) off-chain storage. In the application layer, application programming interfaces (APIs), command line interfaces, and software development kits are exposed for interaction between GovChain and clients with different data-sharing services. To improve the scalability of the data sharing system, only the hash of encrypted data is kept in blockchain, while original data are stored in the IPFS. Regarding the identity and key services module, it provides an unique identity and a digital certificate for each client and performs functions (e.g., client registration and attribute management) thanks to smart contracts. Finally, in the GovChain, every node is considered as an authority in decentralized CP-ABE scheme, so it can conduct off-chain encryption and decryption algorithm computation to reduce communication overhead. The authors in  proposed a blockchain-based government data-sharing system with the support of a fine-grained access control scheme. To realize data confidentiality and flexible access management, the authors use the advanced encryption standard algorithm  to encrypt data and CP-ABE algorithm for encrypting the hash of the data storage address returned from IPFS. Besides, a linear secret-sharing scheme is utilized to hide access control policies defined by DPs. During the data-sharing process, if a user has abnormal behaviors or malicious activities, its access privilege will be withdrawn by the key generation node, and a new attribute group will be established thanks to coverage technology. 3) Decarbonization:\nDecarbonization is becoming the main priority for the majority of industries. Industrial ecosystems consist of multiple players from different sectors located in close proximity, using shared utilities and connected through physical networks. These ecosystems can contain over 20 production sites producing a range of products, such as chemicals, iron, steel, and petrochemicals. To optimize the energy and resource usage of these interconnected networks, secure and accurate information sharing is becoming crucial. The deployment of digital systems enables real-time interactions between all stakeholders. An example of sharing for decarbonization is European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) was completed in 2005-2007 and saw the allocation of 2.2 billion tons of CO2 emission allowances to over 12,000 installations across 27 EU member states. During this time, the trading of EU ETS allowances increased from 260 million tons to 1.44 billion tons. The authors of the research  provide a comprehensive overview of existing studies on EU ETS from 2005 to 2009, focusing on its operational mechanisms and the economic benefits it generated. They summarize the evolution of the system’s operating mechanisms, such as allowance allocation and pricing, and explain how these mechanisms have influenced the market’s development and economic outcomes. The paper identifies five areas for future research on EU ETS: (1) its impact on energy industries, (2) the interaction between EU ETS and energy markets, (3) evaluation of its impact on socio-economic systems, (4) its impact on non-Annex I countries, and (5) its operating mechanisms. This paper fills a gap in the literature by providing a review of EU ETS after its first phase and offering ideas for future development. Additionally, carbon pricing plays a crucial role in the global carbon emissions trading market. In the paper , the authors analyze the pricing decision principles of the Emissions Trading System (ETS), including the cap and trade principle and the baseline and credit approach. The EU ETS market  provides various carbon pricing schemes with different national policies and compares their outcomes. Carbon pricing can be utilized as a means to control carbon emissions and steer the sustainable development of carbon trading . The authors from [ref]217 examine a new energy-saving and emission reduction (ESER) system based on carbon price constraints in China. The authors [ref]218 introduce the concept of a trusted trading framework for emission allowance among vehicles. This research, for the first time, introduces the concept of emission trading for individual vehicles. Specifically, the Emission Allowance Balance (EAB) can be traded among vehicles based on predefined smart contracts. Whenever Bi​(t)<0subscript𝐵𝑖𝑡0B_{i}(t)<0, there will be a red alert issued to i𝑖i for having a negative balance. This alert is in the form of penalties, or restricted road access to zero-balance vehicles. In this case, the vehicles can either wait until the next period for their EAB of to be reset or buy the EAB from other vehicles. We consider the case of vehicles exchanging EAB on-road via the execution of the smart contract and distributed ledger. For this, let ei,j​(t)subscript𝑒𝑖𝑗𝑡e_{i,j}(t) be the amount of allowances sold by vehicle j𝑗j from vehicle i𝑖i at time t𝑡t. These operations are recorded on-chain. Remark: The vehicle j𝑗j cannot sell more allowances ei​j​(t)subscript𝑒𝑖𝑗𝑡e_{ij}(t) than it actually owns. In other words, i𝑖i cannot buy more than is actually available. Hence, Lessons learned. Then, we state the key lessons from leveraging blockchain-based data in the aforementioned sectors. In the education area, blockchain technology provides a safe and transparent place for storing and sharing data in educational organizations. Students’ data, e.g., school profiles, is kept authenticated, synchronized, immutable, and accessible to authorized users when needed. This eliminates a slow and complex paperwork process for both staff and students when students want to change schools, apply for jobs, or pursue higher degree programs. Besides, teachers can collaborate with others when writing material and have more freedom in building curricula and books without the distress of violating copyright ownership issues. This is because the contributions of authors, including cited works, are all recognized and recorded in the blockchain. Moreover, blockchain-based question sharing creates a fair competitive environment for students by avoiding the leakage of exam questions. With regard to government data sharing between government-to-government, government-to-business, government-to-organization, and government-to-citizen   , applying blockchain technology enhances authenticity, confidentiality, responsibility, and security in government information exchange processes. Especially in cases where the data are sensitive, with the support of cryptographic techniques and blockchain, sharing of the data can be realized at a certain level of security and privacy. Therefore, e-government growth with effective public service delivery is fostered, and relationships and trust between governments, corporations, organizations, and people are strengthened. Blockchain-based data sharing can play a significant role in decarbonization efforts. By securely and transparently sharing data on carbon emissions, stakeholders such as governments, companies, and individuals can work together to reduce their carbon footprint. With a decentralized blockchain platform, each participant can maintain control over their data while still contributing to the larger effort. Smart contracts can be used to automatically enforce policies and trigger actions based on real-time data, providing a more efficient and effective means of achieving decarbonization goals, e.g., emission trading for vehicles. Furthermore, the immutable and auditable nature of blockchain records can ensure the integrity of emissions data, preventing fraud and promoting trust between stakeholders.\n\nReference markers found: [202]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]202: trusted data storage and sharing for academic institutions.
