      "content": "Paper Title: AutoShot: A Short Video Dataset and State-of-the-Art Shot Boundary Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nShort-form videos have been widely digested among the entire age groups all over the world. The percentage of short videos and video-form ads has an explosive growth in the era of 5G, due to the richer contents, better delivery and more persuasive effects of short videos than the image and text modalities [ref]36. This strong trend leads to a significant and urgent demand for a temporally accurate and comprehensive video analysis in addition to a simple video classification category [ref]39 . Shot boundary detection is a fundamental component for temporally comprehensive video analysis and can be a basic block for various tasks, e.g., scene boundary detection  , video structuring [ref]36, and event segmentation . For instance, rewarded videos can be automated created of desired lengths for different platforms, leveraging the accurate shot boundary detection in the intelligent video creation. To accelerate the development of video temporal boundary detection, several datasets have been collected with laboriously manual annotation. Conventional shot boundary detection datasets, e.g., BBC Planet Earth Documentary series  and RAI , only consist of documentaries or talk shows where the scenes are relatively static. Tang et al. [ref]32 further contribute a large-scale video shot database, ClipShots, consisting of different types of videos collected from YouTube and Weibo covering more than 20 categories, including sports, TV shows, animals, etc. Shou et al.  construct a generic event boundary detection (GEBD) dataset, Kinetics-GEBD, which defines a clip as the moment where humans naturally perceive an event. Since the video lengths of short and conventional videos differ extensively, i.e., 90% short videos of length less than one minute versus videos in other datasets having length of 2-60 minutes as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1 Right, it dramatically leads to significant content, display, temporal dynamics and shot transition differences as shown in Fig. 1 Left. A short video dataset is necessary to accelerate the development and proper evaluation of short video based shot boundary detection. On the other hand, several endeavors have been made to improve the accuracy of video shot boundary detection (SBD). DeepSBD 1 firstly applies a deep spatio-temporal ConvNet to the video SBD. Deep structured model (DSM) [ref]32 designs a cascade framework to accelerate the speed of SBD. TransNet 1 uses dilated convolutional cells  to process a sequence of resized frames. TransNetV2  incorporates techniques, e.g., convolution kernel factorization , batch normalization 4, skip connection 2, and further improves F1 scores on ClipShots [ref]32 and BBC . In this work, we firstly collect a short video dataset, named SHOT, consisting of 853 short videos with 11,606 manually shot boundary fine annotations. The 200 test videos with 2,716 shot boundary annotations are labeled by experts with two rounds. Leveraging this new data wealth, we aim to improve the accuracy of video shot boundary detection, by conducting neural architecture search  in a search space encapsulating various advanced 3D ConvNets 5    and Transformers  [ref]39. Single path one-shot SuperNet strategy  and Bayesian optimization 8 are employed. The searched model, named AutoShot, outperforms TransNetV2 by 4.2% on our SHOT in terms of F1 score, and by 3.5% in terms of precision metric with a fixed recall rate as TransNetV2, respectively. We further evaluate the searched AutoShot architecture on ClipShots, BBC and RAI, and F1 score of AutoShot surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches by 1.1%, 0.9% and 1.2%, respectively.\nOur contributions are summarized as follows: We collect a short video shot boundary detection dataset (SHOT), which consists of 853 short videos and 11,606 shot boundary annotations. The SHOT will be released and can be employed to advance the development of various short video understanding tasks. We design a video shot boundary detection search space encapsulating various advanced 3D ConvNets and Transformers, and build a neural architecture search pipeline for shot boundary detection. The searched model, named AutoShot, proves to be a highly competitive shot boundary detection architecture, that significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches not only on its derived SHOT dataset, but also on other public benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, the collected SHOT dataset is the first dataset for short video shot boundary detection, and AutoShot is the firstly specially designed neural architecture search method for shot boundary detection.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: short videos and video-form ads has an explosive growth in the era of 5G, due to the richer contents, better delivery and more persuasive effects of short videos than the image and text modalities [ref]36.
