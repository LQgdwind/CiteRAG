      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey on Table Question Answering: Recent Advances\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe methods discussed in the above subsections are used for closed-domain table QA. In this subsection, we discuss the retriever-reader architecture that is usually adopted for open-domain table QA, which provides answers by retrieval and reading. The retrieval model is in charge of retrieving the related documents containing tables from a large corpus, and the reader is used to produce the answers from the retrieved table documents. The retriever can be further categorized into sparse retriever, dense retriever, and iterative retriever . The sparse/dense retriever uses sparse/dense representations for the question and candidate documents and then performs matching between them. The iterative retriever tries to retrieve the relevant documents in multiple steps, which appends the reliable retrieval from the previous step for the next step of retrieval. As for the reader, it can be further classified into generative reader and extractive reader, which adopt the generative method and extractive method discussed in subsections 5.1 and 5.2, respectively. We depict an overview of these categories in Figure 3 and present the representative works below. Extractive Reader: Chen et al. [ref]5 propose the fusion retriever (a dense retriever) and cross-block reader for OTT-QA task. The fusion retriever first pre-aligns the table segments to their related passages by entity linking and groups them into a fused block. Then, it retrieves the top-kùëòk fused blocks for cross-block reading that uses the long range Transformer. Moreover, Zhong et al.  also train a chain extractor as the auxiliary model for RoBERTa-based dense retriever and Longformer-based  extractive reader. The chain extractor extracts possible reasoning chains from the table; then the reasoning chains are flattened and appended to the retrieved tables as the input of the reader, which leads to better answer selection. Instead of using general pre-trained models, Herzig et al  adopt a table-oriented pre-trained model, TAPAS , as both the dense retriever and extractive reader to achieve better performance. Generative Reader: Li et al. 5 adopt a sparse retriever using BM25 to retrieve tables or text, in which the tables are flattened into passages by concatenating the cell values of each row. After retrieving the top-kùëòk candidate tables or passages, a generative dual reader-parser that is based on FiD model 1 is used to generate the answer directly or produce an SQL query. The FiD model is a Seq2Seq transformer that takes the question and top-kùëòk candidates as input and fuses them in decoder for answer or logical form generation (referred to as Fusion in Decoder, FiD). Whether the output will be a final answer or SQL query is decided by the FiD model automatically based on the input question and its context. UniK-QA 5 also adopts a FiD model as the reader but takes a BERT-based dense retriever¬†6. Moreover, it adapts the model to multiple knowledge sources, including text, tables, and knowledge base, by flattening the (semi-)structured data. The open-domain table QA task is a new challenge that has appeared in recent years. Most works  5 5 simply flatten the tables and adapt methods used in open-domain text-based QA for this task. However, this may lead to the loss of important information in the (semi-)structured data 5. Hence, the encoding methods of tables can be further explored in the open-domain setting.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: extractive method discussed in subsections 5.1 and 5.2, respectively.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
