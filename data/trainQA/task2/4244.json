Event-based Visual Place Recognition Using Sparse But Varying Pixels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA range of feature representations have been proposed for event data, many of them focusing on the object classification task. Event frames  are the simplest representation, where a conventional single-channel image is formed, with each pixel containing the number of events that occurred at that location over either a fixed time period, a fixed number of events across the image, or using adaptive times slices with variable duration . If positive and negative polarities are considered separately, a two-channel image is formed . Lagorce et al.  developed the Hierarchy Of Time Surfaces (HOTS) that describe the recent activity within a local neighboring window, whereby less recent events exponentially decay in value. Sironi et al. proposed Histograms of Averaged Time Surfaces (HATS)  which is less sensitive to noise and contrast when compared to HOTS. FEAST  is an extension of HOTS with adaptive thresholds, which allows for a simpler network architecture and integrated noise filtering. Gehrig et al.  presented a unifying framework that learns the event representation end-to-end in a deep network. Most recently Baldwin et al. [ref]15 introduced Time-Ordered Recent Event (TORE) volumes to compactly store raw spike timing information. Detailed comparisons of different event representations are provided in [ref]15 ; and  compares event representations in the SLAM context. To the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of any other works in the event camera literature that make use of just a tiny fraction of the available pixels. The closest related works in that regard are [ref]23 [ref]24 which focus on estimating the region that an object encompasses to recognize [ref]23 and track [ref]24 the object using attention mechanisms. In addition, a variety of works explore using as few events as possible to e.g. update event-based graph networks   or spiking neural networks  in the temporal domain, but in contrast to our work, still use all available pixels spatially. Note that the sparse event representation in our work is task-specific and not likely to be applicable in other tasks without modifications.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: network architecture and integrated noise filtering.
