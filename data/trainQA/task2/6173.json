GCL is illustrated on the left of Fig. 1 where the complete interval is divided into three tasks. Each task is signified by a learning problem (graph classification, node classification, regression of graphs or link prediction) on a collection of a graphs. The goal at the onset of the first task is train a graph neural network (a neural network that takes graphs as input) to achieve perfect performance on the first task. After the first tasks is finished, another task is observed and we seek to perform the second task well while remembering the first task. However, as this second task may present new vertices and/or edges along with new edge features and/or vertex features, updating the model naively using the second task will reduce the models’ effectiveness on the first task (previous task) due to a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting . This behaviour highlights an unusual dilemma in the CL domain, known as the stability-plasticity dilemma , where a model in pursuit of learning new experiences (generalize to new tasks) loses long-term memory (remember previous tasks). This dilemma provides a natural objective for GCL: balance forgetting and generalization. To facilitate this balance and achieve improved CL performance on graph tasks one must model the dynamics between forgetting and generalization – something the literature does not do, more on this in section Section 1.1 The first work to formalize these notion of balance in CL was presented in meta-experience replay (MER) , where the balance between forgetting and generalization is enforced with hyperparameters. Our prior work in  1 attempted to take an alternative adaptive dynamic programming viewpoint of CL to model the this balance and its dynamics with changing tasks. However, both  and our prior work in  1 does not naturally extend to graph neural network (neural networks that are specifically designed to take graphs as inputs 3). In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have facilitated unprecedented efficiency   3 for datasets with graph inputs. However, much of this research involves cases when all the training graphs are available upfront. In many applications, however, graphs are observed in sequence, and the distribution of the graphs is nonstationary 5. Thus, we must train the GNN to adapt to the sequential nature of graph generation. While the GCL literature is sparse, several methods [ref]34    8 have been proposed in recent years.\nThere are two key issues with the current GCL literature, first, none of the methods in the GCL literature model the dynamics introduced into the GCL problem by the non-stationarity in graphs.\nFurthermore, the balance between generalization and forgetting and these methods are not modeled in any prior work and despite promising initial advances, the current GCL methods [ref]34    8 do not provide any theoretical characterization of GCL.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: and the distribution of the graphs is nonstationary 5.
