      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamical Isometry: The Missing Ingredient for Neural Network Pruning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConventional pruning. Pruning aims to remove as many parameters as possible in a neural network meanwhile maintaining its performance. There are many ways to categorize pruning methods. The most popular two are grouping by pruning structure and methodology. (1) In terms of structure, pruning can be specified into unstructured pruning¬† 4 and structured pruning¬† [ref]28 . For the former, a single weight is the basic pruning element. Unstructured pruning can deliver a high compression ratio; whereas, without regularization, the pruned locations usually spread randomly in the network, which is hard to exploit for acceleration. On the opposite, structured pruning introduces certain patterns in the pruned locations, which benefit subsequent acceleration while cannot achieve as much compression. Choices between unstructured and structured pruning depend on specific application needs. For structured pruning, there are still many sub-groups¬†. In the literature, without specific mention, structured pruning means filter pruning or channel pruning. (2) In terms of pruning methodology (i.e., how to select unimportant weights to prune), pruning falls into two paradigms in general: importance-based and penalty-based. The former prunes weights based on some established importance criteria, such as magnitude (for unstructured pruning)¬† 4 or L1subscriptùêø1L_{1}-norm (for filter pruning)¬†[ref]28, saliency based on 2nd-order gradients (e.g., Hessian or Fisher)¬†    . The latter adds a penalty term to the objective function, drives unimportant weights towards zero, then removes those with the smallest magnitude. Note, the two groups are not starkly separated. Many methods take wisdom from both sides. For example,¬†   select unimportant weights by magnitude (akin to the first group) while also employing the regularization to penalize weights (akin to the second group). There is no conclusion about which paradigm is better, yet empirically, the state-of-the-art pruning methods are closer to the second paradigm, i.e., deciding weights via training instead of some derived formulas. Although no theories have formally discussed the reason, we can take a rough guess with the knowledge from this paper: Training can\nrecover dynamical isometry, which is beneficial to subsequent finetuning. For more comprehensive literature, we refer interested readers to several surveys: an outdated one¬†, some recent surveys of pruning alone¬†  or pruning as a sub-topic under the general umbrella of model compression and acceleration¬†   . Pruning at initialization (PaI). Recent years have seen some new pruning paradigms. The most prominent one is pruning at initialization. Different from the conventional pruning, which prunes a pretrained model, PaI methods prune a randomly initialized model. Existing PaI approaches mainly include¬† [ref]26  1 8 and the series of lottery ticket hypothesis¬† 0. We refer interested readers to¬† for a more comprehensive summary about this new pruning paradigm. This topic is relevant to this work mainly because one PaI paper¬†[ref]26 also examines pruning using the tool of dynamical isometry. Our work is different from theirs in that (1) they focus on pruning a random network while ours focus on the broader conventional pruning; (2) we show how dynamical isometry can be used to unveil two important open problems in pruning.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: pruning methods.
