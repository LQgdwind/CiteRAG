Many of these advances are obtained by model-free (MFRL) methods, whose desirable asymptotic performance yet comes at the cost of sample efficiency. Hence their applications are mostly limited to simulation scenarios  [ref]33 . In contrast, Model-Based RL (MBRL) methods, which learn a transition model directly from orders-of-magnitude fewer samples and then derive the optimal policy from the learned model, have become an appealing alternative in small-data and more practical cases [ref]37   . In general, MBRL methods alternate between the two stages: model learning and policy optimization (e.g. the general Dyna-style  ). A more accurate model will lead to a better policy. Various attempts have been proposed to improve model accuracy by investigating high-capacity models (the model ensemble technique   and better function approximators  ) or amending the policy optimization stage based on model bias      .\nEven so, their resultant models are just accurate in a local and relative sense, since the learning is conditional on a fixed number of state-action tuples explored by the policy at the current step, other than the full transition dynamics of the environment. Indeed, it is tricky to determine how much we should explore. Insufficient exploration would trap the model and the following policy optimization, whereas excessive newly-encountered state-action pairs would confuse the model and later cause policy chattering.\nTo derive a “truly” accurate model, we need a smarter scheme to choose different numbers of explorations at different times, instead of the unchanged setting in current methods. From an optimization point of view, the thinking of how to derive an accurate model for MBRL in a global sense also motivates us to investigate the monotonicity of the optimization target (i.e. the return of the learned model and policy in MBRL), which, unfortunately, is less explored and not well guaranteed in current works.\nHowever, discussing the monotonicity guarantee for MBRL is challenging by any means, arising from the coupling of the model learning and policy optimization processes.\nAlthough there has been recent interest in related subjects, most of the theoretical works seek to characterize the monotonicity in terms of a fixed model of interest     , which does not naturally fit our case when the model is dynamically shifted. In this paper, we study how to guarantee the optimization monotonicity theoretically, upon which we then develop an event-triggered strategy that learns the model from a dynamically-varying number of explorations.\nIn particular, we interestingly find that the lower bound of the performance improvement between two adjacent alternation steps in MBRL is dependent on the one-step model accuracy plus the constraint of the model shifts under certain mild assumptions. This discovery encourages us to formulate a constrained optimization problem, in order to permit positive performance improvement and thus the optimization monotonicity for MBRL. We also give a feasible solution example to show that dynamical alternation between model learning and policy exploration does benefit performance monotonicity. To resolve the constrained optimization problem, we design a simple but effective algorithm CMLO (Constrained Model-shift Lower-bound) equipped with an event-triggered mechanism.\nThis mechanism first estimates whether the model shifts meet the constraint and then decides when to train the model. We evaluate CMLO on several continuous control benchmark tasks. The results show that CMLO learns much faster than other state-of-the-art MBRL methods and yields promising asymptotic performance compared with the model-free counterparts. Note that our optimization framework is general and can be applied to different backbones of policy optimization algorithms, which is also ablated in our experiments.\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: Reinforcement learning (RL) has driven impressive advances in many complex decision-making problems in recent years  [ref]48.
