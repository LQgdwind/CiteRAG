      "content": "Paper Title: Local consistency as a reduction between constraint satisfaction problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIs it possible to find a mathematical invariant that characterises when one computational problem reduces to another by a polynomial-time (Karp) reduction? This question is far beyond our current understanding as it would imply a characterisation of polynomial-time solvable problems, possibly resolving the P vs.¬†NP problem. The present paper is a contribution to the effort to provide a partial answer to this question by characterising certain well-structured efficient reductions between structured problems. Though it is usually not described in these words, a characterisation of a subclass of polynomial-time (in fact log-space) reductions in terms of certain mathematical invariants of the problem is the core of a theory referred to as the algebraic approach to the constraint satisfaction problem. Development of this theory started with Jeavons, Cohen, and Gyssens [ref]32 and Bulatov, Jeavons, and Krokhin [ref]16.\nThe scope of this theory is the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) which is a decision problem whose input consists of a list of variables, with each variable allowed to attain values from a finite domain, and a list of constraints each involving a tuple of variables. The goal is to decide if there is an assignment of values to variables that simultaneously satisfies all the constraints.\nBy restricting the shape of the constraints allowed in a CSP one can encode a large family of computational problems, including SAT, graph kùëòk-colouring, or solving systems of linear equations. Many of these problems naturally arise in various settings.\nThese CSPs possess great expressiveness power and, as proven by Feder and Vardi , finite-domain CSPs is one of the largest natural subclasses of NP, defined via syntactic prescriptions, that could exhibit a P vs.¬†NP-complete dichotomy.\nFurthermore, CSPs are well-structured from a mathematical perspective since every CSP is parametrised by a single relational structure. Consequently, significant efforts have been devoted to classifying their computational complexity via the above mentioned algebraic approach, culminating with a celebrated dichotomy theorem of Bulatov  and Zhuk . The essence of the algebraic approach is a characterisation of gadget reductions between constraint satisfaction problems in terms of invariants of the problem called polymorphisms. Loosely speaking, a gadget reduction replaces each variable of the input with a tuple of variables of a fixed length, and each constraint on the input with a gadget of constraints on the newly introduced variables (possibly introducing more new variables).\nA remarkable fact is that, in the realm of finite template CSPs, gadget reductions are enough to provide all necessary NP-hardness, i.e., a finite template CSP is NP-complete if all other finite template CSPs reduce to it via a gadget reduction, and in P otherwise. The tractability side of the CSP dichotomy is given by providing an efficient algorithm for solving all other CSPs. The algorithms of Bulatov  and Zhuk  were the last piece of the dichotomy to be proven, and both of them rely on a¬†deep understanding of structural properties of CSP templates. A recent popular direction of CSP research is focused on a more general version of CSPs, promise constraint satisfaction problems. In this promise version of the problem, each instance comes with two versions of each constraint, a stronger and a weaker one. The goal is then decide between two (disjoint, but not complementary) cases: all stronger constraints can be satisfied, or not even the weaker constraints can be satisfied. A prominent problem described in this scope is approximate graph colouring which asks, e.g., to decide between graphs that are 3-colourable and those that are not even 6-colourable.\nA systematic study of promise CSPs has been started by Austrin, Guruswami, and H√•stad [ref]4 which studied a certain promise version of SAT, and continued in a series of papers including generalisations of the algebraic approach to promise CSPs by Brakensiek and Guruswami  and Barto, Bul√≠n, Krokhin, and Opr≈°al . While the extension of the algebraic approach for promise CPS has proven fruitful. There is a solid basis for an argument that any theory aiming to tackle a full classification of promise CSPs must incorporate a richer notion of reduction as, unlike in (classic) CSP, gadget reductions alone cannot adequately explain many of the existing NP-hardness results, e.g., those by Dinur, Regev, and Smyth ; Huang ; Austrin, Guruswami, and H√•stad [ref]4; Krokhin and Opr≈°al ; Ficak, Kozik, Ol≈°√°k, and Stankiewicz ; Wrochna and ≈Ωivn√Ω ; Brandts, Wrochna, and ≈Ωivn√Ω ; Barto, Battistelli, and Berg ; Nakajima and ≈Ωivn√Ω . These hardness results usually rely on variations of the PCP theorem of Arora and Safra  which is better suited for a different, more analytical, approximation version of CSPs. Indeed, new reductions for promise CSPs have been called for in Barto, Bul√≠n, Krokhin, and Opr≈°al  and Barto and Kozik . The primary objective of the present paper is to offer a novel perspective on the complexity landscape of CSPs and promise CSPs that is focused on reductions rather than algorithms, or algebraic hardness conditions. We aim to identify a class of efficient reductions that can potentially fulfil a similar role to that of gadget reductions in a broader framework of (promise) CSPs.\nTo this end, the suggested class of reductions should have the following properties: robustness, informally meaning that the notion of reduction remains invariant under minor variations in its definition. In particular, it should be closed under composition. In the scope of (promise) CSPs, it is also natural to require that the reductions are monotone with respect to the homomorphism order, so that the structure of the problem is preserved. expressiveness, that is, it should significantly extend the capabilities of gadget reductions. characterisability, meaning that it must be possible to characterise, in some terms similar to the algebraic characterisation of gadget reductions, whether a given (promise) CSP reduces to another given (promise) CSP.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: invariants of the problem is the core of a theory referred to as the algebraic approach to the constraint satisfaction problem.
