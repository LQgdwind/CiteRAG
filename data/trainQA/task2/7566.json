      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Graphs via Hierarchical Semantic Environments\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExtensive experiments were conducted on real-world graph data from diverse domains. CMNIST-75sp. The task is to classify each graph that is converted from an image in the ColoredMNIST dataset [ref]2 into the corresponding handwritten digit using the superpixels algorithm . Distribution shifts exist on node attributes by adding random noises in the testing set. Graph-SST datasets. We utilize sentiment graph data from SST5 and SST-Twitter datasets from [ref]46. For the Graph-SST5 dataset, graphs are split into different sets based on averaged node degrees to create distribution shifts. For the Graph-Twitter dataset, we invert the split order to assess the out-of-distribution generalization capability of GNNs trained on large-degree graphs to smaller ones. DrugOOD. We use six datasets in DrugOOD [ref]20 that are provided with manually specified environment labels. DrugOOD provides more diverse splitting indicators, including assay, scaffold, and size. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of our method under different environment definitions, we adopt these three different splitting schemes on categories IC50 and EC50 provided in DrugOOD. Then we obtain six datasets, EC50-* and IC50-*, where the suffix * specifies the splitting scheme i.e. IC50/EC50-assay/scaffold/size. We comprehensively compare our methods with the following categories of baselines: (1) ERM denotes supervised learning with empirical risk minimization . (2) Euclidean OOD methods: We compare with SOTA invariant learning methods from the Euclidean regime, including IRM [ref]2, V-REX , EIIL , IB-IRM . (3) Graph OOD methods: We also compare with SOTA invariant learning methods from the graph regime. Graph OOD methods can be further split into three groups: environment generation-based baseline methods including GREA  and LiSA , environment augmentation-based baseline methods including DisC 0 and CIGA  and environment inference-based baseline methods including GIL , MoleOOD , and GALA . All methods use the same GIN backbone  and the same optimization protocol for fair comparisons. Each of the methods is configured using the same parameters reported in the original paper or selected by grid search. For a fair comparison, we use the same embedding size for all methods. We tune the hyperparameters following the common practice. All details are given in Appendix. We report the ROC-AUC score in the DrugOOD dataset and the accuracy score for the rest of the datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Extensive experiments were conducted on real-world graph data from diverse domains.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
