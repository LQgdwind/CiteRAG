      "content": "Paper Title: MPDIoU: A Loss for Efficient and Accurate Bounding Box Regression\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nObject detection and instance segmentation are two important problems of computer vision, which have attracted a large scale of researchers’ interests during the past few years. Most of the state-of-the-art object detectors (e.g., YOLO series  [ref]2  [ref]4 [ref]5 , Mask R-CNN , Dynamic R-CNN  and DETR ) rely on a bounding box regression (BBR) module to determine the position of objects. Based on this paradigm, a well-designed loss function is of great importance for the success of BBR. So far, most of the existing loss functions for BBR fall into two categories: ℓnsubscriptℓ𝑛\\ell_{n}-norm based loss functions and Intersection over Union (IoU)-based loss functions. However, most of the existing loss functions for bounding box regression have the same value under different prediction results, which decreases the convergence speed and accuracy of bounding box regression. Therefore, considering the advantages and drawbacks of the existing loss functions for bounding box regression, inspired by the geometric features of horizontal rectangle, we try to design a novel loss function ℒM​P​D​I​o​Usubscriptℒ𝑀𝑃𝐷𝐼𝑜𝑈\\mathcal{L}_{MPDIoU} based on the minimum points distance for bounding box regression, and use M​P​D​I​o​U𝑀𝑃𝐷𝐼𝑜𝑈MPDIoU as a new measure to compare the similarity between the predicted bounding box and the groundtruth bounding box in the bounding box regression process. We also provide an easy-implemented solution for calculating M​P​D​I​o​U𝑀𝑃𝐷𝐼𝑜𝑈MPDIoU between two axis-aligned rectangles, allowing it to be used as an evaluation metric to incorporate M​P​D​I​o​U𝑀𝑃𝐷𝐼𝑜𝑈MPDIoU into state-of-the-art object detection and instance segmentation algorithms, and we test on some of the mainstream object detection, scene text spotting and instance segmentation datasets such as PASCAL VOC 0, MS COCO 1, IIIT5k 2 and MTHv2 3 to verify the performance of our proposed M​P​D​I​o​U𝑀𝑃𝐷𝐼𝑜𝑈MPDIoU. The contribution of this paper can be summarized as below:\n1. We considered the advantages and disadvantages of the existing I​o​U𝐼𝑜𝑈IoU-based losses and ℓnsubscriptℓ𝑛\\ell_{n}-norm losses, and then proposed an I​o​U𝐼𝑜𝑈IoU loss based on minimum points distance called ℒM​P​D​I​o​Usubscriptℒ𝑀𝑃𝐷𝐼𝑜𝑈\\mathcal{L}_{MPDIoU} to tackle the issues of existing losses and obtain a faster convergence speed and more accurate regression results.\n2. Extensive experiments have been conducted on object detection, character-level scene text spotting and instance segmentation tasks. Outstanding experimental results validate the superiority of the proposed M​P​D​I​o​U𝑀𝑃𝐷𝐼𝑜𝑈MPDIoU loss. Detailed ablation studies exhibit the effects of different settings of loss functions and parameter values.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: two important problems of computer vision, which have attracted a large scale of researchers’ interests during the past few years.
