      "content": "Paper Title: The Quantum Abstract Machine (Extended Version)\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nQuantum computers offer unique capabilities that can be used to\nimplement substantially faster algorithms than those classical computers are capable of. For example, Grover’s search algorithm  [ref]21 can query unstructured data in sub-linear time (compared to linear time on a classical computer), and Shor’s algorithm  can factor integers in polynomial time (no existing classical algorithm for this problem is polynomial-time).\nQuantum computing, via mechanisms such as quantum teleportation  2,\nalso supports secure communication capabilities that can transmit information without the possibility of eavesdropping.\nThese capabilities of quantum computation are motivating researchers to build hybrid classical-quantum communication networks (HCQNs), including so-called quantum internets ,\nthat integrate quantum computing and existing classical network facilities to provide secure information transmission, with several HCQN protocols being proposed [ref]7  5 8. The growing interest in quantum communication systems has also spurred work on formal approaches to modeling and verifying quantum communication protocols.\nFrameworks   9 based on process algebra have been proposed to model HCQN systems particularly.\nThese frameworks have generally focused on enhancing existing message-passing process algebras  4 with notations for describing quantum circuits  and their physical behaviors based on precise linear-algebraic quantum-state interpretations.\nThe virtue of these approaches is their fidelity to the semantics of quantum states, but with two major issues.\nThe precise quantum interpretations require classical resources exponential in their quantum descriptions, so the automated verification procedures for such descriptions moreover must confront problems of combinatorial explosion.\nAdditionally, the message passing model, which the process algebras are based on, can fall afoul of quantum physical realities, such as no relocations or remote controls of quantum qubit resources, so defining protocols in these frameworks requires a significant background in quantum physics to employ;\notherwise, users might define semantically sound protocols that are physically impossible to construct. This fact limits their use to system modelers well-versed in quantum physics. To address these issues, we introduce the Quantum Abstract Machine (QAM),\ninspired by the classical Chemical Abstract Machine  (CHAM) and Linda ,\nas a basis for the abstract, yet accurate, modeling of quantum communication.\nOur approach involves identifying a set of action primitives for modeling HCQN behavior and then giving them direct operational semantics rather than interpreting them in the traditional framework as unitary matrices of complex numbers.\nIn addition, HCQN behaviors show different functional behaviors from traditional network protocols, which direct the QAM’s design.\nThis yields semantics that abstracts away many low-level details while preserving essential functional HCQN behaviors and physical realities, While channels in classical networks are identifiers, in HCQNs, quantum channels have a limited lifetime and act as the carriers for conveying quantum messages;\nthus, they must be properly created before a quantum message can be delivered, with new operations to connect them with quantum messages in the QAM.\nSecondly, the no-cloning theorem  indicates that the delivery of a quantum message cannot simply copy the message to the other party,\ni.e., once a quantum message is delivered, the sender no longer has the message, which contravenes classical message passing.\nThirdly, as we mentioned above, the physical reality of quantum computing is that quantum qubit resources are localized,\nso they cannot be relocated to distinct locations, and there is very limited way, if it is no way, to remotely manipulate quantum resources,\nThis indicates a regional concept for quantum resources, and we adopt the membrane concept from CHAM to model it.\nFinally, HCQNs permit the connections between quantum and classical messages,\ne.g., a classical message must be measured out from a quantum qubit in quantum teleportation ,\nwhich involves the nondeterministic generation of values. However, the nondeterminism is not completely random.\nInstead, in quantum teleportation, the result of a quantum message measurement creates a pair of classical and quantum residues, and they perform like a key lock pair,\nso we can recover the original quantum message by combining the right two residues, as if we match the right key and lock.\nAll these aspects and the QAM’s design are discussed throughout the paper, and the following is our list of contributions. We develop the QAM, with its syntax and semantics (\\Creffsec:sem), suitable for defining HCQN protocols. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first abstract semantics for describing HCQN behaviors without the involvement of quantum circuits. We carefully employ HCQN properties and physical limitations in the QAM’s design so the definable QAM protocols correctly respect these properties and limitations. The QAM helps explore many HCQN properties, such as \\Creffdef:no-cloning-good and \\Creffdef:decoding-good. We extend the QAM to describe and evaluate real-world multi-location HCQN protocols (\\Creffsec:case-study), demonstrating a certain probability of failure. To demonstrate the extendability and utility of the QAM, we utilize trace-refinement in the evaluation framework to reason about the similarity of two HCQN protocols, such as QPASS and QCAST 5.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: Quantum computers offer unique capabilities that can be used to\nimplement substantially faster algorithms than those classical computers are capable of.
