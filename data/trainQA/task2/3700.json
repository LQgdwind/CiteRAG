      "content": "Paper Title: Energy-based Latent Aligner for Incremental Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIncremental Learning: In this setting a model consistently improves itself on new tasks, without compromising its performance on old tasks.\nOne popular approach to achieve this behaviour is by constraining the parameters to not deviate much from previously tuned values [ref]28 1    2.\nIn this regard, knowledge distillation  has been used extensively to enforce explicit regularization in incremental classification [ref]28 1  and object detection    settings.\nIn replay based methods, typically a small subset of exemplars is stored to recall and retain representations useful for earlier tasks 1 2   . Another set of isolated parameter learning methods dedicate separate subsets of parameters to different tasks, thus avoiding interference e.g., by new network blocks or gating mechanisms\n    . Further, meta-learning approaches have been explored to learn the update directions which are shared among multiple incremental tasks   . In contrast to these approaches, we propose to learn an EBM to align implicit feature distributions between incremental tasks. ELI can enhance these existing methods without any methodological modifications, by enforcing an implicit latent space regularization using the learned energy manifold. Energy-based Models: EBMs  are a type of maximum likelihood estimation models that can assign low energies to observed data-label pairs and high energies otherwise 1.\nEBMs have been used for out-of-distribution sample detection  , structured prediction    and improving adversarial robustness 7 1. Joint Energy-based Model (JEM) 4 shows that any classifier can be reinterpreted as a generative model that can model the joint likelihood of labels and data. While JEM requires alternating between a discriminative and generative objective, Wang et al. 9 propose an energy-based open-world softmax objective that can jointly perform discriminative learning and generative modeling.\nEBMs have also been used for synthesizing images 3  8 7.\nXie et al. 4 represents EBM using a CNN and utilizes Langevin dynamics for MCMC\nsampling to generate realistic images.\nIn contrast to these methods, we explore the utility of the EBMs to alleviate forgetting in a continual learning paradigm.\nMost of these methods operate in the data space, where sampling from the EBM would be expensive7. Differently, we learn the energy manifold with the latent representations, which is faster and effective in controlling the representational shift that affects incremental models.\nA recent unpublished work  proposes to replace the standard softmax layer of an incremental model with an energy-based classifier head. Our approach introduces an implicit regularization in the latent space using the learned energy manifold which is fundamentally different from their approach, scales well to harder datasets and diverse settings (classification and detection).\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: on new tasks, without compromising its performance on old tasks.\nOne popular approach to achieve this behaviour is by constraining the parameters to not deviate much from previously tuned values [ref]28 1    2.\nIn this regard, knowledge distillation  has been used extensively to enforce explicit regularization in incremental classification [ref]28 1  and object detection    settings.\nIn\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
