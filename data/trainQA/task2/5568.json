Early works of ECE mostly were dependent on linguistic rules     or traditional machine learning algorithms . With the development of the deep neural network, the recent works of ECE task gradually adopted the deep learning models, such as co-attention [ref]20, self-attention , multi-task learning , graph neural networks [ref]33, and external knowledge incorporation [ref]34, to solve this task. Specifically,  proposed a convolutional multiple-slot memory network that simultaneously captures each word’s context.  unified the emotion classification and cause detection to fully exploit the interaction between emotion classification and cause detection. [ref]20 considered the emotional context awareness to construct the co-attention network to incorporate the emotional information into the clause representation.  viewed ECE as a reordered prediction problem and took previous clauses’ prediction labels into the subsequent clauses’ subsequent prediction.  adopted Transformer  as the clause encoder to encode the mutual indication among clauses in a document to extract the emotion cause clause based on such global information. [ref]33 constructed a graph structure based on the inter-clause dependency and proposed a graph convolutional network with the fusion of semantics and structural information (FSS-GCNs), which captures the semantic relevance and structural constricts among clauses simultaneously.  proposed a two-stage supervised method from the perspective of information retrieval ranking to extract the emotion causes. It distinguishes the causes for each emotion in contexts by using the query performance predictors in the first stage and then considers the emotional complexity to enhance the ranking model for accurately extracting the causal clauses in the second stage.  used the hierarchical RNN to model the document structure and injected the sentiment lexicon and common knowledge into the model in a regularized way to constrain the model parameters.  utilized the hierarchy and bidirectionally of context to focus on the relevant contextual information to the candidate cause clause and incorporate that information as the features for detecting the emotion causes.  proposed a Hierarchical Inter-Clause Interaction Network (HICIN) network to capture the inter-clause interaction on both word-level and clause-level, which captures the semantic cues at multiple granularities.  formalized ECPE as a probability problem and evaluated the mutual information between emotion clause and cause clause. Furthermore,  proved the conjecture on the emotion-cause causality and mutual information.\n[ref]34 utilized commonsense knowledge to construct the emotion trigger path between candidate clauses and emotion clauses and proposed a novel strategy to generate adversarial examples to alleviate the position bias of the benchmark dataset.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: rules     or traditional machine learning algorithms .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
