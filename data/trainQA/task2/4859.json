      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Clustering With Consensus Representations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nClustering is the task of unsupervised classification, where we infer cluster labels from the data.111Our code is available at https://gitlab.cs.univie.ac.at/lukas/deccs. Deep clustering (DC) combines unsupervised deep learning and clustering to learn representations (embeddings) that improve clustering performance. Current DC methods are designed with only a single clustering model in mind, e.g., DEC [ref]1 which improves the representation for kùëòk-means , VaDE  for Gaussian mixture models , DeepECT  for hierarchical clustering , and SpectralNet [ref]7 for spectral clustering . Relying on the assumptions of a single clustering model leads to poor results if the assumptions are not met by the data. Consensus clustering (CC) can alleviate the limitations of individual clusterings by combining a clustering ensemble into a single robust clustering . Unfortunately, applying current CC methods to high-dimensional data sets leads to unsatisfactory results, because they are either limited to linear transformations   , only work for kùëòk-means like clusterings [ref]13, or only use CC information as input features for DC without updating the CC in response to improved data representations  . In contrast to that, we propose our novel Deep Embedded Clustering with Consensus representationS (DECCS) method, which is a DC method that can be applied to high-dimensional data, finds non-linearly hidden clusters and works with many existing clustering algorithms. DECCS learns a consensus representation (CR) that maximizes the agreement between ensemble members.\nThe key idea we use for consensus representation learning with DECCS is that most clustering methods can find well-separated clusters in a low-dimensional space that have a simple shape, e.g., dense, spherical clusters. Using this idea, DECCS learns a consensus representation by transforming the embedded space such that it is trivial to cluster and, therefore, all ensemble members naturally agree on one partitioning into clusters. Fig. 1 illustrates on a synthetic data set how DECCS transforms an initial embedding that contains clusters of different shapes to a consensus representation that consists only of dense, spherical, and well separated clusters. In Fig. 2, multiple, heterogeneous algorithms with different assumptions about the cluster structure are applied to the initial autoencoder (AE) embedding (upper row). Initially, the clustering algorithms perform poorly, but applied to the consensus representation learned with DECCS all algorithms in the ensemble reach the same, perfect clustering (bottom row) as measured with the adjusted rand index (ARI) .\nIn Fig. 3, we apply existing DC methods to the same synthetic data set using the same AE and plot their learned embeddings. While this data set can be clustered by classical clustering techniques, we see that DC methods fail, because their assumptions are not met. For example, DEC is performing poorly because the data set contains non-spherical clusters, which is not suited for kùëòk-means. As a consequence DEC is producing a distorted embedding (first column). In this work, we tackle the shortcomings of existing DC and CC techniques and present the following contributions: We introduce the idea of a consensus representation, which is a representation that maximizes the agreement of the applied clustering algorithms by producing similar clustering results for all clustering methods included in the ensemble. We propose DECCS, the first DC algorithm that can include multiple heterogeneous clustering methods to jointly improve the learned embedding and clustering results by simplifying the representation. Our method is outperforming several relevant baselines in terms of cluster performance.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: deep learning and clustering to learn representations (embeddings) that improve clustering performance.
