      "content": "Paper Title: Curious Exploration via Structured World Models Yields Zero-Shot Object Manipulation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCurious free-play has been identified as a driving force in child development, allowing children to efficiently explore their environment and build an understanding of the world .\nSuch intrinsically motivated exploration schemes are especially attractive in open-ended learning scenarios to guide an agent even without extrinsic tasks and corresponding rewards. Similar to how children learn, we want Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents to learn through play and then be able to solve new tasks quickly.\nWe address both challenges in this work. Minimization of novelty (or surprise) is a prominent formulation of curiosity, with several psychological studies showcasing the role of novelty in children’s curious exploration   . Novelty as an intrinsic reward signal has also been adopted in RL, where agents try to resolve a cognitive disequilibrium [ref]5 [ref]6. However, applying entirely intrinsic task-agnostic exploration to object manipulation scenarios in a sample-efficient manner is an ongoing challenge as the relevant information lies in the sparse agent-object and object-object interactions. These compositional multi-object manipulation environments highlight one of the significant weaknesses of the current novelty-based intrinsic motivation methods: a novel stimulus alone does not necessarily mean that it contains useful or generalizable information for an individual .\nThus, curious exploration needs to attend to a subset of possibilities, as supported by studies in psychology  .\nAnalyzing children during free play accumulated evidence that infants have innate biases and heuristics to help guide their attention toward relevant\nand informative\nfeatures of the environment 0 1.\nOur goal is to improve curious exploration in RL by incorporating appropriate inductive biases. We hypothesize that viewing the world as a collection of entities and their interactions is such a “useful” inductive bias, which was also put forward in Tsividis et al. 2. However, instead of utilizing explicit theory-based modeling, we exploit a relational inductive bias by using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) as our choice of model 3 and learn everything from interactions.\nWe postulate that curious exploration via epistemic uncertainty of such a model leads to the collection of valuable data as it inherits this structure. This paper shows how online planning methods can efficiently exploit learned models, both for exploration and zero-shot generalization to tasks.\nRecent advances in general-purpose model predictive control methods have reduced their complexity and show strong performance when good forward models are available 4 5.\nWe build on this work to create a self-reinforcing cycle between learning good models and good exploration.\nThanks to their ability to plan for a new task without further training,\nmodels efficiently track the naturally changing exploration targets and perform downstream tasks in a zero-shot generalization manner. We propose CEE-US: Curious Exploration using Epistemic Uncertainty via Structured Models that achieves sample-efficient and interaction-rich exploration in multi-object manipulation environments.\nTo our knowledge, we are the first to\nuse GNN ensemble disagreement for computing intrinsic motivation signals in RL. A further major contribution of our method is to combine GNN-based epistemic uncertainty with planning methods in a task-agnostic setting and demonstrate zero-shot generalization to challenging object manipulation tasks.\nWe provide a brief comparison to related work in Table 1 and provide more details in Sec. 4.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: studies showcasing the role of novelty in children’s curious exploration   .
