      "content": "Paper Title: POTTER: Pooling Attention Transformer for Efficient Human Mesh Recovery\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the blooming of deep learning techniques in the computer vision community, rapid progress has been made in understanding humans from monocular images such as human pose estimation (HPE). No longer satisfied with detecting 2D or 3D human joints from monocular images, human mesh recovery (HMR) which can estimate 3D human pose and shape of the entire human body has drawn increasing attention. Various real-world applications such as gaming, human-computer interaction, and virtual reality (VR) can be facilitated by HMR with rich human body information. However, HMR from single images is extremely challenging due to complex human body articulation, occlusion, and depth ambiguity. Recently, motivated by the evolution of the transformer architecture in natural language processing, Vision Transformer (ViT)  successfully introduced transformer architecture to the field of computer vision. The attention mechanism in transformer architecture demonstrates a strong ability to model global dependencies in comparison to the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. With this trend, the transformer-based models have sparked a variety of computer vision tasks, including object detection7 , semantic segmentation 9 , and video understanding 3  with promising results. For HMR, the SOTA methods   all utilize the transformer architecture to exploit non-local relations among different human body parts for achieving impressive performance. However, one significant limitation of these SOTA HMR methods is model efficiency. Although transformer-based methods  [ref]19 lead to great improvement in terms of accuracy, the performance gain comes at the cost of a substantial computational and memory overhead. The large CNN backbones are needed for  [ref]19 to extract features first. Then, computational and memory expensive transformer architectures are applied to process the extracted features for the mesh reconstruction. Mainly pursuing higher accuracy is not an optimal solution for deploying HMR models in real-world applications such as human-computer interaction, animated avatars, and VR gaming (for instance, SOTA method METRO  requires 229M Params and 56.6G MACs as shown in Fig. 1). Therefore, it is important to also consider the memory footprint and computational complexity when evaluating an HMR model. To bridge this gap, we aim to design a lightweight end-to-end transformer-based network for efficient HMR. Observing that the transformer blocks (attention-based approaches in Fig. 2 (a) and MLP-based approaches in Fig. 2 (b)) are usually computational and memory consuming, we\npropose a Pooling Attention Transformer (PAT) block as shown in Fig. 2 (c) to achieve model efficiency.\nAfter patch embedding, the image input becomes X=[D,Hp,Wp]𝑋𝐷𝐻𝑝𝑊𝑝X=[D,\\frac{H}{p},\\frac{W}{p}], where D𝐷D is the embedding dimension and the number of patches is N=Hp×Wp𝑁𝐻𝑝𝑊𝑝N=\\frac{H}{p}\\times\\frac{W}{p} when patch size is p×p𝑝𝑝p\\times p. The input for transformer block is often written as Xi​n=[N,D]subscript𝑋𝑖𝑛𝑁𝐷X_{in}=[N,D].\nTo reduce the memory and computational costs, we design a Pooling Attention (PoolAttn) module in our PAT block. The PoolAttn consists of patch-wise pooling attention and embed-wise pooling attention. For the patch-wise pooling attention block, we preserve the patches’ spatial structure based on the input Xi​n=[D,Hp,Wp]subscript𝑋𝑖𝑛𝐷𝐻𝑝𝑊𝑝X_{in}=[D,\\frac{H}{p},\\frac{W}{p}], then apply patch-wise pooling attention to capture the correlation of all the patches. For the embed-wise pooling attention block, we maintain the 2D spatial structure of each patch (without flattening to 1D embedded features). The input is reshaped to Xi​n=[N,Dh,Dw]subscript𝑋𝑖𝑛𝑁subscript𝐷ℎsubscript𝐷𝑤X_{in}=[N,D_{h},D_{w}], where Dh×Dw=Dsubscript𝐷ℎsubscript𝐷𝑤𝐷D_{h}\\times D_{w}=D is the embedding dimension. The embed-wise pooling attention is applied to model the dependencies of the embedding dimensions in each patch. A detailed explanation is provided in Section 3.2. The Params and MACs comparison between the PoolAttn and conventional attention module or MLP-based module is shown in Fig. 2 (d). Thus, PAT can reduce the Params and MACs significantly while maintaining high performance, which can be utilized for efficient HMR. Equipped with PAT as our transformer block, the next step for building an efficient and powerful transformer-based HMR model is to design an overall architecture. The naive approach is to apply a Vision Transformer  (ViT) architecture as shown in Fig. 3 (a). The image is first split into patches. After patch embedding, a sequence of patches is treated as tokens for transformer blocks. But in ViT, patches are always within a fixed scale in transformer blocks, producing low-resolution features. For the HMR task, high-resolution features are needed because human body parts can vary substantially in scale. Moreover, ViT architecture focuses on capturing the global correlation, but the local relations can not be well modeled. Recently, Swin 2 introduced a hierarchical transformer-based architecture as shown in Fig. 3 (b). It has the flexibility to model the patches at various scales, the global correlation can be enhanced during hierarchical blocks. However, it also produces low-resolution features after the final stage. To obtain high-resolution features, additional CNN networks such as Feature Pyramid Network 0 (FPN) are required to aggregate hierarchical feature maps for HMR. Thus, we propose our end-to-end architecture as shown in Fig. 3 (c), the hierarchical patch representation ensures the self-attention can be modeled globally through transformer blocks with patch merge. To overcome the issue that high-resolution representation becomes low-resolution after patch merge, we propose a High-Resolution (HR) stream that can maintain high-resolution representation through patch split by leveraging the local and global features from the basic stream. Finally, the high-resolution local and global features are used for reconstructing accurate human mesh. The entire framework is also lightweight and efficient by applying our PAT block as the transformer block. Our contributions are summarized as follows:\n We propose a Pooling Transformer Block (PAT) which is composed of the Pooling Attention (PoolAttn) module to reduce the memory and computational burden without sacrificing performance. We design a new transformer architecture for HMR by integrating a High-Resolution (HR) stream. Considering the patch’s merging and split properties in transformer, the HR stream returns high-resolution local and global features for reconstructing accurate human mesh. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method – POTTER. In the HMR task, POTTER surpasses the transformer-based SOTA method METRO on Human3.6M (PA-MPJPE metric) and 3DPW (all three metrics) datasets with only 7 % of Params and 14 % MACs.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: among different human body parts for achieving impressive performance.
