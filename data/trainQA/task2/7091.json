      "content": "Paper Title: Envy-Free Cake-Cutting for Four Agents\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe begin with some useful “preprocessing” which will allow us to assume that the valuations have some additional structure. Let 𝔪∈ℕ𝔪ℕ\\mathfrak{m}\\in\\mathbb{N} and let v𝑣v be an additive continuous valuation function. Then there exists an additive continuous valuation function v~~𝑣\\widetilde{v} that satisfies: v~~𝑣\\widetilde{v} is a 2/𝔪2𝔪2/\\mathfrak{m}-approximation of v𝑣v, i.e., |v​(a,b)−v~​(a,b)|≤2/𝔪𝑣𝑎𝑏~𝑣𝑎𝑏2𝔪|v(a,b)-\\widetilde{v}(a,b)|\\leq 2/\\mathfrak{m} for all 0≤a≤b≤10𝑎𝑏10\\leq a\\leq b\\leq 1. v~~𝑣\\widetilde{v} is 1/𝔪1𝔪1/\\mathfrak{m}-strongly-hungry, i.e., v~​(a,b)≥(b−a)/𝔪~𝑣𝑎𝑏𝑏𝑎𝔪\\widetilde{v}(a,b)\\geq(b-a)/\\mathfrak{m} for all 0≤a≤b≤10𝑎𝑏10\\leq a\\leq b\\leq 1. Any value or cut query to v~~𝑣\\widetilde{v} can be answered by making a constant number of value and cut queries to v𝑣v. v~~𝑣\\widetilde{v} is linear between its 𝔪𝔪\\mathfrak{m}-quantiles, i.e., letting 0=x0<x1<⋯<x𝔪=10subscript𝑥0subscript𝑥1⋯subscript𝑥𝔪10=x_{0}<x_{1}<\\dots<x_{\\mathfrak{m}}=1 be the (unique) positions such that for all j∈[𝔪]𝑗delimited-[]𝔪j\\in[\\mathfrak{m}] we have that for all j∈[𝔪]𝑗delimited-[]𝔪j\\in[\\mathfrak{m}] and all t∈[ref]0 𝑡01t\\in[ref]0  The 𝔪𝔪\\mathfrak{m}-quantiles of v𝑣v, i.e., positions 0=x0<x1<⋯<x𝔪=10subscript𝑥0subscript𝑥1⋯subscript𝑥𝔪10=x_{0}<x_{1}<\\dots<x_{\\mathfrak{m}}=1 such that for all j∈[𝔪]𝑗delimited-[]𝔪j\\in[\\mathfrak{m}] are in general not unique, because v𝑣v might not be hungry. For any choice x0,x1,…,x𝔪subscript𝑥0subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝔪x_{0},x_{1},\\dots,x_{\\mathfrak{m}} of 𝔪𝔪\\mathfrak{m}-quantiles of v𝑣v, we can define a corresponding valuation function v~~𝑣\\widetilde{v} as follows. The valuation function v~~𝑣\\widetilde{v} is constructed by evening out the mass between the 𝔪𝔪\\mathfrak{m}-quantiles x0,x1,…,x𝔪subscript𝑥0subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝔪x_{0},x_{1},\\dots,x_{\\mathfrak{m}} of v𝑣v. Formally, v~~𝑣\\widetilde{v} is given by its density function f~~𝑓\\widetilde{f}, which is defined as for all x∈[ref]0 𝑥01x\\in[ref]0 . Here χI:[ref]0 →{0,1}:subscript𝜒𝐼→0101\\chi_{I}:[ref]0 \\to\\{0,1\\} denotes the characteristic function of interval I𝐼I. Clearly, v~~𝑣\\widetilde{v} is additive and continuous. Furthermore, it immediately follows from the construction that v~​(0,1)=1~𝑣011\\widetilde{v}(0,1)=1, that x0,x1,…,x𝔪subscript𝑥0subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝔪x_{0},x_{1},\\dots,x_{\\mathfrak{m}} are the (unique) 𝔪𝔪\\mathfrak{m}-quantiles of v~~𝑣\\widetilde{v}, and that v~~𝑣\\widetilde{v} is linear between its 𝔪𝔪\\mathfrak{m}-quantiles. Finally, it is easy to check that v~~𝑣\\widetilde{v} is 1/𝔪1𝔪1/\\mathfrak{m}-strongly-hungry and that it is a 2/𝔪2𝔪2/\\mathfrak{m}-approximation of v𝑣v. It remains to argue that we can simulate queries to v~~𝑣\\widetilde{v} by using queries to v𝑣v. To do this, we will fix the choice of 𝔪𝔪\\mathfrak{m}-quantiles x0,x1,…,x𝔪subscript𝑥0subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝔪x_{0},x_{1},\\dots,x_{\\mathfrak{m}} of v𝑣v as follows: xjsubscript𝑥𝑗x_{j} is defined as the cut position returned when we perform a cut query121212A somewhat subtle detail is that performing the same cut query (0,j/𝔪)0𝑗𝔪(0,j/\\mathfrak{m}) to v𝑣v multiple times could potentially output different results (because the quantiles might not be unique). However, this is not an issue: it suffices for the simulation to memorize the answer the first time it performs the query and then to just reuse this answer for subsequent queries. This will ensure that the xjsubscript𝑥𝑗x_{j}’s are fixed throughout the simulation. (0,j/𝔪)0𝑗𝔪(0,j/\\mathfrak{m}) to v𝑣v. If the simulation never queries (0,j/𝔪)0𝑗𝔪(0,j/\\mathfrak{m}) for some j𝑗j, then all simulated queries to v~~𝑣\\widetilde{v} will be consistent with any of the possible choices for xjsubscript𝑥𝑗x_{j}. First, we observe that for any j∈[𝔪]∪{0}𝑗delimited-[]𝔪0j\\in[\\mathfrak{m}]\\cup\\{0\\} we can obtain xjsubscript𝑥𝑗x_{j} by using at most one cut query to v𝑣v. Indeed, if j=0𝑗0j=0 or j=𝔪𝑗𝔪j=\\mathfrak{m}, then we just use x0=0subscript𝑥00x_{0}=0 or x𝔪=1subscript𝑥𝔪1x_{\\mathfrak{m}}=1 respectively. Otherwise, when j∈[𝔪−1]𝑗delimited-[]𝔪1j\\in[\\mathfrak{m}-1], we can use one cut query (0,j/𝔪)0𝑗𝔪(0,j/\\mathfrak{m}) to v𝑣v to obtain xjsubscript𝑥𝑗x_{j}. We can now simulate queries to v~~𝑣\\widetilde{v} as follows: cut query (0,α)0𝛼(0,\\alpha): We first find j∈[𝔪]𝑗delimited-[]𝔪j\\in[\\mathfrak{m}] such that (j−1)/𝔪≤α≤j/𝔪𝑗1𝔪𝛼𝑗𝔪(j-1)/\\mathfrak{m}\\leq\\alpha\\leq j/\\mathfrak{m}. Then we compute xj−1subscript𝑥𝑗1x_{j-1} and xjsubscript𝑥𝑗x_{j} as described above and output xj−1+(xj−xj−1)​(𝔪​α−(j−1))subscript𝑥𝑗1subscript𝑥𝑗subscript𝑥𝑗1𝔪𝛼𝑗1x_{j-1}+(x_{j}-x_{j-1})(\\mathfrak{m}\\alpha-(j-1)). value query (0,b)0𝑏(0,b): We first perform one value query to v𝑣v to obtain v(0,b)=:αv(0,b)=:\\alpha. If α=0𝛼0\\alpha=0, then we compute x1subscript𝑥1x_{1} as described above and output b/(𝔪​x1)𝑏𝔪subscript𝑥1b/(\\mathfrak{m}x_{1}). If α=1𝛼1\\alpha=1, then we compute x𝔪−1subscript𝑥𝔪1x_{\\mathfrak{m}-1} as described above and output 1−(1−b)/(𝔪​(1−x𝔪−1))11𝑏𝔪1subscript𝑥𝔪11-(1-b)/(\\mathfrak{m}(1-x_{\\mathfrak{m}-1})). If α∈(0,1)𝛼01\\alpha\\in(0,1), then we find j∈[𝔪−1]𝑗delimited-[]𝔪1j\\in[\\mathfrak{m}-1] such that (j−1)/𝔪<α<(j+1)/𝔪𝑗1𝔪𝛼𝑗1𝔪(j-1)/\\mathfrak{m}<\\alpha<(j+1)/\\mathfrak{m} and compute xjsubscript𝑥𝑗x_{j}. If b≥xj𝑏subscript𝑥𝑗b\\geq x_{j}, then we compute xj+1subscript𝑥𝑗1x_{j+1} and output j/𝔪+(b−xj)/(𝔪​(xj+1−xj))𝑗𝔪𝑏subscript𝑥𝑗𝔪subscript𝑥𝑗1subscript𝑥𝑗j/\\mathfrak{m}+(b-x_{j})/(\\mathfrak{m}(x_{j+1}-x_{j})). If b<xj𝑏subscript𝑥𝑗b<x_{j}, then we compute xj−1subscript𝑥𝑗1x_{j-1} and output j/𝔪−(xj−b)/(𝔪​(xj−xj−1))𝑗𝔪subscript𝑥𝑗𝑏𝔪subscript𝑥𝑗subscript𝑥𝑗1j/\\mathfrak{m}-(x_{j}-b)/(\\mathfrak{m}(x_{j}-x_{j-1})). Note that it is sufficient to only consider queries with endpoint 00, since the valuations are additive.\n∎ In the rest of this section, we will assume that the valuations visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} have been obtained from the original valuations by applying Lemma 6.2 with m:=⌈4/ε⌉assign𝑚4𝜀m:=\\lceil 4/\\varepsilon\\rceil, i.e., we have replaced visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} by v~isubscript~𝑣𝑖\\widetilde{v}_{i}. Thus, finding an envy-free allocation with respect to these valuations will yield an ε𝜀\\varepsilon-envy-free allocation with respect to the original valuations. We let x0i,…,x𝔪isuperscriptsubscript𝑥0𝑖…superscriptsubscript𝑥𝔪𝑖x_{0}^{i},\\dots,x_{\\mathfrak{m}}^{i} denote the (unique) 𝔪𝔪\\mathfrak{m}-quantiles of valuation visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i}. The following will be used repeatedly in our algorithm. Let c:[t1,t2]→[ref]0 :𝑐→subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡201c:[t_{1},t_{2}]\\to[ref]0  be continuous, strictly monotone, and let c​(t1)𝑐subscript𝑡1c(t_{1}) and c​(t2)𝑐subscript𝑡2c(t_{2}) be given. Furthermore, assume that given any a∈{c​(t):t∈[t1,t2]}𝑎conditional-set𝑐𝑡𝑡subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2a\\in\\{c(t):t\\in[t_{1},t_{2}]\\} we can find the unique t𝑡t such that c​(t)=a𝑐𝑡𝑎c(t)=a using at most Q​(𝔪)𝑄𝔪Q(\\mathfrak{m}) queries to the agents’ valuations. Finally, let s:[t1,t2]→ℝ:𝑠→subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2ℝs:[t_{1},t_{2}]\\to\\mathbb{R} be an arbitrary function that can be evaluated using at most Q​(𝔪)𝑄𝔪Q(\\mathfrak{m}) queries and that satisfies s​(t1)≤0𝑠subscript𝑡10s(t_{1})\\leq 0 and s​(t2)≥0𝑠subscript𝑡20s(t_{2})\\geq 0. Then, using at most O​(Q​(𝔪)​log⁡𝔪)𝑂𝑄𝔪𝔪O(Q(\\mathfrak{m})\\log\\mathfrak{m}) queries, we can compute t1∗,t2∗∈[t1,t2]superscriptsubscript𝑡1superscriptsubscript𝑡2subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2t_{1}^{*},t_{2}^{*}\\in[t_{1},t_{2}] with t1∗<t2∗superscriptsubscript𝑡1superscriptsubscript𝑡2t_{1}^{*}<t_{2}^{*}, s​(t1∗)≤0𝑠superscriptsubscript𝑡10s(t_{1}^{*})\\leq 0, s​(t2∗)≥0𝑠superscriptsubscript𝑡20s(t_{2}^{*})\\geq 0, and such that for each agent i∈{1,2,3,4}𝑖1234i\\in\\{1,2,3,4\\}, there exist some (possibly different) j∈[𝔪]𝑗delimited-[]𝔪j\\in[\\mathfrak{m}] such that c​(t1∗),c​(t2∗)∈[xj−1i,xji]𝑐superscriptsubscript𝑡1𝑐superscriptsubscript𝑡2superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑗1𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑗𝑖c(t_{1}^{*}),c(t_{2}^{*})\\in[x_{j-1}^{i},x_{j}^{i}]. We consider the case where c𝑐c is strictly increasing. The case where it is strictly decreasing can be handled analogously. We initialize t1∗:=t1assignsuperscriptsubscript𝑡1subscript𝑡1t_{1}^{*}:=t_{1} and t2∗:=t2assignsuperscriptsubscript𝑡2subscript𝑡2t_{2}^{*}:=t_{2}. Using two value queries to Agent 1 we can determine j1≤j2subscript𝑗1subscript𝑗2j_{1}\\leq j_{2} such that xj1−11≤c​(t1∗)≤xj11superscriptsubscript𝑥subscript𝑗111𝑐superscriptsubscript𝑡1superscriptsubscript𝑥subscript𝑗11x_{j_{1}-1}^{1}\\leq c(t_{1}^{*})\\leq x_{j_{1}}^{1} and xj2−11≤c​(t2∗)≤xj21superscriptsubscript𝑥subscript𝑗211𝑐superscriptsubscript𝑡2superscriptsubscript𝑥subscript𝑗21x_{j_{2}-1}^{1}\\leq c(t_{2}^{*})\\leq x_{j_{2}}^{1}. If j1=j2subscript𝑗1subscript𝑗2j_{1}=j_{2} then we are done with Agent 1. Otherwise, we perform binary search as follows: As long as j1<j2subscript𝑗1subscript𝑗2j_{1}<j_{2}: Let j:=⌊(j1+j2)/2⌋assign𝑗subscript𝑗1subscript𝑗22j:=\\lfloor(j_{1}+j_{2})/2\\rfloor. Compute t𝑡t such that c​(t)=xj1𝑐𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑗1c(t)=x_{j}^{1}. If s​(t)≥0𝑠𝑡0s(t)\\geq 0, then set t2∗:=tassignsuperscriptsubscript𝑡2𝑡t_{2}^{*}:=t and j2:=jassignsubscript𝑗2𝑗j_{2}:=j.\nOtherwise, set t1∗:=tassignsuperscriptsubscript𝑡1𝑡t_{1}^{*}:=t and j1:=j+1assignsubscript𝑗1𝑗1j_{1}:=j+1. It is easy to see that this runs for at most log⁡𝔪𝔪\\log\\mathfrak{m} iterations, and each iteration requires O​(Q​(𝔪))𝑂𝑄𝔪O(Q(\\mathfrak{m})) queries. When it terminates, we have that [c​(t1∗),c​(t2∗)]∈[xj−11,xj1]𝑐superscriptsubscript𝑡1𝑐superscriptsubscript𝑡2superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑗11superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑗1[c(t_{1}^{*}),c(t_{2}^{*})]\\in[x_{j-1}^{1},x_{j}^{1}]. Repeating this in sequence for the other three agents yields the desired outcome. In particular, note that each binary search procedure can only make [c​(t1∗),c​(t2∗)]𝑐superscriptsubscript𝑡1𝑐superscriptsubscript𝑡2[c(t_{1}^{*}),c(t_{2}^{*})] smaller (w.r.t. inclusion order), so the property will hold simultaneously for all agents at the end.\n∎\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: be the (unique) positions such that for all j∈[𝔪]𝑗delimited-[]𝔪j\\in[\\mathfrak{m}] we have that for all j∈[𝔪]𝑗delimited-[]𝔪j\\in[\\mathfrak{m}] and all t∈[ref]0 𝑡01t\\in[ref]0  The 𝔪𝔪\\mathfrak{m}-quantiles of v𝑣v, i.e., positions 0=x0<x1<⋯<x𝔪=10subscript𝑥0subscript𝑥1⋯subscript𝑥𝔪10=x_{0}<x_{1}<\\dots<x_{\\mathfrak{m}}=1 such that for all\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
