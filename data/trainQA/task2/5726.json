      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Phytoplankton Parasite Detection Using Autoencoders\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAnomaly detection is a data classification technique where a detector models the representation of samples within a specification (OK) and where it distinguishes all samples different from the specification as anomalous (NOK). This problem could be challenging because of potentially high diversity among the NOK samples, imbalance between the number of samples in OK and NOK, and irregularity of the NOK class. A comprehensive overview describing the anomaly detection problems, techniques, and categorization is presented in [ref]15. First time introduced on image data in , autoencoder (AE) models are widely used in computer vision. The authors of  were the first to make the use of worse generalisation ability on different kind out-of-training data of the AE models to detect anomalies in both synthetic and real-world telemetry data using a fully connected AE trained only on the data without anomalies. Based on the results, such an AE can be used to detect previously unseen anomalous samples. This concept was further enhanced and used also on image data, for example, in  and [ref]19. A comprehensive overview of the AE techniques can be found in [ref]20. Plankton anomaly detection has been studied in the context of open-set recognition, i.e., image classification with the present of previously unseen classes (plankton species). In , the authors presented an unsupervised approach to classify a plankton sample and to detect potential significant differences (i.e., anomalies) with the respect to the detected class. Image features are extracted using classical computer vision methods and they consists of geometrical, moment-based, and other traditional features. In , a CNN, trained on the OK samples and the artificial NOK samples derived from the OK data by common data augmentation techniques as blurring and noise adding, is used as the feature extractor. An anomaly score is then computed from those features and it is used together with the trained feature extractor to distinguish between the plankton samples and anomalies. Here air bubbles and non-plankton water particles are considered as anomalies. In , the authors used a parallel network of custom statistical classifiers called TailDeTect (TDT) to discover previously unseen plankton species. Each of the TDT classifiers is trained on one particular species, and a sample is considered as unknown if none of the classifiers is able to detect it. Unknown samples are collected and validated by experts. Feature extraction and the concept is based on . In , open-set recognition plankton recognition was addressed using a similarity learning approach. Metric learning with angular margin loss was applied to obtain image embedding vectors that model the similarity between images. The anomalies (images from previously unseen classes) were detected by setting a threshold values for the similarity. Faster R-CNN  is a popular deep learning algorithm that has been successfully applied to various domains and tasks, including object detection and anomaly detection. Anomaly detection using Faster R-CNN involves training the model on abnormal images to learn the features of abnormal instances. Then during classification, the model is used to detect abnormal samples that deviate from the expected one. For instance, in industrial manufacturing, abnormal behavior can include machine malfunctions, while in medical diagnosis, it can be unusual patterns in medical images. For example, in , an improved Faster R-CNN to detect defects in steel plates was used. The algorithm was trained on a dataset of abnormal regions on steel plate images and was able to accurately detect anomalies such as cracks and holes in test images. Similarly, in , a subtle modification of Faster R-CNN to detect anomalies in CT images of lungs was considered. Also object detection methods have been successfully used on the parasite detection, for example, in . In this case, a YOLOv5 object detector was used to detect a parasitic mite on the honey bee’s body. An overview of the other object detection techniques and commonly used dataset could be found for example in . In plankton research, Faster R-CNN is widely adopted for segmentation and object detection. In   several object detection approaches including Faster R-CNN were utilized to evaluate a synthetically augmented dataset. Similar work was presented in  where a plankton dataset from a dark-field microscope was compiled, and then tested with various object detection methods, including YOLOv3 , R-CNN , and SSD .\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: between the number of samples in OK and NOK, and irregularity of the NOK class.
