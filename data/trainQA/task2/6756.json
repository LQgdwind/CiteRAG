      "content": "Paper Title: Source-free Domain Adaptive Human Pose Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets. We use three human pose datasets and three hand pose datasets to validate our approach. SURREAL [ref]36 is utilized as the source dataset and encompasses six million synthetic human pose images. Human3.6M , one of the target human pose datasets, is a frequently used real-world dataset in the community, consisting of 3.6 million images distributed into seven folds. , According to previous research [ref]12 , S1, S5, S6, S7, and S8 are designated as the training set, whereas S9 and S11 serve as the testing set. The other target dataset is Leeds Sports Pose  (LSP), which is a real-world dataset with 2,000 images, and we use all of them for adaptation. We focus on two domain adaptation tasks: SURREAL ‚Üí‚Üí\\rightarrow Human3.6M and SURREAL ‚Üí‚Üí\\rightarrow LSP for human pose tasks. Rendered Hand Pose Dataset [ref]42 (RHD) is the source hand dataset with 43,986 synthetic hand images, of which 41,258 are allocated for training, while the remaining 2,728 images are utilized for validation. Hand-3D-Studio  (H3D) is one of the two target hand datasets, including 22,000 real-world frames. For training, we employed 18,800 frames and reserved the rest for testing, following the protocol outlined in previous research papers [ref]12 . The other target hand dataset, FreiHand , provides 130k real-world images, and we employed all of them for our adaptation task. Our focus is on two domain adaptation tasks: RHD ‚Üí‚Üí\\rightarrow H3D and RHD ‚Üí‚Üí\\rightarrow FreiHand. Implementation Details. We adopt Simple Baseline  with ResNet-101  as the HPE backbone, following previous works [ref]12 . In the pretrain process, we conduct 40 epochs, each with 500 iterations, using the Adam  optimizer with an initial learning rate of 1e-4. The learning rate decreases to 1e-5 at 25 epochs. For the adaptation process, we execute 40 epochs with 30,000 iterations. In step A, we choose an initial learning rate of 1e-4 for Fs‚Äãrsuperscriptùêπùë†ùëüF^{sr} and 1e-5 for Gi‚Äãnsuperscriptùê∫ùëñùëõG^{in}. Step B sets the initial learning rate to 1e-4 for Gt‚Äãgsuperscriptùê∫ùë°ùëîG^{tg} and 1e-3 for Ft‚Äãgsuperscriptùêπùë°ùëîF^{tg}. We use the same annealing strategy for the learning rate scheduler as in [ref]12. As for hyperparameters, we select Œ±=0.7ùõº0.7\\alpha=0.7, Œ≤=0.5ùõΩ0.5\\beta=0.5, and Œ≥=0.85ùõæ0.85\\gamma=0.85. Moreover, the intermediate model is used for the final inference.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: Datasets.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
