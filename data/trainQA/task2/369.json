      "content": "Paper Title: Off-Policy Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe define a Markov decision process (MDP) as a tuple (S,A,T,r,γ,ρ0)𝑆𝐴𝑇𝑟𝛾subscript𝜌0(S,A,T,r,\\gamma,\\rho_{0}), where S𝑆S,A𝐴A are the state and action space respectively, γ∈[0,1)𝛾01\\gamma\\in[0,1) is the discount factor. We consider the dynamic or transition distribution T​(s′|s,a)𝑇conditionalsuperscript𝑠′𝑠𝑎T(s^{\\prime}|s,a), initial state distribution ρ0​(s)subscript𝜌0𝑠\\rho_{0}(s) and reward function r​(s,a)𝑟𝑠𝑎r(s,a) are unknown in IRL setup and can be learned through interaction with the MDP. AIL evolved from maximum casual entropy IRL framework , which considers an entropy regularized MDP with the goal to find the optimal policy π∗\\pi* that maximizes the expected entropy-regularized discounted reward under π𝜋\\pi,T𝑇T and ρ0subscript𝜌0\\rho_{0}: Here τ=(s0,a0​…​sT,aT)𝜏subscript𝑠0subscript𝑎0…subscript𝑠𝑇subscript𝑎𝑇\\tau=(s_{0},a_{0}...s_{T},a_{T}) defines the sequence of states and actions induced by policy and H(π(.|st))H(\\pi(.|s_{t})) is the discounted causal entropy of policy π𝜋\\pi. In imitation task, expert demonstrations D=τ1,τ2​…​τn𝐷subscript𝜏1subscript𝜏2…subscript𝜏𝑛D={\\tau_{1},\\tau_{2}...\\tau_{n}} are given and an agent is expected to produce trajectory which are similar to the expert and infer reward function. Under certain constrain of feature matching [ref]7 derived following objective function: where z=∫τeR​(τ)𝑧subscript𝜏superscript𝑒𝑅𝜏z=\\int_{\\tau}e^{R(\\tau)} is the partition function and can be expressed as probability of trajectories with equal reward/cost are equal likely and probability of trajectory with higher rewards are exponentially more likely. Equation (2) can be interpreted as solving a maximum likelihood problem: m​a​xψ​𝐄τ∼D​[log⁡pψ​(τ)]𝑚𝑎subscript𝑥𝜓subscript𝐄similar-to𝜏𝐷delimited-[]subscript𝑝𝜓𝜏max_{\\psi}\\mathbf{E}_{\\tau\\sim D}[\\log p_{\\psi}(\\tau)]. But the assumptions that are made in  are model / transition function T​(s′|s,a)𝑇conditionalsuperscript𝑠′𝑠𝑎T(s^{\\prime}|s,a) is known and applied on small state-action space. GAIL , a model-free algorithm, is the first framework to draw connection between generative adversarial network (GAN) and imitation learning which works in continuous state-action space. GAIL uses a generative model or generator, G𝐺G that acts as the policy. Purpose of the generator is to learn policy πθsubscript𝜋𝜃\\pi_{\\theta} such that the state-action visitation frequency ρπθsubscript𝜌subscript𝜋𝜃\\rho_{\\pi_{\\theta}} is similar to expert’s ρπEsubscript𝜌subscript𝜋𝐸\\rho_{\\pi_{E}} without directly being provided with the expert demonstrations. A discriminator D𝐷D is a binary classifier which tries to distinguish the data distribution of the generator ρπsubscript𝜌𝜋\\rho_{\\pi} from the expert’s ρπEsubscript𝜌subscript𝜋𝐸\\rho_{\\pi_{E}}. Objective for a generator is to minimize the difference with expert visitation frequency, while a discriminator wants to maximize the difference and thus derived the entropy regularized objective as following: where entropy term H𝐻H is policy regularizer controlled by λ≥0𝜆0\\lambda\\geq 0. GAIL uses two separate neural-networks to represent generator and discriminator. For any given state generator tries to take expert like action. Discriminator takes state-action pairs as input and computes the likelihood of the input coming from an expert. Generator uses a reward function R​(s,a)=−log⁡Dψ​(s,a)𝑅𝑠𝑎subscript𝐷𝜓𝑠𝑎R(s,a)=-\\log D_{\\psi}(s,a) in order to train it’s network parameters. GAIL is sample efficient in terms of number of expert demonstrations required but not quite sample efficient in terms of required interaction with the environment to learn the policy.\nThus GAIL is not suitable for many real-world applications. Discriminator Actor critic (DAC)  uses Twin-delayed deep deterministic actor-critic (TD3) [ref]8, an off-policy algorithm as generator to improve upon the sample efficiency of existing methods, and it extends the learning environment with absorbing states. DAC criticises AIL algorithms (i.e GAIL) for inducing reward biases by using strict positive or negative reward function and proposes a reward function r​(s,a)=log⁡(Dθ​(s,a))−log⁡(1−Dθ​(s,a))𝑟𝑠𝑎subscript𝐷𝜃𝑠𝑎1subscript𝐷𝜃𝑠𝑎r(s,a)=\\log(D_{\\theta}(s,a))-\\log(1-D_{\\theta}(s,a)) in order to achieve unbiased rewards. Combined, these changes remove the survival bias and solves sample inefficiency problem of GAIL. For being an imitation learning algorithm, instead of learning cost/reward function, both GAIL and DAC only recover expert policy and thus will fail miserably in dynamic environments. A discriminator function, that learns policy as well as the cost/reward function, is proposed by  by optimizing following objective for discriminator network: And thus, where p​(τ)𝑝𝜏p(\\tau) is the data distribution and q​(τ)𝑞𝜏q(\\tau) is the policy distribution and (a) consider derived objective function (2) from . But  contains no experimental demonstration of imitation performance. Later on AIRL  shows, when we consider a whole trajectory to compute discriminator update it suffers from high variance issue and that leads to a poor performing generator. Instead AIRL computes discriminator update using (s,a,s′)𝑠𝑎superscript𝑠′(s,a,s^{\\prime}) tuple: where fψ,ω​(s,a,s′)=rψ​(s,a)+γ​Φω​(s′)−Φω​(s)subscript𝑓𝜓𝜔𝑠𝑎superscript𝑠′subscript𝑟𝜓𝑠𝑎𝛾subscriptΦ𝜔superscript𝑠′subscriptΦ𝜔𝑠f_{\\psi,\\omega}(s,a,s^{\\prime})=r_{\\psi}(s,a)+\\gamma\\Phi_{\\omega}(s^{\\prime})-\\Phi_{\\omega}(s) is a potential-based reward function, rψ​(s,a)subscript𝑟𝜓𝑠𝑎r_{\\psi}(s,a) is a reward function approximator and ΦωsubscriptΦ𝜔\\Phi_{\\omega} is reward shaping term controlled by the dynamics. In  fψ,ω​(s,a,s′)subscript𝑓𝜓𝜔𝑠𝑎superscript𝑠′f_{\\psi,\\omega}(s,a,s^{\\prime}) is referred as disentangled reward function 0 due to rψ​(s)subscript𝑟𝜓𝑠r_{\\psi}(s) being indifferent to the changes in dynamics T𝑇T.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: are given and an agent is expected to produce trajectory which are similar to the expert and infer reward function.
