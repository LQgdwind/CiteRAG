      "content": "Paper Title: Better Schedules for Low Precision Training of Deep Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate the proposed CPT schedules on both image classification and object detection tasks.\nWe train ResNet-74, ResNet-152, and MobileNet-V2 architectures on the CIFAR-10/100 datasets [ref]10 [ref]43, following the settings of .\nAdditionally, we adopt the settings of [ref]10 and perform experiments with ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 architectures on ImageNet.\nObject detection experiments are performed on the PascalVOC dataset  and adopt a RetinaNet architecture [ref]46 with an ImageNet pre-trained ResNet-18 backbone [ref]10.\nPerformance is reported in terms of test accuracy and mean average precision (mAP) for image classification and object detection experiments, respectively.\nFor all experiments, we report performance as an average across three separate trials and all hyperparameters are tuned using a hold-out validation set. CIFAR-10/100.\nWe adopt the settings of  for training.\nAll models are trained for a total of 64‚ÄãK64ùêæ64K iterations with a batch size of 128 using standard crop and flip data augmentations.\nWe use a SGDM optimizer with momentum of 0.9.\nTraining begins with a learning rate of 0.1, and the learning rate is decayed by 10√ó10\\times after 50% and 75% of training iterations.\nWeight decay is set to 1√ó10‚àí41superscript1041\\times 10^{-4}, and we use qmin=3subscriptùëûmin3q_{\\text{min}}=3 (i.e., discovered using a precision range test) and qmax‚àà{6,8}subscriptùëûmax68q_{\\text{max}}\\in\\{6,8\\}.\nAll CPT variants are tested with n=8ùëõ8n=8. Results of experiments with CPT on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are shown in Figure 3.\nDespite using less training compute, CPT variants tend to outperform static baselines in nearly all cases.\nThis finding aligns with prior work  but goes further by demonstrating that the benefit of CPT is not specific to any particular precision schedule.\nCompared to CPT with the originally-proposed CR schedule, our large schedules achieve further reductions in training compute, but slightly degrade accuracy.\nSmall and medium schedules tend to both reduce training cost and improve accuracy. Across all experiments, we see that a correlation exists between model performance and training compute, irrespective of model depth or architecture.\nThis interesting finding reveals that the choice of CPT schedule is a mechanism that controls the trade off between model performance and training compute.\nCompared to most hyperparameter settings (e.g., the learning rate) that only impact model performance, the choice of CPT schedule is quite nuanced due to its joint impact on training efficiency and performance. ImageNet. We consider the ILSVRC2012 version of ImageNet with 1K total classes.\nThe settings of [ref]10 are used:\nModels are trained for a total of 90 epochs with a batch size of 256 using standard crop and flip data augmentations.\nWe use a SGDM optimizer with momentum of 0.9.\nAn initial learning rate of 0.1 is adopted, and this learning rate is decayed by a factor of 10√ó10\\times after 50% and 75% of total epochs.\nWeight decay is set to 1√ó10‚àí51superscript1051\\times 10^{-5}, and we use qmin=4subscriptùëûmin4q_{\\text{min}}=4 and qmax‚àà{6,8}subscriptùëûmax68q_{\\text{max}}\\in\\{6,8\\}.\nAll CPT variants are tested with n=8ùëõ8n=8. As shown in Figure 3, CPT schedules that significantly reduce training compute cause a noticeable performance deterioration relative to static baselines on ImageNet.\nFor example, large schedules cause a 0.5‚àí1.5%0.5percent1.50.5-1.5\\% drop in accuracy relative to static baselines across different architectures and settings of qmaxsubscriptùëûmaxq_{\\text{max}}.\nWith the larger ResNet-34 architecture, we see that more aggressive quantization is especially detrimental to performance; e.g., setting qmax=6subscriptùëûmax6q_{\\text{max}}=6 significantly deteriorates performance in both CPT and baseline experiments. Though we still observe a correlation between performance and training compute, larger-scale image classification experiments seem to be more sensitive to the level of training quantization‚Äîaggressive quantization noticeably deteriorates model performance.\nBy adopting our small schedules that quantize more conservatively, however, we exceed baseline performance at a reduced training cost.\nIn comparison, medium schedules‚Äîincluding the originally-proposed CR schedule‚Äîperform similarly to or worse than baseline models. Pascal VOC.\nWe consider the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset for both training and testing .\nPrior to training on Pascal VOC, the ResNet backbone of each RetinaNet model is pre-trained on the ILSVRC2012 dataset.\nModels are trained for 120 total epochs with a batch size of 4 on Pascal VOC.\nWe do not perform any data augmentation, though images are normalized and resized before being passed as input.\nWe adopt an Adam optimizer  for training with a fixed learning rate of 1√ó10‚àí51superscript1051\\times 10^{-5} throughout training.\nThe model is trained using a focal loss that matches the settings of [ref]46.\nWe use qmin=5subscriptùëûmin5q_{\\text{min}}=5, qmax‚àà{6,8}subscriptùëûmax68q_{\\text{max}}\\in\\{6,8\\}, and n=8ùëõ8n=8. The results of CPT experiments on PascalVOC are shown in Figure 4.\nHere, we see that setting qmax=6subscriptùëûmax6q_{\\text{max}}=6 yields a clear performance deterioration in both baseline and CPT experiments, indicating that training on PascalVOC is sensitive to quantization.\nWhen qmax=8subscriptùëûmax8q_{\\text{max}}=8, however, all CPT variants either match or exceed the performance of static baselinesm while reducing the cost of training.\nFor example, the best medium schedule (ETV) yeilds an absolute improvement of 1.02 mAP with a 25% reduction in training cost.\nThe performance of all CPT schedules is roughly comparable when qmax=8subscriptùëûmax8q_{\\text{max}}=8.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: We evaluate the proposed CPT schedules on both image classification and object detection tasks.\nWe train ResNet-74, ResNet-152, and MobileNet-V2 architectures on the CIFAR-10/100 datasets [ref]10 [ref]43, following the settings of .\nAdditionally, we adopt the settings of [ref]10 and perform experiments with ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 architectures on ImageNet.\nObject detection\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
