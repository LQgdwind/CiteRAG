It turns out that our problem reappeared several times in theoretical computer science under different names.\nIt has been called LIFO-search  in the area of graph pursuit-evasion games, ordered coloring , minimum height elimination trees [ref]7 in the context of parallel matrix factorization, then vertex ranking , and more recently as tree-depth . While listing the main approaches to construct search strategies, we do not differentiate between the edge and vertex versions of the problem as it turns out that the algorithmic techniques we mention are applicable to both.\nThe majority of works, especially for the unweighted version of the problem utilize the bottom-up tree processing.\nIn this approach one usually assigns greedily the lowest possible interval and argues that this leads to an optimal solution, see e.g. [ref]3    .\nWe note here that by ‚Äòinterval‚Äô we mean the following interpretation of the cost function: if costs are seen as query durations, then the query interval is the corresponding time period in which the query is processed.\nThe particular contributions of these works mainly lie in various optimizations that bring down the computational complexity of finding optimal strategies.\nIn case of non-uniform query times the problem becomes more challenging and keeping in mind that it is NP-complete  a series of works focused on finding approximate solutions.\n(We note that the unweighted case has been long known to be linear-time solvable ).\nA natural approach, for the case of non-uniform costs, is to query a ‚Äòcentral‚Äô element of the search space and then computing the strategy recursively for the remaining subtrees  , which for trees gives ùí™‚Äã(log‚Å°n)ùí™ùëõ\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)-factor approximations.\nMore involved recursive approaches allowed to break the barrier of ùí™‚Äã(log‚Å°n)ùí™ùëõ\\mathcal{O}(\\log n) in [ref]9  giving a ùí™‚Äã(log‚Å°n/log‚Å°log‚Å°n)ùí™ùëõùëõ\\mathcal{O}(\\log n/\\log\\log n)-approximation.\nA rather involved bottom-up approach gave the best approximation ratio of ùí™‚Äã(log‚Å°n)ùí™ùëõ\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\log n}) so far .\nThe main open question in this line of research is whether either the edge or vertex query model admits a polynomial-time constant factor approximation for weighted trees.\nA possible angle at tackling this question is to consider either special subclasses of trees [ref]9 or restricted weight functions .\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: several times in theoretical computer science under different names.\nIt has been called LIFO-search  in the area of graph pursuit-evasion games, ordered coloring , minimum height elimination trees [ref]7 in the context of parallel matrix factorization, then vertex ranking , and more recently as tree-depth .
