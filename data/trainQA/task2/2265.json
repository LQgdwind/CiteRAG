      "content": "Paper Title: Convolutional Sparse Coding Fast Approximation with Application to Seismic Reflectivity Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConsider the cost function Following Majorization Minimization (MM) strategy, we can build a surrogate function   The parameter c𝑐c is chosen such that the added expression is strictly convex, requiring its Hessian to be positive definite, c​𝐈−𝐃T​𝐃≺𝟎precedes𝑐𝐈superscript𝐃𝑇𝐃0c\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{D}^{T}\\mathbf{D}\\prec\\mathbf{0}. Therefore c>‖𝐃T​𝐃‖2=λm​a​x​(𝐃T​𝐃)𝑐subscriptnormsuperscript𝐃𝑇𝐃2subscript𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥superscript𝐃𝑇𝐃c>\\|\\mathbf{D}^{T}\\mathbf{D}\\|_{2}=\\lambda_{max}(\\mathbf{D}^{T}\\mathbf{D}), i.e., greater than the largest eigenvalue of the coherence matrix 𝐃T​𝐃superscript𝐃𝑇𝐃\\mathbf{D}^{T}\\mathbf{D}. In essence, the term d​(𝐱,𝐱θ)𝑑𝐱subscript𝐱𝜃d(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}_{\\theta}) is a measure of proximity to a previous solution 𝐱θsubscript𝐱𝜃\\mathbf{x}_{\\theta}. If the vector difference 𝐱−𝐱θ𝐱subscript𝐱𝜃\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}_{\\theta} is spanned by 𝐃𝐃\\mathbf{D}, the distance drops to nearly zero (We usually choose c=‖𝐃‖22𝑐superscriptsubscriptnorm𝐃22c=\\|\\mathbf{D}\\|_{2}^{2}). Then, we remain with a minimization over the original cost function f​(𝐱)𝑓𝐱f(\\mathbf{x}). Alternatively, if 𝐃𝐃\\mathbf{D} is not full rank and the change 𝐱−𝐱θ𝐱subscript𝐱𝜃\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}_{\\theta} is close to the null space of 𝐃𝐃\\mathbf{D}, the distance is simply the approximate Euclidean distance between the current solution to the previous one. The surrogate function Q​(𝐱,𝐱θ)𝑄𝐱subscript𝐱𝜃Q(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}_{\\theta}) obeys equality at 𝐱θsubscript𝐱𝜃\\mathbf{x}_{\\theta}: Q​(𝐱θ,𝐱θ)=f​(𝐱θ)𝑄subscript𝐱𝜃subscript𝐱𝜃𝑓subscript𝐱𝜃Q(\\mathbf{x}_{\\theta},\\mathbf{x}_{\\theta})=f(\\mathbf{x}_{\\theta}). It is upper-bounded by the original function: Q​(𝐱,𝐱θ)≥f​(𝐱)∀𝐱𝑄𝐱subscript𝐱𝜃𝑓𝐱for-all𝐱Q(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}_{\\theta})\\geq f(\\mathbf{x})\\quad\\forall\\mathbf{x}, and tangent at 𝐱θsubscript𝐱𝜃\\mathbf{x}_{\\theta}: ∇Q​(𝐱,𝐱θ)|𝐱=𝐱θ=∇f​(𝐱)|𝐱=𝐱θevaluated-at∇𝑄𝐱subscript𝐱𝜃𝐱subscript𝐱𝜃evaluated-at∇𝑓𝐱𝐱subscript𝐱𝜃\\nabla Q(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}_{\\theta})|_{\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{x}_{\\theta}}=\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x})|_{\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{x}_{\\theta}}. Hence, the solution sequence is guaranteed to yield decreasing values of the original cost function f​(𝐱)𝑓𝐱f(\\mathbf{x}) because Following the MM strategy, that is, minimizing Q​(𝐱,𝐱θ)𝑄𝐱subscript𝐱𝜃Q(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}_{\\theta}) instead of f​(𝐱)𝑓𝐱f(\\mathbf{x}), the sequence of iterative solutions is generated by the recurrent formula where θ∈ℕ𝜃ℕ\\theta\\in\\mathbb{N} is the iteration index.\nTherefore, we can find a closed-form solution for its global minimizer Intuitively, this sequence can be interpreted as an iterative projection of the dictionary on the residual term, starting from the initial solution that is simply a thresholded projection of the dictionary on the observation signal (assuming 𝐱0=𝟎subscript𝐱00\\mathbf{x}_{0}=\\mathbf{0}): Under the assumption that the constant c𝑐c is large enough, it was shown in , that the above algorithm is guaranteed to converge to its global minimum.\nHence, we are guaranteed to recover a local minimum of f​(𝐱)𝑓𝐱f(\\mathbf{x}).\nThis approach can also be viewed as a proximal-point algorithm 3, or as a simple projected gradient descent algorithm. It is worth mentioning that ISTA can be also viewed as a Recurrent Neural Net (RNN) unfolded through time . As previously stated, despite its simplicity, ISTA is considered as a slow algorithm. Over time, faster extensions have been suggested, such as: Fast-ISTA (FISTA) , Learned-ISTA (LISTA) [ref]16 and Ada-LISTA . We refer the reader to the corresponding references for further details.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: time .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1.
