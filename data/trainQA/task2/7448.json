However, the absence of control and verification mechanisms for the accuracy of published information has led to social networks being deemed conducive to the rapid and extensive spread of disinformation .\nDisinformation refers to false information deliberately published with the intent of deceiving and misleading the audience .\nDisinformation takes on various forms, such as fake news, rumors, hoax and clickbait.\nConsidering that the dissemination of disinformation can have severe negative effects on various aspects of human life, such as social  , political , economic , verifying the accuracy of information published on social networks is considered a critical issue in all societies. In recent years, machine learning and deep learning algorithms have gained extensive utilization in detecting disinformation.\nMost of the methods available in the research literature use a supervised classification approach to detect and classify disinformation.\nHowever, the lack of access to a substantial and adequate set of labeled data is one of the fundamental challenges in the supervised approach.\nBecause labeling extensive sets of information incurs significant human expenses.\nFurthermore, the disinformation detection problem (e.g., fake news detection)\nis intrinsically imbalanced, indicating that true information (e.g., real news) constitutes a larger proportion within the real world . Generally, to overcome these challenges, various solutions have been proposed.\nOne-Class Learning (OCL), considered as a form of semi-supervised learning, is among the proposed solutions for this challenge.\nOne-Class Learning is a learning algorithm that exclusively employs labeled examples of the interest class (positive class) as its input .\nIts primary goal is to construct a proficient model that effectively classifies new examples into interest (positive) or non-interest (negative) classes, accomplished through the strategic utilization of interest class examples.\nThrough instructing the classification model exclusively with examples from the interest class, OCL diminishes the gap in unbalanced training sets and eliminates the need to label examples of non-interest classes .\nThis approach is commonly employed in various domains, including fraud detection, anomaly detection and threat detection.\nGiven that the disinformation detection problem can be regarded as a form of anomaly detection, the One-Class Learning approach can be highly effective in addressing this issue. One of the influential factors in the performance of learning algorithms is the data representation model.\nUsing an inappropriate model can disrupt the classification algorithm, especially when dealing with unlabeled data .\nOn the other hand, while OCL approach diminishes the need for labeled examples of non-interest classes, the learning process becomes more demanding owing to the absence of non-interest class examples for model training .\nHence, disinformation detection through OCL requires more robust representation models to effectively separate false and true information in the hidden space .\nGraph-based modeling is a powerful and efficient approach that facilitates the effective analysis of complex data structures in non-Euclidean space.\nIndeed, graph-based modeling allows extracting class patterns that are challenging to discern using vector space models .\nResearch results demonstrate that graph-based modeling can be highly advantageous for semi-supervised learning [ref]13.\nBecause graphs, with their ability to depict structural and contextual dependencies between nodes where each node represents an object, prove to be valuable in scenarios where the number of labels is limited .\nTypically, the process of label learning for unlabeled nodes in a graph is accomplished through a label propagation algorithm, wherein labeled nodes propagate their labels to unlabeled nodes .\nOn the other hand, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) stand as the most powerful tools for processing graph data.\nIn Graph Neural Networks, unlike traditional neural networks that rely on matrix representation, graph processing involves a series of simple and efficient computations, such as aggregating the local neighborhood of each node [ref]16.\nThe literature demonstrates that GNNs exhibit high efficiency in\nsemi-supervised learning . In this paper, we propose the LOSS-GAT (Label Propagation and One-Class Semi-Supervised Learning with Graph Attention Network) algorithm, a novel One-Class Learning method for detecting fake news, utilizing GNNs along with a two-step label propagation approach.\nWe initiate the process by representing the data as a graph, comprising a limited number of labeled data (positive class = fake news) and a large number of unlabeled data (including positive class = fake news, and negative class = real news).\nThe methodology for constructing this graph is explained in detail in subsection 4.2.\nThen, we employ a two-step label propagation method to infer pseudo-labels for a subset of unlabeled data.\nIn the first step, we utilize a label propagation algorithm based on the Katz index, as described in .\nIn the second step, we employ the pseudo-labels obtained from the first step to train a Graph Attention Network (GAT) model.\nThis model predicts the labels of unlabeled nodes and classifies them as either fake or real.\nThen, a portion of these predicted labeled data is randomly selected as new pseudo-labels.\nFinally, these pseudo-labels are utilized by the classification module.\nIn the classification module, we initiate the process by performing structural augmentation on the graph using the Adamic-Adar score .\nAfter that, a GAT model is utilized to learn all nodes’ embedding vectors, and the final labels are determined using a fully connected perceptron.\nIn this GAT network, we induce randomness to reconstruct neighborhoods and enhance the aggregation process.\nThe key novelties of our proposed method are as follows: Our method accomplishes semi-supervised binary classification of fake news using only a limited amount of labeled data from the fake class. Our\nproposed two-step label propagation method is the first of its kind to utilize an initial classifier for label propagation. For the first time, we introduce an OCL approach utilizing GNNs for detecting fake news. Our method is the first approach that employs a structural augmentation to enhance the graph structure in the context of detecting fake news. Our method is the first fake news detection algorithm that\nemploys a probabilistic random approach grounded in node similarity degrees to reconstruct the neighborhood during the aggregation process. The rest of this article is organized as follows:\nIn section 2, we present related work.\nIn section 3, we formally describe the studied problem.\nIn section 4, we introduce our proposed approach.\nIn section 5, we present our experimental evaluation and\nthe obtained results.\nFinally, the paper is concluded in section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: and social networks are widely regarded as ideal tools for communication and information dissemination.\nSo, social networks have become the primary medium for interactions in today’s societies [ref]1.\nThe ease of widely disseminating information to millions of people within a short time has transformed social networks into a highly suitable platform for rapid information and news\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
