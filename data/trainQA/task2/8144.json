First, we conduct the experimental comparison on naive hallucination-based approaches on LFW and UCCS benchmarks. In our experiment, we check two hallucination methods, BI (bilinear interpolation) and SR (a recent FSRNet approach ), as well as five high-resolution face recognition models (CenterLoss [ref]58, SphereFace [ref]3, CosFace [ref]5, VGGFace2  and ArcFace ). Note that these models are provided by their authors with parameters pretrained on specific datasets. The input face resolution is 16Ã—16161616\\times 16. Tab. III shows the results.\nFrom the results, we can find that the hallucination-based approaches generally can achieve good recognition accuracy. For example, the average recognition accuracy can reach 82.16%percent82.1682.16\\% on LFW even using simply bilinear interpolation to hallucinate face images. It is also noted that complex hallucination method often leads to larger performance improvement while costing more computational burden in the reconstruction process. Moreover, SphereFace performs worse than CosFace and ArcFace on UCCS, since it is pretrained on CASIA-WebFace dataset  where the face images have very different distribution from the surveillance faces in UCCS. Our approach achieves comparable performance while costing much less computational and memory resources. For example, our S-16-sc-E student model gives an accuracy of 85.88%percent85.8885.88\\% on LFW and 91.84%percent91.8491.84\\%@Top5 on UCCS. We next check the impact of different loss functions for classification task on recognition performance. Beyond the baseline softmax loss, we conduct the experiments with four kinds of face recognition losses (CenterLoss [ref]58, SphereFace+ , CosFace [ref]5 and ArcFace ) on four student models. Tab. IV shows the results, where our proposed approach has consistent performance boost under various kinds of face recognition losses when having better distillation losses. It implies that our proposed approach is loss-agnostic.\n\nReference markers found: [58]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]58: benchmarks.
