Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

RefCOCO , RefCOCO+ , and RefCOCOg [ref]29 are three visual grounding datasets with images and referred objects selected from MSCOCO [ref]21. The referred objects are selected from the MSCOCO object detection annotations and belong to 80 object classes. RefCOCO  has 19,994 images with 142,210 referring expressions for 50,000 object instances. RefCOCO+ has 19,992 images with 141,564 referring expressions for 49,856 object instances. RefCOCOg has 25,799 images with 95,010 referring expressions for 49,822 object instances. On RefCOCO and RefCOCO+, we follow the split  of train/ validation/ testA/ testB that has 120,624/ 10,834/ 5,657/ 5,095 expressions for RefCOCO and 120,191/ 10,758/ 5,726/ 4,889 expressions for RefCOCO+, respectively. Images in “testA” are of multiple people and the ones in “testB” contain all other objects. The queries in RefCOCO+ contains no absolute location words, such as “on the right” that describes the object’s location in the image. On RefCOCOg, we experiment with the splits of RefCOCOg-google[ref]29 and RefCOCOg-umd [ref]30, and refer to the splits as the val-g, val-u, and test-u in Table 1. The queries in RefCOCOg are generally longer than those in RefCOCO and RefCOCO+: the average lengths are 3.61, 3.53, 8.43, respectively, for RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg. ReferItGame. The ReferItGame dataset  has 20,000 images from SAIAPR-12 . We follow a cleaned version of split   , which has 54,127, 5,842, and 60,103 referring expressions in train, validation, and test set, respectively. Flickr30K Entities. Flickr30K Entities  has 31,783 images with 427K referred entities. We follow the same split in previous works   0. We note that the queries in Flickr30K Entities are mostly short noun phrases and do not well reflect the difficulty of comprehensive phrase understanding. We still benchmark our method on Flickr30K Entities and compare it with other baselines for experiments completeness.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: RefCOCO/ RefCOCO+/ RefCOCOg.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
