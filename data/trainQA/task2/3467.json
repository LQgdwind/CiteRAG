      "content": "Paper Title: On the Complexity of Scheduling Problems With a Fixed Number of Parallel Identical Machines\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we consider problems on a single machine. For these problems, the main task is to order the jobs. First, consider again the problem 1||∑wjUj{1||\\sum w_{j}U_{j}} of minimizing the weighted number of late jobs on a single machine. With a reduction very similar to the one by Karp , we get the following lower bound:777It should be noted that some of the parameters in our lower bounds could be omitted, as they are overshadowed by others. For example, we can assume w.l.o.g. that dmax≤Psubscript𝑑𝑃d_{\\max}\\leq P for 1||∑wjUj{1||\\sum w_{j}U_{j}}, since we can assume a schedule to be gap-less and hence due dates larger than P𝑃P could be set to P𝑃P. But having all the parameters in the lower bound makes the comparison with known upper bounds easier. For every ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, there is a δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0 such that 1||∑wjUj{1||\\sum w_{j}U_{j}} cannot be solved in time 𝒪​(2δ​n​(dmax+y+P+W)1−ε)𝒪superscript2𝛿𝑛superscriptsubscript𝑑𝑦𝑃𝑊1𝜀\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{\\delta n}(d_{\\max}+y+P+W)^{1-\\varepsilon}\\right), unless the SETH fails. Let a1,…,ansubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑛a_{1},\\dots,a_{n} be a Partition instance and let T=12​∑i=1nai𝑇12superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛subscript𝑎𝑖T=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}.\nConstruct an instance of 1||∑wjUj{1||\\sum w_{j}U_{j}} by setting pj=wj=aj,dj=Tformulae-sequencesubscript𝑝𝑗subscript𝑤𝑗subscript𝑎𝑗subscript𝑑𝑗𝑇p_{j}=w_{j}=a_{j},d_{j}=T for each j∈[n]𝑗delimited-[]𝑛j\\in[n] and y=T𝑦𝑇y=T.\nThe idea is that the jobs corresponding to items in one of the partitions can be scheduled early (i.e. before the uniform due date T𝑇T). For a formal proof regarding the correctness of the reduction, see Appendix A. With this reduction, we get N:=nassign𝑁𝑛N:=n jobs. We have P=∑i=1nai=A𝑃superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛subscript𝑎𝑖𝐴P=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}=A and hence K:=dmax+y+P+W=T+T+A+A=poly​(n)​A=nc​Aassign𝐾subscript𝑑𝑦𝑃𝑊𝑇𝑇𝐴𝐴poly𝑛𝐴superscript𝑛𝑐𝐴K:=d_{\\max}+y+P+W=T+T+A+A=\\text{poly}(n)A=n^{c}A. The reduction itself takes time 𝒪​(N)𝒪𝑁\\mathcal{O}\\left(N\\right). Assuming that we can solve 1||∑wjUj{1||\\sum w_{j}U_{j}} in time 𝒪​(2δ​N​K1−ε)𝒪superscript2𝛿𝑁superscript𝐾1𝜀\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{\\delta N}K^{1-\\varepsilon}\\right) for some ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 and every δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0, we could also solve Partition in time: The last step holds for large enough n𝑛n; for smaller n𝑛n, we can solve the problem efficiently, anyway, as n𝑛n is then bounded by a constant. Now, to contradict Theorem 2.3, we can set ε′:=εassignsuperscript𝜀′𝜀\\varepsilon^{\\prime}:=\\varepsilon and for every δ′>0superscript𝛿′0\\delta^{\\prime}>0, we have δ=δ′2>0𝛿superscript𝛿′20\\delta=\\frac{\\delta^{\\prime}}{2}>0. So by assumption, we can solve Partition in time 𝒪​(22​δ​n​A1−ε)=𝒪​(2δ′​n​A1−ε′)𝒪superscript22𝛿𝑛superscript𝐴1𝜀𝒪superscript2superscript𝛿′𝑛superscript𝐴1superscript𝜀′\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{2\\delta n}A^{1-\\varepsilon}\\right)=\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{\\delta^{\\prime}n}A^{1-\\varepsilon^{\\prime}}\\right). Using the algorithm by Lawler and Moore , 1||∑wjUj{1||\\sum w_{j}U_{j}} is solvable in time 𝒪​(n​W)𝒪𝑛𝑊\\mathcal{O}\\left(nW\\right) or 𝒪​(n​min⁡{dmax,P})𝒪𝑛subscript𝑑𝑃\\mathcal{O}\\left(n\\min\\{d_{\\max},P\\}\\right). Our 𝒪​(2δ​n​(dmax+y+P+W)1−ε)𝒪superscript2𝛿𝑛superscriptsubscript𝑑𝑦𝑃𝑊1𝜀\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{\\delta n}(d_{\\max}+y+P+W)^{1-\\varepsilon}\\right)-time lower bound suggests the optimality of both variants, as we cannot hope to reduce the linear dependency on W𝑊W, dmaxsubscript𝑑d_{\\max} or P𝑃P without getting a super-polynomial dependency on n𝑛n. As noted above, Abboud et al.  exclude 𝒪~​(n+pmax​n1−ε)~𝒪𝑛subscript𝑝superscript𝑛1𝜀\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(n+p_{\\max}n^{1-\\varepsilon}\\right)-time algorithms; Hermelin et al. [ref]16 exclude algorithms with running time 𝒪~​(n+wmax​n1−ε)~𝒪𝑛subscript𝑤superscript𝑛1𝜀\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(n+w_{\\max}n^{1-\\varepsilon}\\right), and 𝒪~​(n+wmax1−ε​n)~𝒪𝑛superscriptsubscript𝑤1𝜀𝑛\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(n+w_{\\max}^{1-\\varepsilon}n\\right) and 𝒪~​(n𝒪​(1)+dmax1−ε)~𝒪superscript𝑛𝒪1superscriptsubscript𝑑1𝜀\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(n^{\\mathcal{O}\\left(1\\right)}+d_{\\max}^{1-\\varepsilon}\\right) (all three under the stronger ∀∃for-all\\forall\\exists-SETH). One interesting property of 1||∑wjUj{1||\\sum w_{j}U_{j}} is that its straightforward formulation as an Integer Linear Program has a triangular structure that collapses to a single constraint when all due dates are equal (see e.g. Lenstra and Shmoys 8). This shows that the problem is closely related to Knapsack: Knapsack Item values v1,…,vn∈ℕsubscript𝑣1…subscript𝑣𝑛ℕv_{1},\\ldots,v_{n}\\in\\mathbb{N}, item sizes\na1,…,an∈ℕsubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑛ℕa_{1},\\ldots,a_{n}\\in\\mathbb{N}, knapsack capacity T∈ℕ𝑇ℕT\\in\\mathbb{N} and threshold y𝑦y. Decide whether there is a subset S𝑆S of items with ∑j∈Saj≤Tsubscript𝑗𝑆subscript𝑎𝑗𝑇\\sum_{j\\in S}a_{j}\\leq T and ∑j∈Svj≥ysubscript𝑗𝑆subscript𝑣𝑗𝑦\\sum_{j\\in S}v_{j}\\geq y. Cygan et al.  conjectured that the (min,+)(\\min,+)-Convolution problem cannot be solved in sub-quadratic time (this is known as the (min,+)(\\min,+)-conjecture) and showed that this conditional lower bound transfers to Knapsack, excluding 𝒪​((n+T)2−δ)𝒪superscript𝑛𝑇2𝛿\\mathcal{O}\\left((n+T)^{2-\\delta}\\right) algorithms. As noted by Mucha et al. , these results also hold when we swap the role of sizes and values. As we can discard items with too large value visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i}, a lower bound depending on the largest item value vmaxsubscript𝑣v_{\\max} directly follows from Corollary 9.6 in : For any constant δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0, there is no 𝒪​((n+vmax)2−δ)𝒪superscript𝑛subscript𝑣2𝛿\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\left(n+v_{\\max}\\right)^{2-\\delta}\\right)-time exact algorithm for Knapsack, unless the (min,+)(\\min,+)-conjecture fails. We show that the conditional hardness of Knapsack transfers to 1||∑wjUj{1||\\sum w_{j}U_{j}}: For any constant δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0, the existence of an exact algorithm\nfor 1||∑wjUj{1||\\sum w_{j}U_{j}} with running time\n𝒪​((n+wmax)2−δ)𝒪superscript𝑛subscript𝑤2𝛿\\mathcal{O}\\left((n+w_{\\max})^{2-\\delta}\\right) refutes the (min,+)(\\min,+)-conjecture. We give a reduction from Knapsack to 1||∑wjUj{1||\\sum w_{j}U_{j}}. Consider an instance v1,…,vnsubscript𝑣1…subscript𝑣𝑛v_{1},\\ldots,v_{n}, a1,…,ansubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑛a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n}, T𝑇T, y𝑦y of Knapsack. We construct jobs with pj=ajsubscript𝑝𝑗subscript𝑎𝑗p_{j}=a_{j}, wj=vjsubscript𝑤𝑗subscript𝑣𝑗w_{j}=v_{j} and dj=Tsubscript𝑑𝑗𝑇d_{j}=T for every j∈[n]𝑗delimited-[]𝑛j\\in[n]. The threshold is set to y′=∑j=1nvj−ysuperscript𝑦′superscriptsubscript𝑗1𝑛subscript𝑣𝑗𝑦y^{\\prime}=\\sum_{j=1}^{n}v_{j}-y. As this is also a very classical reduction, we leave the proof of correctness to the appendix. Suppose that there is an 𝒪​((n+wmax)2−δ)𝒪superscript𝑛subscript𝑤2𝛿\\mathcal{O}\\left((n+w_{\\max})^{2-\\delta}\\right)-time algorithm for 1||∑wjUj{1||\\sum w_{j}U_{j}}. Since wmax=vmaxsubscript𝑤subscript𝑣w_{\\max}=v_{\\max} in the reduction and the reduction takes time 𝒪​(n)𝒪𝑛\\mathcal{O}\\left(n\\right), we could then solve Knapsack in time 𝒪​(n)+𝒪​((n+wmax)2−δ)=𝒪​((n+vmax)2−δ)𝒪𝑛𝒪superscript𝑛subscript𝑤2𝛿𝒪superscript𝑛subscript𝑣2𝛿\\mathcal{O}\\left(n\\right)+\\mathcal{O}\\left((n+w_{\\max})^{2-\\delta}\\right)=\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\left(n+v_{\\max}\\right)^{2-\\delta}\\right),\nwhich is a contradiction to Corollary 3.4, unless the (min,+)(\\min,+)-conjecture fails. Lower bounds such as this one also imply lower bounds for approximation schemes, as setting the accuracy parameter ε𝜀\\varepsilon small enough yields an exact solution. The above result implies the following (see Appendix A for the proof): For any constant δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0, the existence of an 𝒪​((n+12​n​ε)2−δ)𝒪superscript𝑛12𝑛𝜀2𝛿\\mathcal{O}\\left((n+\\frac{1}{2n\\varepsilon})^{2-\\delta}\\right)-time approximation scheme for the optimization version of 1||∑wjUj{1||\\sum w_{j}U_{j}} refutes the (min,+)(\\min,+)-conjecture. As the currently fastest FPTAS by Gens and Levner  runs in time 𝒪​(n2​(log⁡(n)+1ε))𝒪superscript𝑛2𝑛1𝜀\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{2}(\\log(n)+\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon})\\right), there is still a small gap. This relation between exact and approximation algorithms might also be an interesting subject of further investigation, as many other scheduling problems admit approximation schemes and exact lower bounds. We wish to mention two other results, the proofs of which can also be found in Appendix A. The first result concerns 1||∑Tj{1||\\sum T_{j}}: For every ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, there is a δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0 such that 1||∑Tj{1||\\sum T_{j}} cannot be solved in time 𝒪​(2δ​n​P1−ε)𝒪superscript2𝛿𝑛superscript𝑃1𝜀\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{\\delta n}P^{1-\\varepsilon}\\right), unless the SETH fails. There is an 𝒪​(n4​P)𝒪superscript𝑛4𝑃\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{4}P\\right)-time algorithm by Lawler 2 and while we can derive no statement about the exponent of n𝑛n, our lower bound suggests that an improvement of the linear factor P𝑃P is unlikely without getting a super-polynomial dependency on n𝑛n. We have a similar situation for the problem 1|R​e​j≤Q|Cmaxconditional1𝑅𝑒𝑗conditional𝑄subscript𝐶{1|Rej\\leq Q|C_{\\max}}: For every ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, there is a δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0 such that 1|R​e​j≤Q|Cmaxconditional1𝑅𝑒𝑗conditional𝑄subscript𝐶{1|Rej\\leq Q|C_{\\max}} cannot be solved in time 𝒪​(2δ​n​(y+P+Q+W)1−ε)𝒪superscript2𝛿𝑛superscript𝑦𝑃𝑄𝑊1𝜀\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{\\delta n}(y+P+Q+W)^{1-\\varepsilon}\\right), unless the SETH fails. The lower bound can also be shown to hold for 1|R​e​j≤Q|∑wj​Ujconditional1𝑅𝑒𝑗conditional𝑄subscript𝑤𝑗subscript𝑈𝑗{1|Rej\\leq Q|\\sum w_{j}U_{j}} (see Appendix C) and this problem can be solved in time 𝒪​(n​Q​P)𝒪𝑛𝑄𝑃\\mathcal{O}\\left(nQP\\right) with the algorithm by Zhang et al. . This almost matches our lower bound: An algorithm with running time 𝒪​(n​(Q+P))𝒪𝑛𝑄𝑃\\mathcal{O}\\left(n(Q+P)\\right) might still be possible, for example.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: dependency on n𝑛n. As noted above, Abboud et al.  exclude 𝒪~​(n+pmax​n1−ε)~𝒪𝑛subscript𝑝superscript𝑛1𝜀\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(n+p_{\\max}n^{1-\\varepsilon}\\right)-time algorithms; Hermelin et al. [ref]16 exclude algorithms with running time 𝒪~​(n+wmax​n1−ε)~𝒪𝑛subscript𝑤superscript𝑛1𝜀\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(n+w_{\\max}n^{1-\\varepsilon}\\right), and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
