      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Robust Generalization by Direct PAC-Bayesian Bound Minimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs mentioned earlier, neither AWP 0 nor S2O  minimize the PAC-Bayesian bound directly, likely due to the complicating square-root term in Eq.3.\nHowever, Eq.3 is only one instance out of\nPAC-Bayesian bounds defined in Germain et al. [ref]19.\nAccording to their framework, there is also a linear-form of the bound related to Bayesian inference which can be analytically minimized with the aid of a Gibbs distribution   [ref]13.\nWe leverage this linear-form of the PAC-Bayesian bound, and adapt it for bounding the robustness gap: Under the same assumptions as in Theorem 1, for any β>0𝛽0\\beta>0, with a probability at least 1−τ1𝜏1-\\tau,\n where C​(τ,β,m)𝐶𝜏𝛽𝑚C(\\tau,\\beta,m) is a function independent of 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q}. Here β𝛽\\beta is a hyper-parameter that balances the three terms on the RHS. A common choice is β∝mproportional-to𝛽𝑚\\beta\\propto m, i.e. the size of the dataset  .\nRecently, [ref]13 proposed to set 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} and 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} to univariate Gaussians and used a second-order approximation to estimate the PAC-Bayesian bound.\nApplying a similar technique, we introduce Theorem 3 (see Appendix. A for the proof) which minimizes the RHS of Eq. 4. If 𝒫=𝒩​(𝟎,σ02)𝒫𝒩0subscriptsuperscript𝜎20\\mathcal{P}=\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0},\\sigma^{2}_{0}), and 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} is also a product of univariate Gaussian distributions, then the minimum of Eq. 4 w.r.t 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} can be bounded by Assuming that σ02=1/dsuperscriptsubscript𝜎021𝑑\\sigma_{0}^{2}=1/d is the variance of the initial weight matrices where d𝑑d is the input feature dimension, then O​(σ04)=O​(d−2)𝑂subscriptsuperscript𝜎40𝑂superscript𝑑2O(\\sigma^{4}_{0})=O(d^{-2}).\nTheorem 3 considerably simplifies the optimization problem from one over the space of probability density functions 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} to one over model weights θ𝜃\\theta.\nMoreover, the resulting bound (RHS of Eq. 5) contains the Trace of Hessian (TrH) term\nTr​(▽θ2​R^​(θ,Dm))Trsubscriptsuperscript▽2𝜃^𝑅𝜃superscript𝐷𝑚\\mathrm{Tr}(\\triangledown^{2}_{\\theta}\\hat{R}(\\theta,D^{m})) of the robust loss, which sums the loss surface curvatures in all directions.\nFor a convex loss, the Hessian is positive semi-definite (PSD) in which case trace minimization leads θ𝜃\\theta to a flatter region of the loss surface.\nAlthough in general, our Hessian is not PSD, empirically we find that its largest eigenvalue has a much larger magnitude than the least ones \nand that trace minimization correlates with minimizing the standard deviation of the eigenvalues (see Figure 5 in the appendix), so that the overall curvature is effectively decreases. The RHS of Eq. 5 in Theorem 3 provides a training objective function that bounds the optimal test error up to a constant. However, evaluating and minimizing the bound in Eq. 5 requires computing the Trace of Hessian (TrH) term.\nUnfortunately, computing the Hessian directly by applying auto-differentiation twice is infeasible for a large deep network. Another solution is to apply Hutchinson’s method  to randomly approximate the TrH,\nhowever, the variance of the resulting estimator is too high and it ends up being too noisy for training in practice. Instead, we propose to restrict TrH regularization to the top layer of the deep network only. Although this restriction brings approximation error to the bound, it has two benefits.\nFirst, the TrH on the top layer has simple analytical expressions for (Section 3.1). Second, we show that the top-layer TrH regularization effectively regularizes the TrH of the entire network as well (Section 3.2).\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: nor S2O  minimize the PAC-Bayesian bound directly, likely due to the complicating square-root term in Eq.3.\nHowever, Eq.3 is only one instance out of\nPAC-Bayesian bounds defined in Germain et al. [ref]19.\nAccording to their framework, there is also a linear-form of the bound related to Bayesian inference which can be analytically minimized with the aid of a Gibbs distribution   [ref]13.\nWe\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
