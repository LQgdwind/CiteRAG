A detailed exposition of bounded lattice representation and duality is given in  and, in a context of implicative lattices, in [ref]23, both presenting special cases of the duality for normal lattice expansions in [ref]24. The lattice representation and duality underlying the results of each of [ref]24 [ref]23  first appeared in print in  . The way we define point operators and canonical relations was first introduced in . Point operators, as we define them, are the same as the duals of lattice quasi-operators defined in the dual lattice space by Moshier and Jipsen  , as we detailed in [24, Remark 4.2, Remark 4.8]. That the complete lattice of stable sets is identical to the complete lattice of the Moshier-Jipsen saturated sets (defined as the intersections of open filters that cover them) was proven in [25, Proposition 4.6]. For an implicative modal lattice 𝐋𝐋\\mathbf{L}, following  [ref]23, we let Z1=Filt​(𝐋)subscript𝑍1Filt𝐋Z_{1}=\\mbox{\\rm Filt}(\\mathbf{L}), Z∂=Idl​(𝐋)subscript𝑍Idl𝐋Z_{\\partial}=\\mbox{\\rm Idl}(\\mathbf{L}) be the sets of non-empty lattice filters and ideals, respectively, and we define the relation I⊆Filt​(𝐋)×Idl​(𝐋)𝐼Filt𝐋Idl𝐋I\\subseteq\\mbox{\\rm Filt}(\\mathbf{L})\\times\\mbox{\\rm Idl}(\\mathbf{L}) by x​I​y𝑥𝐼𝑦xIy iff x∩y=∅𝑥𝑦x\\cap y=\\emptyset (with the Galois relation of the frame defined then by x​\\upVdash​y𝑥\\upVdash𝑦x\\upVdash y iff x∩y≠∅𝑥𝑦x\\cap y\\neq\\emptyset). The underlying lattice of 𝐋𝐋\\mathbf{L} is embedded in the complete lattice 𝒢​(Z1)𝒢subscript𝑍1{\\mathcal{G}}(Z_{1}) of stable sets of filters via the map ζ1subscript𝜁1\\zeta_{1} defined by ζ1​(a)={x∈Filt​(𝐋)|a∈x}=Xasubscript𝜁1𝑎conditional-set𝑥Filt𝐋𝑎𝑥subscript𝑋𝑎\\zeta_{1}(a)=\\{x\\in\\mbox{\\rm Filt}(\\mathbf{L})\\;|\\;a\\in x\\}=X_{a} and dually embedded in 𝒢​(Z∂)𝒢subscript𝑍{\\mathcal{G}}(Z_{\\partial}) via the map ζ∂​(a)={y∈Idl​(𝐋)|a∈y}=Yasubscript𝜁𝑎conditional-set𝑦Idl𝐋𝑎𝑦superscript𝑌𝑎\\zeta_{\\partial}(a)=\\{y\\in\\mbox{\\rm Idl}(\\mathbf{L})\\;|\\;a\\in y\\}=Y^{a}. Meets are taken to intersections and lattice joins to joins (closures of unions) of stable sets in 𝒢​(Z1)𝒢subscript𝑍1{\\mathcal{G}}(Z_{1}). Note that Xa={x∈Filt​(𝐋)|xa⊆x}=Γ​xasubscript𝑋𝑎conditional-set𝑥Filt𝐋subscript𝑥𝑎𝑥Γsubscript𝑥𝑎X_{a}=\\{x\\in\\mbox{\\rm Filt}(\\mathbf{L})\\;|\\;x_{a}\\subseteq x\\}=\\Gamma x_{a} and Ya={y∈Idl​(𝐋)|ya⊆y}=Γ​yasuperscript𝑌𝑎conditional-set𝑦Idl𝐋subscript𝑦𝑎𝑦Γsubscript𝑦𝑎Y^{a}=\\{y\\in\\mbox{\\rm Idl}(\\mathbf{L})\\;|\\;y_{a}\\subseteq y\\}=\\Gamma y_{a}, where for a lattice element e𝑒e we write xe,yesubscript𝑥𝑒subscript𝑦𝑒x_{e},y_{e} for the principal filter and ideal, respectively, generated by e𝑒e. The sets Xasubscript𝑋𝑎X_{a} are clopen elements of 𝒢​(Z1)𝒢subscript𝑍1{\\mathcal{G}}(Z_{1}), since Γxa={ya}\\upVdash=(Γya)\\upVdash\\Gamma x_{a}={}\\mbox{${}^{\\upVdash}$}\\{y_{a}\\}={}\\mbox{${}^{\\upVdash}$}(\\Gamma y_{a}) (and then so are the sets Yasuperscript𝑌𝑎Y^{a} in 𝒢​(Z∂)𝒢subscript𝑍{\\mathcal{G}}(Z_{\\partial})). Taking the families ℬ={Xa|a∈𝐋}ℬconditional-setsubscript𝑋𝑎𝑎𝐋\\mathcal{B}=\\{X_{a}\\;|\\;a\\in\\mathbf{L}\\} and 𝒞={Ya|a∈𝐋}𝒞conditional-setsuperscript𝑌𝑎𝑎𝐋\\mathcal{C}=\\{Y^{a}\\;|\\;a\\in\\mathbf{L}\\} as bases for topologies on Z1=Filt​(𝐋)subscript𝑍1Filt𝐋Z_{1}=\\mbox{\\rm Filt}(\\mathbf{L}) and Z∂=Idl​(𝐋)subscript𝑍Idl𝐋Z_{\\partial}=\\mbox{\\rm Idl}(\\mathbf{L}), respectively, it was shown in  that ℬ,𝒞ℬ𝒞\\mathcal{B,C} generate spectral topologies ([25, Proposition 4.2]), that ℬ,𝒞ℬ𝒞\\mathcal{B,C} are the families of compact open, Galois stable and co-stable sets, respectively, and that they are dually isomorphic lattices and sublattices of 𝒢​(Z1),𝒢​(Z∂)𝒢subscript𝑍1𝒢subscript𝑍{\\mathcal{G}}(Z_{1}),{\\mathcal{G}}(Z_{\\partial}), respectively ([25, Proposition 4.4]). Furthermore, the map a↦Xamaps-to𝑎subscript𝑋𝑎a\\mapsto X_{a} is a bounded lattice isomorphism ([25, Theorem 4.5]). That the full complex algebra of the dual frame of the lattice is a canonical extension of the lattice was proven in [12, Proposition 2.6]. The canonical relations R□∂∂,R◇11superscriptsubscript𝑅□subscriptsuperscript𝑅11◇R_{\\Box}^{\\partial\\partial},R^{11}_{\\Diamond} and R→∂1​∂=Tsubscriptsuperscript𝑅1→𝑇R^{\\partial 1\\partial}_{\\rightarrow}=T are defined using the canonical point operators ⊟:Z∂⟶Z∂\\boxminus:Z_{\\partial}\\longrightarrow Z_{\\partial}, \\diamondvert:Z1⟶Z1:\\diamondvert⟶subscript𝑍1subscript𝑍1\\diamondvert:Z_{1}\\longrightarrow Z_{1} and ▷:Z1×Z∂⟶Z∂\\triangleright:Z_{1}\\times Z_{\\partial}\\longrightarrow Z_{\\partial}, setting y​R□​v𝑦subscript𝑅□𝑣yR_{\\Box}v iff ⊟v⊆y⊟𝑣𝑦\\boxminus v\\subseteq y, x​R◇​z𝑥subscript𝑅◇𝑧xR_{\\Diamond}z iff \\diamondvert​z⊆x\\diamondvert𝑧𝑥\\diamondvert z\\subseteq x and y​T∂1​∂​x​v𝑦superscript𝑇1𝑥𝑣yT^{\\partial 1\\partial}xv iff x▷v⊆y▷𝑥𝑣𝑦x{\\triangleright}v\\subseteq y, given the point operator definitions in (21) A point operator ⊟⊟\\boxminus, generating the relation S□11subscriptsuperscript𝑆11□S^{11}_{\\Box}, is defined on filters by ⊟x=⋁{x□​a|a∈x}⊟𝑥conditional-setsubscript𝑥□𝑎𝑎𝑥\\boxminus x=\\bigvee\\{x_{\\Box a}\\;|\\;a\\in x\\}. The reader can easily verify that the relations R□∂∂,R◇11superscriptsubscript𝑅□subscriptsuperscript𝑅11◇R_{\\Box}^{\\partial\\partial},R^{11}_{\\Diamond} and R→∂1​∂=Tsubscriptsuperscript𝑅1→𝑇R^{\\partial 1\\partial}_{\\rightarrow}=T are equivalently defined by the respective instance of the clause in the statement of this Theorem. The general proof (for any normal lattice expansion and the associated canonical relations) of this fact is given in [24, Lemma 4.4]. Operators \\largesquare​□,\\largediamond​◇\\largesquare□\\largediamond◇\\mbox{\\raisebox{1.0pt}{$\\largesquare\\Box\\;$}},\\mbox{$\\largediamond\\Diamond\\;$} and ⇒⇒\\Rightarrow are defined in the canonical frame from the frame relations as detailed in Section 3 for any frame. That the so defined maps are the σ𝜎\\sigma (for \\largediamond​◇\\largediamond◇\\largediamond\\Diamond\\;) and π𝜋\\pi-extension (for \\largesquare​□,⇒\\largesquare□⇒\\mbox{\\raisebox{1.0pt}{$\\largesquare\\Box\\;$}},\\Rightarrow), depending on the output type of their distribution type was argued for, for any normal lattice expansion, in [22, Proposition 28]. That the lattice representation map a↦Xamaps-to𝑎subscript𝑋𝑎a\\mapsto X_{a} is an isomorphism of implicative modal lattices follows from the observations below The axioms (F1)–(F4) for a refined frame (though the term was not used) were argued for in [ref]24, for any normal lattice expansion. For axiom (F5), the defining condition for the relation S□11subscriptsuperscript𝑆11□S^{11}_{\\Box} in the canonical frame is z​S□11​x𝑧subscriptsuperscript𝑆11□𝑥zS^{11}_{\\Box}x iff ⊟x⊆z⊟𝑥𝑧\\boxminus x\\subseteq z, where we define ⊟x⊟𝑥\\boxminus x to be the filter generated by the set {□​a|a∈x}conditional-set□𝑎𝑎𝑥\\{\\Box a\\;|\\;a\\in x\\}, equivalently ⊟x=⋁a∈xx□​a⊟𝑥subscript𝑎𝑥subscript𝑥□𝑎\\boxminus x=\\bigvee_{a\\in x}x_{\\Box a}. To verify that z​S□11​x𝑧subscriptsuperscript𝑆11□𝑥zS^{11}_{\\Box}x iff z​R□′′⊆Γ​x𝑧subscriptsuperscript𝑅′′□Γ𝑥zR^{\\prime\\prime}_{\\Box}\\subseteq\\Gamma x we verify that S□11​x=\\largesquare​□​Γ​xsubscriptsuperscript𝑆11□𝑥\\largesquare□Γ𝑥S^{11}_{\\Box}x=\\mbox{\\raisebox{1.0pt}{$\\largesquare\\Box\\;$}}\\Gamma x. Since \\largesquare​□Γx=⋂x​\\upVdash​y{y}\\upVdash=⋂x​\\upVdash​y{⊟y}\\upVdash\\mbox{\\raisebox{1.0pt}{$\\largesquare\\Box\\;$}}\\Gamma x=\\bigcap_{x\\upVdash y}\\mbox{${}^{\\upVdash}$}\\{y\\}=\\bigcap_{x\\upVdash y}\\mbox{${}^{\\upVdash}$}\\{\\boxminus y\\}, the claim to prove is equivalent to showing that for any filters x,z𝑥𝑧x,z, ⊟x⊆z⊟𝑥𝑧\\boxminus x\\subseteq z iff ∀y​(x​\\upVdash​y⟶z​\\upVdash⊟y)for-all𝑦⟶𝑥\\upVdash𝑦⊟𝑧\\upVdash𝑦\\forall y(x\\upVdash y\\longrightarrow z\\upVdash\\boxminus y), where in the canonical frame \\upVdash\\upVdash\\upVdash means non-empty intersection. If ⊟⊆z\\boxminus\\subseteq z and y𝑦y is an ideal such that a∈x∩y≠∅𝑎𝑥𝑦a\\in x\\cap y\\neq\\emptyset, then by a∈x𝑎𝑥a\\in x and a∈y𝑎𝑦a\\in y we obtain □​a∈⊟x□𝑎⊟𝑥\\Box a\\in\\boxminus x and □​a∈⊟y□𝑎⊟𝑦\\Box a\\in\\boxminus y. Hence □a∈z∩⊟y≠∅\\Box a\\in z\\cap\\boxminus y\\neq\\emptyset. Conversely, assume ∀y​(x​\\upVdash​y⟶z​\\upVdash⊟y)for-all𝑦⟶𝑥\\upVdash𝑦⊟𝑧\\upVdash𝑦\\forall y(x\\upVdash y\\longrightarrow z\\upVdash\\boxminus y), but suppose for a contradiction that ⊟x⊈znot-subset-of-or-equals⊟𝑥𝑧\\boxminus x\\not\\subseteq z. Hence there is an element a∈x𝑎𝑥a\\in x such that □​a∉z□𝑎𝑧\\Box a\\not\\in z. But since a∈x∩ya𝑎𝑥subscript𝑦𝑎a\\in x\\cap y_{a} (where yasubscript𝑦𝑎y_{a} is the principal ideal generated by the element a𝑎a), the case hypothesis implies that z​\\upVdash⊟ya⊟𝑧\\upVdashsubscript𝑦𝑎z\\upVdash\\boxminus y_{a}. Since ⊟ya=y□​a⊟subscript𝑦𝑎subscript𝑦□𝑎\\boxminus y_{a}=y_{\\Box a} we get □​a∈z□𝑎𝑧\\Box a\\in z, contradiction. Finally, axiom (F6) posits that \\largesquare​□u​A⊆\\largesquare​□ℓ​Asuperscript\\largesquare□𝑢𝐴superscript\\largesquare□ℓ𝐴\\mbox{\\raisebox{1.0pt}{$\\largesquare\\Box\\;$}}^{u}A\\subseteq\\mbox{\\raisebox{1.0pt}{$\\largesquare\\Box\\;$}}^{\\ell}A, for any stable set A𝐴A. In the canonical frame \\largesquare​□u=□πsuperscript\\largesquare□𝑢superscript□𝜋\\mbox{\\raisebox{1.0pt}{$\\largesquare\\Box\\;$}}^{u}=\\Box^{\\pi} and \\largesquare​□ℓ=□σsuperscript\\largesquare□ℓsuperscript□𝜎\\mbox{\\raisebox{1.0pt}{$\\largesquare\\Box\\;$}}^{\\ell}=\\Box^{\\sigma} are the π𝜋\\pi and σ𝜎\\sigma extensions of the box operator. Having argued that the full complex algebra of the canonical frame is a canonical extension of the represented implicative modal lattice, identity of the σ𝜎\\sigma and π𝜋\\pi extensions of the box operator holds, by [12, Lemma 4.4]. By the above, the proof that the canonical frame is a refined frame (axiomatized in Table 3) is complete.\n∎ It remains to examine the cases where additional axioms are satisfied in the implicative modal lattice. For the lattice distribution axiom and for the case where the lattice is a Heyting algebra and the respective proofs that the full complex algebra of the canonical frame is (completely) distributive and a (complete) Heyting algebra, respectively, we refer the reader to Section 7 and to [23, Proposition 4.7, Proposition 4.11].\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: else it is its π𝜋\\pi-extension (in the sense of [12, Definition 4.1]).
