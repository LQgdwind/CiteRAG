      "content": "Paper Title: Sóley: Identification and Automated Detection of Logic Vulnerabilities in Ethereum Smart Contracts Using Large Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSmart contracts are self-executing programs and key components of modern blockchain such as Ethereum . Smart Contracts have gained widespread attention for their ability to enforce agreements without intermediaries, offering a decentralized and trustworthy approach .\nThe characteristics of smart contracts, including high financial value, immutability, and decentralized nature, have facilitated the growth of decentralized applications (DApps) that offer various functionalities in fields such as gaming, e-commerce, and more .\nSmart contracts are typically implemented using high-level languages such as Solidity 111https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.23/. Their implementation consists of functions that define a sequence of instructions and a set of state variables [ref]4. Ethereum, as the first blockchain supporting smart contracts , has garnered significant developer interest, leading to the deployment of over 64 million smart contracts 222https://etherscan.io/contractsVerified and a market capitalization exceeding $300 billion 333https://etherscan.io/.\nOn Ethereum, executing a smart contract requires fees known as “gas”, a unit that measures the consumption of storage and computing resources . These fees, paid in Ether 444Ethereum cryptocurrency, compensate for computing resources used during contract execution 555https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/gas. Smart contracts with logic vulnerabilities are susceptible to severe consequences, including high-impact cyberattacks, execution failures due to excessive gas usage, wasted gas, and significant financial losses . Identifying logic vulnerabilities is crucial for maintaining Solidity smart contracts as emphasized by Chaliasos et al. . In their study, they highlight the inefficiency of existing smart contract security tools in detecting logic-related vulnerabilities, sanity checks, and logic errors. Logic vulnerabilities become even more critical when they exist in smart contract functions responsible for transferring Ether out of the contract, as this could potentially prevent the contract owners or users from accessing their money (i.e, Ether). A notable example is the Governmental contract [ref]6, where $2.5 million worth of Ether got locked out. Therefore, ensuring a sustainable and secure development of smart contracts is imperative, and addressing logic vulnerabilities plays a crucial role in achieving this goal. Smart contracts, with their sequential code structure and the interrelation of statements, share similarities with natural language text. Moreover, they often conform to predetermined templates and standards, leading to recognizable patterns and recurring code structures [ref]7. Consequently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and other Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods offer the potential for automating the detection of vulnerabilities and generating comments within smart contracts  . Motivated by the advancements achieved by LLMs in conventional software and the inherent characteristics of smart contract code,\nthis paper aims to answer the following research questions. RQ1 - (Identification): To what extent do historical code changes reveal logic vulnerabilities in smart contracts? RQ2 - (Detection): How can we automatically detect logic vulnerabilities in smart contracts via LLMs? RQ3 - (Mitigation): What specific strategies do developers employ in their code changes to mitigate potential logic vulnerabilities in smart contracts? With these RQs in mind, our methodology consists of several key steps. First, we gathered instances of smart contract vulnerabilities and their corresponding fixes from real-world Solidity code changes on GitHub. We then investigated the identified logic vulnerabilities using open coding 0, defining the available vulnerabilities and corresponding mitigation strategies. Subsequently, we developed Sóley to effectively detect logic vulnerabilities using LLMs without extensive feature engineering. Finally, we investigate the performance of various LLMs on the logic vulnerability detection task. Our work makes the following contributions: Sóley Development and Experiment. We present Sóley, based on CodeBERTa, to detect logic-related vulnerabilities in smart contracts. We also explore the performance of well-known LLMs on the same task for various code vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Dataset. We curated a large dataset of Solidity smart contracts labeled with vulnerability types, locations in the contracts, and other metadata. This dataset contains 50k contracts, 428,569 instances of code vulnerabilities, and 171,180 logic related vulnerabilities. Analysis of Logic code vulnerabilities and mitigation. We conduct an in-depth analysis of logic vulnerabilities found in code changes within smart contracts and in literature, identifying nine novel vulnerabilities. Moreover, we introduce 15 mitigation strategies used by developers to address logic vulnerabilities. We have made the models, scripts, and data utilized in this study openly available\nto promote research replication and facilitate additional investigations by other researchers in the field. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide background information about smart contracts and the Ethereum blockchain. Our research methodology is outlined in Section 3. Section 4 presents the experiment evaluation and setup, while Section 5 details our findings. Section 6 provides discussions and implications. Section 7 presents the related work. Additionally, we address threats to the validity of our work in Section 8 before concluding in Section 9.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: high-level languages such as Solidity 111https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.23/.
