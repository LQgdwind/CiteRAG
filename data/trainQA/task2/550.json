      "content": "Paper Title: Fast General Distributed Transactions with Opacity using Global Time\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section we compare FaRMv2’s design with some other\nsystems that support distributed transactions. We do not aim to cover\nthe entire space of distributed transaction protocols or\nsystems  .\nInstead we focus on a few systems that highlight differences in the use of\none-sided RDMA, strictness, serializability, opacity, availability,\nand timestamp generation. Most systems with distributed transactions and data partitioning use\nRPCs to read remote objects during execution which requires CPU\nprocessing at the remote participants. Traditional 2-phase commit also\nrequires processing of P​R​E​P​A​R​E𝑃𝑅𝐸𝑃𝐴𝑅𝐸PREPARE and C​O​M​M​I​T𝐶𝑂𝑀𝑀𝐼𝑇COMMIT messages at all\nparticipants, including read-only\nones. Calvin  uses\ndeterministic locking of predeclared read and write sets to avoid 2PC\nbut read locks must still be taken using messages.\nSinfonia  can piggyback reads on the 2PC messages in\nspecialized cases to reduce the number of messages at read-only\nparticipants. Sundial [ref]36 uses logical leases to\ndynamically reorder transactions to minimize conflicts, and caching to\nreduce remote accesses. This provides serializability but not\nstrictness, and lease renewals still require RPCs to read-only participants. Systems that use one-sided RDMA reads can avoid CPU processing at\nread-only participants. NAM-DB  uses RDMA reads during\nexecution and only takes write locks during commit, but it only\nprovides SI and not\nserializability. DrTM   provides\nserializability by using hardware transactional memory (HTM) to detect\nconflicting writes. FaRM uses an\nadditional validation phase with RDMA reads to detect conflicting\nwrites. With traditional 2PC, if a coordinator fails, the system becomes\nunavailable until it recovers. Spanner  replicates both\nparticipants and coordinators to provide availability. FaRM and\nRAMCloud 5 replicate data but not\ncoordinators: they recover coordinator state for untruncated\ntransactions from participants. In FaRM, transaction recovery is\nparallelized across all machines and cores and runs concurrently with\nnew application transactions. Calvin replicates transactional inputs\nand sequence numbers to all nodes in the system and re-executes\ntransactions issued since the last checkpoint. NAM-DB replicates\ninputs of committed transactions but does not checkpoint or replicate\ndata and must re-execute all past transactions sequentially on failure\nbefore the system becomes available. Opacity requires consistent read snapshots during execution which can\nbe provided with pessimistic concurrency control, or with timestamp\nordering. FaRMv1, DrTM, RAMcloud, Sundial, and FaSST 2 use\nOCC with per-object versions rather than global timestamps, and hence\ndo not provide opacity. NAM-DB uses timestamp vectors with one element\nper server, read from a timestamp server and cached and reused\nlocally. NAM-DB does not provide strictness. Clock-SI 3\nuses physical clocks at each server: remote reads must use RPCs that\nblock at the remote server until the local clock has passed the\ntransaction read timestamp. Clock-SI does not rely on a clock drift\nbound for correctness but needs physical clocks to be loosely\nsynchronized for performance. It also does not provide strictness. Spanner  and FaRMv2 use timestamp ordering based\non real time with explicit uncertainty computed according to\nMarzullo’s algorithm 7, and both provide opacity.\nUnlike Spanner, FaRMv2 does not\nrely on globally synchronized hardware such as atomic clocks or GPS,\nand it achieves two orders of magnitude lower uncertainty than Spanner\nwithin the data center by exploiting fast RDMA networks. Spanner uses\npessimistic concurrency control for serializability whereas FaRMv2 uses\nOCC and supports one-sided RDMA reads. Timestamp ordering and OCC have been used in many scale-up in-memory\nsystems, both software transactional memories (STMs) and in-memory\ndatabases. They typically use shared-memory primitives such as CAS to\ngenerate timestamps. TL2 0 and LSA\n 9 are some of the first STMs to use\ntimestamp ordering and OCC to provide strict serializability and\nopacity. TL2 is single-versioned and LSA is multi-versioned with\neager validation. Silo   uses OCC with\nread-set validation and without opacity for strictly serializable\ntransactions, and timestamp ordering based on epochs for stale\nsnapshot reads with opacity. Hekaton 4 uses OCC\nand timestamp ordering with both single- and multi-versioning. It\nalso supports pessimistic concurrency control.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: 2PC\nbut read locks must still be taken using messages.\nSinfonia  can piggyback reads on the 2PC messages in\nspecialized cases to reduce the number of messages at read-only\nparticipants. Sundial [ref]36 uses logical leases to\ndynamically reorder transactions to minimize conflicts, and caching to\nreduce remote accesses. This provides serializability but not\nstrictness, and lease renewals\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
