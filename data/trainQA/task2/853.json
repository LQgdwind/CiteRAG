Authors in  proposed a solution to this problem by equipping RNN cells with memory gates capable of capturing long-range dependencies. The two most widely known types of RNN cells that follow this paradigm of RNN architecture design are LSTMs , and GRUs [ref]19. \n‚àô‚àô\\bullet LSTM cells. An LSTM cell is equipped with three types of gates: the input gate, the forget gate and the output gate. The intuition behind using those cells is that each of which is responsible of controlling the amount of information that flows in the network as it runs on a particular string. The input gate is responsible of deciding on the amount of information the cell will capture about the input. The forget gate controls the amount of information the network will capture about the past. And the output gate controls the information that will be transmitted to the cell output. The general equations of an LSTM cell running on a symbol œÉùúé\\sigma are given as follows: where œïitalic-œï\\phi is the sigmoid activation function. \nAfter the update of the memory gates, their values are aggregated by a memory cell ctsubscriptùëêùë°c_{t}, and the hidden state vector flowing out of the LSTM cell is constructed using the following expressions: ‚àô‚àô\\bullet GRU cells. The architecture of the LSTM is highly complex, which makes it difficult to train efficiently. In an attempt to simplify the architecture, while still keeping the property of capturing long-range dependencies, authors in [ref]19 proposed a simplified version architecture of cells with memory gates, called GRU. This architecture uses only two gates, the reset gate denoted rtsubscriptùëüùë°r_{t}, and the update gate denoted ztsubscriptùëßùë°z_{t}. The general equations of a GRU cell is given as:\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: RNN cells with memory gates capable of capturing long-range dependencies.
