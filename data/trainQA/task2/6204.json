      "content": "Paper Title: An Experimental Investigation into the Evaluation of Explainability Methods\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn order to evaluate and compare the different XAI methods presented in Section 2.1, there are several types of metrics. We consider the four distinct families of such metrics that are applicable to our dataset, based on the property of explainability they aim to characterize, following the formalism proposed in Quantus . Faithfulness metrics measure how explanations follow the predictive behavior of the model. Seven of them are explored in this paper. Faithfulness Correlation  partitions the input image into subsets of features whose values are iteratively replaced by a baseline value (e.g., black pixel), and computes the Pearson correlation between the drop in classification probability and the sum of the relevance attribution of a subset. Similarly, Faithfulness Estimation [ref]3 calculates the Pearson correlation between the drop in classification probability and the feature relevance. Monotonicity Arya  measures the extent to which model performance increases (as measured by classification probability) when features of increasing significance are added, whereas Monotonicity Nguyen 3 follows the same idea, but measures the model performance increase through probability estimation uncertainty. Pixel Flipping [ref]5, also called Deletion metric by some authors    flips pixels with high relevance scores from the relevance heatmap and looks at the probability score evolution. Region Perturbation ) and Selectivity  both extend this methodology to areas of an image. Robustness metrics measure the stability of explanations to small input perturbations.\nThree of them are used in the following work. The Local Lipschitz Estimate  measures the consistency in explanations for adjacent samples. Max-Sensitivity and Avg-Sensitivity  quantify how explanations change when inputs are infinitesimally perturbed, through a Monte Carlo sampling-based approximation. Complexity metrics measure explanation conciseness. Three of them are compared in the experiments. Sparseness  uses the Gini index to measure whether only highly-attributed features are predictive of the model output. Complexity  measures the entropy of the fractional contributions to the total attribution, whereas Effective Complexity 3 looks at how many attributions exceed a certain threshold. Randomization metrics measure model deterioration as a function of parameter randomization. Two methods are explored. Model Parameter Randomization  quantifies the similarity between original explanations and explanations from sequential randomization of successive model layers. The Random Logit Test  computes the distance between the original explanation and the explanation obtained for another random class.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: (e.g., black pixel), and computes the Pearson correlation between the drop in classification probability and the sum of the relevance attribution of a subset.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
