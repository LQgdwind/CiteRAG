Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

In the recent decade, GCN has rapidly developed in deep graph clustering, crediting from its efficiency, simplicity, and generality  [ref]33   [ref]36   . For instance, Kipf and Welling  built the graph auto-encoder (GAE) and variational graph auto-encoder (VGAE) based on the variational architecture to learn the graph structure feature via a reconstruction constraint for graph structure preservation. Pan et al. [ref]22 presented the adversarially regularized graph auto-encoder (ARGA) to enhance the learning ability of the network by injecting an adversarial regularizer into the GAE framework. Wang et al.  improved GAE by introducing the graph attention network model  into its network architecture to encode the topological structure and node contents, called deep attentional embedded graph clustering (DAEGC).\n\nSalha et al.  designed a general framework (FastGAE) to scale graph AE and VAE to large graphs.\nMrabah et al.  presented a series of rethinking graph auto-encoder models (e.g., R-GMM-VGAE (RG-VGAE)) to consider the feature randomness and feature drift.\nSalha et al.  designed modularity-aware graph autoencoders (MA-GAE) to consider both the initial graph structure and modularity-based prior communities.\n\nZhang et al.  developed an embedding graph auto-encoder (EGAE) to use a relaxed K-means  to alternatively update GAE by gradient descent and perform clustering on inner-product distance space.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: In the recent decade, GCN has rapidly developed in deep graph clustering, crediting from its efficiency, simplicity, and generality  [ref]33   [ref]36   .
