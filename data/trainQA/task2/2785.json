      "content": "Paper Title: LawSum: A weakly supervised approach for Indian Legal Document Summarization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere is an increasing interest in using the advances of NLP and machine learning to benefit the legal community. Especially tasks like summarization, rhetorical role labelling and precedent retrieval are highly sought after by lawyers and paralegals. Recently the Supreme Court of India established an AI Department, which focuses on administrative efficiency and legal research 111https://vidhilegalpolicy.in/research/responsible-ai-for-the-indian-justice-system-a-strategy-paper/. It is clearly evident that AI integration in the Indian legal domain is no longer a futuristic endeavour. However, there are few publicly available large scale datasets of legal documents which is a necessity for any serious attempt at legal analytics research. In this work we try to mitigate that gap by proposing a new dataset consisting of over 10,000 judgements and corresponding summaries. While the data was already available in public domain, it was unstructured and noisy. We propose a pre-processing pipeline to curate the dataset and make it more usable. Unlike the most commonly used datasets, like news articles, Wikipedia pages or social media content, the structure of legal text is much more richer. Very long and complex sentences with several abbreviations, named entities and citations are common in legal documents. The also have a variety of distinct units depending on the nature of information. For instance, statures are divided into sections, articles and paragraphs, while regulations can be in form of sections and sub-sections. This is country specific and varies considerably. As a result even the most basic pre-processing steps, like sentence and word tokenization, or entity recognition, do not work out of the box for legal texts. Further the legal vocabulary is highly technical and distinct from regular text, and is full of abbreviations which makes sentence tokenization even more difficult. This is commonly observed across a lot of works   [ref]3. As a result, although several tens of thousands of these court judgements are publicly available, their utility is limited until they can be properly processed. This work aims to bridge that gap, by providing a collection of pre-processed and annotated documents, that can be used for several downstream tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest publicly available annotated corpora of Indian legal text. The proposed dataset consists of 10,764 supreme court judgements pre-processed by normalizing abbreviations, handling spell variations in named entities and tokenizing into sentences. Additionally, we identify other useful meta-information about the case, like date of judgement, involved parties, names of the judges, citations, etc. We also label each sentence with their rhetorical roles using the trained model made available by  and pseudo-relevance score which indicates whether or not that sentence is summary worthy. We demonstrate the use of this dataset in legal summarization using weakly supervised neural summarization. We conclude that neural approaches comfortably outperform strong baseline techniques. We also conclude that our approach, is effective on different time frames and different sub-domains. While we demonstrate the use on a summarization take, we believe the proposed dataset would be useful to several other tasks, including rhetorical role labelling, precedent retrieval and citation analysis as well. We plan to make the entire preprocessing and annotation pipeline publicly available and provide the required tools for loading and using this dataset. Some supplementary material including sample documents is made available in our github repository222https://github.com/mtkh0602/LegalSummarization.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: vocabulary is highly technical and distinct from regular text, and is full of abbreviations which makes sentence tokenization even more difficult.
