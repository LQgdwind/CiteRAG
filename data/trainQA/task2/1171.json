      "content": "Paper Title: Crowdsharing Wireless Energy Services\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe architecture of the system shall include the setup of four pillar components to implement an energy crowdsharing ecosystem. These components comprise the context of the environment, in-development technology, energy services management system, and market design. In what follows, we discuss these components in detail. Environment:\nWe envision a scenario where a number of people gather in different places within the downtown of any major smart city (See Fig.2A). The city residents will use their wearables to harvest energy . The smart buildings in the city such as a smart mall are split into geographical m‚Äãi‚Äãc‚Äãr‚Äão‚Äãc‚Äãe‚Äãl‚Äãl‚Äãsùëöùëñùëêùëüùëúùëêùëíùëôùëôùë†microcells where a microcell is a confined area such as cafes, movie theaters, etc. (see Fig.2B). There are several IoT devices and wearables in every microcell (see Fig.2C). The devices are assumed to be equipped with wireless energy transmitters and receivers. The IoT users might share their spare harvested energy to fulfill the requirements of nearby IoT devices. We identify four components in the crowdsharing environment: energy service, energy request, energy provider, and energy consumers. An energy service refers to the wireless transfer of energy among IoT devices. An energy request is an inquiry to receive an amount of energy through wireless means. An energy provider refers to an IoT device that may share energy. An energy consumer refers to an IoT device that requires energy. Wireless energy transfer technology:\nTwo energy technologies are required to implement the crowdsharing ecosystem, namely, energy harvesting and Over-the-Air wireless charging. Energy harvesters may be any wearable IoT device such as smart clothes, smart shirts, smart glasses, smartwatches, and smartphones. Energy harvesters have the ability to generate energy from natural resources such as body heat, solar, or kinetic activity . Existing wearable technology allows for the harvesting of several microwatts to a few watts . For instance, Solar Shirt uses flexible solar panels to harvest solar energy and stores it in a battery . Another example, PowerWalk kinetic energy harvester produces 10-12 watts on-the-move power . PowerWalk harvester can generate enough energy to charge up to four smartphones from an hour walk at a comfortable speed by its user [ref]25. Over-the-Air wireless charging technologies are the wireless energy transmitters and receivers that enable the wireless transfer of energy[ref]16. For example, ‚ÄúEnergous‚Äù created a technology to enable wireless charging up to a distance of 4.5 meters222www.energous.com. IoT devices need to be equipped with both, harvesting and wireless transmitting, energy technologies to be able to crowdshare energy services. Energy services management system\nThe energy service management system is responsible to manage the received energy services and requests. An energy service is defined by spatio-temporal preferences, the amount of available energy, the usage behavior, and the mobility model of the IoT owner (See Fig.3). Similarly, an energy request is defined by spatio-temporal preferences, the amount of requested energy, the usage behavior, and the mobility model of the IoT owner. A single energy request may not be fulfilled by one energy service due to the limited resources of IoT devices . In such cases, the system may compose multiple nearby energy services to one request or vise versa. Additionally, energy service providers and consumers may have different Spatio-temporal preferences. Therefore, the system should consider these preferences in matching and composing energy services and requests. Edge-based crowdsharing market\nThe crowdsharing market consists of energy providers and consumers in a microcell exchanging energy services (see Fig.2 C). Typically, an energy provider advertises their services to the energy services management system. Similarly, an energy consumer submits their energy request to the system. All local energy requests and advertisements are handled in the energy services management system at the edge e.g., a router associated with the microcell. Presumably, the management system sets a limit on the amount of requested energy by a consumer and uses a reward system to encourage providers to share energy. Rewards come in the form of stored credits to providers. The collected credits may be used later by the provider to increase the limit on the amount of requested energy when they are in the consumer role. Providers may also be a consumer and vice-versa. Providers receive rewards based on the amount of shared energy.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: kinetic energy harvester produces 10-12 watts on-the-move power .
