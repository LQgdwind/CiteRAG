      "content": "Paper Title: Cycle-Consistent Counterfactuals by Latent Transformations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCounterfactual Visual Explanation.\nWhile many of the previous approaches in CF explanation focus on categorical data   [ref]26 [ref]30 , in this paper, we mainly concentrate on generating CF examples in the vision domain. One of the early approaches on counterfactual visual explanation is  where CFs are generated by exhaustively searching for feature replacement between the latent feature of query and CF images.\nDue to the exhaustive search for individual samples, this method is slow in practice and the generated CF images are oftentimes off the data manifold. Later,  proposed SCOUT in which the regions that are exclusively informative for the query or the CF classes are discovered using attribution maps. However, this work does not compose CF images and the explanations are limited to highlighting regions over images. Unlike our work, the quality of the explanations on both aforementioned approaches relies on the choice of CF images from the training set and the heuristics used for finding them. [ref]7 proposes a contrastive explanation framework with the goal of finding minimal and sufficient input features in order to justify the prediction or finding minimal and sufficient perturbations in order to change the classifier’s prediction from the query class to a CF one (pertinent negative). Applying such perturbations is limited to gray-scale images. Although the authors suggested using an auto-encoder loss term to align CF examples to the distribution of the original data, the generated CF examples are adversarial and off the data manifold. The authors in  proposed to incorporate a prototype loss in the optimization of [ref]7, making the generated CFs more interpretable. These methods usually push the generated images off the manifold of the natural images and are limited to simple datasets. We have also observed that occasionally their optimizations do not converge. ExplainGAN  composes CF examples by filling a masked area over the input using a generator. Their design has an additional mask generator that needs to be trained jointly with the GAN. This is an impediment to plugging their method into existing GANs and extending the scope of their work to complicated datasets such as ImageNet. More recently,  decomposes image generation into parallel mechanisms (shape, texture, and background) and the distributions over the individual mechanisms are learned.\nTheir work generates high-resolution images, but\ndo not explain the decision of a classifier.\n  builds a graph over all the candidates in the training set and selected CFs from it to respect the underlying data distribution. This assumes a counterfactual example to the query image can be found among the training examples, which may not be always true.    use conditional VAE-based architectures to generate CFs. They solve individual optimizations for each sample. Similarly, many other previous CF explanation methods [ref]7    [ref]26 [ref]30 have separate optimizations for each query image. This obstructs their applications in real-time. In turn, our method learns a transformation from query to CF (and vice versa) over the course of training. At inference time, there is no optimization to be solved and our method is suitable for interactive use.  learns an unpaired image-to-image translation using cycle-consistent adversarial training. However, it has a different goal than ours. While our method can explain the decisions from any classifier, their method does not and instead uses two separate discriminators in order for the transformed images to lie in the target image class. Latent Manipulations in Generative Models\nIt has been shown that GANs learn interpretable directions in their latent space and meaningful changes can be obtained by steering in such directions.  shows that by linearly walking in the latent space of pretrained GANs, simple edits on images (e.g. zoom, rotation, etc.) can be learned.    aim to learn interpretable directions in the latent space of the GANs for attribute manipulation such as face editing (e.g. age, expressions, etc.). However, their manipulations do not explain the decision of an external classifier. Our method, on the other hand, explains any given classifier using the same GAN/VAE backbone.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: Counterfactual Visual Explanation.\nWhile many of the previous approaches in CF explanation focus on categorical data   [ref]26 [ref]30 , in this paper, we mainly concentrate on generating CF examples in the vision domain.
