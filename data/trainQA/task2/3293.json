      "content": "Paper Title: Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning Models: A Comparative Study on a Decade of Sinhala Language Facebook Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnderstanding or analyzing human emotions could be quite a complex task for a computer. Nonetheless, the numerous possible applications of this task has driven researchers around the globe to attempt to tackle it through varying perspectives, causing sentiment analysis to become a leading research area in natural language processing. A wide range of fields including movie reviews , product reviews , and political studies  benefit from advancements in this study area. However, a noteworthy gap in research on sentiment analysis, which is currently available, is the lack of interest in the perspective of the observer. Most research studies attempt to understand the sentiment expressed by the creator of the content. Only an extremely limited number of researchers such as Hui et al. [ref]4 have attempted to analyze the sentiment invoked by the content in an observer. While there are instances where the emotional reaction of the creator of content is more important than that of the observer, in certain instances such as political campaigns and brand management, understanding the reaction of the observer towards content could be quite important [ref]5. Facebook reactions, which could be considered as user sentiment annotations for Facebook posts, contain an immense potential in the field of sentiment analysis from the perspective of the observer, due to the convenient availability of massive amounts of data. [ref]6   [ref]5. Through this paper, we attempt to assess the applicability of Facebook data for sentiment analysis with respect to the Sinhala language. In contrast to English, for which numerous resources as well as previous research studies are readily available for sentiment analysis, the amount of research done in Sinhala in this arena remains highly unsatisfactory . The fact that most of the research conducted on the subject are outdated, incomplete, or access-restricted contribute heavily to this issue 0. To the best of our knowledge, the reigning state-of-the-art model for sentiment analysis in Sinhala is the Sencat tool 1. The name of the tool is an abbreviation for Sentiment Categorization. The developers of the tool have tested the performance of several well-known sentiment analysis models for a data set consisting of over 15,0591505915,059 Sinhala news comments 2. Using their results as a benchmark, we have tested the feasibility of Facebook data as a means for sentiment analysis in Sinhala. Here it should be noted that our reaction sentiment data set is significantly (ten times) larger than that of Senevirathne et al.. The reaction sentiment data set contains 150,000150000150,000 Facebook posts with 235,660235660235,660 sentences as discussed in Section III-A. Following the procedure adopted by Senevirathne et al. 2, a comparison between different models: RNN 3 , LSTM 4, GRU 5, Bidirectional LSTM 6, combinations of baseline models and a convolutional neural network 3, 2 and 3 layer stacked LSTM 7, 2 and 3 layer stacked Bidirectional LSTM 7, HAHNN 8, capsule-A 9, and capsule-B 9, is conducted to select the model with the best performance. Additionally, two machine learning models introduced in the work of Jayawickrama et al. [ref]5; Core Reaction Set Model and Star Rating Model are also tested. Results of this study indicate that the highest performance metrics are achieved by the 3-Layer Stacked BiLSTM model, with accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score values of 83.5983.5983.59, 83.5983.5983.59, 85.5985.5985.59, and 84.5884.5884.58 respectively. These are significantly higher than the best results obtained by Senevirathne et al. 2. Furthermore, in contrast to the results obtained by Senevirathne et al. where the best values of different performance metrics were scattered among different models, the consistent high performance of the 3-Layer Stacked BiLSTM model across all metrics provides further reassurance regarding the ability of the model to predict the sentiments included in the reaction sentiment data set used in this study. The utilization of a larger data set is a major reason for this consistency as well as the significant increase in performance scores of all models tested.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: the perspective of the observer.
