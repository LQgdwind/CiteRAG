      "content": "Paper Title: Snappability and singularity-distance of pin-jointed body-bar frameworks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn two recent conference articles [ref]11 [ref]12 the author already started to investigate this topic.\nIn [ref]11 a first attempt towards the computation of the snappability of bar-joint frameworks was done\nbased on the definition of Cauchy/Engineering strain.\nIn [ref]12 the author extended the approach to\nframeworks composed of bars and triangular panels. For this it was necessary to switch to the concept of\nGreen-Lagrange strain, as the elastic strain energy of triangular panels using Cauchy/Engineering strain is not invariant under rotations.\nIn the articles [ref]11 [ref]12 the author restricted to planar examples;\nnamely the trivial case of a triangular framework and the more sophisticated example of a pinned 3-legged planar\nparallel manipulator.\nIn the paper at hand, we render the approach of [ref]12 more precisely and generalize it to polygonal panels and polyhedra, respectively, and study some\nspatial frameworks, which already appear in existing literature on this topic reviewed next. By the well-known technique of deaveraging (e.g.¬†, [13, page 1604] and ) snapping frameworks can be constructed in any dimension ‚Ñùdsuperscript‚Ñùùëë{\\mathbb{R}}^{d}.\nMoreover, for snapping bipartite frameworks in ‚Ñùdsuperscript‚Ñùùëë{\\mathbb{R}}^{d} an explicit result in terms of confocal hyperquadrics is known\n(cf.¬†[3, page 112] under consideration of ).\nMost results are known for the dimension d=3ùëë3d=3, which are as follows:\nThere is a series of papers by Walter Wunderlich on snapping spatial structures\n(octahedra , closed 4R loops , antiprisms ,\nicosahedra  , dodecahedra ),\nwhich are reviewed in . In this context also the paper \nshould be cited, where buckling polyhedral surfaces and Siamese dipyramids are introduced.\nSnapping structures are also related to so-called model flexors222Mathematically these structures do not posses a\ncontinuous flexibility but due to free bendings without visible distortions of materials their physical models flex.\n(cf.¬†) as in some cases the model flexibility can be reasoned by the snapping through different realizations.\nExamples for this phenomenon are the so-called four-horn  or the already mentioned Siamese dipyramid.\nThe latter are studied in more detail in , especially how minor relative variations on the edge lengths\nproduce significant relative variations in the spatial shape. The authors of  also suggested estimates to quantify these\nintrinsic and extrinsic variations.\nRecently, a more general approach for estimating these kinds of quantities for arbitrary bar-joint frameworks was presented in ,\nwhere inter alia also the Siamese dipyramid was studied as an example. Beside the above reviewed mathematical studies on snapping frameworks, there are also the following application driven approaches.\nTheir snapping behavior is studied by numerical simulations based on (a) finite element methods   \nor (b) force method approaches like  or a generalized displacement control method   , theoretical approaches based on the variation of the total potential energy    0. In contrast, our approach only relies on the total strain energy of the structure (i.e.¬†no a priori assumptions\non external loads have to be made) paving the way for the definition of the snappability, which only depends on the intrinsic framework geometry.\nFinally it should be noted, that a short review on approaches towards the computation of singular-distances\nis given in the section dealing with Stewart-Gough (SG) manipulators, which brings us straight to the outline of the paper. After introducing notations and summarizing fundamentals of rigidity theory in Section 1.2, we present the underlying physical model of deformation in\nSection 2, which is used for building up the pseudometric on the space of intrinsic framework geometries\nin Section 3. Based on some theoretical considerations, we discuss the computation of the snappability and the singularity-distance in Sections 4\nand 5, respectively, and demonstrate the presented methods in two examples.\nAfterward we adopt our theoretical results for the singularity-distance computation of SG platforms in Section 6, which is also closed by a practical example.\nFinally we conclude the paper in Section 7.\nMoreover, in Appendix A the Siamese dipyramid and the four-horn are studied, and the obtained results are compared with existing literature.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: In two recent conference articles [ref]11 [ref]12 the author already started to investigate this topic.\nIn [ref]11 a first attempt towards the computation of the snappability of bar-joint frameworks was done\nbased on the definition\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
