A small 2D seismic image that consists of 400 traces is used for demonstration. Each trace is 1.2 s in duration (300 time samples), with 444 ms sampling rate. The seismic image is shown in Fig. 4(a). As can be observed, the data is non-stationary, reflectors are closely spaced and not sufficiently separated and reflectors amplitudes are unbalanced. Assuming an initial Ricker wavelet with ω0=80​πsubscript𝜔080𝜋\\omega_{0}=80\\pi (404040Hz), we estimated Q=200𝑄200Q=200 as described in [ref]36, and derived the set of time-variant pulses {gσ,n}subscript𝑔𝜎𝑛\\{g_{\\sigma,n}\\} (see ,Appendix D). The estimated reflectivity image and the corresponding reconstructed seismic image using RFN-ITA, at the first iteration and at the second (and final) iteration are depicted in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, respectively. For the first iteration we set β1=1subscript𝛽11\\beta_{1}=1 and τ1=0.4subscript𝜏10.4\\tau_{1}=0.4. For the second iteration we set β2=0.7subscript𝛽20.7\\beta_{2}=0.7, τ2=1subscript𝜏21\\tau_{2}=1 and αr=0.3subscript𝛼r0.3\\alpha_{\\mathrm{r}}=0.3. The normalization window is a Gaussian window of length Lh=9subscript𝐿h9L_{\\mathrm{h}}=9 with σh=2subscript𝜎h2\\sigma_{\\mathrm{h}}=2. Since the ground truth is unknown, in order to quantify the estimation success, we calculate the reconstructed seismic image from the recovered reflectivity, i.e, 𝐘^=𝐆​𝐗^^𝐘𝐆^𝐗\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}=\\mathbf{G}\\hat{\\mathbf{X}}, depicted in Fig. 4(c). We assess its correspondence with the given data by the correlation coefficient, where 𝐘cssubscript𝐘cs\\mathbf{Y}_{\\mathrm{cs}} and 𝐘^cssubscript^𝐘cs\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}_{\\mathrm{cs}} are column-stack vectors of the observed seismic image and the reconstructed seismic image respectively. In terms of the correlation coefficient between the predicted data to the observed data, the first iteration achieved ρ𝐘,𝐘^1=0.77subscriptsuperscript𝜌1𝐘^𝐘0.77\\rho^{1}_{\\mathbf{Y},\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}}=0.77. While the second iteration achieved ρ𝐘,𝐘^=0.89subscript𝜌𝐘^𝐘0.89\\rho_{\\mathbf{Y},\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}}=0.89. Increasing the number of iterations and/or decreasing βlsubscript𝛽𝑙\\beta_{l} or τlsubscript𝜏𝑙\\tau_{l} can increase the correlation score, on the expense of the reflectors localization resolution, i.e., these parameters settings can produce smeared results of decreased sparsity, which is usually unwanted. As can be seen, reflectors curves, in the reflectivity estimated in the first iteration, are a bit thick due to high mutual coherence values and insufficient spikes separation. Also, some reflectors are missing. Yet, this image is very close to the final one. Using our method most relevant information is recovered in the first iteration. Figures 6-8 compare the proposed methods results to ISTA results with β=0.14𝛽0.14\\beta=0.14 and a score of ρ𝐘,𝐘^=0.91subscript𝜌𝐘^𝐘0.91\\rho_{\\mathbf{Y},\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}}=0.91, and to the multichannel time-variant method in  with a score of ρ𝐘,𝐘^=0.92subscript𝜌𝐘^𝐘0.92\\rho_{\\mathbf{Y},\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}}=0.92. As can be seen, a slightly better score does not necessarily indicate a visually enhanced reflectivity. As can be observed in the predicted reflectivity produced by ISTA, some layers are incomplete, and it appears that some spikes are annihilated. Here, ISTA required an average of 1087 iterations per trace. In this example, RFN-ITA reduces the number of required iterations by a factor of 500. Figure 9 presents one seismic trace at in-line offset 7.5 km, and the corresponding estimated 1D reflectivity by ISTA and by RFN-ITA. As can be visually observed, the data is of inherent ambiguity, and the estimated results differ mostly in amplitude, and share relatively close supports. Throughout our experiments with ISTA, we observed that decreasing β=cλ𝛽𝑐𝜆\\beta=\\frac{c}{\\lambda}, which decreases the sparsity of the solution, comes at the expense of significantly increasing the number of iterations. Also, as can be seen in the presented examples, ISTA performance is terms of the visual quality of the image, deteriorates with a time-variant dictionary, taking a Q factor into account. Moreover, in practice, ISTA number of iterations increases dramatically with the length of the signal. Another drawback is that the constant cλ𝑐𝜆\\frac{c}{\\lambda} depends on the maximum eigenvalue of 𝐃T​𝐃superscript𝐃𝑇𝐃\\mathbf{D}^{T}\\mathbf{D} that is harder to compute at larger scales . RFN does not suffer from this complications because an approximate solution is reached within a limited number of iterations, where each data stripe is analyzed locally, yet the signal is updated globally without significant increase in computational complexity. It is important to emphasize that most real data super resolution problems, and specifically seismic inversion, do not comply with the theoretical bounds constraints (e.g.  ) for separation, amplitude balance and noise. Therefore, applying classical algorithms to real data applications is not expected to result in perfect recovery. In  and  we show that under the separation condition in a noise-free environment we can perfectly recover the reflectivity in an attenuating environment, providing that we can estimate Q𝑄Q. However, when working with real data there is no guarantee that the true reflectors are sufficiently separated nor that Q is constant or estimated correctly. Also, we observe that the resolution of the estimation results is highly sensitive to user-dependent parameters. Overall, real data is of inherent uncertainty. Since the proposed method requires only 2-4 iterations per trace, its implementation entails significantly low computational complexity. Solving using MATLAB, the processing time of the above data set of 300×401300401300\\times 401 on a standard CPU Intel(R)Core(TM)i7-7820HQ@2.90GHz is 122 ms, that is, about 305 μ𝜇\\mathrm{\\mu}s per trace. Whereas the processing time of the same data set for ISTA is 13.13 seconds, that is, 32.8 ms per trace. For the 3D time-variant multichannel method the processing time is 16.06 minutes, and 2.41 seconds per trace. Which means, the proposed method is about 100 times faster than ISTA. This in turn assures us of a promising potential of the suggested method to be incorporated in the future in large scale real-time data processing applications.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: separated and reflectors amplitudes are unbalanced.
