      "content": "Paper Title: Quantum algorithms to simulate quadratic classical Hamiltonians and optimal control\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nQuantum algorithms have been designed for several important problems such as cryptography, quantum Hamiltonian simulation, condensed matter physics, semi-definite programming and optimization. Important primitives have been developed such as quantum phase estimation, quantum walks, Fourier transforms, Hamiltonian simulation and quantum linear systems algorithms (QLSA). The latter two have a close relationship and common techniques can be used in implementing them. In fact, it was shown in [ref]1  that one can include quantum walks, phase estimation and Hamiltonian simulation to show that they can all be cast as the problem of implementing functions of Hamiltonians. This has recently been generalized to a large set of non-Hermitian matrices in . Hamiltonian simulation essentially solves the Schr√∂dinger equation, which is a linear ordinary differential equation (ODE). Efficient techniques for this have been developed in a series of papers      with current techniques having an optimal dependence on the parameters. Hamiltonian simulation algorithms for time-dependent Hamiltonians have been developed in   . The HHL algorithm to solve linear systems of equations was described in the seminal paper . This algorithm has been generalized in subsequent works (see  for a review), where the matrix representing the linear system can be non-Hermitian, rectangular and even singular. The dependence on various parameters such as the condition number and error has been improved in   . This algorithm has been applied to problems in topological data analysis  , machine learning  and more recently in solving differential equations (described in detail below). An important subroutine developed in the process is a protocol to load classical data called block-encoding. This method takes classical data such as matrix entries of sparse and structured matrices and creates a unitary that represents the matrix in the quantum algorithm. Block-encoding has been used in earlier quantum algorithms such as  and recently many explicit methods have been developed [ref]1  0 1 2. We use these techniques in this paper as well. An approach to solve differential equations using the linear systems algorithms was given in 3. This was made into a high-precision algorithm in 4 using truncated Taylor series to approximate exp‚Å°(A‚Äãt)ùê¥ùë°\\exp(At). These algorithms have been generalized to allow for arbitrary time-independent matrices in 5. An important quantity used in this work is the norm of the exponential of the matrix i.e., ‚Äñexp‚Å°(A‚Äãt)‚Äñnormùê¥ùë°\\|\\exp(At)\\|. It was shown that as long as this norm of the exponential of the matrix Aùê¥A over the time domain of interest (denoted C‚Äã(A)ùê∂ùê¥C(A) in 5) is polynomially bounded, one can bound the condition number of the resulting linear system. Using a stronger condition that the log-norm of Aùê¥A is negative, this has been extended to time-dependent matrices in 6 7. More recently, an approach to reduce time-dependent differential equations to Hamiltonian simulation is given in 8 9 where optimal dependence on parameters is achieved assuming Aùê¥A has a negative log-norm. It is interesting to note that for one of the applications considered here (of damped coupled oscillators), the matrix involved in the differential equation does not have a negative log-norm and needs the weaker condition of bounded C‚Äã(A)ùê∂ùê¥C(A). A general theory of quantum algorithms for linear ODEs is given in 0 where a fast-forwarding theorem similar to the one in Hamiltonian simulation is proved. Recently, there has been work on using Hamiltonian simulation algorithms to solve general ODEs. In 1, the authors reduce a general class of partial differential equations to Hamiltonian simulation. Many of the above algorithms essentially solve a quantum problem i.e., given an initial state as a quantum state, and sparse access oracles, the goal is to create a quantum state that encodes the normalized solution state. However, in practical applications, one usually has access to classical data that must be encoded into the quantum state and at the end of the simulation we would also need to extract classical data out of the quantum state. Many quantum algorithms are designed within a specific mathematical framework and applying them to problems of practical interest is not always straightforward. The comprehensive review 2 covers the above mentioned algorithms and many more from the point of view of end-to-end applications. In considering such end-to-end applications, one needs proof or strong evidence of three different aspects namely, quantum efficiency, classical hardness and practical utility. The recent work on estimating the kinetic energy of coupled oscillators 3 is an example of such an end-to-end application. In that paper, the authors consider a problem of practical interest and show that quantum algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation can be used to provide evidence of a quantum advantage. The specific problem considered is that of estimating kinetic energy of a network of coupled oscillators. The problem of estimating the kinetic energy (or more precisely, the decision version where one has to decide whether the kinetic energy is above some value or below another with the promise that the gap is a constant independent of the number of qubits) has been shown to be ùñ°ùñ∞ùñØùñ°ùñ∞ùñØ{\\mathsf{BQP}} complete and therefore, one does not expect an efficient classical algorithm unless ùñ°ùñ∞ùñØ=ùñ°ùñØùñØùñ°ùñ∞ùñØùñ°ùñØùñØ{\\mathsf{BQP}}={\\mathsf{BPP}}. While this problem has a quantum advantage, an important caveat is that the oscillators are assumed to be ideal and there is no damping in the system. Going beyond this idealized setting i.e., simulating oscillators in the presence of damping would increase the practical utility of the quantum algorithm. In this work, we show that even in the presence of damping in coupled oscillators (or dissipation in other systems that can be modeled by the similar equations), there exist efficient quantum algorithms to approximate the kinetic energy of the system. One might wonder if the presence of damping makes the problem of approximating the kinetic energy of an oscillator network amenable to classical algorithms i.e., it may be that the problem of kinetic energy estimation of damped coupled oscillators is in ùñ°ùñØùñØùñ°ùñØùñØ{\\mathsf{BPP}}. We show that this is unlikely to be the case. Specifically, we show that even in the presence of damping, approximating the kinetic energy of an arbitrary sparse oscillator network is ùñ°ùñ∞ùñØùñ°ùñ∞ùñØ{\\mathsf{BQP}} hard (provided that the strength of damping is inverse polynomial in the number of qubits). This means that even under the realistic conditions, this problem has a quantum advantage. In order to construct a quantum algorithm for this problem, we cast this problem as ordinary differential equation (ODE) and use the recently developed quantum algorithm for ODEs 5. In order to apply quantum algorithms for linear ODEs of the form xÀô=A‚Äãx+bÀôùë•ùê¥ùë•ùëè\\dot{x}=Ax+b, one needs to overcome certain obstacles. As pointed out in 3, if the quantum algorithm for a linear ODE requires that Aùê¥A has a negative log-norm, then one cannot get an efficient algorithm. The algorithm in 5 requires that the norm of the exponential of Aùê¥A is bounded and works even when the log-norm of Aùê¥A is positive. However, this encoding means that the norm of the exponential of Aùê¥A is proportional to the condition number of the matrix VùëâV, which encodes the spring constants. The algorithm of 3 did not depend on the condition number of VùëâV, but rather only the norm of VùëâV. This is the price one has to pay to be able to simulate damping (which is not amenable to Hamiltonian simulation). Fortunately, the work of 3 also showed the the hardest cases of the coupled oscillator problem (i.e., the instances which are ùñ°ùñ∞ùñØùñ°ùñ∞ùñØ{\\mathsf{BQP}} hard) have a constant condition number for VùëâV. This also carries over for the case with damping. We also show that in a different basis, we can design a quantum algorithm to estimate the kinetic energy with a slightly worse dependence on error, but no dependence on the condition number of Vùëâ\\sqrt{V}. Therefore, depending on the condition number of Vùëâ\\sqrt{V}, one can choose one of these bases. These algorithms are applicable to systems other than just damped forced coupled oscillators. For the specific case of damped and forced coupled oscillators, we show that one can remove the dependence on the condition number of VùëâV and the worse dependence on error by using the specific structure of the problem (by leveraging the results for block-encoding in 3). Quantum algorithms for nonlinear differential equations have been constructed in 4 5 5 6 and quantum algorithms for partial differential equations (PDEs) in 7 8 9. For nonlinear ODEs, quantum algorithms such as 4 5 can be applied to very general types of nonlinear ODEs (with a polynomial nonlinearity). However, these algorithms can only handle a small amount of nonlinearity i.e., they require R<1ùëÖ1R<1, where RùëÖR is (roughly) the ratio of the strength of the nonlinearity to the strength of dissipation. In 4, it was also shown that no quantum algorithm can efficiently solve nonlinear ODEs for R>2ùëÖ2R>\\sqrt{2}. This was improved to R‚â•1ùëÖ1R\\geq 1 in 0 matching the algorithm. While this is true for arbitrary nonlinear differential equations, one might hope that for specific nonlinear ODEs, higher nonlinearity may be efficiently solvable using quantum algorithms. However, there are currently no quantum algorithms that can solve nonlinear ODEs for R>1ùëÖ1R>1. In this paper, we remedy this situation and show that a specific nonlinear differential equation called the Riccati equation used in optimal control can be solved for R=polylog‚Å°(N)ùëÖpolylogùëÅR=\\operatorname{polylog}(N), where NùëÅN is the dimension of the matrices involved in the equation. The solution to the Riccati equation, which is ubiquitous in classical optimal control, has practical applications such as the stability of magnetohydrodynamics 1. The solution to the Riccati equation can also be used to solve another problem in optimal control known as the linear quadratic regulator problem (LQR). This problem is about finding a controller that can regulate a process such as in an airplane by minimizing a cost function. It turns out that this can be cast as a Riccati equation by viewing it as a special case of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. The HJB equation is a non-linear partial differential equation that generalizes the Hamilton-Jacobi equation from the theory of calculus of variations. It gives the necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality of a control problem. In its generality, this problem can be highly nonlinear. However, in the case of the LQR problem, it becomes tractable using quantum algorithms. The differential equations used in classical mechanical systems described above and those in optimal control are linked via a theory known as Calculus of Variations 2 3 as mentioned above. This theory has two equivalent approaches - a Lagrangian formalism and a Hamiltonian formalism. We use the Hamiltonian formulation of this theory since it gives us linear ODEs. We can then apply quantum algorithms for linear ODEs to solve the above problems of simulating classical mechanical systems under realistic conditions and of solving the Riccati and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation (for the LQG). Interestingly, in the above applications, we need the linear ODE solvers that are based on linear systems rather then Hamiltonian simulation. This is because we need to extract classical information from the unnormalized final state (which can be done via the so-called history state that keeps track of the solution at various times). Recent approaches via Hamitonian simulation directly produce the normalized final state and it would be interesting to see if they can be modified for these applications. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section¬†2, we give a basic background in calculus of variations, the Hamiltonian formalism, optimal control, Riccati equation and the HJB equation. Then in Section¬†3, we present some background and definitions needed on oracle access and block encoding as well as results on quantum linear systems algorithms that we will need later on. In Section¬†4, we give our quantum algorithm to estimate the kinetic energy of damped coupled oscillators and other realistic mechanical systems. We also give a proof of the ùñ°ùñ∞ùñØùñ°ùñ∞ùñØ{\\mathsf{BQP}} hardness of additive approximation of the kinetic energy. Then in Section¬†5, we give quantum algorithms to solve the vector and matrix versions of the Riccati equation and its application to the LQR problem. Finally, in Section¬†6, we present our conclusions and open questions.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Hamiltonian simulation and quantum linear systems algorithms (QLSA).
