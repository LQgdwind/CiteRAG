A particularly hard task in causal machine learning is so-called causal discovery, the task of learning the causal graph (including causal directions) from passive observations\n  . Given how many problems modern deep learning (DL) has solved via providing computers with massive data , one may wonder whether appropriate DL architectures could learn how to learn causal structure from data\nafter feeding them with an abundance\nof datasets with known ground truth. This approach, however, fails alone due to the scarcity of such datasets.222Even benchmarking the elementary problem of cause-effect inference from bivariate data is often done via the Tübingen dataset  containing currently 106 pairs only [ref]7. A lot odf studies are therefore heavily based on simulated data .\nThis, in turn, raises the question: why is there so little benchmarking data with commonly agreed causal structure?\nThe common answer is that in many real world systems interventions are impossible, costly, or unethical.\n(e.g. moving the moon to show that its position causes the solar eclipse is costly at least).\nAlthough this is a valid explanation, it blurs the question whether the required interventions are well-defined in the first place.\nWhile defining interventions on the moon seems unproblematic, it will be significantly harder to agree on a definition for interventions on\nthe Gross National Product (GNP)’, for instance, as a basis for discussing the impact of GNP on employment. –\nWhich of all hypothetical political instruments (whether feasible or not) influencing GNP should be considered interventions on GNP?\nBefore going into this discussion, we first recall the description of interventions in the framework of graphical models.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: to the scarcity of such datasets.222Even benchmarking the elementary problem of cause-effect inference from bivariate data is often done via the Tübingen dataset  containing currently 106 pairs only [ref]7.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
