      "content": "Paper Title: Downlink Power Allocation in Massive MIMO via Deep Learning: Adversarial Attacks and Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning (DL) has become extremely popular due to its ability to efficiently learn end-to-end strategies from raw inputs and owing to the significant recent increase in availability of computational power . DL-based techniques have been applied widely in machine learning (ML) applications such as computer vision, natural language processing, medical diagnosis, and market trading.\nThe success of DL in different domains and the need for more complex models to characterize future wireless networks   , has stimulated a surge of interest to adopt DL in wireless communication applications, for example, power allocation in massive multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) [ref]6, channel estimation and signal detection , channel decoding , indoor user positioning , indoor activities sensing and classification using radio signals , modulation classification [ref]11  [ref]13  , and the design of end-to-end communication systems  . It is important that DL models are reliable and robust to security threats before being deployed in the physical world, and this is a particular concern when DL is applied to wireless communications. In spite of promising performance, however, it has been found that DL-based systems can be vulnerable and exposed to new security related issues   0 1 2.\nThe different classes of security threat models that are of interest are inference attacks 1, adversarial attacks [ref]11, and poisoning attacks 2. In this paper, our focus is only on adversarial attacks against models built with deep neural networks (DNNs). In adversarial attacks, a well-crafted adversarial perturbation is added to the input of the DNN that causes erroneous prediction (e.g., misclassification) [ref]11  [ref]13   . The nature of the attack against DNN depends on the adversary’s knowledge (that is, the attacker’s information) and is categorized into white-box and black-box attacks. In white-box attacks, the adversary has access to all information including the trained model and the model parameters 3. Although this type of attack may not be realistic, it helps to evaluate vulnerabilities and robustness against the models for the worst-case attack. In black-box attacks, the adversary has limited information or no access to the trained model 3. In the literature, there has been a significant amount of work on adversarial attacks in DL-based wireless communication systems mainly focusing on classification based applications (e.g., radio signal classification [ref]11  [ref]13  ), while the regression-based applications (e.g., resource allocation [ref]6) are overlooked. In this paper, we take a first step towards filling this gap by investigating different types of adversarial attacks and then a defensive technique against the DNN model built for optimal power allocation in the downlink of a massive MIMO network. To enable reproducibility of the results presented in this paper, we have considered the openly available dataset and the DNN models of [ref]6. Recently, in the context of wireless application, only 4 used a regression-based DNN model to allocate the power in the downlink scenario for orthogonal subcarriers and then showed that by launching adversarial attacks, that is by manipulating the inputs to the DNN, it is possible to reduce the minimum rate among all users. Different from 4, in this paper, for our considered regression problem in a wireless network setting, the focus is to investigate different adversarial attacks to generate adversarial examples in terms of attacker success rate. Then, we analyze the defense technique through adversarial training for robustness against these attacks. More specifically, our main contributions in this paper are as follows: The most commonly used adversarial attacks in computer vision and image classification applications are the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) [ref]11, the momentum iterative FGSM 5, and the projected gradient descent method (PGDM) 6. We extend these attacks to generate adversarial examples for the regression problem in the context of a massive MIMO system. In particular, we consider the problem of optimal power allocation using the product signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) maximization strategy in the downlink scenario using maximal-ratio (MR) and multicell-minimum mean square error (M-MMSE) precoding schemes. We investigate both white-box and black-box attacks against DNN models. The aim of the adversarial attack is to create an infeasible solution by the DNN. We benchmark our proposed adversarial attacks and show that PGDM attack is the most successful in fooling the DNN. We further demonstrate by assuming that the adversary having access to the input of the DNN model, i.e., we perform a white-box attack, the adversary can cause up to 85% of infeasible solutions to be generated by the proposed DNN models of [ref]6. Considering a worst-case scenario, we show that adversarial training is not only a very efficient method to improve the robustness of DNN models against adversarial attacks, but also to boost the robustness of networks against natural unwanted disturbances such as random noise. Finally, we use the property of transferability to characterize black-box attacks and analyze the effectiveness of this property for MR and M-MMSE precoding schemes, i.e., we study the adversary success rate of black-box attacks.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: future wireless networks   , has stimulated a surge of interest to adopt DL in wireless communication applications, for example, power allocation in massive multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) [ref]6, channel estimation and signal detection , channel decoding , indoor user positioning , indoor activities sensing and classification using radio signals , modulation classification [ref]11\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
