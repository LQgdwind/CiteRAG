      "content": "Paper Title: CTVIS: Consistent Training for Online Video Instance Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVideo instance segmentation is a joint vision task involving classifying, segmenting, and tracking interested instances across videos 5. It is critical in many video-based applications, such as video surveillance, video editing, autonomous driving, augmented reality, etc. Current mainstream VIS methods  5  4  [ref]12    can be categorized into offline and online groups. The former      segments and classifies all video frames simultaneously and makes the instance association in a single step. The latter  4 5 [ref]12 takes as input a video in a frame-by-frame fashion, detecting and segmenting objects per frame while associating instances across time. In this paper, we focus on the online branch. Online methods are typically built upon image-level instance segmentation models   .\nSeveral works 5   utilize convolution-based instance segmentation models to segment each frame and associate instances by incorporating heuristic clues, such as mask-overlapping ratios and the similarity of appearance.\nHowever, these hand-designed approaches always fail to tackle complicated cases, which typically include severe target occlusion, deformation and re-identification.\nRecently, encouraged by the thriving of Transformer-based  architectures in object detection and segmentation   , a bunch of query-based online frameworks have been proposed 4 [ref]12, which take advantage of the temporal consistency of query embeddings and associate instances by linking corresponding query embeddings frame by frame. These advances boost the performance of online VIS models, which become de-facto leading VIS performance on most benchmarks (especially on challenging ones such as OVIS ). Though the importance of the discrimination of query embeddings to associate instances has been nominated 4 [ref]12, less research attention has been paid in this vein.\nMinVIS [ref]12 simply trains a single-frame segmentor, and the quality of its query embedding is hampered by the segmentor originally proposed for image-based instance segmentation.\nAs shown in Figure 1(a), recent methods 4  merely supervise instance embedding generation between two temporally adjacent frames with thein contrastive losses computed upon contrastive items.\nSpecifically, for each instance at the key frame, if the same instance appears on the reference frame, the embedding of it is selected as the anchor embedding 𝐯𝐯\\mathbf{v}. Meanwhile, its embedding in the reference frame is taken as the positive embedding 𝐤+superscript𝐤\\mathbf{k}^{+}, and the embeddings of other instances in the reference frame are used as the negative embeddings 𝐤−superscript𝐤\\mathbf{k}^{-}. In convention the set {𝐯,𝐤+,𝐤−}𝐯superscript𝐤superscript𝐤\\{\\mathbf{v},\\mathbf{k}^{+},\\mathbf{k}^{-}\\} is called contrastive item (CI).\nThis training paradigm is inconsistent with the inference (shown in the right of Figure 1), as it overlooks the interaction with the long-term memory bank to construct contrastive items and lacks modelling for long videos. To bridge this gap, we propose CTVIS (as shown in Figure 1(b)), which intuitively brings in useful tactics from inference, including memory bank, momentum-averaged (MA) embedding and noise training.\nSpecifically, CTVIS samples several frames from a long video to form one training sample. Then we process each sample frame by frame, which can produce abundant CIs. Moreover, we sample momentum-averaged (MA) embeddings from the memory bank to create positive and negative embeddings. Furthermore, we introduce noise training for VIS, incorporating a few noises into the memory bank updating procedure to simulate the tracking failure scenarios during the inference process. We also consider the availability of large-scale training samples, which are especially expensive to annotate and maintain for VIS. To tackle this, we implement and test several goal-oriented augmentation methods (to align with the distribution of real data) to produce pseudo-videos. Different from the COCO joint training, we only use pseudo-videos to train VIS models. Without bells and whistles, CTVIS outperforms the state-of-the-art by large margins on all benchmark datasets, including YTVIS19 5, YTVIS22 5, and OVIS . Even trained with pseudo-videos only, CTVIS surpasses fully supervised VIS models 4  . Here we summarize our key contributions as We propose a simple yet effective training framework (CTVIS) for online VIS. CTVIS promotes the discriminative ability of the instance embedding by\ninteracting with long-term memory banks to build CIs,\nand by introducing noise into the memory bank updating procedure. We propose to create pseudo-VIS training samples by augmenting still images and their mask annotations. CTVIS models trained with pseudo-data only surpass their fully-supervised opponents already, which suggests that it is a desirable choice, especially when dense temporal mask annotations are limited. CTVIS achieves impressive performance on three public datasets. Meanwhile, extensive ablation validates the method’s effectiveness.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: across videos 5.
