      "content": "Paper Title: Multilingual Music Genre Embeddings for Effective Cross-Lingual Music Item Annotation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMusic genres are a key characteristic of music items  .\nIn music streaming services, user profiles and interests can be expressed through music genres, tracks and artists can be grouped in genre-specific collections, and content-based recommender systems frequently exploit music genres as item tags.\nHowever, music genres are difficult to infer due to their subjective nature. Based on their music preferences, musicological knowledge and culture, people inconsistently associate genres to music items   [ref]5.\nThus, annotating music items with genres for providing personalized recommendation and retrieval is challenging. Acknowledging this subjectivity and the absence of a unique genre definition, recent works [ref]6  framed the music genre annotation as a translation.\nMore precisely, given music items annotated with music genres originating from multiple source tag systems such as folksonomies, editorial vocabularies or taxonomies, the goal was to predict the equivalent music genres within a target tag system.\nIn a supervised setup, the translation relied on a parallel corpus of music items jointly annotated with music genres from the source and target tag systems [ref]6 .\nIn an unsupervised setup, when the parallel corpus was unavailable, a solution centered on taxonomy alignment was proposed [ref]6. However, the translation of music genres between multilingual sources remains unaddressed when a parallel corpus is unavailable.\nThe only past unsupervised solution [ref]6 relied on heuristics specific to the English language, making its adaptation to multilingual tags a challenge.\nHere, we propose to perform the unsupervised cross-lingual translation by leveraging multilingual music genre embeddings.\nAlso, our method to learn these embeddings could be straightforwardly applied to new languages. The proposed method is further summarised.\nFirst, by acknowledging the compositional nature of music genres (i.e. the meaning of multi-word music genres can be often derived from the meaning of each word), we learn music genre embeddings by applying compositionality functions to pre-trained word vectors   0.\nMoreover, as these pre-trained vectors are often trained on language-specific text, we need to align them across languages 1 2. Second, we fit the obtained music genre embeddings into the music domain.\nThe embeddings learnt on general-language corpora could sometimes be semantically ambiguous.\nFor instance, house is closer to building than to music and jazz is more similar to folk than to bebop in fastText .\nTo tackle this problem, we create a music genre knowledge graph from multilingual DBpedia 3 that contains multilingual genres as nodes and exhibits different types of music genre relations through its edges.\nThen, we use retrofitting 4 to encode the relational knowledge from the semantic graph in the embeddings.\nIn this work, we modify the original retrofitting algorithm 4 to distinguish between two types of relations: equivalence (e.g. dnb and drum’n’bass) and other types of relatedness such as sub-genres, derivative genres, fusion genres, stylistic origins.\nBesides, we use retrofitting to learn embeddings for music genres that do not exist in the pretrained embedding vocabulary by exploiting their graph relations (e.g. ethnotronica and chillstep are not in the pretrained fastText vocabulary). We evaluate the proposed method in two experiments.\nFirst, we collect a new parallel corpus of music items annotated with music genres in three languages (English, French and Spanish) and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for unsupervised cross-lingual music genre translation.\nSecond, we show that using the embeddings learnt with our method outperforms the previous baseline [ref]6 in a music genre translation task between multiple English-language tag systems.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: music genres are difficult to infer due to their subjective nature. Based on their music preferences, musicological knowledge and culture, people inconsistently associate genres to music items   [ref]5.\nThus, annotating music items with genres for providing personalized recommendation and retrieval is challenging. Acknowledging this subjectivity and the absence of a unique genre definition,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
