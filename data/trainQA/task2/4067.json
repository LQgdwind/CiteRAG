Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Anomaly Detection with Test Time Augmentation and Consistency Evaluation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDataset settings are diverse in anomaly detection. We mainly consider the advanced ImageNet [ref]9 settings, including full set settings and two kinds of subset settings. We also verify on CIFAR  settings and put the results in Appendix I due to limited space. In the full-size ImageNet setting, the whole validation set is treated as the in-distribution test set. Since the ImageNet training set already contains all-embracing natural scenery, the corresponding out-distribution dataset is chosen to be a publicly available artificial image dataset from Kaggle111https://www.kaggle.com/alamson/safebooru. We use the first 50000 figures since the ImageNet validation dataset is of the same size. Some examples of the dataset are depicted in Figure 7 in Appendix B. We will call this setting ImageNet vs. Artificial. Additionally, two sources of subset settings are included. The ImageNet-30 subset setting is used in relevant researches [ref]17 . The corresponding out-distribution datasets includes CUB-200 , Stanford Dogs , Oxford Pets [ref]30, Places-365  with small images (256*256) validation set, Caltech-256 , and\nDescribable Textures Dataset (DTD) . Beyond that, we also validate our algorithm on several public ImageNet subset combinations introduced by other works   and public sources222https://github.com/MadryLab/robustness.These additional three ImageNet subsets are Living 9, Geirhos 16, and Mixed 10. The out-distribution categories are randomly selected from the complement set. The detailed subset hierarchy and configuration are shown in Appendix B. In total, we consider four subset settings. We notice the performance of anomaly detection is highly affected by the trained classifiers. So we train networks with three random seeds per setting and report the mean and variance. The training details are in Appendix H.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: Dataset settings are diverse in anomaly detection.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
