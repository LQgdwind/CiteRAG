The\nI/O-based attacks demonstrated that\nlogic locking techniques having a key-size of kùëòk does not necessarily\nimply k-bit security.\nThe actual security level depends on the mathematical primitive and the scheme construction¬†.\nAlthough PSLL techniques are mathematically sound (assuming that DIPs are chosen uniformly at random and are non-repeated, I/O-based attacks require 2ksuperscript2ùëò2^{k} queries to an oracle) in recovering a kùëòk-bit key), the hardware implementation\nof these techniques leave structural vulnerabilities\nthat attackers exploit to recover the secret key.\nHence, there is a requirement for a security framework that\ninforms a designer regarding the lower-bound security-level attained by the hardware implementation of PSLL techniques.\nThis leads to our second research challenge.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: as evidenced next.\nFor instance, the bypass attack¬† demonstrated vulnerabilities in SARLock¬† and Anti-SAT¬† but could not challenge the security of SFLL techniques¬† .\nThe FALL¬† and SFLL-hd-unlocked¬†[ref]16 attacks were successful in recovering the secret key from variants of\nSFLL-HD but did not apply to SFLL-flex¬† and SFLL-rem¬†.\nThe attacks proposed in¬† broke the security guarantees of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
