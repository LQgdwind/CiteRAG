      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamic Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network for Traffic Prediction: Benchmark and Solution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the rapid development of urbanization, transportation system in the city is under great pressure when facing growing populations and vehicles. Fortunately, advances in data intelligence and urban computing have made it possible to collect massive amounts of traffic data and conduct analysis. The traffic data can be crowd flow data or traffic speed data, which not only is an important indicator reflecting the state of transportation system, but also is used for prediction tasks of future traffic conditions.\nAmong these tasks, traffic prediction acts as the cornerstone of intelligent transportation system (ITS) with the aim of understanding and developing an optimal transportation system and minimal traffic congestions. By predicting future traffic,\nit provides reference for urban planning and traffic management, so as to reduce congestion and improve traffic efficiency, and provide early warning for public safety emergency management. Accurate traffic prediction can also help travelers plan and change their routes, thus improving their quality of life. Traffic prediction originates from single variant time series forecasting with many traditional statistic-based methods, e.g., history average (HA), vector auto-regression (VAR), support vector regression (SVR) and auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). However, most of these methods need to satisfy the stationarity assumption for each time series. Besides, there are not many parameters in these methods, most of the which need to be designed by experts rather than mined from data. Thus, traditional methods are restricted by their ability for capturing spatio-temporal dependency. In deep learning, temporal correlations can be captured by RNN, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or attention. Meanwhile, spatial dependencies can be modeled by CNN, Graph Neural Network (GNN) or attention.\nAt first, grid-based graph is used to build spatial topology and then fed into CNNs    , but fail to deal with non-euclidean data. The appearance of graph neural network makes the deep learning model able to tackle non-euclidean data and the road distance between nodes (sensors or road segments) are often used to calculate the weights of edges [ref]5     0 1 2 3. Besides, the self-adaptive adjacency matrix is proposed to preserve hidden spatial dependencies 2 4 5 3 6. However, it is tough for the static graph to adjust itself dynamically and capture complex dynamic spatial dependencies. CNN can also be used to capture temporal correlations  7 8 9 2 4 efficiently at the expense of flexibility due to its implicit temporal modeling, which makes the time steps invisible. Self-attention is effective to capture global dependency  but not good at short-range prediction. RNN is powerful to capture sequential correlations with relatively higher time consuming 0 1 2  3 3 [ref]5  5. Since traffic data shows strong dynamic correlations in the spatial and temporal dimension,\nit is crucial to model dynamic and nonlinear spatio-temporal correlations for accurate traffic prediction.\nThe spatial correlations between different locations are highly dynamic, which is determined by real-time traffic conditions and the topology of traffic network. Meanwhile, the temporal dependencies are also complex due to the mixture of non-linear changes and periodicity. Due to the complex spatio-temporal correlations,\nwe need to address the following challenges: The dynamic characteristics of traffic graph topology need to be further modeled. The pre-defined adjacency matrix and adaptive adjacency matrix are both static with the change of time, which is not enough to reflect the dynamic characteristics of road network topology in reality. Static distance based graph and dynamic attribute based graph describe the topology of traffic network from distinct perspectives, thus integrating them can give model a wider range of horizon for capturing spatial dependencies.\nHowever, most works fail to fuse them together while maintaining efficiency and avoiding over-smoothing. Although widely used in time series prediction, the training speed of RNN and its variants are restricted by the inner recurrent operations, which blocks the applications of architectures like sequence-to-sequence in traffic prediction task. The number of proposed models and traffic datasets is increasing with rapid growing of traffic prediction field, where the models are evaluated on different datasets with corresponding experimental settings. This makes it tricky to make a fair comparison among models, impeding the development of the field. In this work, we propose a hyper-network to generate dynamic adjacency matrix step by step adaptively, where the message passing of dynamic node features improve the effectiveness of graph generation. Then we integrate the static graph and dynamic graph together in graph convolution module, which improve the performance significantly. To improve the efficiency of the seq2seq architecture, we employ a general training strategy for RNNs. For more challenging prediction task, we publish a representative congestion-related traffic dataset. Finally, We propose an open-source benchemark based on three public datasets and 15 baselines for fair comparison and further research. The main contributions of our paper are summarized as follows: We propose a GNN and RNN based model, where the dynamic adjacency matrix is designed to be generated from a hyper-network step by step synchronize with the iteration of RNN. The dynamic graph is incorporated with the pre-defined graph and skip connection to describe the dynamic characteristics of road networks more effectively, enhancing the performance of prediction. We employ a general training method for RNN based models, which not only improves performance effectively and efficiently, but also sharply decreases training time consumption, in order to overcome the shortcomings of RNNs in efficiency and resource occupancy. We conduct extensive experiments based on three publicly available datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model on the traffic prediction task. Compared with 15 baselines in benchmark, results demonstrate that our model can reduce the error of prediction significantly and achieve state-of-the-art prediction accuracy. We publish a new real-life congestion-related dataset111The source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/Traffic-Benchmark. and conduct sufficient comparative experiments on three public datasets to get fair comparison results for various complex models and derive a reproducible standardized benchmark. The benchmark is composed of comparative prediction performance of 15 representative methods on 3 datasets, which can provide reference value for researchers to facilitate further research on related problems. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We first review the related works and propose a comprehensive classification in Section 2. Then the traffic prediction problem is formulated in Section 3. Motivated by the challenges, we introduce the details of our solutions in Section 4. After that, we evaluate our model by three real-world traffic datasets and derive the traffic benchmark in Section 5, where the ablation studies and parameter studies are conducted. Finally, we conclude our paper in Section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: graph neural network makes the deep learning model able to tackle non-euclidean data and the road distance between nodes (sensors or road segments) are often used to calculate the weights of edges [ref]5     0 1 2 3.
