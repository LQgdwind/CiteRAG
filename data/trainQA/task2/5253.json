      "content": "Paper Title: Real-Time Neural Light Field on Mobile Devices\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNeRF. NeRF [ref]33 represents the scene implicitly with an MLP network FΘsubscript𝐹ΘF_{\\Theta}, which maps the 555D coordinates (spatial location (x,y,z)𝑥𝑦𝑧(x,y,z) and view direction (θ,ϕ)𝜃italic-ϕ(\\theta,\\phi)) to a 111D volume density (opacity, denoted as σ𝜎\\sigma here) and 333D radiance (denoted as 𝐜𝐜\\mathbf{c}) such that FΘ:ℝ5↦ℝ4:subscript𝐹Θmaps-tosuperscriptℝ5superscriptℝ4F_{\\Theta}:\\mathbb{R}^{5}\\mapsto\\mathbb{R}^{4}. Each pixel of an image is associated with a camera ray. To predict the color C^^𝐶\\hat{C} of a pixel, the NeRF method samples many points (denoted as N𝑁N below) along the camera ray and accumulates the radiance 𝐜𝐜\\mathbf{c} of all these points via alpha compositing  [ref]31 [ref]33: where 𝐫𝐫\\mathbf{r} means the camera ray; 𝐫​(ti)=𝐨+ti​𝐝𝐫subscript𝑡𝑖𝐨subscript𝑡𝑖𝐝\\mathbf{r}(t_{i})=\\mathbf{o}+t_{i}\\mathbf{d} represents the location of a point on the ray with origin 𝐨𝐨\\mathbf{o} and direction 𝐝𝐝\\mathbf{d}; tisubscript𝑡𝑖t_{i} is the Euclidean distance, i.e., a scalar, of the point away from the origin; and δi=ti+1−tisubscript𝛿𝑖subscript𝑡𝑖1subscript𝑡𝑖\\delta_{i}=t_{i+1}-t_{i} refers to the distance between two adjacent sampled points. A stratified sampling approach is employed in NeRF [ref]33 to sample the tisubscript𝑡𝑖t_{i} in Eqn. 1. To enrich the input information, the position and direction coordinates are encoded by positional encoding [ref]39, which maps a scalar (ℝℝ\\mathbb{R}) to a higher dimensional space (ℝ2​L+1superscriptℝ2𝐿1\\mathbb{R}^{2L+1}) through cosine and sine functions, where L𝐿L (a predefined constant) stands for the frequency order (in the original NeRF [ref]33, L=10𝐿10L=10 for positional coordinates and L=4𝐿4L=4 for direction coordinates). The whole formulation and training of NeRF are straightforward. One critical problem preventing fast inference in NeRF is that the N𝑁N, i.e., the number of sampled points, in Eqn. 1 is pretty large (256256256 in the original NeRF paper due to their two-stage coarse-to-fine design). Therefore, the rendering computation for even a single pixel is prohibitively heavy. The solution proposed by R2L  is distilling the NeRF representation to NeLF. R2L. Essentially, a NeLF function maps the oriented ray to RGB.\nTo enrich the input information, R2L proposes a new ray representation – they also sample points along the ray just like NeRF [ref]33 does; but differently, they concatenate the points to one vector, which is used as the ray representation and fed into a neural network to learn the RGB. Similar to NeRF, positional encoding [ref]39 is also adopted in R2L to map each scalar coordinate to a high dimensional space. During training, the points are randomly (by a uniform distribution) sampled; during testing, the points are fixed. The output of the R2L model is directly RGB, no density learned, and there is no extra alpha-compositing step, which makes R2L much faster than NeRF in rendering. One downside of the NeLF framework is, as shown in R2L , the NeLF representation is much harder to learn than NeRF; so as a remedy, R2L proposes an 888888-layer deep ResMLP (residual MLP) architecture (much deeper than the network of NeRF) to serve as the mapping function. R2L has two stages in training. In the first stage, they use a pre-trained NeRF model as a teacher to synthesize excessive (origin, direction, RGB) triplets as pseudo data; and then fed the pseudo data to train the deep ResMLP. This stage can make the R2L model achieve comparable performance to the teacher NeRF model. In the second stage, they finetune the R2L network from the first stage on the original data – this step can further boost the rendering quality as shown in the R2L work .\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: NeRF.
