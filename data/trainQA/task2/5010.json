      "content": "Paper Title: Map matching queries on realistic input graphs under the Fréchet distance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Fréchet distance is a popular similarity measure for trajectories. To compute the Fréchet distance between a pair of trajectories of complexity n𝑛n, Alt and Godau [ref]6 provide an O​(n2​log⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛2𝑛O(n^{2}\\log n) time algorithm, which Buchin et al.  improve to an O​(n2​log⁡n​(log⁡log⁡n)3/2)𝑂superscript𝑛2𝑛superscript𝑛32O(n^{2}\\sqrt{\\log n}(\\log\\log n)^{3/2}) algorithm. Conditioned on the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH), for all δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0, Bringmann [ref]9 shows an Ω​(n2−δ)Ωsuperscript𝑛2𝛿\\Omega(n^{2-\\delta}) lower bound for computing the Fréchet distance in two or more dimensions. Buchin et al. [ref]14 generalise the lower bound to one or more dimensions. Variants of Problem 1 have been considered. Seybold  and Chambers et al.  consider finding the shortest map matching paths in geometric graphs. Chen et al.  study map matching under the weak Fréchet distance, whereas Wylie and Zhu  and Fu et al.  consider map matching under the discrete Fréchet distance. Wei et al.  and Chen et al.  combine the Fréchet distance approach with a Hidden Markov Model approach to obtain a hybrid algorithm. A problem closely related to Problem 2 is to preprocess a trajectory for Fréchet distance queries. Driemel and Har-Peled  preprocess a trajectory Z𝑍Z of complexity n𝑛n in O​(n​log3⁡n)𝑂𝑛superscript3𝑛O(n\\log^{3}n) time and O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n) space, so that given a query trajectory Q𝑄Q with complexity k𝑘k, and a query subtrajectory Z​[u,v]𝑍𝑢𝑣Z[u,v] where u𝑢u and v𝑣v are points on Z𝑍Z, one can return in O​(k2​log⁡n​log⁡(k​log⁡n))𝑂superscript𝑘2𝑛𝑘𝑛O(k^{2}\\log n\\log(k\\log n)) time a constant factor approximation of the Fréchet distance between Z​[u,v]𝑍𝑢𝑣Z[u,v] and Q𝑄Q. In this paper we show that, even with polynomial time preprocessing time on the trajectory Z𝑍Z, one cannot hope to answer Fréchet distance queries in truly subquadratic time, unless SETH fails. As such, special cases have been considered. For k=2𝑘2k=2, one can answer (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-approximate  or exact    queries in polylogarithmic query time, by constructing a data structure of subquadratic size. Discrete Fréchet distance queries for small values of k𝑘k have also been studied   . Gudmundsson and Smid  preprocess a c𝑐c-packed tree for Fréchet distance queries. We regard this to be one of the most relevant results to our work. Given a c𝑐c-packed tree T𝑇T, and a positive real number ΔΔ\\Delta, the authors show how to construct a data structure of size O​(c​n)𝑂𝑐𝑛O(cn) in O​(n​log2⁡n+c​n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛superscript2𝑛𝑐𝑛𝑛O(n\\log^{2}n+cn\\log n) preprocessing time, so that given a polygonal curve Q𝑄Q with k𝑘k vertices, one can decide in O​(c4​k​log2⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑐4𝑘superscript2𝑛O(c^{4}k\\log^{2}n) time whether there exists a path π∈T𝜋𝑇\\pi\\in T so that dF​(π,Q)≤3.001⋅Δsubscript𝑑𝐹𝜋𝑄⋅3.001Δd_{F}(\\pi,Q)\\leq 3.001\\cdot\\Delta, or that dF​(π,Q)>Δsubscript𝑑𝐹𝜋𝑄Δd_{F}(\\pi,Q)>\\Delta for all paths π∈T𝜋𝑇\\pi\\in T, where dF​(⋅,⋅)subscript𝑑𝐹⋅⋅d_{F}(\\cdot,\\cdot) denotes the Fréchet distance. The authors assume that the edges of T𝑇T and Q𝑄Q have length Ω​(Δ)ΩΔ\\Omega(\\Delta). Since ΔΔ\\Delta is fixed at preprocessing time, it is unclear whether it is possible to minimise the Fréchet distance to solve Problem 2. Related structures that have received considerable attention include range searching and approximate nearest neighbour searching under the Fréchet distance       0 2 6 .\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: The Fréchet distance is a popular similarity measure for trajectories.
