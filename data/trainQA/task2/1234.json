      "content": "Paper Title: A Boundary Regression Model for Nested Named Entity Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNamed entity (NE) recognition is often modeled as a sequence labelling task, where a sequence model (e.g., Conditional Random Field (CRF)  or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [ref]15) is adopted to output a maximized labelling sequence. Because sequence models are effective to encode semantic dependencies of a sentence and constraint the structure of a labelling sequence, they have achieved a great success for NE recognition. However, sequence models assume a flattened structure for each input sentence. They are not effective to find nested NEs in a sentence. For example, “Guizhou University” is an organization NE, where “Guizhou” is also a NE indicating the location of the university. In this case, outputting a label sequence cannot resolve the nested structure. Due to the reason that nested structures are effective to represent semantic relationships of entities (e.g., affiliation, ownership, hyponymy), they are widely used in natural languages. For example, in the GENIA corpus and ACE corpus, the nesting ratio is 35.27% and 33.90%, respectively  . Span classification is an effective method to recognize nested NEs. It generates NE spans from a sentence in a process known as region proposal, then outputs a class label for each possible NE span. It has two advantages to support nested NE recognition. First, nested NE structure can be resolved as separated NE spans. Second, the classification can be implemented on a span representation, which encode global semantic relevant to a predicated NE. At current, span classification has achieved a great attention. However, many span classification models enumerate all possible NE spans in a sentence, which suffer from a high computing complexity and the data unbalance problem. Therefore, many related work only verify possible NE spans upto a certain length (e.g., [ref]48  [ref]47), or filter unlikely NE spans with predefined thresholds  or NE boundary cues  . For example, Chen et al.  verify NE spans combined from detected NE boundaries. Lin et al.  apply a point network to recognize span boundaries relevant to the head word of a NE mention. The main problem for span classification is that, due to the reason of computation complexity and data imbalance, it is difficult to enumerate all NE candidates in a sentence. If a NE is not enumerated in the region proposal process, it cannot be recognized by span classification. In our study, we found that there are some similarities between named entity recognition and object detection. For example, named entities in a sentence and objects in an image have similar spatial structures, e.g., flattened, nested and discontinuous . The task to recognize them can be modelled as a span (or region) classification problem. The main difference between named entities and objects is that the former uses a discrete position representations. Because deep neural network has the ability to transform multimodal signals into an abstract semantic space , in this paper, we represent positions of NEs as continuous values. Then, a regression operation can be introduced to regress boundaries of NEs for locating NEs in a sentence the same way as detecting object detection in an image. In this paper, motivated by techniques developed in object detection of computer vision, we generate abstract NE representations from sentence in a region proposal process. The generated NE representations is named as textual bounding boxes (or bounding boxes in short). Every bounding box is annotated with three parameters to indicate its entity type, start position and length in a sentence. Then, instead of predicting the class of a NE candidate, a boundary regression operation is applied to refine its spatial location in a sentence. Based on boundary regression, we design a boundary regression (BR) model to support nested NE recognition. It is a multiobjective learning framework composed of a basic network module, a region proposal module, a classification module and a regression module. The basic network transforms each sentence into abstraction representation. Then, a region proposal network is applied to generate bounding boxes. They are fed into the classification module fro class prediction and regression module for boundary regression. In the training process, in addition to maximizing the confidence scores of a NE, a linear layer is used to minimizes its location offset relative to a true NE. The BR model simultaneously predicts the classification score of a NE candidate and refine its spatial location in a sentence. The contributions of this paper include the following: Positions of NEs in a sentence are represented as continuous values to support NE boundary regression. It has the advantage to resolve nested NEs and locate NEs with boundary regression operation. A bounding box based multiobjective learning model is designed to support nested NE recognition. It supports simultaneously predicts the class probability and refines spatial locations of NEs in a sentence. The structure of this paper is organized as follows. Before discussing the details of this model, our motivation is first discussed in Section II. Section III presents the definition of boundary regression and the architecture of the BR model. Experiments are conducted in Section IV, where several issues about the BR model are discussed. Section V introduce related work. Section VI gives the conclusion of this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: Named entity (NE) recognition is often modeled as a sequence labelling task, where a sequence model (e.g., Conditional Random Field (CRF)  or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [ref]15) is adopted to output a maximized labelling sequence.
