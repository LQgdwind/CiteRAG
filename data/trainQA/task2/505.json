      "content": "Paper Title: Explaining Local, Global, And Higher-Order Interactions In Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate T-NID‚Äôs ability to rank interactions on the suite of synthetic functions\nproposed by  [ref]26  [ref]45,\nwhich were ‚Äúdesigned to have a mixture of pairwise and higher-order interactions, with varying order, strength, nonlinearity, and overlap‚Äù [ref]45.\nThese are available to see in the Appendix and in Table 1 of [ref]45. Pairwise Interactions ‚ÄÉFor pairwise interaction effects (see Table 1), we report or reproduce the experiments of [ref]45 verbatim, measuring AUC scores between predicted interaction rankings and ground truths. A pair xi,xjsubscriptùë•ùëñsubscriptùë•ùëóx_{i},x_{j}\nis considered an interaction either by itself or when it is a subset of a higher-order interaction,\nas in [ref]26 . Included for comparison are benchmarks from various statistical and machine learning methods   [ref]44 [ref]45 . NID [ref]45 uses an interpretation of the weights from a standard MLP to detect interactions, whereas NID + MLP-M uses an MLP with additional univariate networks summed at the output to discourage modeling of main effects and false spurious interactions.\nGLIDER [ref]44 is a recent cross-partial method that induces higher-order differentiability with Softplus. In contrast, T-NID uses only a standard MLP and GELU activations. GELU demonstrably performs better.\nUnlike NID,\nwe found\nno\nbenefit from MLP-M or sparsity regularization.\nDespite the simpler architecture, T-NID is immune to some of the deficits of NID and NID + MLP-M.\nT-NID is able to distinguish main effects and spurious interactions in F2subscriptùêπ2F_{2} and F4subscriptùêπ4F_{4}, and\nwhile NID + MLP-M modeled spurious main effects in the {8,9,10}8910\\{8,9,10\\} interaction of F6subscriptùêπ6F_{6} and GLIDER appears to struggle with this as well, T-NID recognizes it as an interaction. All around, T-NID performs on par or better than NID and GLIDER at computing pairwise statistical interaction effects on these synthetic tasks. Higher-Order Interactions ‚ÄÉFor higher-order interactions, we do not report AUC scores against the full ground truth, as that would grow combinatorially more expensive with higher orders. Since NID also extracts interactions one order at a time, we compare the AUC scores of NID and T-NID one order at a time and use ground truths from the union of their discovered interactions. That way, they can be assessed relative to one another, albeit not universally. In addition to the results reported in Table 2, we tested many variants of architectures and report results with NID + MLP-M in the Appendix. In all cases, the relative results were largely the same, with T-NID achieving the highest scores, except less so at 444-way interactions when equipped with its own main effects network (MLP-M). Since any-order NID tends to find supersets much better than subsets, at 333-way interactions, NID misses nearly all present interactions, whereas T-NID fares relatively well. Along with recent works , we have shown that cross derivatives are a promising metric for interaction attribution in DNNs.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: We evaluate T-NID‚Äôs ability to rank interactions on the suite of synthetic functions\nproposed by  [ref]26  [ref]45,\nwhich were ‚Äúdesigned to have a mixture of pairwise and higher-order interactions, with varying order, strength, nonlinearity, and overlap‚Äù [ref]45.\nThese are available to see in the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
