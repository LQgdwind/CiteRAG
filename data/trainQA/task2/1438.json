Al-Fuqaha [ref]20 introduces the concept of cognitive smart city where IoT and artificial intelligence are merged in a three-level model with different requirements. In relation to the communication level, the basic approach assumes a fog cloud computing (fog-CC) communication without considering any specific IoT massive traffic requirement. In fact, the proposal assumes that the aggregation with edge processing reduces the required bandwidth for fog-CC communication to a minimum. Rathore  explores the issue of big data analytics for smart cities. The paper proposes an edge-based aggregation and processing strategy for raw data. Processed data is forwarded through gateways to smart city applications using Internet and assuming bandwidth reduction at edge-level. Martins  discusses the potential benefits and impacts of how some technological enablers, like software-defined networking [ref]12 and machine learning [ref]36, are integrated and aim at cognitive management . IoT data edge-processed aggregation, network communication and service deployments towards an efficient overall smart city solution are discussed and the relevance of intelligent communication resource provisioning and deployment are highlighted. Resource provisioning from the perspective of IoT services deployment for smart city is considered by Santos . The paper proposes a container-based micro-services approach, using Kubernetes, for service deployment that aims to off-load IoT processing with fog computing. In relation to this paper discussion, the proposal endorses fog processing offloading using a edge-computed approach and does not consider the network communication resource provisioning necessary to distribute the outcomes of the edge processing. Edge intelligence for service deployment is discussed in Zhang . The proposed solutions defines a framework capable to support the deployment of AI algorithms like RL on common edge aggregators like Raspberry. The approach assumed is to enable the execution of AI algorithms in the edge for those applications that require near real time edge processing like voice recognition and on-board autonomous vehicles processing. Machine learning in communication networks is broadly addressed by Cote  and Boutaba et al in . Intelligent network communication resources are considered by Zhao . The work presents a smart routing solution for crowdsourcing data with mobile edge computing (MEC) in smart cities using reinforcement learning (RL). The solution defines routes, differently from ours that optimizes the bandwidth allocated for IoT flow flushing. In summary, this work advances on existing studies that propose service provisioning by adding an intelligent component for the allocation of communication resources between IoT data aggregators and IoT data consumers. From the architectural point of view, this work adopts an edge-based processing approach coupled with an efficient communication resource allocation for massive IoT data transfers.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: Architectural and system-wide studies about IoT massive data processing and data flow in smart cities are presented in Al-Fuqaha [ref]20, Rathore  and Martins .
