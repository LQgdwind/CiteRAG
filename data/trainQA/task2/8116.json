As game playing is a natural application for CoEAs, there have been a large number of empirical investigations into this topic, of which we can only list a small fraction here. In terms of impartial combinatorial games, Rosin and Belew  investigated the effect of using features such as fitness sharing and archives in CoEAs optimising a 4-pile instance of Nim, noting that Nim was a difficult coevolutionary problem despite lending itself to simple crossover-friendly representations. Additionally, Jákowski, Krawiec, and Wieloch  observed in relation to experiments on SubtractionNim2003superscriptsubscriptSubtractionNim2003\\textsc{SubtractionNim}_{200}^{3} that intransitivity presents a strong challenge for CoEAs. Non-impartial (yet still almost symmetric) combinatorial games studied in the context of coevolution include Tic-Tac-Toe  , Backgammon , Othello   , Senet , Checkers , Chess  , and Go . More general game-playing applications include Pong , Bomberman , Poker , Resistance , as well as games invented to emulate real-world applications such as cyber security and defense  [ref]41. For a general survey, see . Runtime analysis of coevolutionary algorithms. Until recently, the only existing coevolutionary runtime analysis result, due to Jansen and Wiegand , applied to a cooperative coevolutionary algorithm, which uses multiple populations to collectively solve traditional optimisation problems. The first runtime analysis applicable to competitive coevolution was established by Lehre , who showed that a population-based CoEA which selects using a pairwise dominance relation is able to approximate the Nash equilibrium of instances of a game called Bilinear in expected polynomial time. A key theoretical insight into algorithm design from the same paper was the identification of an error threshold for mutation rate, above which no CoEA can efficiently optimise Bilinear. Further runtime analysis for CoEAs on Bilinear has concerned the roles played by fitness aggregation methods  and archives  in algorithm behaviour. Inspired by promising applications of CoEAs for optimising binary test-based problems, Lin and Lehre  provided runtime analysis establishing the benefit of using a CoEA over a traditional EA for optimising a benchmark problem called Diagonal. In , Benford and Lehre considered the importance of maintaining a diverse set of opponents when coevolving game strategies, showing that any CoEA able to retain only one individual between generations cannot efficiently find optimal strategies on a certain class of symmetric zero-sum games, even though with high probability a coevolutionary EDA finds an optimal strategy in polynomial time.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: , and Go .
