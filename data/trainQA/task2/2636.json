      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamic Meta-theorems for Distance and Matching\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne plausible approach to maintain distance or matching in a graph is to give\ndynamically evolving non-zero circulations. Even for planar graphs, this is\na tough order because giving non-zero circulations requires a\ndynamic planar embedding algorithm in \\DynFO\\DynFO\\DynFO, which is not known. Further,\nsmall changes in the input can lead to large changes in the embedding.\nThus, any algorithm that gives non-zero circulation to planar graphs like\n  and uses Logspace algorithms like undirected reachability\n cannot be used even if it was made dynamic.\nThis induces us to side-step maintaining non-zero circulation weights.\n Instead, we use a result from  to convert the given static circulation\nto dynamic isolating weights. Notice that  yields a black box recipe\nto produce isolating weights of quasipolynomial magnitude, which we label\nas FGT-weights in the following way.\nGiven a bipartite graph G𝐺G, one first considers a non-zero circulation\nof exponential magnitude viz. w0​(e):e↦2e:subscript𝑤0𝑒maps-to𝑒superscript2𝑒w_{0}(e):e\\mapsto 2^{e}. Next, consider a\nlist of ℓ=O​(log⁡n)ℓ𝑂𝑛\\ell=O(\\log{n}) primes p→=(p1,…,pℓ)→𝑝subscript𝑝1…subscript𝑝ℓ\\vec{p}=(p_{1},\\ldots,p_{\\ell})\nwhich yield a weight function wp→​(e)subscript𝑤→𝑝𝑒w_{\\vec{p}}(e). This is defined\nby taking the ℓℓ\\ell weight functions w0modpimodulosubscript𝑤0subscript𝑝𝑖w_{0}\\bmod{p_{i}} for i∈{1,…,ℓ}𝑖1…ℓi\\in\\{1,\\ldots,\\ell\\}\nand concatenating them with shifting the weights to the higher-order bits appropriately, that is:\nwp→​(e)=⟨w0​(e)modp1,…,w0​(e)modpℓ⟩subscript𝑤→𝑝𝑒modulosubscript𝑤0𝑒subscript𝑝1…modulosubscript𝑤0𝑒subscript𝑝ℓw_{\\vec{p}}(e)=\\left<w_{0}(e)\\bmod{p_{1}},\\ldots,w_{0}(e)\\bmod{p_{\\ell}}\\right>.\nThis is so that there is no overflow from the i𝑖i-th field to the\n(i−1)𝑖1(i-1)-th for any i∈{2,…,ℓ}𝑖2…ℓi\\in\\{2,\\ldots,\\ell\\}. Suppose we start with a graph with static weights ensuring non-zero\ncirculation. In a step, some edges are inserted or deleted.\nThe graph after deletion is a subgraph of the original graph; hence the\nnon-zero circulation remains non-zero after a deletion111If we merely had isolating\nweights, this would not necessarily preserve isolation., but we have to do more\nin the case of insertions. We aim to give the newly inserted edges FGT-weights\nin the higher-order bits while giving weight 00 to all the original edges in\nG𝐺G again in the higher-order bits. Thus the weight of all perfect matchings\nthat survive the deletions in a step remains unchanged. Moreover, if none such\nsurvive but new perfect matchings are introduced (due to insertion of edges)\nthe lightest of them is determined solely by the weights of the newly\nintroduced edges. In this case, our modification of the existential proof\nfrom  ensures that the minimum weight perfect matching is unique. Notice that the FGT-recipe applied to a graph with polylog (N=logO​(1)⁡n𝑁superscript𝑂1𝑛N=\\log^{O(1)}{n}) edges yields quasipolylogarithmically (NlogO​(1)⁡Nsuperscript𝑁superscript𝑂1𝑁N^{\\log^{O(1)}{N}}) large weights which are therefore still subpolynomial\n(2(log⁡log⁡n)O​(1)=2o​(log⁡n)=no​(1)superscript2superscript𝑛𝑂1superscript2𝑜𝑛superscript𝑛𝑜12^{(\\log{\\log{n}})^{O(1)}}=2^{o(\\log{n})}=n^{o(1)}).\nThus the weights remain polynomially bounded when shifted to accommodate for the old weights. Further the number of primes is polyloglog\n(logO​(1)⁡N=(log⁡log⁡n)O​(1)superscript𝑂1𝑁superscript𝑛𝑂1\\log^{O(1)}{N}=(\\log{\\log{n}})^{O(1)})\nand so sublogarithmic (logo​(1)⁡nsuperscript𝑜1𝑛\\log^{o(1)}{n}).\nHence, the number of possible different weights is subpolynomial,\nwhich allows us to derandomize our algorithm. Before getting into technical details, we point out that in [ref]9 a\nsimilar scheme is used for reachability and bears the same relation to\n as this section does to .\nWe have the following lemma, which we prove in Appendix C: Let G𝐺G be a bipartite graph with a non-zero circulation\nw𝑤w. Suppose N=logO​(1)⁡n𝑁superscript𝑂1𝑛N=\\log^{O(1)}{n} edges are inserted into G𝐺G to yield Gn​e​wsuperscript𝐺𝑛𝑒𝑤G^{new}\nthen we can compute polynomially many weight functions in \\FOar\\FOar\\FOar that\nhave O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log{n}) bit weights, and at least one of them,\nwn​e​wsuperscript𝑤𝑛𝑒𝑤w^{new} is isolating. Furthermore, the weights of the original edges remain\nunchanged under wn​e​wsuperscript𝑤𝑛𝑒𝑤w^{new}.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: the number of possible different weights is subpolynomial,\nwhich allows us to derandomize our algorithm.
