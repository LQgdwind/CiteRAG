      "content": "Paper Title: Contextual Transformer Networks for Visual Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSetup. We conduct image recognition task on the ImageNet dataset, which consists of 1.28 million training images and 50,000 validation images derived from 1,000 classes. Both of the top-1 and top-5 accuracies on the validation set are reported for evaluation. For this task, we adopt two different training setups in the experiments, i.e., the default training setup and advanced training setup. The default training setup is the widely adopted setting in classic vision backbones (e.g., ResNet 2, ResNeXt , and SENet ), that trains networks for around 100 epochs with standard preprocessing. Specifically, each input image is cropped into 224√ó\\times224, and only the standard data augmentation (i.e., random crops and horizontal flip with 50% probability) is performed. All the hyperparameters are set as in official implementations without any additional tuning. Similarly, our CoTNet is trained in an end-to-end manner, through backpropagation using SGD with momentum 0.9 and label smoothing 0.1. We set the batch size as B=512ùêµ512B=512 that enables applicable implementations on an 8-GPU machine. For the first five epochs, the learning rate is scaled linearly from 0 to 0.1‚ãÖB256‚ãÖ0.1ùêµ256\\frac{0.1\\cdot B}{256}, which is further decayed via cosine schedule . As in [ref]1, we adopt exponential moving average with weight 0.9999 during training. For fair comparison with state-of-the-art backbones (e.g., ResNeSt , EfficientNet  and LambdaNetworks [ref]1), we additionally involve the advanced training setup with longer training epochs and improved data augmentation & regularization. In this setup, we train our CoTNet with 350 epochs, coupled with the additional data augmentation of RandAugment  and mixup , and the regularization of dropout  and DropConnect . Performance Comparison. We compare with several state-of-the-art vision backbones with two different training settings (i.e., default and advanced training setups) on ImageNet dataset. The performance comparisons are summarized in Tables 3 and 4 for each kind of training setup, respectively. Note that we construct several variants of our CoTNet and CoTNeXt with two kinds of depthes (i.e., 50-layer and 101-layer), yielding CoTNet-50/101 and CoTNeXt-50/101. In advanced training setup, as in LambdaResNet [ref]1, we additionally include an upgraded version of our CoTNet, i.e., SE-CoTNetD-101, where the 3√ó\\times3 convolutions in the res4 and res5 stages are replaced with CoT blocks under SE-ResNetD-50 3  backbone. Moreover, in default training setup, we also report the performances of our models with the use of exponential moving average for fair comparison against LambdaResNet. As shown in Table 3, under the same depth (50-layer or 101-layer), the results across both top-1 and top-5 accuracy consistently indicate that our CoTNet-50/101 and CoTNeXt-50/101 obtain better performances against existing vision backbones with favorable parameter budget, including both ConvNets (e.g., ResNet-50/101 and ResNeXt-50/101) and attention-based models (e.g., Stand-Alone and AA-ResNet-50/101). The results generally highlight the key advantage of exploiting contextual information among keys in self-attention learning for visual recognition task. Specifically, under the same 50-layer backbones, by exploiting local self-attention in the deep architecture, LR-Net-50 and Stand-Alone exhibit better performance than ResNet-50, which ignores long-range feature interactions. Next, AA-ResNet-50 and LambdaResNet-50 enable the exploration of global self-attention over the whole feature map, and thereby boost up the performances. However, the performances of AA-ResNet-50 and LambdaResNet-50 are still lower than the stronger ConvNet (SE-ResNeXt-50) that strengthens the capacity of visual representation with channel-wise feature re-calibration. Furthermore, by fully replacing 3√ó\\times3 convolutions with CoT blocks across the entirety of deep architecture in ResNet-50/ResNeXt-50, CoTNet-50 and CoTNeXt-50 outperform SE-ResNeXt-50. This confirms that unifying both context mining among keys and self-attention learning into a single architecture is an effective way to enhance representation learning and thus boost visual recognition.\nWhen additionally using exponential moving average as in LambdaResNet, the top-1 accuracy of CoTNeXt-50/101 will be further improved to 80.2% and 81.3% respectively, which is to-date the best published performance on ImageNet in default training setup. Similar observations are also attained in advanced training setup, as summarized in Table 4. Note that here we group all the baselines with similar top-1/top-5 accuracy or network depth. In general, our CoTNet-50 & CoTNeXt-50 or CoTNet-101 & CoTNeXt-101 perform consistently better than other vision backbones across both metrics for each group. In particular, the top-1 accuracy of our CoTNeXt-50 and CoTNeXt-101 can achieve 82.1% and 83.2%, making the absolute improvement over the best competitor ResNeSt-50 or ResNeSt-101/LambdaResNet-10 by 1.0% and 0.9%, respectively. More specifically, the attention-based backbones (BoTNet-S1-50 and BoTNet-S1-59) exhibit better performances than ResNet-50 and ResNet-101, by replacing the final three 3√ó\\times3 convolutions in ResNet with global self-attention layers. LambdaResNet-101 further boosts up the performances by leveraging the computationally efficient global self-attention layers (i.e., Lambda layer) to replace the convolutional layers. Nevertheless, LambdaResNet-101 is inferior to CoTNeXt-101 which capitalizes on the contextual information among input keys to guide self-attention learning. Even under the heavy setting with deeper networks, our SE-CoTNetD-152 (320) still manages to outperform the superior backbones of BoTNet-S1-128 (320) and EfficientNet-B7 (600), sharing the similar (even smaller) FLOPs with BoTNet-S1-128 (320). Inference Time vs. Accuracy.\nHere we evaluate our CoTNet models with regard to both inference time and top-1 accuracy for image recognition task. Figure 3 and Figure 4 show the inference time-accuracy curve under both default and advanced training setups for our CoTNet and the state-of-the-art vision backbones. As shown in the two figures, we can see that our CoTNet models consistently obtain better top-1 accuracy with less inference time than other vision backbones across both training setups. In a word, our CoTNet models seek better inference time-accuracy trade-offs than existing vision backbones. More remarkably, compared to the high-quality backbone of EfficientNet-B6, our SE-CoTNetD-152 (320) achieves 0.6% higher top-1 accuracy, while runs 2.75√ó\\times faster at inference. Ablation Study.\nIn this section, we investigate how each design in our CoT block influences the overall performance of CoTNet-50. In CoT block, we first mine the static context among keys via a 3√ó\\times3 convolution. Conditioned on the concatenation of query and contextualized key, we can also obtain the dynamic context via self-attention. CoT block dynamically fuses the static and dynamic contexts as the final outputs. Here we include one variant of CoT block by directly summating the two kinds of contexts, named as Linear Fusion. Table 5 details the performances across different ways on the exploration of contextual information in CoTNet-50 backbone. Solely using static context (Static Context) for image recognition achieves 77.1% top-1 accuracy, which can be interpreted as one kind of ConvNet without self-attention. Next, by directly exploiting the dynamic context via self-attention, Dynamic Context exhibits better performance. The linear fusion of static and dynamic contexts leads to a boost of 78.7%, which basically validates the complementarity of the two contexts. CoT block is further benefited from the dynamic fusion via attention, and the top-1 accuracy of CoT finally reaches 79.2%. Effect of Replacement Settings.\nIn order to show the relationship between performance and the number of stages replaced with our CoT blocks, we progressively replace the stages with our CoT blocks in ResNet-50 backbone (res2‚Üí‚Üí\\rightarrowres3‚Üí‚Üí\\rightarrowres4‚Üí‚Üí\\rightarrowres5), and compare the performances. The results shown in Table 6 indicate that increasing the number of stages replaced with CoT blocks can generally lead to performance improvement, and meanwhile the parameter number & FLOPs are slightly decreased. When taking a close look on the throughputs and accuracies of different replacement settings, the replacement of CoT blocks in the last two stages (res4 and res5) contributes to the most performance boost. The additional replacement of CoT blocks in the fist stages (res1 and res2) can only lead to a marginal performance improvement (0.2% top-1 accuracy in total), while requiring 1.34√ó\\times inference time. Therefore, in order to seek a better speed-accuracy trade-off, we follow [ref]1 and construct an upgraded version of our CoTNet, named SE-CoTNetD-50, where only the 3√ó\\times3 convolutions in the res4 and res5 stages are replaced with CoT blocks under SE-ResNetD-50 backbone. Note that the SE-ResNetD-50 backbone is a variant of ResNet-50 with two widely adopted architecture changes (ResNet-D 3 and Squeeze-and-Excitation in all bottleneck blocks ). As shown in Table 6, compared to the SE-ResNetD-50 counterpart, our SE-CoTNetD-50 achieves better performances at a virtually negligible decrease in throughput.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: on an 8-GPU machine.
