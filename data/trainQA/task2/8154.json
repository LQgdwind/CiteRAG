      "content": "Paper Title: Stimulus-to-stimulus learning in RNNs with cortical inductive biases\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe ability to engage in stimulus-stimulus associative learning provides a crucial evolutionary advantage. The cerebral cortex might contribute to this evolutionary edge by exploiting representational  and architectural  inductive biases present in the cortical microcircuit . We here propose a recurrent neuronal network model of how the cortex can implement stimulus substitution, which allows the same set of neurons to encode multiple stimulus-stimulus associations. The model relies on the properties of two-compartment layer-5 pyramidal neurons, which based on recent experimental findings, we refer to as associative neurons. These neurons can act as coincidence detectors for information about the US arriving at their somatic compartment and information about the CS arriving at their dendritic compartment   . Coincidence detection allows for a biologically plausible synaptic plasticity rule that, after learning, results in neurons that would normally fire in the presence of the US to respond in the same manner when the CS is presented. At the population level, this means that the pattern of neural activity corresponding to the CS can be morphed into the one corresponding to the US, leading to stimulus substitution. Our model accounts for many of most important conditioning phenomena observed in animal experiments, including delay conditioning, trace conditioning, extinction, blocking, overshadowing, saliency effects, overexpectation and contingency effects. The model is able to learn multiple CS-US associations with a degree of training that is commensurate with animal experiments. Significantly, the model performs well across a wide variety of conditioning tasks without experiments-specific parameter fine-tuning. We also show that some influential models of three-factor Hebbian learning rules - Oja’s rule  and the BCM rule  - fail to learn generic stimulus-stimulus associations due to their unsupervised nature. Hebbian rules have demonstrable autoassociative  and heteroassociative  capabilities, and when augmented with eligibility traces they have been shown to account for neuronal-level reinforcement learning   . Still, they struggle with pattern-to-pattern associations when representations are mixed. This is because Hebbian rules are purely unsupervised, and therefore provide no guarantee that the impact of the CS will be eventually shaped to be identical to the one of the US. Instead, network performance heavily depends on implementation details, like training history, task details and stimulus statistics. As a result, decoding from a population encoding several associations is hampered by the fact that activation levels for individual neurons when exposed to the CS will more often than not be off from those resulting from exposure to the corresponding US. Related work utilized a predictive learning rule similar to the one used here to account for prospective coding of anticipated stimuli . While prospective coding might also be involved in conditioning, their study differs in several ways. First, their learning rule is timing-dependent; it succeeds in a delayed pair associative learning task, but it would require re-learning when the relative timing of the US in relation to the CS is variable. In contrast, our learning rule applies to arbitrary task timings. Second, their learning rule lacks gating which, unless strict conditions are met (dendritic and somatic activity conditioned on a stationary Markov chain), leads to reduced responses and even catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, adding gating is not feasible in their model, because learning needs to bootstrap before the presentation of the delayed stimulus, and gating would inactivate learning at these times. Several features of the model are worth emphasizing. First, the proposed RNN leverages architectural inductive biases in the form of two-compartment associative neurons. These associative neurons are the most common neuron type in the mammalian cortex . This is likely no coincidence; once evolution stumbled upon their usefulness in predicting external contingencies, it might have favored them. While subcortical  and even single-neuron  mechanisms for conditioning exist, the mechanism that we propose can handle mixed representations, and thus allow animals with a cerebral cortex to flexibly learn large numbers of associations. The structure of the associative neuron is ideal for stimulus-stimulus learning. Feedforward inputs, like the US representations, arrive near the soma in layer-5 and directly control the neuron’s firing rate. Feedback inputs, like the CS representations and the activity of other cortical neurons, arrive at the distal dentrites in layer-1 . This compartmentalized structure allows the signals to travel independently, and get associated via a cellular mechanism known as BAC firing . Specifically, it has been shown that these cells implement coincidence detection, whereby feedforward inputs trigger a spike which backpropagates to the distal dendrites and concurrently feedback input arrives at these dendrites, then plateau calcium potentials are initiated in the dendritic compartment . These plateau potentials result in the neuron spiking multiple times subsequently and learning occurs in the distal dendrites, so that feedback inputs can elicit spikes alone in the future, without the need for external information. Second, a prerequisite for the biological plausiblity of the learning rule used in the model is that backpropagating action potentials to be disentangled from postsynaptic potentials at the dendritic compartment. Only then can the two critical components in our learning rule, f​(Vs)𝑓superscript𝑉sf(V^{\\text{s}}) and f​(p′​Vd)𝑓superscript𝑝′superscript𝑉df(p^{\\prime}V^{\\text{d}}) in eq. 1 be compared. Since backpropagating action potentials (denoted by f​(Vs)𝑓superscript𝑉sf(V^{\\text{s}}) in the model) do not need to travel far, they experience minimal attenuation  and therefore they maintain some of their high-frequency components, which could be used at synapses to differentiate them from slower postsynaptic potentials (denoted by Vdsuperscript𝑉dV^{\\text{d}} in the model). As a result, only a static transformation of this last term is needed to compare the two signals. Consequently, the learning rule relies only on information locally available at each synapse, which is a prerequisite for biological plausibility. Third, our model suggests multiple functional roles for gating. It limits learning to episodes that appear to have behavioral significance. Gating also prevents drifting of learned associations due to a lack of perfect self-consistency between f​(Vs)𝑓superscript𝑉sf(V^{\\text{s}}) and f​(p′​Vd)𝑓superscript𝑝′superscript𝑉df(p^{\\prime}V^{\\text{d}}) in the learning rule , which is expected in a biological system subject to noise and approximate computation. In addition, gating provides a critical global reference signal when multiple CSs are available at the same time. The model also has some limitations to be addressed in future work. Most importantly, it does not account for spontaneous recovery of previously learnt associations after extinction. In our model,\nextinction stems from the decay of the response of the associate neurons to the CS, a mechanism akin to unlearning, which erases previous learning, and thus does not allow for spontaneous recovery or faster re-acquistion. The extinction mechanism proposed here is complementary to inhibitory learning, the mechanism initially put forth by Pavlov to explain spontaneous recovery. In the case of experiments with multiple CSs, the model assumes that different neuronal population implements separate RNNs to learn the associations for each of them. Although the two populations interact indirectly through the surprise signals, they each learn to predict the US on their own. The existence of separate populations might be justifiable when the CSs involve different sensory modalities (e.g., sound and vision), or very different spatial locations, but not necessarily when they are presented simultaneously. Extending the model to include differential routing of simultaneously presented stimuli is an open question for future work. Another direction for future work is to account for more psychological aspects of conditioning by developing a larger model that incorporates other forms of learning and generalization like model-based strategies also thought to take place in the PFC , or to allow for context-dependent computation to resolve conflicts among competing stimuli . In these larger models, our network would model the stimulus substitution component. The model allows to differentiate between conditioning effects that can be accounted by low-level, synaptic plasticity mechanisms, versus other high level explanations. At its core, the model performs stimulus substitution at the neuronal level, via a gradual acquisition process   [ref]34. Despite that, the model is still capable of rapid, few-shot learning, especially when the number of associations is small compared to size of the network (fig. 2E). Yet, for rapid learning in more complicated scenarios, fast inference based on prior knowledge might be necessary . Finally, our model suggest an alternative role for representational inductive biases in the form of mixed selectivity, other than readout flexibility : it permits the efficient packing of multiple stimulus-stimulus associations within the same neuronal population, which might confer cortical animals the evolutionary edge.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: by low-level, synaptic plasticity mechanisms, versus other high level explanations.
