      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Reactive Synthesis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGXU synthesis is strongly based on the structural approach to reactive synthesis¬† .\nBut GXU synthesis supports an expressive rule-like logic including strong until,\nit is complete for mutually dependent specifications, and it is\ndecidable in polynomial time in the size of GXU specifications (Theorem¬†5.1).\nReal-time extensions and other pragmatics for synthesizing programmable logic controllers¬† can be adapted to the more expressive GXU logic. Structural synthesis¬†  is based on a reduction of the realizability to the 2QBF validity problem, which is Œ†2psuperscriptsubscriptŒ†2ùëù\\Pi_{2}^{p}-complete.\nA more detailed analysis of the resulting 2QBF\nrealizability conditions with the aim of obtaining improved\ncomplexity bounds for these kinds of subclasses has been missing.\nReactive synthesis based on solving 2QBF\nhas also been considered in¬† ,\nwhich is based on greatest fixpoints to represent acceptable control behavior. Again, these logic-based approaches to reactive synthesis rely on general\n2QBF solving. Since GXU contains GR(1) as a sublogic, the polynomially bounded runtimes of GXU synthesis in Theorem¬†5.1 improve the known complexity result for GR(1) synthesis¬†,\nwhich, even if it is cubic in an underlying state space, may well be non-polynomial with respect to the problem statement itself.\nThis observation also holds for other LTL fragments¬†. Finite LTL synthesis¬†  [ref]49 0 generates deterministic finite automata (DFA) for LTLfsubscriptLTLùëì\\text{LTL}_{f} specifications, that is, LTL formulas interpreted over finite traces.\nThe LTLfsubscriptLTLùëì\\text{LTL}_{f} to DFA translation in¬† is doubly-exponential in the size of the formula,\n reduces LTLfsubscriptLTLùëì\\text{LTL}_{f} to DFA synthesis\nto reachability games, which are 2EXPTIME complete,\noptimizations for LTLfsubscriptLTLùëì\\text{LTL}_{f} synthesis have been studied in 0,\nand LTLfsubscriptLTLùëì\\text{LTL}_{f} satisfiability checking is applied as a preprocessing step¬†1, thereby obtaining potentially exponential speedups¬†[ref]49.\nThere are two main differences between GXU and LTLfsubscriptLTLùëì\\text{LTL}_{f} synthesis.\nFirst, GXU synthesis is designed to work only for a syntactically restrictive assumption-guarantee fragment of LTL formulas,\nwhile the LTLfsubscriptLTLùëì\\text{LTL}_{f} synthesis supports all LTL formulas, albeit in a finitary interpretation.\nSecond, a polynomial time GXU synthesis algorithm is obtained from these restrictions, whereas LTLfsubscriptLTLùëì\\text{LTL}_{f} synthesis is doubly-exponential.\nIt might be interesting, however,\nto possibly extend the core GXU synthesis algorithm to work for all LTLfsubscriptLTLùëì\\text{LTL}_{f} formulas, or, alternatively, to recover a polynomial GXU-like synthesis algorithm for certain fragments in the general framework of LTLfsubscriptLTLùëì\\text{LTL}_{f} synthesis. Minimal unrealizable cores have previously been used\nto locate errors in an unrealizable specification, based\non approximations of the winning region by a minimization algorithm¬†2.\nIn contrast, our unrealizable core are purely logical, and\nlogical operations are used to synthesize repairs to unrealizability.\nCounterstrategies for synthesis games are generally used to exclude unrealizable environmental\nbehavior¬†  3 [ref]24 4 5.\nIn this way, predefined templates were proposed, which are instantiated on the basis of the exclusion of counter-strategies¬† .\nMoreover, a\ncounterstrategy-driven refinement loop based\non explicit value abstraction, Sa√Ødi-Graf predicate abstraction, and Craig interpolation for mining assumptions\nis described in¬†6.\nIn contrast to the algorithm for mining assumptions in Section¬†5.2, these approaches rely on suitable expert input, such as specification templates and also predefined scenarios.\nMinimal assumptions have been\nproposed for repairing unrealizable specifications¬†3 [ref]24 4.\nBut the computation of minimal liveness assumptions is NP-hard.\nAssumption mining as developed in this paper has been influenced by\nrecent work on constructing explicit definitions in the context of preprocessing and solving QBF formulas¬†7.\n\nReference markers found: [49]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]49: if it is cubic in an underlying state space, may well be non-polynomial with respect to the problem statement itself.\nThis observation also holds for other LTL fragments¬†. Finite LTL synthesis¬†  [ref]49 0 generates deterministic finite automata (DFA) for LTLfsubscriptLTLùëì\\text{LTL}_{f} specifications, that is, LTL formulas interpreted over finite traces.\nThe LTLfsubscriptLTLùëì\\text{LTL}_{f}\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
