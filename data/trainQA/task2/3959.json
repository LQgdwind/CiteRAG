      "content": "Paper Title: HyperTree Proof Search for Neural Theorem Proving\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAutomated theorem proving has been a long-standing goal of artificial intelligence, with the earliest work dating from the 1950s  .\nEarly approaches focused on simpler logics, culminating in extremely efficient first-order provers such as E  or Vampire .\nHowever, these approaches are insufficient when it comes to theorems written in modern proof assistants such as Isabelle , Coq , or Lean .\nRecently, the rising success of deep language models [ref]15 and model-guided search methods [ref]7 has spurred a renewed interest in the problem of automated theorem proving. Recent work applying deep learning methods to theorem proving  [ref]17  are the closest to this work and obtained impressive results on difficult held-out sets for Metamath and Lean.\nThe main differences between their approach and ours are the proof-search algorithm we propose, the training data we extract from proof-searches and our use of online training compared to their expert iterations. We validate experimentally that these differences lead to improved performances as well as faster training times.\nAnother similar approach is Holophrasm , which is based on a different tree exploration technique which expands paths in an AND/OR tree, while we expand entire proof subtrees in a proof hypergraph. Their model is only trained once from supervised data and does not benefit from online training or expert iteration, which we found to be critical.\nDeepHOL  focuses on the HOL-Light environment . Their model relies on a classifier that can select among a restricted set of tactics and arguments, while we rely on a seq2seq model that can generate arbitrary tactics.\nThe suggested tactics are then used in a breadth-first search.\nTacticToe  uses an MCTS without learned components, using ranking on predefined features to guide the search. Machine learning has also been used to improve classical provers by re-ranking clauses .\nOverall, previous studies always focus on a single proving environment (e.g. Metamath, Lean, or HOL-Light). Impressive performance of large language models in one or few shot learning [ref]15, machine translation  or more recently code generation  spurred interest into the reasoning capabilities of large transformers. These model perform quite well on formal tasks such as expression simplification , solving differential equations , symbolic regression  , or predicting complex properties of mathematical objects . These studies suggest that deep neural networks are well adapted to complex tasks, especially when coupled with a formal system for verification. Recently, AlphaZero [ref]7 demonstrated good performances on two player games, replacing the Monte-Carlo evaluations of MCTS  with evaluations from a deep neural network and guiding the search with an additional deep policy. This recent success follows extensive literature into search methods for two player games, notably alpha-beta search . Theorem proving can be thought of as computing game-theoretic value for positions in a min/max tree: for a goal to be proven, we need one move (max) that leads to subgoals that are all proven (min). Noticing heterogeneity in the arities of min or max nodes, we propose a search method that goes down simultaneously in all children of min nodes, such that every simulation could potentially result in a full proof-tree.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: these approaches are insufficient when it comes to theorems written in modern proof assistants such as Isabelle , Coq , or Lean .\nRecently, the rising success of deep language models [ref]15 and model-guided search methods [ref]7 has spurred a renewed interest in the problem of automated theorem proving.
