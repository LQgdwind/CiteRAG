      "content": "Paper Title: Cognitive Learning-Aided Multi-Antenna Communications\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs the wireless standards move from the recent initial deployment of fifth-generation (5G) new radio to 6G, there is an urgency in transcending the current data rates, robustness, spectral reuse, latency, and energy efficiency. Therefore, instead of a single antenna, nearly all recent wireless technologies employ multiple antennas to address these challenges¬†. For example, the spatial diversity provided by the use of multiple antennas is helpful in multipath scenarios. By providing multiple copies of the transmitted signal in statistically independent fading, this configuration reduces errors at the receiver. Further, spatial multiplexing with multiple antennas allows transmission of many simultaneous data streams over a multipath channel and same frequency band, thereby improving bit rates. Finally, large antenna arrays offset the severe attenuation and path losses at higher frequencies through beamforming gain. Multiple antennas are able to offer more efficient use of limited spectrum by also including diversity in the spectral (multiple frequency allocations) and time (multiple delays of signal replica) domains. In wireless communications, multiple-input single-output, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), and massive MIMO are common architectures¬†[ref]2. The backscattered communications, which aid in passive sensing applications, also employ multiple antennas to detect and localize unknown emitters¬†. In recent years, multi-antenna technologies have increasingly leveraged cognitive processing and control (Fig.¬†1). These cognitive systems are capable of quick and greater control of transmitters and higher adaptability of receivers than their non-cognitive counterparts. The conventional optimization and analytical methods are not efficient or fast in adaptively utilizing the excess degrees of freedom and high-dimensional data in multi-antenna systems. This has motivated growing use of learning-based techniques to accomplish various stages of sense-learn-adapt cycle of cognitive multiple-antenna communications. The traditional learning-based methods, such as kùëòk-nearest neighbor algorithm, support vector machines, kùëòk-means clustering, principal and independent component\nanalysis have been widely recognized for regression, classification and clustering tasks¬†. These traditional methods have limited performance, especially for huge training data¬†[ref]5. In this context, deep learning (DL) is a key cognition-enabling technology   because it offers robustness against the imperfections in the data, fast prediction response, allows a model-free mapping between input and output data, by training a learning model with a huge number of learnable parameters. Recent research suggests promising outlook for DL in solving common wireless communications problems, such as signal detection¬† [ref]5, channel estimation¬†[ref]8 and beamforming¬† [ref]8. In this article, we focus on the developments in this area during the last three years, wherein novel DL architectures have emerged to enhance the adaptability of multi-antenna communications. Whereas traditional learning methods for possible use in wireless communications were discussed in , simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures for the physical layer design in 5G systems were examined in . Recently, [ref]5 concentrated on signal detection and decoding in DL-based transceivers for 5G non-orthogonal multiple access. Unlike these expositions, the main contributions of this article are as follows:\n¬†\n‚àô‚àô{\\bullet} We explore multi-antenna wireless applications of existing and new DL architectures such as unsupervised learning (UL), supervised learning (SL), online learning (OL), reinforcement learning (RL), transfer learning (TL), and federated learning (FL). ¬†\n‚àô‚àô{\\bullet} We provide a comprehensive analysis for DL-based cognitive physical layer problems (Fig.¬†2), such as signal detection, channel estimation, user localization, antenna selection and beamforming via different learning techniques, including some numerical examples. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we introduce the role of DL in combating the challenges in multi-antenna communications. Section¬†III discusses DL-based solutions for multi-antenna communications. We follow this with unaddressed design challenges and consequent future research directions in Section¬†IV. We conclude in Section¬†V.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: and time (multiple delays of signal replica) domains.
