      "content": "Paper Title: Active Learning in Gaussian Process State Space Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn learning the posterior, our target is to compute The major challenge is the computation of p​(𝒚1:t)𝑝subscript𝒚:1𝑡p(\\bm{y}_{1:t}). Throughout this paper, we are going to apply variational inference to train GPSSM, which is a technique based on making assumptions about the posterior over latent variables that leads to a tractable lower bound, often called evidence lower bound (ELBO). There are two reasons for choosing this approach, which is currently state-of-the-art in training GPSSM. First, variational inference is computationally efficient. Second, this approach will lead to an approximation of the posterior, which can be carried to the AL strategy, as we will present further in section 4. The first step of using variational inference in GPSSM is to introduce M𝑀M (M≪Tmuch-less-than𝑀𝑇M\\ll T) inducing points 𝒖=𝒖1:M={𝒖i}i=1M𝒖subscript𝒖:1𝑀subscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝒖𝑖𝑀𝑖1\\bm{u}\\!=\\!\\bm{u}_{1:M}\\!=\\!\\{\\bm{u}_{i}\\}^{M}_{i=1} with their corresponding inputs. This is referred as sparse GP technique (see e.g.  [ref]22) and the joint density is Then, the ELBO ℒtsubscriptℒ𝑡\\mathcal{L}_{t} to the log marginal likelihood of p​(𝒚1:t)𝑝subscript𝒚:1𝑡p(\\bm{y}_{1:t}) in equation 6, which is based on KL divergence (see e.g. chapter 8.5 in Cover), is given by for t=1,⋯,T𝑡1⋯𝑇t\\!=\\!1,\\!\\cdots\\!,T, where q​(⋅)𝑞⋅q(\\cdot) is the distribution function to approximate p​(⋅)𝑝⋅p(\\cdot). With further derivations from variational inference methodology, ℒtsubscriptℒ𝑡\\mathcal{L}_{t} is given by Analogously to Ialongo et al., we set which leads to equation 17 of  Under sparse GP approximation, we can specify a free Gaussian density on the function values 𝒖𝒖\\bm{u} giving q​(𝒖)=𝒩​(𝒖|𝝁𝒖,𝚺𝒖)𝑞𝒖𝒩conditional𝒖subscript𝝁𝒖subscript𝚺𝒖q(\\bm{u})\\!=\\!\\mathcal{N}(\\bm{u}|\\bm{\\mu}_{\\bm{u}},\\bm{\\Sigma}_{\\bm{u}}). The only term that requires further specification is q​(𝒙i|𝒇i)𝑞conditionalsubscript𝒙𝑖subscript𝒇𝑖q(\\bm{x}_{i}|\\bm{f}_{i}) and  presented q​(𝒙i|𝒇i)=𝒩​(𝒙i|𝑨i−1​𝒇~i−1+𝒃i−1,𝑺i−1)𝑞conditionalsubscript𝒙𝑖subscript𝒇𝑖𝒩conditionalsubscript𝒙𝑖subscript𝑨𝑖1subscript~𝒇𝑖1subscript𝒃𝑖1subscript𝑺𝑖1q(\\bm{x}_{i}|\\bm{f}_{i})\\!=\\!\\mathcal{N}(\\bm{x}_{i}|\\bm{A}_{i-1}\\tilde{\\bm{f}}_{i-1}+\\bm{b}_{i-1},\\bm{S}_{i-1}), where 𝒇~isubscript~𝒇𝑖\\tilde{\\bm{f}}_{i} is a free variational parameter. 𝑨isubscript𝑨𝑖\\bm{A}_{i}, 𝒃isubscript𝒃𝑖\\bm{b}_{i} and 𝑺isubscript𝑺𝑖\\bm{S}_{i} are other free variational parameters depending on the choice of 𝒇~isubscript~𝒇𝑖\\tilde{\\bm{f}}_{i}. This generalises a number of previous work. For example, by setting 𝒇i=𝒙isubscript𝒇𝑖subscript𝒙𝑖\\bm{f}_{i}\\!=\\!\\bm{x}_{i} in q(⋅|⋅)q(\\cdot|\\cdot) and q​(𝒙)=q​(𝒙0)𝑞𝒙𝑞subscript𝒙0q(\\bm{x})\\!=\\!q(\\bm{x}_{0}), we recover the expression from  and the optimal q​(𝒙)𝑞𝒙q(\\bm{x}) can be solved by calculus of variations. If we set 𝒇~i=𝒙isubscript~𝒇𝑖subscript𝒙𝑖\\tilde{\\bm{f}}_{i}\\!=\\!\\bm{x}_{i}, then we have the Gaussian factorised approximation of . In , they proposed setting 𝒇~i=k​(𝒙i,𝒖)​K𝒖​𝒖−1​𝒖subscript~𝒇𝑖𝑘subscript𝒙𝑖𝒖subscriptsuperscript𝐾1𝒖𝒖𝒖\\tilde{\\bm{f}}_{i}=k(\\bm{x}_{i},\\bm{u})K^{-1}_{\\bm{uu}}\\bm{u} and the training turned out to be marginally better if a sufficiently large amount of iterations are allowed. We choose to set 𝒇~i=𝒙isubscript~𝒇𝑖subscript𝒙𝑖\\tilde{\\bm{f}}_{i}\\!=\\!\\bm{x}_{i} throughout this paper, which is the approach by . This is because their approach has shown to have a stable improvement in model accuracy during the training phase. Also, its linear factorising nature, given a fixed and often small number of allowed iterations, is also beneficial for training time. Such setting leads to q​(𝒙i|𝒇i)=𝒩​(𝒙i|𝑨i−1​𝒙i−1+𝒃i−1,𝑺i−1)𝑞conditionalsubscript𝒙𝑖subscript𝒇𝑖𝒩conditionalsubscript𝒙𝑖subscript𝑨𝑖1subscript𝒙𝑖1subscript𝒃𝑖1subscript𝑺𝑖1q(\\bm{x}_{i}|\\bm{f}_{i})\\!=\\!\\mathcal{N}(\\bm{x}_{i}|\\bm{A}_{i-1}\\bm{x}_{i-1}+\\bm{b}_{i-1},\\bm{S}_{i-1}), with the free parameters 𝑺i−1=(𝑸−1+𝑪T​𝑹−1​𝑪)−1subscript𝑺𝑖1superscriptsuperscript𝑸1superscript𝑪𝑇superscript𝑹1𝑪1\\bm{S}_{i-1}\\!=\\!(\\bm{Q}^{-1}+\\bm{C}^{T}\\bm{R}^{-1}\\bm{C})^{-1}, 𝑨i−1=𝑺i−1​𝑸−1subscript𝑨𝑖1subscript𝑺𝑖1superscript𝑸1\\bm{A}_{i-1}\\!=\\!\\bm{S}_{i-1}\\bm{Q}^{-1} and 𝒃i−1=𝑺i−1​𝑪T​𝑹−1​(𝒚t−𝒅)subscript𝒃𝑖1subscript𝑺𝑖1superscript𝑪𝑇superscript𝑹1subscript𝒚𝑡𝒅\\bm{b}_{i-1}\\!=\\!\\bm{S}_{i-1}\\bm{C}^{T}\\bm{R}^{-1}(\\bm{y}_{t}-\\bm{d}). The prediction with GPSSM can be done rather cheaply. Suppose we would like to predict the new observation 𝒚⋆superscript𝒚⋆\\bm{y}^{\\star} based on a new control input 𝒄⋆superscript𝒄⋆\\bm{c}^{\\star}, by defining all training data as 𝒟≡{𝒚1:T,𝒙0:T}𝒟subscript𝒚:1𝑇subscript𝒙:0𝑇\\mathcal{D}\\!\\equiv\\!\\{\\bm{y}_{1:T},\\bm{x}_{0:T}\\}, we can show easily  that the predictive distribution p​(𝒚⋆|𝒄⋆,𝒟)𝑝conditionalsuperscript𝒚⋆superscript𝒄⋆𝒟p(\\bm{y}^{\\star}|\\bm{c}^{\\star},\\mathcal{D}) is given by In practice, we sample f​(𝒙T,𝒄⋆)𝑓subscript𝒙𝑇superscript𝒄⋆f(\\bm{x}_{T},\\bm{c}^{\\star}), where the latent states 𝒙1:Tsubscript𝒙:1𝑇\\bm{x}_{1:T} are already estimated via training. Then, we predict the new observation based on drawing samples from the distribution.
