      "content": "Paper Title: Democratizing Uncertainty Quantification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUM-Bridge fills a major gap in the UQ software ecosystem: There\nis currently no common platform linking arbitrary UQ algorithms and model software, let alone general-purpose cloud and HPC support or language-independent benchmarks. In practice, most publications that couple advanced UQ methods and complex models\ndo so in one of two ways: Either they directly embed the model in the\nUQ code, which requires compatible programming languages and\nentails unwieldy software stacks. Or, the UQ component\npasses parameters to the modelling component via some kind\nof input file, executes the model software, and then processes the\noutcomes. Both approaches do not lend themselves to containerized models, and the parallelization infrastructure for HPC support remains up to each individual UQ code.\nSince the interfaces are incompatible across UQ packages,\nthey lead to user lock-in: It is impractical for models to\nimplement interfaces to multiple UQ packages and it is often\ndifficult to translate data and data structures between programming\nlanguages.\nAll of this further precludes systematic comparisons between UQ methods, which are often\nonly demonstrated on trivial test cases (say a superposition of\nGaussians) and a single complex model that is\ninaccessible to the broader community. UM-Bridge addresses those problems by providing a uniform and\nlanguage-independent set of interfaces. As a consequence, it is able\nto couple NùëÅN UQ codes and MùëÄM model applications using only N+MùëÅùëÄN+M\nimplementations of the coupled interface, rather than the N‚ãÖM‚ãÖùëÅùëÄN\\cdot M\nmodifications otherwise necessary. In addition, UM-Bridge provides\ngeneric parallelization platforms that serve any UQ code and any model, and\nit addresses the issue of different languages and complex, perhaps conflicting dependencies, build systems, or parallelization schemes. Table¬†2 gives an overview of how commonly used UQ packages\nrealize the interface between UQ and model and how that compares to UM-Bridge. In building UM-Bridge, we were inspired by projects\nin other domains\nthat aim at coupling with modeling software. For example, the\nFunctional Mockup Interface (FMI) ,\nprominent in commercial codes like ANSYS and Matlab, standardizes this\nprocess by encapsulating models as Functional Mockup Units (FMUs),\npromoting interoperability between different simulation tools.\nAs another example, preCICE\n(Precise Code Interaction Coupling Environment) \nfacilitates multi-physics simulations by coupling grid interfaces\nbetween different specialized simulation codes through the preCICE interface. In the end, a UQ project‚Äôs success hinges on whether its benefits can be\ndemonstrated using practical examples of relevance to the\ncommunity. To this end, we have built the UM-Bridge benchmarks library\nthat provides a ready made set of benchmarks that can be used to test the performance of new methods, and which can be used as a reference for comparison with existing methods. In other areas such as numerical linear algebra , geophysics   [ref]32, HPC , model order reduction , etc., such benchmark collections are widely used. To the best of our knowledge no such collection currently exists for UQ. Algorithms requiring information beyond the current UM-Bridge interface can not be integrated. Also, for large data transfers or extremely fast models, the network overhead may become significant. Both limitations are somewhat mitigated by support for future protocol extensions. At the time of writing, smooth handling of model code crashes is planned but not yet supported. We aim to establish UM-Bridge across the UQ community, serving as a catalyst for highly efficient UQ methods applied to challenging problems, and acting as a link between UQ and applications as well as between academia and industry. With growing computational resources and the advance of science, we expect growing complexity in UQ applications, making the need for separation of concerns and advanced UQ tools even more prominent. Beyond its initial focus on UQ, the protocol can adapt to the needs of other fields through extensions. Ongoing work, e.g., adds an optional ‚Äúfast path‚Äù through shared memory whenever client and server run on the same machine, enabling transfer of large amounts of data like entire random fields.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: that can be used to test the performance of new methods, and which can be used as a reference for comparison with existing methods.
