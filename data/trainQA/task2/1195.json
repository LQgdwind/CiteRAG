Weight decay is the most popular regularization technique for training deep neural networks that generalize well 4. In deep learning, there exist two types of “weight decay”: L2subscript𝐿2L_{2} regularization and weight decay. People commonly use the first type of L2subscript𝐿2L_{2} regularization for training of deep neural networks as\nθt=θt−1−ηt​∇(L​(θt−1)+λL2​‖θt−1‖2)subscript𝜃𝑡subscript𝜃𝑡1subscript𝜂𝑡∇𝐿subscript𝜃𝑡1subscript𝜆subscript𝐿2superscriptnormsubscript𝜃𝑡12\\theta_{t}=\\theta_{t-1}-\\eta_{t}\\nabla(L(\\theta_{t-1})+\\lambda_{L_{2}}\\|\\theta_{t-1}\\|^{2}),\nwhere ∇∇\\nabla is the gradient operator, ∥⋅∥\\|\\cdot\\| is the L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}-norm, t𝑡t is the index of iterations, θ𝜃\\theta denotes the model weights, ηtsubscript𝜂𝑡\\eta_{t} is the learning rate, L​(θ)𝐿𝜃L(\\theta) is the training loss, and λL2subscript𝜆subscript𝐿2\\lambda_{L_{2}} is the L2subscript𝐿2L_{2} regularization hyperparameter. In principle, the L2subscript𝐿2L_{2} regularization strength is chosen to be constant during training of DNNs and people do not need to schedule L2subscript𝐿2L_{2} regularization like learning rate decay.\nThe second type of weight decay was first proposed by Hanson and Pratt, [ref]13 to directly regularize the weight norm: where λ′superscript𝜆′\\lambda^{\\prime} is the (vanilla) weight decay hyperparameter. While the two types of “weight decay” seem similar to Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Loshchilov and Hutter, 2 reported that they can make huge differences in adaptive gradient methods, such as Adam . Adam often generalizes worse and finds sharper minima than SGD    for popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs), where the flat minima have been argued to be closely related with good generalization     . Understanding and bridging the generalization gap between SGD and Adam have been a hot topic recently. Loshchilov and Hutter, 2 argued that directly regularizing the weight norm is more helpful for boosting Adam than L2subscript𝐿2L_{2} regularization, and proposed Decoupled Weight Decay as where λWsubscript𝜆𝑊\\lambda_{W} is the decoupled weight decay hyperparameter. We display Adam with L2subscript𝐿2L_{2} regularization and Adam with Decoupled Weight Decay (AdamW) in Algorithm 1. To avoid abusing notations, we strictly distinguish L2subscript𝐿2L_{2} regularization and weight decay in the following discussion. While fine analysis of weight decay has attracted much attention recently   , some pitfalls of weight decay have still been largely overlooked. This paper analyzes the currently overlooked pitfalls of (the second-type) weight decay and studies how to mitigate them by a gradient-norm-aware scheduler. The main contributions can be summarized as follows. First, supported by theoretical and empirical evidence, we discover that, weight decay can lead to large gradient norms especially at the final phase of training. The large gradient norm problem is significant in the presence of scheduled or adaptive learning rates, such as Adam. From the perspective of optimization, a large gradient norm at the final phase of training often leads to poor convergence. From the perspective of generalization, penalizing the gradient norm is regarded as beneficial regularization and may improve generalization    . However, previous studies fail to discover that the pitfalls of weight decay may sometimes significantly hurt convergence and generalization. Second, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of scheduled weight decay for mitigating large gradient norms and boosting performance. Inspired by the gradient-norm generalization measure and the stability analysis of stationary points, we show that weight decay should be scheduled with the gradient norm for adaptive gradient methods. We design a gradient-norm-aware scheduler for weight decay, called Scheduled Weight Decay (SWD), which significantly boosts the performance of weight decay and bridges the generalization gap between Adam and SGD. Adam with SWD (AdamS) is displayed in Algorithm 2. The empirical results in Table 1 using various DNNs support that SWD often significantly surpasses unscheduled weight decay for Adam. Structure of this paper.\nIn Section 2, we analyze the overlooked pitfalls of weight decay, namely large gradient norms.\nIn Section 3, we discuss why large gradient norms are undesired.\nIn Section 4, we propose SWD to mitigate the large gradient norm and boosting performance of Adam.\nIn Section 5, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of SWD.\nIn Section 6, we conclude our work.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: during training of DNNs and people do not need to schedule L2subscript𝐿2L_{2} regularization like learning rate decay.\nThe second type of weight decay was first proposed by Hanson and Pratt, [ref]13 to directly regularize the weight norm: where λ′superscript𝜆′\\lambda^{\\prime} is the (vanilla) weight decay hyperparameter.
