      "content": "Paper Title: Redeeming Intrinsic Rewards via Constrained Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile EIPO is agnostic to the choice of intrinsic rewards, we mainly experiment with RND \nbecause it is the state-of-the-art intrinsic reward method. EIPO implemented with RND is termed EIPO-RND and compared against several baselines below. All policies are learned using PPO [ref]13. EO (Extrinsic only): The policy is trained using extrinsic rewards only: π∗=arg​maxπ∈Π⁡JE​(π)superscript𝜋subscriptargmax𝜋Πsubscript𝐽𝐸𝜋\\pi^{*}=\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{\\pi\\in\\Pi}J_{E}(\\pi). RND (Random Network Distillation) : The policy is trained using the sum of extrinsic rewards (rtEsubscriptsuperscript𝑟𝐸𝑡r^{E}_{t}) and RND intrinsic rewards (λ​rtI𝜆subscriptsuperscript𝑟𝐼𝑡\\lambda r^{I}_{t}): π∗=arg​maxπ∈Π⁡JE+I​(π)superscript𝜋subscriptargmax𝜋Πsubscript𝐽𝐸𝐼𝜋\\pi^{*}=\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{\\pi\\in\\Pi}J_{E+I}(\\pi). For ATARI experiments, we chose a single value of λ𝜆\\lambda that worked best across games. Other methods below also use this λ𝜆\\lambda. EN (Ext-norm-RND): We found that a variant of RND where the extrinsic rewards are normalized using running mean and standard deviation (Appendix A.2.2) outperforms the original RND implementation, especially in games where RND performs worse than EO. Our method EIPO and other baselines below are therefore implemented using Ext-norm-RND. DY (Decay-RND): Instead of having a fixed trade-off between exploration and exploitation throughout training, dynamically adjusting exploration vs. exploitation can lead to better performance. Without theoretical results describing how to make such adjustments, a commonly used heuristic is to gradually transition from exploration to exploitation. One example is ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-greedy exploration , where ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon is decayed over the course of training. Similarly, we propose a variant of Ext-norm-RND where intrinsic rewards are progressively scaled down to eliminate exploration bias over time. Intrinsic rewards rtIsubscriptsuperscript𝑟𝐼𝑡r^{I}_{t} are scaled by λ​(i)𝜆𝑖\\lambda(i), where i𝑖i denotes the iteration number. The objective function turns into JE+I=𝔼π​[∑t=0∞γt​(rtE+λ​(i)​rtI)]subscript𝐽𝐸𝐼subscript𝔼𝜋delimited-[]subscriptsuperscript𝑡0superscript𝛾𝑡subscriptsuperscript𝑟𝐸𝑡𝜆𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝑟𝐼𝑡J_{E+I}=\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\Big{[}\\sum^{\\infty}_{t=0}\\gamma^{t}(r^{E}_{t}+\\lambda(i)r^{I}_{t})\\Big{]}, where λ​(i)𝜆𝑖\\lambda(i) is defined as λ​(i)=clip​(iI​(λmax−λmin),λmin,λmax)𝜆𝑖clip𝑖𝐼subscript𝜆maxsubscript𝜆minsubscript𝜆minsubscript𝜆max\\lambda(i)=\\textrm{clip}(\\dfrac{i}{I}(\\lambda_{\\textrm{max}}-\\lambda_{\\textrm{min}}),\\lambda_{\\textrm{min}},\\lambda_{\\textrm{max}}). Here, λmaxsubscript𝜆max\\lambda_{\\textrm{max}} and λminsubscript𝜆min\\lambda_{\\textrm{min}} denote the predefined maximum and minimum λ​(i)𝜆𝑖\\lambda(i), and I𝐼I is the iteration after which decay is fixed. We follow the linear decay schedule used to decay ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-greedy exploration in DQN . DC (Decoupled-RND) : The primary assumption in EIPO is that πE+Isubscript𝜋𝐸𝐼\\pi_{E+I} and πEsubscript𝜋𝐸\\pi_{E} are similar (Section 3.2). A recent work used this assumption in a different way to balance intrinsic and extrinsic rewards : they regularize the mixed policy to stay close to the extrinsic policy by minimizing the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence DKL(πE||πE+I)\\textrm{D}_{\\textrm{KL}}(\\pi_{E}||\\pi_{E+I}). However, they do not impose the extrinsic-optimality constraint, which is a key component in EIPO. Therefore, comparing against this method called Decoupled-RND (DC)  will help separate the gains in performance that come from making the similarity assumption versus the importance of extrinsic-optimality constraint. We adapted DC to make use of Ext-norm-RND intrinsic rewards:\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: with RND \nbecause it is the state-of-the-art intrinsic reward method.
