Notably, there is a standard operation\nwhich associates, to any set-family 𝒞⊆2V𝒞superscript2𝑉\\mathcal{C}\\subseteq 2^{V}, a set of balls of a graph G𝐺G as follows. The vertex set of G𝐺G is V∪{xC:C∈𝒞}𝑉conditional-setsubscript𝑥𝐶𝐶𝒞V\\cup\\{x_{C}:C\\in\\mathcal{C}\\}, the vertices of {xC:C∈𝒞}conditional-setsubscript𝑥𝐶𝐶𝒞\\{x_{C}:C\\in\\mathcal{C}\\} are pairwise adjacent,\nand there is an edge between xCsubscript𝑥𝐶x_{C} and v∈V𝑣𝑉v\\in V if and only if v∈C𝑣𝐶v\\in C. Then, the balls of radius 1 centered at the vertices xCsubscript𝑥𝐶x_{C} such that C∈𝒞𝐶𝒞C\\in\\mathcal{C} have the form C∪{xC:C∈𝒞}𝐶conditional-setsubscript𝑥𝐶𝐶𝒞C\\cup\\{x_{C}:C\\in\\mathcal{C}\\}.\nOn the other hand, one may hope that for graphs G𝐺G with a rich metric\nstructure, the geometric structure of the set ℬ⁡(G)ℬ𝐺\\operatorname{\\mathcal{B}}(G) may allow to efficiently construct NC-teaching maps, and, indeed, the results of our paper show that this is the case. Further,\nℬ⁡(G)ℬ𝐺\\operatorname{\\mathcal{B}}(G) may provide classes of graphs for which NCTD⁡(ℬ⁡(G))NCTDℬ𝐺\\operatorname{NCTD}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{B}}(G)) exceeds VCD⁡(ℬ⁡(G))VCDℬ𝐺\\operatorname{VCD}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{B}}(G)). For example, we prove that for trees of cycles NCTD⁡(ℬ⁡(G))≤4NCTDℬ𝐺4\\operatorname{NCTD}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{B}}(G))\\leq 4, while VCD⁡(ℬ⁡(G))≤3VCDℬ𝐺3\\operatorname{VCD}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{B}}(G))\\leq 3. Therefore, in light of the open question of   , it is natural to ask if, for trees of cycles, NCTD⁡(ℬ⁡(G))≤3NCTDℬ𝐺3\\operatorname{NCTD}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{B}}(G))\\leq 3. Trees of cycles are planar graphs, and\nfor planar graphs VCD⁡(ℬ⁡(G))≤4VCDℬ𝐺4\\operatorname{VCD}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{B}}(G))\\leq 4  , however, it is not clear how to show that NCTD⁡(ℬ⁡(G))NCTDℬ𝐺\\operatorname{NCTD}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{B}}(G)) is at most a relatively small constant for planar graphs (it is at most around 615615615 since, for any concept class 𝒞𝒞\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}}, NCTD⁡(𝒞)≤RTD​(𝒞)NCTD𝒞RTD𝒞\\operatorname{NCTD}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}})\\leq\\text{RTD}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}})   and RTD(𝒞)≤39.3752⋅VCD(𝒞)2−3.6330⋅VCD(𝒞)\\text{RTD}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}})\\leq 39.3752\\cdot\\operatorname{VCD}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}})^{2}-3.6330\\cdot\\operatorname{VCD}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}}) ). Lastly, this continues the work of [ref]10, in which SCSs for balls in graphs were studied, and B-NCTD+ is also\nclosely related to another problem in metric graph theory dealing with balls in graphs called r𝑟r-Identifying Codes .\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: 39.3752\\cdot\\operatorname{VCD}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}})^{2}-3.6330\\cdot\\operatorname{VCD}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}}) ).
