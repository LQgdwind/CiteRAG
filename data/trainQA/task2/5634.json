      "content": "Paper Title: A Coarse to Fine Framework for Object Detection in High Resolution Image\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare our approach with the overlap image partition (OIP) method to cut high-resolution images into some sub-images with overlapping on all datasets. Compared with evenly image partition, we implement OIP according to the property of the datasets to prevent the same object from being split into two different parts which may have hurt the AP of large objects. For TinyPerson, the image size after partition is 640√ó640. For CityPerson, the street scenario has regular distribution of objects, so we set the image size as 768√ó768 to keep large objects in one image part as much as possible. The parameters for training stage of image partition are the same as the fine detection stage. In addition, we also compare our method with representative state-of-the-art detectors on all datasets, including Faster-RCNN[ref]9, RetinaNet[ref]13 or TTFNet[ref]36. The backbone of our approach based on Faster-RCNN[ref]9 and RetinaNet[ref]13 is ResNet-50 and the backbone of TTFNet[ref]36 is DarkNet-53. The coarse detection stage and fine detection stage use the same state-of-the-art detector for our approach. As shown in Table I and Table II, The ‚Äòs‚Äô, ‚Äòm‚Äô, and ‚Äòl‚Äô represent small, medium, and large, respectively. The ‚Äòs1‚Äô and ‚Äòs2‚Äô represent the input image size of coarse detection and fine detection, respectively. The ‚Äò#img‚Äô is the number of images forwarded to the detector of fine detection and coarse detection. Experiment results show that our proposed approach achieves promising performance compared with other state-of-the-art detectors or methods. Our approach has a significant improvement over the detection with the down-sampled high-resolution image, especially for small and medium objects. The accuracy of large objects has a slight decrease compared with OIP method due to the down-sample in chip and NMS in the result fusion stage of large objects. The OIP method of high-resolution image can increase the detection accuracy, but greatly increase the image number to process. Our approach can reduce the number of images that need to process and improve the detection accuracy at the same time. When using the same backbone, our approach consistently outperforms such counterparts by margins, improving APs of the second-best by 4.4% and 1.1% with RetinaNet[ref]13 and TTFNet[ref]36 in Table I for CityPersons, respectively. For TinyPerson in Table II, our approach largely boosts the performance of other methods, and it improves the A‚ÄãPùê¥ùëÉAP, A‚ÄãP50ùê¥subscriptùëÉ50AP_{50} and A‚ÄãP75ùê¥subscriptùëÉ75AP_{75} of the second-best by 2.8%, 4.7% and 1.6%, respectively. As shown in Table III, compared with the original image, the relative size in chip generated by our approach has greatly improved, and the standard deviation of absolute size has decreased. Therefore, our approach improves the detection accuracy of small and medium objects by generating chips, ensures the detection accuracy of large objects through the coarse detection stage, and improves the accuracy of small objects through the center localization stage. Therefore, coarse detection is mainly used for detecting large objects and locating the approximate bounding boxes of the small and medium objects, if many small objects in the image are down-sampled, the precision of small objects can be seriously reduced, the center location is mainly used for locating the small object and reducing false alarm results, the fine detection is mainly used for improving the detection accuracy of the medium and small object.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: stage of image partition are the same as the fine detection stage. In addition, we also compare our method with representative state-of-the-art detectors on all datasets, including Faster-RCNN[ref]9, RetinaNet[ref]13 or TTFNet[ref]36. The backbone of our approach based on Faster-RCNN[ref]9 and RetinaNet[ref]13 is ResNet-50 and the backbone of TTFNet[ref]36 is DarkNet-53.
