      "content": "Paper Title: EVNet: An Explainable Deep Network for Dimension Reduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe dimensional reduction (DR) methods include parametric-free and parametric methods. The parametric-free DR method directly optimizes the embedding output corresponding to the input data rather than learning a continuous mapping function from the input to the embedding result. \nThese methods are widely acknowledged because of the proven system and low computation costs.\nSome approaches focus on preserving global information and are built around the principle of distance (or ‘dissimilarity’) preservation.\nFor example, MDS  characterizes the data relationships in low-dimensional space according to pairwise distance.\nISOMAP  improves MDS by describing the data relationships based on geodesic similarity.\nLLE  improves the MDS by introducing the linearity assumption for localized manifolds, allowing it to model linearly only locally.\nLaplacian Eigenmap (LapEig)  uses graph embedding methods to improve the representation process by introducing undirected graphs into the modeling process.\nIn addition, some methods introduce the manifold assumption to produce a non-linear embedding by emphasizing the local manifold structure.\nThe SNE method , for example, assumes that the distance between the data satisfies the normal distribution and transforms the pairwise distance into pairwise similarity by the normal kernel function.\nThe tSNE [ref]32 and LargeVis  improve SNE by substituting the t-distribution kernel function, resulting in a better global structure-preserving performance.\nUMAP  makes a significant reduction in computational cost by introducing negative samples.\nSuch above methods are widely used in data analysis fields such as life sciences and physics. A significant drawback of parametric-free DR method is their poor explainability.\nMost of them are non-linear methods. The non-linear property implies that these methods are difficult to understand.\nThe parameter-free property leads to the learned embedding knowledge not being stored in the model as parameters, making it impossible to generalize existing embeddings to newly collected datasets. Some parameter variants of the above methods are proposed to improve generability and explainability.\nTopological autoencoders (TAE)  and Geometry Regularized AutoEncoders (GRAE) , for example, train autoencoders directly with local distance constraints in the input space.\nIvis [ref]49 propose a triplet loss function with distance as a constraint to train the neural network.\nBased on tSNE and UMAP, parametric tSNE (PtSNE) [ref]31, and parametric UMAP (PUMAP)  introduce neural networks to learn a continues mapping from the input data to the output.\nRecently, Zang et al.  design a DR neural network that can process biological and image data based on the assumption of manifold flatness.\nWhile these methods have the potential to address generalization and explanation issues, these methods do not achieve satisfactory performance because they do not make practical improvements to the loss function and training form. The loss function of the parameter-free model is no longer suitable for the parametric approach, which inevitably causes a degradation of the optimization results.\n As a result, more applications, such as biological data visualization  , use non-parametric models rather than parametric models.\nWe expect to design a naturally explainable DR model that achieves high performance and explainability.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: for example, assumes that the distance between the data satisfies the normal distribution and transforms the pairwise distance into pairwise similarity by the normal kernel function.\nThe tSNE [ref]32 and LargeVis  improve SNE by substituting the t-distribution kernel function, resulting in a better global structure-preserving performance.\nUMAP  makes a significant reduction in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
