      "content": "Paper Title: Multimodal Explainability via Latent Shift applied to COVID-19 stratification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere is a general consensus that medical images complemented by clinical data can help physicians, and radiologist in particular, better understanding the patient’s state, thus advancing to a more informative decision making process  .\nIn this respect, research in the field of MDL has been increasing  since multimodal data give the opportunity to train models that can learn the complex dynamics behind a disease. The level at which the fusion of input modalities occurs in the network is usually distinguished into early, intermediate or late fusion .\nEarly fusion combines raw data or extracted features by the different modalities which are fed to a simple learner, whilst late fusion combines at the decision level the outputs of networks independently trained on each modality.\nIntermediate fusion learns a joint representation of different modalities at a shared representation layer, by propagating the loss back to the feature extractor network in an end-to-end manner. The application of AI in COVID-19 using medical imaging and clinical data has mainly focused on discriminating patients suffering from COVID-19 pneumonia from those which are healthy or affected by different types of pneumonia .\nNevertheless, only four work investigated patients’ stratification into mild and severe outcomes using such multimodal data [ref]9   , which can be further divided in three using computed tomography (CT) scans    and one using CXR images [ref]9. In  the authors proposed a deep network using CT scans and 535353 clinical features to detect the potential malignant progression of mild patients.\nVia a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) processing the clinical features only, their method gets an embedding that is then concatenated in an early fusion approach with the flattened CT scan.\nThis new vector then fed a Long short-term memory (LSTM) network followed by a fully-connected (FC) network, which produces the output.\nOn a private cohort of 199 patients, they obtained an accuracy of 79.20%percent79.2079.20\\%.\nIn  the authors used 130130130 clinical features and CT scans to discriminate between negative, mild and severe COVID-19 cases via an early fusion of a VGG-16 and a 7-layer FC network.\nThey used a private dataset containing 1521 patients, achieving an accuracy equal to 81.10%percent81.1081.10\\%.\nFang et al applied joint fusion combining CT scans and 616161 clinical features, which fed a deep network to predict COVID-19 malignant progression .\nThe approach extracts the abstract representations of CT images using a 3D ResNet, and of the clinical data via a FC network.\nThese two embeddings are concatenated and given to an LSTM followed by another FC network.\nThe whole architecture is training in an end-to-end modality.\nOn a private dataset containing 1040 patients they achieved an accuracy equal to 87.70%percent87.7087.70\\%. It is worth noting that CXR helps indicating abnormal formations of a large variety of chest diseases by using a very small amount of radiation, whilst CT delivers a much higher detail level of the lungs’ structures.\nFurthermore, X-ray equipment is much smaller, less complex, and with lower costs than CT scans; it also prevents other three limitations of CT imaging, i.e., the lack of available machines’ slots, the difficulty of moving bedridden patients, and the long sanitation times.\nFor these reasons, several authors indicated that CXR imaging fit well with the needs of COVID-19 pandemic [ref]24.\nLet us now focus on the only work that uses CXR images and clinical data for the COVID-19 prognosis [ref]9.\nThere, the authors presented three different multimodal AI approaches, offering also baseline performance on the AIforCOVID dataset, which we will present in section 4 together with the best results attained.\nThe first method, named as handcrafted approach, computed first-order and texture features from the images, which are then stacked in an early fusion fashion with the clinical features, then feeding different learners among which the Support Vector Machine resulted to be the best.\nThe second approach, referred to as hybrid, combines automatic features extracted by a convolutional neural network with the clinical ones; then it runs a feature selection stage whose output is given to the learner.\nThe hybrid approach achieved the best results using the GoogleNet and the Support Vector Machine classifier.\nThe third approach, named as end-to-end, performs intermediate fusion of the two modalities by defining a multi-input network concatenating hidden vectors of the two modalities.\nThis architecture contains three main branches: two process independently CXR scans and clinical features to get a small number of relevant and abstract features, while the third one concatenates such embeddings that is given to a FC network, which outputs the prognosis.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: from those which are healthy or affected by different types of pneumonia .\nNevertheless, only four work investigated patients’ stratification into mild and severe outcomes using such multimodal data [ref]9   , which can be further divided in three using computed tomography (CT) scans    and one using CXR images [ref]9.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
