      "content": "Paper Title: System and Design Technology Co-optimization of SOT-MRAM for High-Performance AI Accelerator Memory System\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning (DL) has precipitated the computing hardware community to continually design innovative AI/DL accelerators with large data processing capabilities. Research shows that the AI/DL model accuracy improves as training data set size grows [ref]1. With increasing data set, model size also grows. Consequently, memory demand in AI/DL accelerators will also grow asymptotically linearly with model and data size [ref]1 . As a result, the bottleneck for state-of-the-art AI/DL models in the accelerator hardware is now memory rather than data and compute availability, and we expect this trend to worsen in the future . The lack of efficient and high-performance data flow between the computing and memory element (i.e., the memory wall or memory bottleneck) masks the improvement coming from the efficient compute system [ref]5. One promising solution to the memory bottleneck of AI-specific workload is to increase the on-chip memory capacity. For both training and inference, the on-chip memory capacity in the accelerator needs to be increased to ensure that the intermediate activations, as well as the weights of the current layer, can be loaded. Moreover, significantly more memory is required during training to store the gradients and optimizer states. Inadequate on-chip memory capacity causes frequent DRAM accesses which exacerbates energy costs, as well as stalls the compute cores of AI/DL accelerator until the data is fetched. Because of this large capacity demand, an SRAM-based on-chip memory system can be detrimental due to leakage energy and area inefficiency. The promising features, such as high density, near-zero leakage power, immunity against radiation-induced soft errors, and CMOS compatibility of emerging Spin-based non-volatile (NVM) magnetic memory (i.e., MRAM) technologies, attracted researchers from academia and industry . Spin Transfer Torque (STT) MRAM, has already shifted its gear from the R&D phase to commercialization as the NAND-based embedded flash replacement  . However, MRAM in its regular form cannot be used in AI accelerators due to its slow write speed and high write energy . STT-MRAM, a two-terminal magnetic memory with Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) as the storing element, flows a bidirectional spin-polarized current through the MTJ for read-write operation . The major challenges of STT-MRAM - poor write performance, Read Disturbance (RD), retention failure,  - stem from two main reasons. First, the high write current flowing through the MTJ accounts for almost 10×10\\times energy consumption as SRAM. Large write delay (> ns range) resulting from spin injection symmetry in switching the magnetic orientation of free layer belittles STT-MRAM’s feasibility as an on-chip cache . The stress on the dielectric oxide of the MTJ due to the large write current accelerates the time-dependent wear out of the cell . Second, its shared read-write path makes it vulnerable to RD. SOT MRAM, considered the next generation of STT-MRAM, offers high performance without compromising reliability issues such as RD. SOT-MRAM is a three-terminal memory cell that uses MTJ as the storing element . By splitting the read-write path and using a different switching scheme, SOT-MRAM resolves all the challenges of STT-MRAM while retaining its every benefit     . Isolate read and write path allows the designer to optimize the read and write path independently, decreasing the write current and increasing the read-write operating margin, thus solving the RD-induced reliability issues. Though lacking mass-scale production from foundries due to early-stage manufacturing challenges,  \n   [ref]17 have demonstrated the successful fabrication of SOT-MRAM with attractive specifications. Its attractive features, such as high density, reliability and endurance, zero leakage, read-write latency comparable to SRAM, and research effort to enable mass production make it one of the best candidates for AI accelerator memory system where large on-chip memory is a must for training and inference. The performance of an AI accelerator depends on both the compute and memory throughput of the device. While most accelerators have enough compute throughput, their performance is limited by memory throughput operating in the memory bound region. To address the memory bound problem of the AI hardware, in this paper, we perform a closed-loop STCO on AI workloads and DTCO on SOT-MRAM to present a hybrid memory system. To our knowledge, this is the first work that analyzes and evaluates the performance of SOT-MRAM as the on-chip memory of AI accelerators targeting both inference and training. The STCO-DTCO methodology is shown in Fig. 1, and the key contributions of the paper are highlighted as follows. We present a power and performance-optimized hybrid memory system for Deep Learning (DL) accelerators through a workload-aware STCO and DTCO. Comprised of off-chip HBM3 DRAM, on-chip SRAMs, and DTCO-enabled SOT-MRAM, the hybrid memory system can support the training and inference of DL workloads. We perform a closed-loop STCO and DTCO by taking into account the (i) System performance attributes (e.g., throughput and energy cost); (ii) Architectural and micro-architectural attributes (e.g., compute resources utilization, memory bandwidth) (iii) Workload attributes at both training and inference (e.g., runtime action counts, dataflow and data reuse) to reach the Pareto optimal solution. Using the Deep Learning models’ execution profiles, DTCO enables device and circuit level customization of read/write bandwidth, retention time, and capacity of SOT-MRAM memory banks to meet the bandwidth and capacity demands of DL workloads. To achieve dynamic runtime optimization of the power and performance of the accelerator hardware for diverse workloads, memory banks are individually optimized with various bandwidths and capacities. Finally, using various DNN benchmarks, we provide a comparative analysis of the existing SRAM-based memory system and the proposed DTCO-STCO optimized hybrid memory system for AI accelerators. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section II discusses the background. In Section III, we present the analytical model for DNN workload profiling, followed by the DTCO of SOT-MRAM in Section IV. Sections V and VI present the results & analysis, and related works, respectively, following the conclusion in Section VII.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: hardware community to continually design innovative AI/DL accelerators with large data processing capabilities.
