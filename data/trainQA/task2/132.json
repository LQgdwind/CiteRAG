      "content": "Paper Title: Parallel Clique Counting and Peeling Algorithms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEnvironment.\nWe run most of our experiments on a machine with\n30 cores (with two-way hyper-threading),\nwith 3.8GHz Intel Xeon Scalable (Cascade Lake) processors and 240 GiB\nof main memory. For our large compressed graphs, we use a machine with\n80 cores (with two-way hyper-threading),\nwith 2.6GHz Intel Xeon E7 (Broadwell E7) processors and 3844 GiB of\nmain memory. We compile our programs with g++ (version 7.3.1)\nusing the -O3 flag. We use OpenMP for our k𝑘k-clique counting runtimes, and we use a lightweight scheduler called Homemade\nfor our k𝑘k-clique peeling runtimes .\nWe terminate\nany experiment that takes over 5 hours, except for experiments on\nthe large compressed graphs. Graph Inputs. We test our algorithms on real-world\ngraphs from the Stanford Network Analysis Project\n(SNAP) , CMU’s Lemur\nproject , and the WebDataCommons\ndataset [ref]34. The details of the graphs are in Table 1,\nand we show additional statistics in the appendix. Algorithm Implementations. We test different\norientations for our counting and peeling algorithms, including the\nGoodrich-Pszona and Barenboim-Elkin orientations from Section\n3.1, with ε=1𝜀1\\varepsilon=1. We\nalso test other orientations that do not give work-efficient\nand polylogarithmic-span bounds, but are fast in\npractice, including the orientation given by ranking vertices by\nnon-decreasing degree, the orientation given by the k𝑘k-core\nordering , and the orientation given by the original\nordering of vertices in the graph. Moreover, we compare our algorithms against\nkClist , which contains state-of-the-art parallel\nand sequential k𝑘k-clique counting algorithms, and sequential k𝑘k-clique peeling\nimplementations. kClist additionally includes a parallel\napproximate k𝑘k-clique peeling implementation. We include a simple\nmodification to their k𝑘k-clique counting code to support faster k𝑘k-clique\ncounting, where we simply return the number of\nk𝑘k-cliques instead of iterating over each k𝑘k-clique in the final level of recursion.\nkClist also\noffers the option of node or edge parallelism, but only offers a\nk𝑘k-core ordering to orient the input graphs. Note that\nkClist does not offer a choice of orientation. We additionally compare our counting algorithms to Jain and\nSeshadhri’s Pivoter algorithm , Mhedhbi and\nSalihoglu’s worst-case optimal join algorithm\n(WCO) , Lai et al.’s implementation of a\nbinary join algorithm (BinaryJoin) , and Pinar\net al.’s ESCAPE algorithm . Note\nthat Pivoter is designed for counting all cliques, and the latter\nthree algorithms are designed for general subgraph counting. Finally, we\ncompare our approximate k𝑘k-clique counting algorithm to Bressan et\nal.’s MOTIVO algorithm for approximate subgraph\ncounting , which is more general. For k𝑘k-clique peeling,\nwe compare to Fang et al.’s CoreApp\nalgorithm  and Tsourakakis’s \ntriangle densest subgraph implementation.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: on\nthe large compressed graphs.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
