Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: SHAQ: Incorporating Shapley Value Theory into Multi-Agent Q-Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we show the experimental results of SHAQ on Predator-Prey [ref]17 and various tasks in StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) 111The version that we use in this paper is SC2.4.6.2.69232 rather than the newer SC2.4.10. As reported from [ref]35, the performance is not comparable across versions.. The baselines that we select for comparison are COMA , VDN [ref]8, QMIX , MASAC , QTRAN , QPLEX  and W-QMIX (including CW-QMIX and OW-QMIX) [ref]35. The implementation details of our algorithm are shown in Appendix B.1, whereas the implementation of baselines are from [ref]35 222The source code of baseline implementation is from https://github.com/oxwhirl/wqmix.. We also compare SHAQ with SQDDPG  333The code of SQDDPG is implemented based on https://github.com/hsvgbkhgbv/SQDDPG., which is shown in Appendix C.3. For all experiments, we use the ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-greedy exploration strategy, where ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon is annealed from 1 to 0.05. The annealing time steps vary among different experiments. For Predator-Prey, we apply 1 million time steps for annealing, following the setup from . For the easy and hard maps in SMAC, we apply 50k time steps for annealing, the same as that in ; while for the super-hard maps in SMAC, we apply 1 million time steps for annealing to obtain more explorations so that more state-action pairs can be visited. About the replay buffer size, we set as 5000 for all algorithms that is the same as that in [ref]35. To fairly evaluate all algorithms, we run each experiment with 5 random seeds. All graphs showing experimental results are plotted with the median and 25%-75% quartile shading. About the interpretability of algorithms, we evaluate the algorithms with both both ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-greedy policy (i.e., ϵ=0.8italic-ϵ0.8\\epsilon=0.8) for obtaining mixed optimal and suboptimal actions and greedy policy for obtaining pure optimal actions. The ablation study of SHAQ is shown in Appendix C.4.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: In this section, we show the experimental results of SHAQ on Predator-Prey [ref]17 and various tasks in StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) 111The version that we use in this paper is SC2.4.6.2.69232 rather than the newer SC2.4.10.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
