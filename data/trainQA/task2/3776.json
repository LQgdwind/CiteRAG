      "content": "Paper Title: Bayesian Negative Sampling for Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNegative sampling originates from the Positive-Unlabel (PU) problem¬† : A training dataset, called PU-dataset, contains both positively labelled and unlabeled instances, yet an unlabeled instance could belong to either the positive or negative class. Negative sampling is to determine a policy for guiding how to sample an unlabeled instance from a PU-dataset, so as to effectively train downstream task models. Negative sampling can find many applications in diverse tasks, such as natural language processing (NLP)¬†[ref]3 , computer vision (CV)¬† , as well as recommendation systems (RS)¬† [ref]8 . We focus on negative sampling for recommendation. Many recommendation tasks can be formulated as how to rank unlabeled items for users, yet an unlabeled item is specific to one user, called his negative instance. Most recommendation algorithms adopt a pairwise learning framework to train a recommendation model with learnable users‚Äô and items‚Äô representations for the ranking computation¬†0 1 2 3. A pairwise comparison is to first form a training triple (u,i,j)ùë¢ùëñùëó(u,i,j) consisting of his positive instance iùëñi and negative instance jùëój for a user uùë¢u, and the pairwise loss over all users is optimized for training a recommendation model. The dilemma of such pairwise comparisons lies in that a training triple consists of a negative instance of a user, yet such a negative instance could be potentially interested by the same user and should be recommended by the trained model. This motivates the problem of negative sampling for recommendation. that is, how to effectively sample negative instances for training a recommendation model. Many studies have shown that negative sampling is important to improving recommendation performance¬† [ref]8  4 5 6 7. Recently, some negative sampling algorithms have been proposed for recommendation. We group them into the following categories. Static negative sampling¬†0 8 [ref]3 2 9 0 1. Algorithms of this kind are to sample a negative instance according to a fixed sampling distribution, such as uniform sampling. Hard negative sampling¬† [ref]8 1 2. Algorithms of this kind favor those negative instances with representations more similar to that of positive instances in the embedding space, for example, selecting higher scored or higher ranked instances¬† [ref]8 3, however they are more likely to suffer from the negative problem, as reported in some recent studies¬†  . A recent algorithm SRNS¬† of this kind advocates sampling a negative with a large variance of its predicted scores in the training precess. In this paper, we contribute to the negative sampling studies in the field of implicit CF in three aspects: (i) On the basis of order relation analysis of negatives‚Äô scores, we derive the class conditional density of true negatives and that of false negatives, and provide an affirmative answer from a Bayesian viewpoint to distinguish true negatives from false negatives (RQ1). (ii) According to the asymptotic property of the empirical distribution function, we defined a model-agnostic estimator of an instance being true negative as a quantitative negative signal measure (RQ2). In particular, it is an unbiased posterior probability estimate of an instance being true negative that combines prior information (model-independent) with sample information (model-dependent). (iii) We also propose a Bayesian sampling rule to sample high-quality negative instances (RQ3). It is the theoretically optimal sampling rule that minimizes the empirical sampling risk. Experiment studies validate our analysis and solution in terms of sampling quality and recommendation performance.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: an unlabeled instance from a PU-dataset, so as to effectively train downstream task models.
