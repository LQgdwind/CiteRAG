      "content": "Paper Title: HiFlash: Communication-Efficient Hierarchical Federated Learning with Adaptive Staleness Control and Heterogeneity-aware Client-Edge Association\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNowadays, federated learning (FL) has gained growing attention as it collaboratively trains a global machine learning (ML) model in distributed manner without exposing the data from private clients [ref]1 [ref]2. During the training procedure of FL, the (local/global) model updates are iteratively exchanged between clients and the cloud server until reaching a desirable accurate model, thus it achieves a privacy-preserving learning by leaving training data on local clients. Various popular AI applications such as computer vision , language processing  and human activity recognition  have been derived within this framework. For many existing FL systems, regardless of synchronous update (e.g., FedAvg [ref]1 and its variants  ) or asynchronous update (e.g., FedAsync [ref]8), massive model parameters need to be exchanged in multiple update iterations. However, clients geographically scattered over the edges of networks are usually connected to a remote cloud server through wide-area networks (WAN) and long-distance transmissions, which would incur high communication cost and serious network congestion. Such communication inefficiency would greatly deteriorate the system performance of large-scale distributed training and further hinder the wide deployment of FL systems in practice. Hence, the research issue of boosting the communication efficiency of FL has recently drawn great attention. Hierarchical architecture is a promising solution to alleviate the huge communication pressure of the cloud server, since an order of magnitude fewer data-size of model update would be transferred to cloud by aggregating local models at the lower layer in advance. Due to the merits of mobile edge computing (MEC) in practice, edge nodes (e.g., 5G edge servers) can be set as the intermediates for local model aggregation . The rationales are as follows: 1) due to shorter routing path and less hop distance in the local-area network (LAN), a lower network delay and reduced network jitter are offered in the edge layer . Further, the straggler problem caused by less effective communication between cloud and clients can be significantly alleviated; 2) compared to high monetary cost of WAN usage in traditional FL, abundant cheaper LAN resources at the edge nodes promote FL deployment in reality ; 3) FL applications are commonly scattered over massive devices, which are naturally clustered into many edge domains (e.g., campus and hospital) . This distributed pattern can be well accommodated in hierarchical FL. Motivated by these facts, a new paradigm of client-edge-cloud hierarchical FL has recently been put forward , , which involves two levels of synchronous model aggregations, i.e., client model aggregation controlled by the edge nodes at lower layer, edge model aggregation controlled by the cloud server at higher layer. This framework aims at leveraging the advantage of synchronous update to train global model with high accuracy and fast convergence at the lower layer, benefited from high LAN bandwidth and sufficient computation resources at the edge nodes. However, a severe straggler problem at the higher layer would be incurred due to the edge heterogeneity (e.g., diverse WAN connection conditions and heterogeneous edge aggregation time due to different client size) and the communication bottleneck from edge to cloud. More explicitly, large waiting time in synchronous global model aggregation at the higher layer is inevitable. To fully unleash the benefits of hierarchical FL, in this paper we incorporates the merits of synchronous and asynchronous operations in different aggregation layers into the hierarchical FL, which we call HiFL in order to differentiate it from HierFAVG, the version of hierarchical FL with two levels of synchronous model aggregations. As depicted in Fig. 1, confronted with huge edge heterogeneity and complicated WAN environment among edge nodes and cloud, asynchronous update is adopted for edge-cloud model aggregation to improve learning efficiency via wait-free communication. At the lower layer, synchronous model aggregation between clients and edge nodes ensures high accuracy and fast convergence. Moreover, benefited from high LAN bandwidth and sufficient computation resources at the edges in the communication-efficient one-hop access edge network environment, the straggler problem is very mild and can be neglected during synchronous client-edge aggregation, compared with the asynchronous edge-cloud aggregation communications over the latency-significant WAN. Nevertheless, HiFL also brings in new challenges on account of the asynchronous aggregation and hierarchical mechanism design. On one hand, staleness effect arised in asynchronous update negatively impacts on the model accuracy and convergence speed . Existing staleness-tolerant mechanisms usually dampen the impacts of stale model updates by only controlling the trade-off between convergence rate and variance reduction according to the staleness [ref]8. However, its impact on system efficiency (e.g., training time, resource efficiency) is much less considered. For example, a model with large staleness may marginally contribute to the global model, which results in more rounds of communication to reach a target accuracy for asynchronous FL. Thus, it is critical to control the model staleness for communication-efficient model learning. On the other hand, the hierarchical mechanism introduces data heterogeneity among edges, which can be further amplified by the hierarchical client-edge-cloud model aggregation and lead to degraded model performance . Besides, the resource heterogeneity among the edge-associated clients can exacerbate the straggler effects, possibly prolonging the waiting time in client-edge model aggregation. To cope with the above challenges, in this paper we first investigate HiFL to gain useful theoretical insights about its performance bound and system efficiency, and then identify the key controllable parameters that affect the learning performance. Motivated by our theoretical results, we devise an adaptive staleness control strategy for edge-cloud layer and a heterogeneity-aware association mechanism for client-edge layer to improve the overall efficiency of HiFL. For staleness control, existing approaches usually assume a pre-defined fixed threshold for the participating clients, which can not well adapt to the realistic dynamic environment. Moreover, the threshold determination is non-trivial due to the complicated FL environments (e.g., data and resource heterogeneity of clients, current running stages of FL model). Differently, we resort to the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method and design a DRL agent based on Deep Q-Network (DQN)  to wisely make adaptive staleness threshold decisions tailored to the dynamic and complicated FL environments. The DRL agent is trained through a Double DQN for increased efficiency and robustness. For client-edge association, we devise an efficient weighted heuristic to find a near optimal solution that jointly minimizes the data heterogeneity among the edges and resource heterogeneity in the edge-associated clients. In summary, this paper makes the following contributions: To achieve communication-efficient and accurate model learning, we resort to HiFL, a hierarchical federated learning approach that performs synchronous client-edge model aggregation and asynchronous edge-cloud model aggregation. Rigorous theoretical analysis for the convergence of HiFL is provided, including both convex and non-convex learning objectives. Inspired by the theoretical convergence analysis, we further advocate an enhanced design of HiFlash, which introduces adaptive staleness control and heterogeneity-aware client-edge association based on HiFL. The HiFlash approach enables large-scale deployment with boosted model performance and system efficiency. We devise a DRL agent based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for adaptive staleness control with elaborative learning reward design in order to improve system efficiency without compromising model accuracy. To mitigate the accuracy degradation and straggler effect caused by data and resource heterogeneity, we establish an efficient weighted heuristic of low-complexity for client-edge association that well balances the trade-off between model accuracy and system efficiency. Extensive experiments are conducted using three widely adopted image classification datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of HiFlash, demonstrating that HiFlash significantly outperforms other FL based approaches in communication efficiency without compromising model accuracy. For example, even under highly skewed data distributions among clients, HiFlash can still achieve a high model accuracy, and meanwhile greatly reduces communication overhead, e.g., with a reduction ratio of 42%percent4242\\% and 89%percent8989\\% over the benchmarks of HierFAVG and FedAvg, respectively. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the preliminaries on FL and DRL. Section 3 introduces a hierarchical FL approach named HiFL. In Section 4, we provide theoretical analysis for HiFL, and further devise HiFlash, an enhanced HiFL with adaptive staleness control and heterogeneity-aware client-edge association in Section 5. Extensive experiments are conducted in Section 6. We review the related work in Section 7 and conclude the paper in Section 8.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Nowadays, federated learning (FL) has gained growing attention as it collaboratively trains a global machine learning (ML) model in distributed manner without exposing the data from private clients [ref]1 [ref]2.
