      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Improvement Heuristics for Graph Combinatorial Optimization Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlthough Neural Networks (NN) have been used since the decade of the 80s to solve COPs in the form of Hopfield Networks , it is only recently   that advancements in computation power and the development of sophisticated architectures have enabled more efficient and increasingly competitive applications. As mentioned previously, NN-based optimization methods can be divided into two main groups according to their strategy. Most of the DL-based works develop policies to learn a constructive heuristic. These methods start from an empty solution and iteratively add an item to the solution until it is completed. In one of the earliest works in the Neural Combinatorial Optimization paradigm, Bello et al. [ref]8 used a Pointer Network model  to parameterize a policy that constructs a solution, item by item, for the TSP. Motivated by the results in [ref]8, and mainly focusing on the TSP, DL practitioners have successfully implemented different architectures such as Graph Neural Networks (GNN)   or Attention-based Networks [ref]9 . Since the performance of the baseline models is still far from optimality (mostly in instances with more than a few hundred nodes), they are usually enhanced with supplementary algorithms, such as active search [ref]8, sampling [ref]9 or beam search , which augment the solution diversity at the cost of increasing the computational time. As will be seen in the following, improvement methods offer a more efficient alternative, directly learning the transition from the current solution to a better one. Neural Improvement (NI) methods depart from a given solution, and iteratively propose a (set of) modification(s) to improve it until the solution cannot be further improved. NI methods utilize the learned policy to navigate intelligently across the different neighborhoods. To that end, the architectures previously used for constructive methods have been reused for implementing improvement methods. Chen et al.  use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to parameterize two models: the first model outputs a score or probability for each region of the solution to be rewritten, while a second model selects the rule that modifies that region. Lu et al. [ref]12 use the Attention-based model to select a local operator among a pool of operators to solve the capacitated vehicle routing problem (VRP). Using also an attention network, Hottung et al.  propose a Neural Large Neighborhood Search that suggests new solutions destroying and repairing parts of the current solution. Closer to our proposal, but limited to routing problems, Wu et al.  train a policy that selects the node-pair to apply a local operator, e.g. 2-opt. Similarly, da Costa et al.  generalize the prior work to select k-opt operators. Falkner et al.  propose an improvement method to tackle the job scheduling problem which learns how to control the local search in three aspects: acceptance of the solution, neighborhood selection and perturbations. We have summarized the characteristics of the most relevant NI works in Table I. Improvement methods do not only incorporate the stationary instance data, but also need to consider the present solution. In fact, the difficulty of encoding the solution information into a latent space is a major challenge for most of the combinatorial problems. As an example, there are various ways of representing solutions in routing problems. Each node (or city) can maintain a set of features that indicate the relative position in the current solution, such as the location and distance to the previously and subsequently visited nodes [ref]12. However, this technique does not consider the whole solution as one, as it only contemplates consecutive pairs of nodes in the solution. A common strategy in this case is to incorporate Positional Encodings (PE), which capture the sequence of the visited cities (nodes) in a given solution [ref]9. Recently, Ma et al.  proposed a cyclic PE that captures the circularity and symmetry of the routing problem, making it more suitable for representing solutions than the conventional PE. Nevertheless, in some graph problems the essential information is codified solely in the edges, and thus, prior methods that focus on node embeddings [ref]12  are not capable of properly encoding the relative information. Even though there are few works that consider edge weights to encode problem specific features  , they focus on creating a heatmap of probabilities for each edge to belong to the optimal solution, and use it to construct (or sample) a (set of) solution(s).\nIn this work, similar to  , we utilize nodes and edges to represent graph data. However, what sets our approach apart is its ability to encode both instance and solution information, and then use this encoded information to propose a local improving move.\nIn addition, when compared to , we provide some guidelines for generalizing to different graph-based problems, by considering both node and edge features. Furthermore, unlike , we do not rely on positional encodings to embed current solution information, as we naturally embed it in the edge features. Lastly, we propose a standalone neural improvement model and demonstrate how to combine it with classical local search techniques like multi-start hill climbing, tabu search, or iterative local search. In the following section, we will present an optimization problem that illustrates the need to develop new NI models that also consider edge features.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: methods start from an empty solution and iteratively add an item to the solution until it is completed.
