      "content": "Paper Title: PredDiff: Explanations and Interactions from Conditional Expectations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe consider a classification task, where a classifier fcsubscript𝑓𝑐f_{c} provides access to the conditional probability of class c𝑐c, i.e., fc​(x,y):=p​(c|x,y)assignsubscript𝑓𝑐𝑥𝑦𝑝conditional𝑐𝑥𝑦f_{c}(x,y):=p(c|x,y).\nOne way of assessing the relevance of a particular set of features Y𝑌Y is to compare the original prediction p​(c|x,y)𝑝conditional𝑐𝑥𝑦p(c|x,y) to the prediction p​(c|x)𝑝conditional𝑐𝑥p(c|x), where the feature(s) Y𝑌Y has(ve) been removed.\nFor an arbitrary classifier, this can be implemented in a probabilistically sound manner by m-arginalizing Y𝑌Y  via Here, p​(Y|x)𝑝conditional𝑌𝑥p(Y|x) represents the true generative distribution for reconstructing Y𝑌Y given the remaining features X𝑋X evaluated at x𝑥x. In practice, we typically draw a fixed number of random samples from an empirical imputer distribution q​(Y|x)𝑞conditional𝑌𝑥q(Y|x) that approximates p​(Y|x)𝑝conditional𝑌𝑥p(Y|x), see Appendix B for more numerical details. Therefore, PredDiff does not suffer from an unfavorable factorial scaling with the number of involved features.\nAdditionally, one straightforwardly obtains confidence intervals for relevance scores via empirical bootstrapping.\nIn this sense, the approach is completely domain- and task-agnostic, provided an appropriate generative model for imputation. In terms of imputer distributions q​(Y|x)𝑞conditional𝑌𝑥q(Y|x), one can broadly distinguish between marginal imputer distributions, which completely neglect the dependence on x𝑥x and therefore in general inevitably produce off-manifold samples, and x𝑥x-dependent conditional imputer distributions. It is worth noting that all perturbation-based attributions methods have to deal with this issue. For Shapley values, this is captured in the recent discussion on interventional as compared to observational Shapley values [ref]23  . In our experiments, we always present results for a conditional as well as a marginal imputer to give the reader a qualitative impression of the impact of imputer choice. A detailed comparison is deferred to future work. As a final remark, we stress that the probabilistic interpretation of Eq. 1 clearly requires the use of a conditional imputer distribution. In general, PredDiff relevances are obtained by comparing the occluded prediction to the sample prediction.\nSeveral possibilities have been proposed in the literature .\nHere, we compare logarithmic differences, which are interpreted as the information difference conveyed by Y𝑌Y, i.e., see Sec. 2.2 for a novel argument favoring this choice. We stress that this equally applies to other attribution methods, see Sec. 2.3. We avoid issues with vanishing probabilities, as in , by means of a Laplace correction, i.e., by mapping p→(p​M+1)/(M+K)→𝑝𝑝𝑀1𝑀𝐾p\\to(p\\,M+1)/(M+K), where M𝑀M is the number of training instances and K𝐾K the number of classes.\nAs a second remark, the probabilistic interpretation of Eq. 1 relies on the identification of fcsubscript𝑓𝑐f_{c} with a proper probability distribution. On general grounds, having a well-calibrated classifier is desirable for any classifier.\nIn this work, we use temperature-scaling, which scales the pre-softmax activations by a single global scaling factor in order to shift the prediction confidence appropriately, to achieve this . Turning to regression problems, where we infer relevances with respect to a particular model f​(x,y)𝑓𝑥𝑦f(x,y).\nHence, only the class subscript in Eq. 1 is suppressed, i.e., Here, the target is directly meaningful and therefore, we directly consider centered m𝑚m-values via  [ref]35 [ref]46 with a slight abuse of notation in order to unify regression and classification tasks as far as possible. We discuss different properties of PredDiff attributions in Appendix D. PredDiff satisfies the classic Shapley axioms on sensitivity, linearity and symmetry.\nHowever, the completeness axiom–i.e., summing up all feature relevances is equal to the prediction plus some reference value–only holds under particular circumstances.\nHowever, it holds in the case where it is indispensable, namely for linear models with independent features. Here, PredDiff relevances in fact coincide with Shapley values, see Appendix E.\nWe present a comprehensive discussion of the completeness axiom in Sec. 2.3.4.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: all perturbation-based attributions methods have to deal with this issue. For Shapley values, this is captured in the recent discussion on interventional as compared to observational Shapley values [ref]23  .
