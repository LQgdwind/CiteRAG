[ref]3 find augmenting the observations with cutout  helps improve generalization.\nLee et al.  propose to use a randomized convolutional layer for randomly perturbing the input observations.\nApart from cutout and random convolution, Laskin et al.  further evaluate a wide spectrum of data augmentations on improving generalization. Concurrently, Kostrikov et al.  propose DrQ to apply data augmentations in model-free RL algorithms. Rather than finding the best augmentation for all tasks, Raileanu et al.  propose to automatically select an appropriate augmentation for each given task. In addition to increasing training diversity, regularization techniques such as ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2} regularization, dropout  and batch normalization  also help improve RL agents’ generalizability  [ref]3 .\nOur work follows the direction of increasing training diversity but proposes a more effective approach than prior data augmentation techniques. It can be combined with other methods such as ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2} regularization to yield further improvement. Our work is also related to mixup  in supervised learning.\nMixup establishes a linear relationship between the interpolation of the features and that of the class labels, increasing the generalization and robustness of the trained classification model.\nThe authors of  argued the interpolation principle seems like a reasonable inductive bias that can be possibly extended to RL. Inspired by this, our work investigates on whether enforcing a linear relationship between interpolations of observations and supervision signals helps improve generalization in RL and how it affects the learned policy. To the best of our knowledge, only one existing work  applies mixup in RL but their aim is\ndistinct from ours. They uses mixup regularization for learning a reward function while our target is improving generalization.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Generalization in RL draws increasing attention in recent years.\nSome works [ref]3 [ref]29 [ref]2 show the generalization gap comes from the limited diversity of training environments.\nThis provides a direction to minimize the generalization gap via increasing the training\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
