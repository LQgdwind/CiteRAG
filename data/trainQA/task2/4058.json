      "content": "Paper Title: A Memory System of a Robot Cognitive Architecture and its Implementation in ArmarX\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn artificial cognitive architectures, memory is an essential part of the system. Thus, almost every system described in the survey in  models some sort of memory. As described above, working memory, procedural memory, and semantic memory are commonly represented, while sensory memory and episodic memory are explicitly modeled by only a few. However, existing memory systems of cognitive architectures are often criticized for having the wrong focus , since in some artificial systems (e. g.    ), the memory is only assumed to be passive storage. This means that memory has no active state and that new information that enters the system has no influence on how existing information is represented, processed or interpreted.\nInstead, memory should be an active part of the system that changes during operation. The memory itself must be able to adapt to circumstances and respond to new data. Some architectures partially implement this requiremen,e. g. in Soar  where the WM does not react to new data while the LTM involves learning from new data.\nIn addition, many cognitive architectures focus on the implementation of different types of memory without considering the interconnection between them   , associating entities of different modalities. Sometimes, only association between homogeneous data types is possible  .\nWithout the possibility to store multi-modal information and to associate multi-modal memories, it is difficult for the system to draw common conclusions from knowledge obtained from different sources. Few systems hide the ability to associate information behind neural networks that learn a connection of data sources . Such associations are however useless for applications outside the neural network, such as reasoning components.\n also criticized the way how information is represented in artificial memory systems. Physiologically, all areas of memory are the same, i. e. there is no structural difference between WM, episodic memory or semantic memory. Hence, we believe that memory should support an inherently episodic structure and that the information stored in memory must have a unified representation. Artificial cognitive architectures usually utilize specialized representations and manage modality-specific knowledge in modality-specific containers       . In addition to the identified requirements by  and closely related to an active memory, we emphasize that introspection is another key component of memory and data representation as it allows the system to adapt its behavior based on the stored information, to learn and use the information for e. g. internal simulation, augmentation and prediction. Thus, introspection is also strongly related to the ability to monitor the system’s internal cognitive processes. Some cognitive architectures only focus on the perception-action coupling , however, other architectures explicitly model this capability [ref]32  . In summary, we believe that a memory must be active, inherently episodic and multi-modal, associative and introspective. Only a memory that supports all these characteristics is able to adapt to new situations and respond to new data, have a unified representation of knowledge and support the overall system with data-driven services and data tracing for high-level abilities such as reasoning, explanation, prospection, augmentation or simulation. A more detailed explanation of these characteristics, including technical requirements for a memory system running on a humanoid robot system is given in Section 3. Table 1 shows a comparison of the cognitive architectures described above. We omitted the architecture SASE [ref]32 as is it more an architectural approach, not an implemented system and thus open to many possibilities.\nThe requirement that the memory adapts to new data and actively changes is fulfilled in particular by emergent and hybrid architectures. For emergent architectures, this property therefore follows directly from their definition. Hybrid architectures usually use the ability to process symbolic and sub-symbolic data for learning and development, also fulfilling the active requirement.\nSome architectures do implement an episodic memory, but they do not support an inherently episodic structure in all memory structures. On the other hand, in our previous work in  we only model episodic memory omitting WM. We strongly believe that an inherently episodic structure is required for all modalities and for all memory structures.\nMulti-modality is implemented by several systems.  gives a more detailed review of which modalities are supported by which cognitive architecture.\nAssociations are not explicitly modeled by every system. Especially associations between different modalities are beneficial as they allow the system to use correlated information during operation. To the best of our knowledge, even CRAM does not explicitly link related experiences with each other, but it does link sub-symbolic knowledge of experiences with symbolic derivations. Finally, the ability to inspect data in the memory is naturally given for cognitivistic architectures as data is represented as symbols. Some hybrid architectures claim to have an introspective datatype as well, usually facilitating meta-cognition.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: to monitor the system’s internal cognitive processes. Some cognitive architectures only focus on the perception-action coupling , however, other architectures explicitly model this capability [ref]32  .
