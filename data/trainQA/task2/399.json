      "content": "Paper Title: Language Conditioned Imitation Learning over Unstructured Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRobotic learning from general sensors.\nIn general, learning complex robotic skills from low-level sensors is possible, but requires substantial human supervision. Two common approaches are imitation learning (IL)  and reinforcement learning (RL) . When combined with deep function approximators, IL typically requires many human demonstrations 8 7  to drive supervised learning of a policy. In RL, supervision takes the form of hand-designed task rewards. Reward design is non-trivial in complex environments, often requiring either task-specific instrumentation  or learned perceptual rewards  . Additionally, RL agents often require hand-designed strategies  [ref]9 or human demonstrations 8 to overcome hard exploration problems. Finally, even under multitask formulations of RL  and IL 7, each new task considered requires a corresponding and sizable human effort. This makes it difficult to scale either approach naively to a broad task setting. In this work, we focus on scaling imitation learning to be multitask and language conditioned. While there are several ways to perform imitation learning such as inverse reinforcement learning 0   and occupancy matching , we restrict our attention in this work to behavior cloning 5 given its stability and ease of use. Imitation learning from large unstructured datasets.\nRecent works  6  have sought to mitigate the costs of conventional multitask imitation learning by instead learning many skills at once over large unstructured demonstration datasets. Like these works, we incorporate unstructured demonstration data into our method. Unlike these works, the resulting goal conditioned policies can be conditioned with natural language. Task agnostic control. This paper builds on the setting of task agnostic control, where a single agent is trained to reach any reachable goal state in its environment upon command  . One way of acquiring this kind of control is to first learn a model of the environment through interaction 1 [ref]9 then use it for planning. However,\nthese approaches rely on accurate forward models of visual dynamics, a challenging open problem. A powerful model-free strategy for task agnostic control is goal relabeling  . This technique trains goal conditioned policies to reach any previously visited state upon demand, with many recent examples in RL 9  8 and IL 6 . A limitation to models combining relabeling with image observation spaces is that tasks must be specified with goal images at test time. The present work builds on relabeled imitation, but additionally equips policies with natural language conditioning. Multicontext learning. A number of previous methods have focused on generalizing across tasks , or generalizing across goals . We introduce multicontext learning, a framework for generalizing across heterogeneous task and goal descriptions. When one of the training sources is plentiful and the other scarce, multicontext learning can be seen as transfer learning  through a shared goal space. Multicontext imitation is a central component of our method, as it reduces the cost of human language supervision to the point where it can be practically applied. Instruction following. There is a long history of research into agents that not only learn a grounded language understanding , but demonstrate that understanding by following instructions (survey 5). Recently, authors have had success using deep learning to directly map raw input and text instructions to actions. However, prior work has often studied 2D environments 4 2 7 2 and simplified actuators   . Additionally, learning to follow natural language is still not the standard in instruction following research 5, with typical implementations instead assuming access to simulator-provided instructions drawn from a restricted vocabulary and grammar .\nThis work, in contrast, studies 1) natural language instructions, 2) high-dimensional continuous sensory inputs and actuators, and 3) complex tasks like long-horizon 3D robotic object manipulation. Furthermore, unlike existing RL approaches to instruction following , our IL method is sample efficient, requires no reward definition, and scales easily to the multitask setting. Unlike concurrent IL approaches to robotic instruction following , which assume access to labeled task demonstrations and pretrained object detection, our method learns from unstructured and unlabeled demonstration data and learns perception, language understanding, and control fully end-to-end via a single imitation loss.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: design is non-trivial in complex environments, often requiring either task-specific instrumentation  or learned perceptual rewards  .
