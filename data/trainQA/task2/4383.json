      "content": "Paper Title: RepBNN: towards a precise Binary Neural Network with Enhanced Feature Map via Repeating\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs we all know, the applications of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved tremendous success in computer vision fields such as image classification, object detection, object tracking, and depth estimation. But this success comes at the cost of a huge amount of computation, which binds the application of convolutional neural networks generally to high-end hardware, such as GPU, TPU, etc. However, the efficient application of CNN models on mobile devices and embedded devices, where the storage space and computing resource are limited, is still quite challenging. In order to solve this problem, various lightweight network technologies have emerged, mainly including network architecture design, network architecture search, knowledge distillation, pruning, and quantization. Among these lightweight network technologies, binarization contributes to an extreme version of a convolutional neural network\n, where all feature maps and weights are represented by just 1-bit. Binarization greatly improves the efficiency of CNN models, because it not only reduces the volume of parameters, the requirement of storage capacity, but also its replacement of MAC operations with efficient XNOR and bit-count operations saves a lot computational expense. The work in  shows that a binary neural network has achieve 32× parameter compression and 58× speedup than its full-precision network. However, the speedup of calculation and the compression of parameter by binarization have obvious impact on the accuracy of CNN models. It is the declined representation capability of feature maps that degrades the performance of binarized CNNs. Unlike full-precision networks, the value range of binarized convolutions is so extremely restricted  that the accuracy loss becomes more serious. If the number of input channels is Ci​nsubscript𝐶𝑖𝑛C_{in}, and the size of the convolution kernel is khsubscript𝑘ℎk_{h} and kwsubscript𝑘𝑤k_{w}, then the value range of the binary convolution is (−Ci​n∗kh∗kw,Ci​n∗kh∗kw)subscript𝐶𝑖𝑛subscript𝑘ℎsubscript𝑘𝑤subscript𝐶𝑖𝑛subscript𝑘ℎsubscript𝑘𝑤\\left(-C_{in}*k_{h}*k_{w},C_{in}*k_{h}*k_{w}\\right), a total of Ci​n∗kh∗kw+1subscript𝐶𝑖𝑛subscript𝑘ℎsubscript𝑘𝑤1C_{in}*k_{h}*k_{w}+1 quantization levels. Obviously, increasing the number of input channels Ci​nsubscript𝐶𝑖𝑛C_{in} can improve the feature representation capability of binary neurual networks (BNNs). Inspired by this observation, we propose a new replaceable convolution module RepConv, which reshapes the weight kernel through expanding its channel dimension while compressing its number of groups. The total number of parameters and the amount of related convolutional calculation remain unchanged after the reshape. To convolve with such a reshaped weight kernel, RepConv has to increase the number of both input and output channels simply through a replication operation. In such a manner, RepConv enriches the network information. The binary version of RepConv is called RepBconv. If replacing the normal binarized convolution with RepBconv and further modify the remaining modules such as the first convolution layer, batch normalization, bypasses and fully connected layer following the transformation rule of RepTran, we translate a set of highly cited binary neural networks [ref]22[ref]14[ref]13 into the corresponding RepBNNs, which have been demonstrated to achieve universally better performance than the original BNN versions. Experimental results show that after the RepTran transformation,\nthe Top-1 accuracy of Rep-ReCU-ResNet-20, i.e., a RepBconv enhanced ReCU-ResNet-20[ref]22, reaches 88.97% on CIFAR-10, which is 1.47% higher than that of the original network. And Rep-AdamBNN-ReActNet-A [ref]14[ref]13 achieves 71.342%\nTop-1 accuracy on ImageNet, a fresh state-of-the-art result of BNNs as shown in Fig.1. To sum up, this paper makes the following contributions: We propose a new and easy-to-use convolution module named RepConv that reshapes the weight kernels thus increases the number of input and output channels so as to enrich the representation capability of binarized feature map without extra cost on convolutional operations and parameters. We propose a set of universal network transformation rules of RepTran, which makes the\ncommon modules in binary neural network adaptable to the application of RepConv. We apply RepTran to a large number of state-of-the-art binary neural networks and validate them on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet extensively. It is proved that our proposed structure can significantly improve the performance of binary networks.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: such as the first convolution layer, batch normalization, bypasses and fully connected layer following the transformation rule of RepTran, we translate a set of highly cited binary neural networks [ref]22[ref]14[ref]13 into the corresponding RepBNNs, which have been demonstrated to achieve universally better performance than the original BNN versions.
