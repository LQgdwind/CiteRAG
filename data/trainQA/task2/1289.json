      "content": "Paper Title: End-to-End Object Detection with Fully Convolutional Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nObject detection is a fundamental topic in computer vision, which predicts a set of bounding boxes with pre-defined category labels for each image.\nMost of mainstream detectors  [ref]22   utilize some hand-crafted designs such as anchor-based label assignment and non-maximum suppression (NMS).\nRecently, a quite number of methods [ref]46 8  have been proposed to eliminate the pre-defined set of anchor boxes by using distance-aware and distribution-based label assignments.\nAlthough they achieve remarkable progress and superior performance, there is still a challenge of discarding the NMS post-processing, which hinders the fully end-to-end training. To tackle this issue, Learnable NMS , Soft NMS  and other NMS variants 2  5, and CenterNet  are proposed to improve the duplicate removal, but they still do not provide an effective end-to-end training strategy.\nMeanwhile, many approaches      based on recurrent neural networks have been introduced to predict the bounding box for each instance by using an autoregressive decoder.\nThese approaches give naturally sequential modeling for the prediction of bounding boxes.\nBut they are only evaluated on some small datasets without modern detectors, and the iterative manner makes the inference process inefficient. Recently, DETR  introduces a bipartite matching based training strategy and transformers with the parallel decoder to enable end-to-end detection.\nIt achieves competitive performance against many state-of-the-art detectors.\nHowever, DETR currently suffers from much longer training duration to coverage and relatively lower performance on the small objects.\nTo this end, this paper explores a new perspective: could a fully convolutional network achieve competitive end-to-end object detection? In this paper, we attempt to answer this question in two dimensions, i.e., label assignment and network architecture.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, most of fully convolutional detectors [ref]22 [ref]46 0  adopt a one-to-many label assignment rule, i.e., assigning many predictions as foreground samples for one ground-truth instance.\nThis rule provides adequate foreground samples to obtain a strong and robust feature representation.\nNevertheless, the massive foreground samples lead to duplicate predicted boxes for a single instance, which prevents end-to-end detection.\nTo demonstrate it, we first give an empirical comparison of different existing hand-designed label assignments.\nWe find that the one-to-one label assignment plays a crucial role in eliminating the post-processing of duplicate removal.\nHowever, there is still a drawback in the hand-designed one-to-one assignment.\nThe fixed assignment could cause ambiguity issues and reduce the discriminability of features, since the predefined regions of an instance may not be the best choice 7 for training.\nTo solve this issue, we propose a prediction-aware one-to-one (POTO) label assignment, which dynamically assigns the foreground samples according to the quality of classification and regression simultaneously. Furthermore, for the modern FPN based detector [ref]46, the extensive experiment demonstrates that the duplicate bounding boxes majorly come from the nearby regions of the most confident prediction across adjacent scales.\nTherefore, we design a 3D Max Filtering (3DMF), which can be embedded into the FPN head as a differentiable module.\nThis module could improve the discriminability of convolution in the local regions by using a simple 3D max filtering operator across adjacent scales.\nBesides, to provide adequate supervision for feature representation learning, we modify a one-to-many assignment as an auxiliary loss. With the proposed techniques, our end-to-end detection framework achieves competitive performance against many state-of-the-art detectors.\nOn COCO  dataset, our end-to-end detector based on FCOS framework [ref]46 and ResNeXt-101  backbone remarkably outperforms the baseline with NMS by 1.1% mAP.\nFurthermore, our end-to-end detector is more robust and flexible for crowded detection.\nTo demonstrate the superiority in the crowded scenes, we construct more experiments on CrowdHuman 7 dataset.\nUnder the ResNet-50 backbone, our end-to-end detector achieves 3.0% AP50 and 6.0% mMR absolute gains over FCOS baseline with NMS.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: Object detection is a fundamental topic in computer vision, which predicts a set of bounding boxes with pre-defined category labels for each image.\nMost of mainstream detectors  [ref]22   utilize some hand-crafted designs such as anchor-based label assignment and non-maximum suppression (NMS).\nRecently, a quite number of methods [ref]46 8  have been proposed to eliminate the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
