      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Continual Learning in Streaming Environments\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for data streams is desired because it offers the automatic features engineering step and its aptitude to handle complex problems with high-input dimension . Nevertheless, such approaches are under-explored in the data stream literature due to the iterative training nature of DNNs as well as its rigid structure. The former issue rises the computational and memory issue for data streams requiring data samples to be scanned once without revisiting them again in the future [ref]2. The latter issue causes the so-called retraining phase from scratch being impossible to be carried out in the resource-constrained environments of data streams and imposes relevant knowledge to be catastrophically erased by new ones . In addition, the fixed structure of DNNs warrants the modelâ€™s capacity to be determined before the process runs - impossible to be done given the non-stationary natures of data streams. It often leads to the over-estimation problem where the network structure of DNNs are overly complex and redundant thus calling for the pruning approaches to be performed afterward [ref]4 . The requirement of powerful algorithms for data streams is evident in practise notably in the predictive maintenance sector. That is, data are collected from sensors continuously with a fast sampling rate [ref]6. This issue cannot be settled by deployment of a static model which cannot adapt to new training patterns due to non-stationary natures of a manufacturing process [ref]2. Once maintenance is completed, a model is supposed to revisit its previously seen state. In other words, a model should be robust against the catastrophic forgetting problem when embracing to a new operating condition . That is, it must possess a knowledge retention property. Another issue is perceived in the prohibitive labeling cost because data annotation often results in a complete shutdown of the manufacturing process for visual inspection. This calls for a continual learner handling non-stationary data streams in a label-wise fashion while being robust against the issue of catastrophic forgetting. The algorithmic development of DNNs for data streams has started to gain research attention. In , Online Deep Learning (ODL) is proposed with the idea of hedge back-propagation where every layer has its direct connection to the output layer and produces its own local output. Despite its online training scheme, this approach still relies on the fixed structure which does not adapt to the concept drift. Incremental learning of denoising autoencoder is proposed in  to grow the hidden nodes based on the loss criteria and merges redundant hidden nodes. A similar idea is shared in [ref]4 where it is built upon a radial basis function network. The above-mentioned study, however, has not been evaluated under standard data stream evaluation protocol, namely, the prequential procedure [ref]2. Furthermore, these approaches still depend on the shallow network structure. It is understood that the addition of network depth is capable of boosting the capacity of a model more significantly than network width 0. A fully flexible deep neural networks, namely autonomous deep learning (ADL), is proposed in 1. ADL features a different-depth network structure where its hidden nodes and layers are self-organized from data streams. The different-depth network structure handles the catastrophic forgetting problem in integrating a new layer where every layer produces its own output aggregated by the weighted voting scheme. This idea is extended to the context of standard multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network structure in NADINE 2 where the adaptive memory and soft-forgetting mechanisms are designed to address the catastrophic forgetting problem during the structural evolution. Another piece of work under the roof of recurrent neural networks, namely PALM, is put forward in 3. It is created based on the teacher-forcing concept where its network structure is self-evolved to handle data streams. These approaches are hampered by their fully supervised working principle thereby imposing prohibitive labeling cost. One of the major bottlenecks for most data stream algorithms relies on the assumption where the true class label can be gathered shortly after data samples arrive [ref]2. This fact does not coincide with the fact where at least some delay is expected by the operator to label data samples 4. It is also known that the labeling cost is varying. For instance, the fault diagnosis via manual inspection has to be performed to feed the correct class label. That is, one target class might be more difficult to gather than other classes. This issue also creates difficulty in adapting to the concept drift as the drift status has to be flagged with the absence of any target classes. Further, the aforementioned approaches are not capable of handling the catastrophic forgetting because of the presence of new tasks. That is, unable to deliver a good performance on the previously seen task after learning a new task  5. One attempt to resolve the issue of labeling cost is via the deployment of active learning by means of actively querying important samples for model updates to operators. The confidence score is proposed to actively sample important labels of data streams for model updates [ref]6. This method indeed reduces the labeling cost yet it often biases to under-represented classes in which the class label might be difficult to obtain. In addition, the true class label has to be immediately obtained without considering the possible delay. Another attempt to overcome the labeling cost is via the algorithmic development of a semi-supervised algorithm assuming partially labeled samples. In 6, it makes use of the incremental learning of denoising autoencoder coupled with the hashing algorithm. A self-evolving denoising autoencoder having closed-loop configuration between the generative and discriminative learning phases is proposed 7. These approaches, however, do not fit to handle the infinite delay case where the true class label is only available during the warm-up phase. The labeling cost of the data stream is addressed as the extreme latency problem where it relies only on prerecorded labels while the true class label never arrives during the process runs. COMPOSE is proposed in 8 to cope with the extreme latency problem via the computational geometry approach. In 4, SCARGC is put forward in which it adopts the pool-based approach. These two approaches are non-deep-learning approach. The problem of labeling delay is addressed via the dynamic skip connection of recurrent neural network in 9. In , the deep learning approach via the SLASH method is put forward. Our approach differs from these approaches since it is a fully unsupervised approach. That is, the training process is performed with the absence of labeled samples. The class labels are only used to induce the class-associate representations , i.e., few labeled samples are only exploited to determine the class tendency of a cluster being done in the initialization phase. Note that this step is necessary because we deal with a classification task rather than a clustering task. An Autonomous Deep Clustering Network (ADCN) is proposed in this paper for unsupervised data stream classification in lifelong environments. ADCN is constructed under the deep network structure consisting of a feature extractor and an autonomous fully connected layer. The feature extractor layer may adopt either the convolutional layer or MLP layer. On top of that, a flexible fully connected layer is employed. It is crafted by the deep clustering network approach with a self-evolving property. That is, both network width and depth are self-generated. Hidden nodes can be automatically generated or pruned in a flexible manner using the Network Significance (NS) method 7 while the drift detection method is used to expand the network depth. The self-clustering mechanism is performed in the deep embedding space where every layer produces its own set of clusters and its own local output. That is, clusters are self-generated in different levels of deep embedding space to cope with any possible concept drift. A simple summation is applied to infer the final predicted output. The overall optimization objective aims to produce the cluster-friendly latent space preventing the trivial solution . In other words, it performs simultaneous feature learning and clustering under one joint optimization problem. It replaces the traditional paradigm of linear transformation having difficulty in handling complex data distribution with the deep nonlinear transformation via stacked autoencoder. It jointly optimizes both the reconstruction loss in the greedy-layer wise fashion and the clustering loss. Further, a latent-based regularization adopted from  completes the ADCN learning policy. It is capable of resolving the catastrophic forgetting problems by creating a task-invariant network. This paper consists of five major contributions: 1) it presents an unsupervised approach for data stream classification; 2) it proposes the deep clustering approach for data stream classification; 3) it put forward a methodology for structural learning of deep clustering networks from data streams; 4) it incorporates a latent-based regularization strategy to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting problems; 5) source codes of ADCN including all our numerical results are made public to support reproducible research. Our numerical results have demonstrated the efficacy of ADCN for handling data streams in an unsupervised manner where it produces better accuracy to those counterparts in most cases. The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 outlines the problem formulation; Section 3 discusses the learning policy of ADCN; Section 4 elaborates our experiments; some concluding remarks are drawn in the last section of this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: DNNs as well as its rigid structure.
