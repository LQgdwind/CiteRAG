      "content": "Paper Title: Bayesian Negative Sampling for Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor an un-interacted item l𝑙l with its predicted score x^lsubscript^𝑥𝑙\\hat{x}_{l}, the posterior probability of the item l𝑙l being a true negative can be computed using the Bayesian formula: where P​(x^l|t​n)𝑃conditionalsubscript^𝑥𝑙𝑡𝑛P(\\hat{x}_{l}|tn) is the class conditional density of true negatives given by g​(x^)𝑔^𝑥g(\\hat{x}), Pt​n​(l)=1−Pf​n​(l)subscript𝑃𝑡𝑛𝑙1subscript𝑃𝑓𝑛𝑙P_{tn}(l)=1-P_{fn}(l) is the prior probability of item l𝑙l being true negative instance. f​(x^l)𝑓subscript^𝑥𝑙f(\\hat{x}_{l}) is the score distribution of un-interacted items, F​(x^l)=∫−∞x^lf​(t)​𝑑t𝐹subscript^𝑥𝑙superscriptsubscriptsubscript^𝑥𝑙𝑓𝑡differential-d𝑡F(\\hat{x}_{l})=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\hat{x}_{l}}f(t)dt is the corresponding cumulative distribution function. Also, the posterior probability of item l𝑙l being a false negative can be computed by: Generally, the Bayesian classifier can be obtained by maximizing the posterior probability: Directly computing the score density function f​(⋅)𝑓⋅f(\\cdot) in Eq. (11) and Eq. (12) is complicated. Yet the calculation of empirical distribution function Fn​(x)=1n​∑jI|X⋅≤x^l|F_{n}(x)=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{j}I_{|X_{\\cdot}\\leq\\hat{x}_{l}|} is easy to implement. So we define unbiasedness of an un-interacted item l𝑙l in a fractional form to eliminate the density function f​(⋅)𝑓⋅f(\\cdot): According to Glivenko theorem , F​(x^)𝐹^𝑥F(\\hat{x}) can be approximated using Fn​(x^l)subscript𝐹𝑛subscript^𝑥𝑙F_{n}(\\hat{x}_{l}), i.e., the percentage of x^⋅≤x^lsubscript^𝑥⋅subscript^𝑥𝑙\\hat{x}_{\\cdot}\\leq\\hat{x}_{l} Pf​n​(l)subscript𝑃𝑓𝑛𝑙P_{fn}(l) is the prior probability of l𝑙l being false negative. For convenience, we assume the times of item l𝑙l being interacted p​o​pl∼B​(N,Pf​n​(l))similar-to𝑝𝑜subscript𝑝𝑙𝐵𝑁subscript𝑃𝑓𝑛𝑙pop_{l}\\sim B(N,P_{fn}(l)), where N𝑁N is\ntotal number of interactions in training set. So If p​o​pl∼B​(N,Pf​n​(l))similar-to𝑝𝑜subscript𝑝𝑙𝐵𝑁subscript𝑃𝑓𝑛𝑙pop_{l}\\sim B(N,P_{fn}(l)), then 𝚞𝚗𝚋𝚒𝚊𝚜​(l)𝚞𝚗𝚋𝚒𝚊𝚜𝑙\\mathtt{unbias}(l) measure given by Eq (15) is an unbiased estimator for l𝑙l being true negative. Setting random variable Y=1𝑌1Y=1 if l∈f​n𝑙𝑓𝑛l\\in fn, otherwise Y=0𝑌0Y=0, where θ𝜃\\theta is the probability of l𝑙l being false negative. So Y∼B​(1,θ)similar-to𝑌𝐵1𝜃Y\\sim B(1,\\theta). p​o​pl=Y1+Y2+⋯+YN∼B​(N,θ)𝑝𝑜subscript𝑝𝑙subscript𝑌1subscript𝑌2⋯subscript𝑌𝑁similar-to𝐵𝑁𝜃pop_{l}=Y_{1}+Y_{2}+\\cdots+Y_{N}\\sim B(N,\\theta), then P​(p​o​pl=k)=(Nk)​θk​(1−θ)(N−k)𝑃𝑝𝑜subscript𝑝𝑙𝑘binomial𝑁𝑘superscript𝜃𝑘superscript1𝜃𝑁𝑘P(pop_{l}=k)=\\binom{N}{k}\\theta^{k}(1-\\theta)^{(N-k)}. So Given the observation x^u​l=Xsubscript^𝑥𝑢𝑙𝑋\\hat{x}_{ul}=X, F​(X)𝐹𝑋F(X) is a statistic of X𝑋X. Pf​n​(l)subscript𝑃𝑓𝑛𝑙P_{fn}(l) is a statistic of ∑iYisubscript𝑖subscript𝑌𝑖\\sum_{i}Y_{i} that is independent of X𝑋X. So 𝔼​[F​(X)]𝔼delimited-[]𝐹𝑋\\mathbb{E}[F(X)] is the first order origin moment of cumulative distribution function F​(X)𝐹𝑋F(X) So Note 1−θ1𝜃1-\\theta is the probability of Y=0𝑌0Y=0 from binomial populations Y∼B​(1,θ)similar-to𝑌𝐵1𝜃Y\\sim B(1,\\theta), so 𝚞𝚗𝚋𝚒𝚊𝚜​(l)𝚞𝚗𝚋𝚒𝚊𝚜𝑙\\mathtt{unbias}(l) is unbiased estimator of l𝑙l being true negative. Fig 3 plots 𝚞𝚗𝚋𝚒𝚊𝚜​(l)𝚞𝚗𝚋𝚒𝚊𝚜𝑙\\mathtt{unbias}(l) as a function of F​(x^)∈[ref]0 𝐹^𝑥01F(\\hat{x})\\in[ref]0  and Pf​n​(l)∈[ref]0 subscript𝑃𝑓𝑛𝑙01P_{fn}(l)\\in[ref]0 . We observe that 𝚞𝚗𝚋𝚒𝚊𝚜​(l)𝚞𝚗𝚋𝚒𝚊𝚜𝑙\\mathtt{unbias}(l) is a decreasing function w.r.t both F​(x^)𝐹^𝑥F(\\hat{x}) and P​(f​n)𝑃𝑓𝑛P(fn). The monotonicity of 𝚞𝚗𝚋𝚒𝚊𝚜​(j)𝚞𝚗𝚋𝚒𝚊𝚜𝑗\\mathtt{unbias}(j) is consistent with our analysis, and the value domain of 𝚞𝚗𝚋𝚒𝚊𝚜​(j)𝚞𝚗𝚋𝚒𝚊𝚜𝑗\\mathtt{unbias}(j) ∈[ref]0 absent01\\in[ref]0  conforms to the probability form. The definition of unbiasedness can be interpreted as the normalized posterior probability of l𝑙l being true negative (negative signal). The density function f​(x^l)𝑓subscript^𝑥𝑙f(\\hat{x}_{l}) is eliminated due to the fractional expression of Eq. (15). This suggests that it is model-independent metric and can be generalized to different ranking models. Eq. (15) implies that the negative signal of an un-interacted item l𝑙l is formally determined by: (a) Non-threshold classification result of a ranking model denoted by F​(x^l)𝐹subscript^𝑥𝑙F(\\hat{x}_{l}) 333 Ranking position and F​(x^l)𝐹subscript^𝑥𝑙F(\\hat{x}_{l}) are with a one-to-one mapping.. A larger F​(x^)𝐹^𝑥F(\\hat{x}), i.e., a higher ranking position, indicates that to a large extent a ranking model classifies l𝑙l as a false negative. Now we provide a new understanding of F​(x^l)𝐹subscript^𝑥𝑙F(\\hat{x}_{l}). F​(x^l)𝐹subscript^𝑥𝑙F(\\hat{x}_{l}) describes the joint probability of the observed sample x^lsubscript^𝑥𝑙\\hat{x}_{l} as a function of the parameters of the ranking model. For the specific parameter l∈f​n𝑙𝑓𝑛l\\in fn, F​(x^l)𝐹subscript^𝑥𝑙F(\\hat{x}_{l}) assigns a probabilistic prediction valued in [ref]0 01[ref]0  of l𝑙l being false negative (positive). This explains why those hard negative sampling algorithms  [ref]8 for over-sampling higher scored or higher ranked items are more likely to suffer from the false negative problem. (b) Prior information denoted by prior probability (Pt​n​(l)subscript𝑃𝑡𝑛𝑙P_{tn}(l) or Pf​n​(l)subscript𝑃𝑓𝑛𝑙P_{fn}(l)). We note that the metric of Eq. (15) covers two major paradigms of current works on distilling negative signals: (i) modeling prior information using exposure data , KG entities , connections in social networks  , etc. (ii) utilizing the sample information from ranking model such as predicted score , ranking position [ref]8, scores’ variance , etc. The former can incorporate domain knowledge, however the negative signal is independent of model status; The latter exploits sample information x^lsubscript^𝑥𝑙\\hat{x}_{l} but ignores the prior information. While being easy to sample informative instances, methods of this kind are likely to suffer false negative problems. The advantage of 𝚞𝚗𝚋𝚒𝚊𝚜​(⋅)𝚞𝚗𝚋𝚒𝚊𝚜⋅\\mathtt{unbias}(\\cdot) measure lies in the theoretical foundation of posterior probability, which combines priori information (model-independent) and sample information x^lsubscript^𝑥𝑙\\hat{x}_{l} (model-dependent). For the sake of simplicity and completeness of the theoretical proof, we adopted a naive approach for modeling prior probability. Some other additional information and domain knowledge can also be exploited for modeling Pt​n​(l)subscript𝑃𝑡𝑛𝑙P_{tn}(l).\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: B(1,\\theta), so 𝚞𝚗𝚋𝚒𝚊𝚜​(l)𝚞𝚗𝚋𝚒𝚊𝚜𝑙\\mathtt{unbias}(l) is unbiased estimator of l𝑙l being true negative.

We observe that 𝚞𝚗𝚋𝚒𝚊𝚜​(l)𝚞𝚗𝚋𝚒𝚊𝚜𝑙\\mathtt{unbias}(l) is a decreasing function w.r.t both F​(x^)𝐹^𝑥F(\\hat{x})\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
