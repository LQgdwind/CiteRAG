      "content": "Paper Title: SuperGaussians: Enhancing Gaussian Splatting Using Primitives with Spatially Varying Colors\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare the best setting of SuperGaussians with other state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods. Table 2 shows the PSNR comparison across different datasets. It can be observed that we have achieved optimal or near-optimal results on multiple datasets. Although we do not outperform the original Mip-NeRF360 [ref]3 method on their dataset, we still surpass two explicit Gaussian-based reconstruction methods. Fig. 6 presents a visual comparison between our results and those of 2DGS  on the Synthetic Blender  dataset. We provide the error map alongside the ground truth for easier observation. It is evident that 2DGS  struggles with reconstructing shape boundaries and abrupt parts. For instance, in the “mic” model, its wires and brackets are not clearly visible from certain angles, whereas our method addresses these issues effectively. Fig. 7 demonstrates the visual comparison with 2DGS  and 3DGS , showcasing the powerful expressiveness of SuperGaussians. For example, in the first row, the bicycle example highlights our ability to capture finer details. The distant view of the garden example in the second row and the train in the fourth row emphasize our method’s expressiveness of corner cases that appear less common in the training views.\nAdditionally, since our method can express more details, we can reduce the smearing effect, as demonstrated by the leaves in the fifth row. Table 3 shows the comparison results between our method and 2DGS  on the DTU [ref]13 dataset. It should be noted that, following 2DGS , the DTU [ref]13 dataset does not include a test set, so we only report the metrics on the training set. It can be seen that our method significantly surpasses 2DGS .\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: the PSNR comparison across different datasets.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
