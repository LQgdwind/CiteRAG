See 1.4 We break the proof of Theorem 1.4 into three parts below. Exactly the same argument, but using Theorem 1.1 instead of Lemma 4.3, gives the improved bound in Theorem 1.5, restated below.\nSee 1.5 For each t=0,⋯,T𝑡0⋯𝑇t=0,\\cdots,T, we have 𝔼​[𝖾𝗋𝗋​(At,f)]=0𝔼delimited-[]𝖾𝗋𝗋subscript𝐴𝑡𝑓0\\mathbb{E}[\\mathsf{err}(A_{t},f)]=0. As each sample 𝐳j∈A0superscript𝐳𝑗subscript𝐴0\\mathbf{z}^{j}\\in A_{0} is picked uniformly in [ref]0 [ref]1dsuperscript01𝑑[ref]0 [ref]1^{d}, we have 𝔼A0​[f​(𝐳j)]=f¯subscript𝔼subscript𝐴0delimited-[]𝑓superscript𝐳𝑗¯𝑓\\mathbb{E}_{A_{0}}[f(\\mathbf{z}^{j})]=\\overline{f}, and the claim holds for t=0𝑡0t=0.\nFor t≥1𝑡1t\\geq 1 we have, where the inner expectation is over the randomness of 𝖡𝖺𝗅𝖲𝗎𝖻𝗀𝖣𝗂𝗌𝖼𝖡𝖺𝗅𝖲𝗎𝖻𝗀𝖣𝗂𝗌𝖼\\mathsf{BalSubgDisc}. As 𝖡𝖺𝗅𝖲𝗎𝖻𝗀𝖣𝗂𝗌𝖼𝖡𝖺𝗅𝖲𝗎𝖻𝗀𝖣𝗂𝗌𝖼\\mathsf{BalSubgDisc} outputs a symmetric distribution over colorings, each 𝐳∈At−1𝐳subscript𝐴𝑡1\\mathbf{z}\\in A_{t-1} lies in Atsubscript𝐴𝑡A_{t} with probability exactly 1/2121/2.

By the Koksma-Hlawka inequality (10), it suffices to show D​(AT,𝒞d)≤O~d​(1)𝐷subscript𝐴𝑇superscript𝒞𝑑subscript~𝑂𝑑1D(A_{T},\\mathcal{C}^{d})\\leq\\widetilde{O}_{d}(1) whp. To this end, we first prove that D​(AT,𝒟≤hd)≤O~d​(1)𝐷subscript𝐴𝑇superscriptsubscript𝒟absentℎ𝑑subscript~𝑂𝑑1D(A_{T},\\mathcal{D}_{\\leq h}^{d})\\leq\\widetilde{O}_{d}(1) whp. Fix a dyadic box B∈𝒟≤hd𝐵superscriptsubscript𝒟absentℎ𝑑B\\in\\mathcal{D}_{\\leq h}^{d}. By Lemma 3.4\nwe have where the last equality uses that nT=n,n0=n2formulae-sequencesubscript𝑛𝑇𝑛subscript𝑛0superscript𝑛2n_{T}=n,n_{0}=n^{2} and nt=n0/2tsubscript𝑛𝑡subscript𝑛0superscript2𝑡n_{t}=n_{0}/2^{t}.

Consequently, by Chernoff bound and a union bound over the Od​(nd)subscript𝑂𝑑superscript𝑛𝑑O_{d}(n^{d}) dyadic boxes B𝐵B, we have that D​(A0,B)≤O​((n0​log⁡nd)1/2)=Od​(n​log1/2⁡n)𝐷subscript𝐴0𝐵𝑂superscriptsubscript𝑛0superscript𝑛𝑑12subscript𝑂𝑑𝑛superscript12𝑛D(A_{0},B)\\leq O((n_{0}\\log n^{d})^{1/2})=O_{d}(n\\log^{1/2}n) whp for all B∈𝒟≤h⊗d𝐵superscriptsubscript𝒟absentℎtensor-productabsent𝑑B\\in\\mathcal{D}_{\\leq h}^{\\otimes d}. So the first term D​(A0,B)/n𝐷subscript𝐴0𝐵𝑛D(A_{0},B)/n on the right side of (13) is O~d​(1)subscript~𝑂𝑑1\\widetilde{O}_{d}(1). Similarly, the second term on the right is O~d​(1)subscript~𝑂𝑑1\\widetilde{O}_{d}(1) as 2T/n=1superscript2𝑇𝑛12^{T}/n=1 and\nby Lemma 3.3 the vector 𝐝t,𝒟superscript𝐝𝑡𝒟\\mathbf{d}^{t,\\mathcal{D}} is O​(logd+1⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑑1𝑛O(\\log^{d+1}n)-subgaussian, and hence in particular each coordinate 𝖽𝗂𝗌𝖼t​(B)subscript𝖽𝗂𝗌𝖼𝑡𝐵\\mathsf{disc}_{t}(B) is O​(logd+1⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑑1𝑛O(\\log^{d+1}n) subgaussian. Thus D​(AT,B)≤Od​(logd/2+1⁡n)𝐷subscript𝐴𝑇𝐵subscript𝑂𝑑superscript𝑑21𝑛D(A_{T},B)\\leq O_{d}(\\log^{d/2+1}n) whp for all B∈𝒟≤h⊗d𝐵superscriptsubscript𝒟absentℎtensor-productabsent𝑑B\\in\\mathcal{D}_{\\leq h}^{\\otimes d}. As each corner C∈𝒞h⊗d𝐶superscriptsubscript𝒞ℎtensor-productabsent𝑑C\\in\\mathcal{C}_{h}^{\\otimes d} can be decomposed as at most Od​(logd⁡n)subscript𝑂𝑑superscript𝑑𝑛O_{d}(\\log^{d}n) dyadic boxes, by subgaussianity we also have that D​(AT,C)≤Od​(logd+1⁡n)=O~d​(1)𝐷subscript𝐴𝑇𝐶subscript𝑂𝑑superscript𝑑1𝑛subscript~𝑂𝑑1D(A_{T},C)\\leq O_{d}(\\log^{d+1}n)=\\widetilde{O}_{d}(1) whp for all C∈𝒞h⊗d𝐶superscriptsubscript𝒞ℎtensor-productabsent𝑑C\\in\\mathcal{C}_{h}^{\\otimes d}.\nFinally, since the initial set of samples A0subscript𝐴0A_{0} is uniformly random, the number of samples in every strip of width 2−hsuperscript2ℎ2^{-h}, i.e. strips in 𝒟h×[ref]0 [ref]1⊗(d−1)subscript𝒟ℎsuperscript01tensor-productabsent𝑑1\\mathcal{D}_{h}\\times[ref]0 [ref]1^{\\otimes(d-1)} is at most O~d​(1)subscript~𝑂𝑑1\\widetilde{O}_{d}(1). Consequently, each corner C∈𝒞d𝐶superscript𝒞𝑑C\\in\\mathcal{C}^{d} (recall that this is the infinite set of all possible corners) has the same discrepancy as some corner in 𝒞h⊗dsuperscriptsubscript𝒞ℎtensor-productabsent𝑑\\mathcal{C}_{h}^{\\otimes d} up to an additive O~d​(1)subscript~𝑂𝑑1\\widetilde{O}_{d}(1) term.\n∎ Finally, 𝖲𝗎𝖻𝗀𝖳𝗋𝖺𝗇𝗌𝖿𝖾𝗋𝖾𝗇𝖼𝖾𝖲𝗎𝖻𝗀𝖳𝗋𝖺𝗇𝗌𝖿𝖾𝗋𝖾𝗇𝖼𝖾\\mathsf{SubgTransference} has error at most that of Monte Carlo (up to O~d​(1)subscript~𝑂𝑑1\\widetilde{O}_{d}(1) factors)222222This factor can be reduced to O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) if one cares, by replacing each ejAtsuperscriptsubscript𝑒𝑗subscript𝐴𝑡e_{j}^{A_{t}} in (11) by (h+1)d/2​ejAtsuperscriptℎ1𝑑2superscriptsubscript𝑒𝑗subscript𝐴𝑡(h+1)^{d/2}e_{j}^{A_{t}}. By rescaling, it is easily verified that the coloring 𝐱tsuperscript𝐱𝑡\\mathbf{x}^{t} produced by the ALS algorithm will be O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n)-subgaussian..

The first statement of the theorem is given by Lemma 4.1.\nFor any g,h:[ref]0 [ref]1d→ℝ:𝑔ℎ→superscript01𝑑ℝg,h:[ref]0 [ref]1^{d}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} for which f=g+h𝑓𝑔ℎf=g+h, note that 𝖾𝗋𝗋​(AT,f)=𝖾𝗋𝗋​(AT,g)+𝖾𝗋𝗋​(AT,h)𝖾𝗋𝗋subscript𝐴𝑇𝑓𝖾𝗋𝗋subscript𝐴𝑇𝑔𝖾𝗋𝗋subscript𝐴𝑇ℎ\\mathsf{err}(A_{T},f)=\\mathsf{err}(A_{T},g)+\\mathsf{err}(A_{T},h).
