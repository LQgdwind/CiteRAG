      "content": "Paper Title: Lower Bounds and Optimal Algorithms for Personalized Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn most cases, the local proximal oracle is impractical as it requires the exact minimization of the regularized local problem at each iteration. In this section, we describe an accelerated inexact  version of (6) (Algorithm 1), which only requires a local (either full or summand) gradient oracle. We present two different approaches to achieve so: AGD 8 (under the gradient oracle) and Katyusha  (under the summand gradient oracle). Both strategies, however, share a common characteristic: they progressively increase the effort to inexactly evaluate the local prox, which is essential in order to preserve the optimal communication complexity. As already mentioned, the idea of applying IAPGD to solve (2) is not new; it was already explored in [ref]50.101010The work [ref]50 considers the distributed multi-task learning objective that is more general than (2). However, [ref]50 does not argue about the optimality of IAPGD. Less importantly, our analysis is slightly more careful, and it supports Katyusha as a local sub-solver as well. IAPGD + AGD The next theorem states the convergence rate of IAPGD with AGD 8 as a local subsolver. Suppose that fisubscript𝑓𝑖f_{i} is L𝐿L-smooth and μ𝜇\\mu-strongly convex for all i𝑖i. Let AGD with starting point yiksubscriptsuperscript𝑦𝑘𝑖y^{k}_{i} be employed for\nTk≔L+λμ+λ​log⁡(1152​L​λ​n2​(2​λμ+1)2​μ−2)+4​μ​(L+λ)λ​(μ+λ)​k≔subscript𝑇𝑘𝐿𝜆𝜇𝜆1152𝐿𝜆superscript𝑛2superscript2𝜆𝜇12superscript𝜇24𝜇𝐿𝜆𝜆𝜇𝜆𝑘T_{k}\\coloneqq\\sqrt{\\tfrac{L+\\lambda}{\\mu+\\lambda}}\\log\\left(1152L\\lambda n^{2}\\left(2\\sqrt{\\tfrac{\\lambda}{\\mu}}+1\\right)^{2}\\mu^{-2}\\right)+4\\sqrt{\\tfrac{\\mu(L+\\lambda)}{\\lambda(\\mu+\\lambda)}}k\niterations to approximately solve (7) at iteration k𝑘k.\nThen, we have\nF​(xk)−F⋆≤8​(1−μλ)k​(F​(x0)−F⋆),𝐹superscript𝑥𝑘superscript𝐹⋆8superscript1𝜇𝜆𝑘𝐹superscript𝑥0superscript𝐹⋆F(x^{k})-F^{\\star}\\leq 8\\left(1-\\sqrt{\\tfrac{\\mu}{\\lambda}}\\right)^{k}(F(x^{0})-F^{\\star}),\nwhere F⋆=F​(x⋆)superscript𝐹⋆𝐹superscript𝑥⋆F^{\\star}=F(x^{\\star}).\nAs a result, the total number of communications required to reach ε𝜀\\varepsilon-approximate solution is 𝒪​(λμ​log⁡1ε)𝒪𝜆𝜇1𝜀{\\cal O}\\left(\\sqrt{\\tfrac{\\lambda}{\\mu}}\\log\\tfrac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right). The corresponding local gradient complexity is\n𝒪​(L+λμ​log⁡1ε​(log⁡L​λ​nμ+log⁡1ε))=𝒪~​(L+λμ)𝒪𝐿𝜆𝜇1𝜀𝐿𝜆𝑛𝜇1𝜀~𝒪𝐿𝜆𝜇{\\cal O}\\left(\\sqrt{\\tfrac{L+\\lambda}{\\mu}}\\log\\tfrac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\log\\tfrac{L\\lambda n}{\\mu}+\\log\\tfrac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\right)=\\tilde{{\\cal O}}\\left(\\sqrt{\\tfrac{L+\\lambda}{\\mu}}\\right). As expected, the communication complexity of IAPGD + AGD is 𝒪​(λμ​log⁡1ε)𝒪𝜆𝜇1𝜀{\\cal O}\\left(\\sqrt{\\tfrac{\\lambda}{\\mu}}\\log\\tfrac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right), thus optimal. On the other hand, the local gradient complexity is 𝒪~​(L+λμ)~𝒪𝐿𝜆𝜇\\tilde{{\\cal O}}\\left(\\sqrt{\\tfrac{L+\\lambda}{\\mu}}\\right). For λ=𝒪​(L)𝜆𝒪𝐿\\lambda={\\cal O}(L) this simplifies to 𝒪~​(Lμ)~𝒪𝐿𝜇\\tilde{{\\cal O}}\\left(\\sqrt{\\tfrac{L}{\\mu}}\\right), which is, up to log\\log and constant factors identical to the lower bound on the local gradient calls. IAPGD + Katyusha In practice, the local objectives fisubscript𝑓𝑖f_{i}’s often correspond to a loss of some model on the given client’s data. In such a case, each function fisubscript𝑓𝑖f_{i} is of the finite-sum structure:\nfi​(xi)=1m​∑j=1mf~i,j​(xi).subscript𝑓𝑖subscript𝑥𝑖1𝑚superscriptsubscript𝑗1𝑚subscript~𝑓𝑖𝑗subscript𝑥𝑖f_{i}(x_{{i}})=\\tfrac{1}{m}\\sum_{j=1}^{m}{\\tilde{f}}_{i,j}(x_{{i}}). Clearly, if m𝑚m is large, solving the local subproblem with AGD is rather inefficient as it does not take an advantage of the finite-sum structure. To tackle this issue, we propose solving the local subproblem (7) using Katyusha.111111Essentially any accelerated variance reduced algorithm can be used instead of Katyusha, for example ASDCA , APCG , Point-SAGA [ref]9, MiG , SAGA-SSNM  and others. Let f~i,jsubscript~𝑓𝑖𝑗{\\tilde{f}}_{i,j} be L~~𝐿{\\tilde{L}}-smooth and fisubscript𝑓𝑖f_{i} be μ𝜇\\mu-strongly convex for all 1≤i≤n,1≤j≤mformulae-sequence1𝑖𝑛1𝑗𝑚1\\leq i\\leq n,1\\leq j\\leq m.121212Consequently, we have L~≥L≥L~m~𝐿𝐿~𝐿𝑚{\\tilde{L}}\\geq L\\geq\\tfrac{{\\tilde{L}}}{m}. Let Katyusha with starting point yiksubscriptsuperscript𝑦𝑘𝑖y^{k}_{i} be employed for\nTk=𝒪​((m+m​L~+λμ+λ)​(log⁡1R2+k​μλ))subscript𝑇𝑘𝒪𝑚𝑚~𝐿𝜆𝜇𝜆1superscript𝑅2𝑘𝜇𝜆T_{k}={\\cal O}\\left(\\left(m+\\sqrt{m\\tfrac{{\\tilde{L}}+\\lambda}{\\mu+\\lambda}}\\right)\\left(\\log\\tfrac{1}{R^{2}}+k\\sqrt{\\tfrac{\\mu}{\\lambda}}\\right)\\right)\niterations to approximately solve (7) at iteration k𝑘k of IAPGD for some small R𝑅R (see proof for details). Given that the iterate sequence {xk}k=0∞superscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑘𝑘0\\{x^{k}\\}_{k=0}^{\\infty} is bounded, the expected communication complexity of IAPGD+Katyusha is 𝒪​(λμ​log⁡1ϵ)𝒪𝜆𝜇1italic-ϵ{\\cal O}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu}}\\log\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\right), while the local summand gradient complexity is\n𝒪~​(m​λμ+m​L~μ)~𝒪𝑚𝜆𝜇𝑚~𝐿𝜇\\tilde{{\\cal O}}\\left(m\\sqrt{\\tfrac{\\lambda}{\\mu}}+\\sqrt{m\\tfrac{{\\tilde{L}}}{\\mu}}\\right). Theorem 4.3 shows that local Katyusha enjoys the optimal communication complexity. Furthermore, if m​λ=𝒪​(L~)𝑚𝜆𝒪~𝐿\\sqrt{m}\\lambda={\\cal O}({\\tilde{L}}), the total expected number of local gradients becomes optimal as well (see Sec. 3.2). There is, however, a notable drawback of Theorem 4.3 over Theorem 4.2 – Theorem 4.3 requires a boundedness of the sequence {xk}k=0∞superscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑘𝑘0\\{x^{k}\\}_{k=0}^{\\infty} as an assumption, while this piece is not required for IAPGD+AGD due to its deterministic nature. In the next section, we devise a stochastic algorithm AL2SGD+ that does not require such an assumption. Furthermore, the local (summand) gradient complexity of AL2SGD+ does not depend on the extra log factors, and, at the same time, AL2SGD+ is optimal in a broader range of scenarios.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: the local prox, which is essential in order to preserve the optimal communication complexity.
