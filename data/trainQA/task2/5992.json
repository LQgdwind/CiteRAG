      "content": "Paper Title: Rehabilitation Exercise Repetition Segmentation and Counting using Skeletal Body Joints\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTables I (a)-(b), and (c)-(d), respectively present the results of repetition counting, and segmentation on the KIMORE dataset  through five-fold cross-validation. The body joints captured by the Kinect camera in the dataset (rows #4-11 in tables), the raw RGB videos in the dataset (#2), and the body joints extracted from the RGB videos by OpenPose (#1 and #3) [ref]23 were analyzed in the experiments in Table I. It should be noted that repetition counting was carried out in rows #1 and #3-10 of Tables I (a)-(b) as a result of repetition segmentation. First, repetition segmentation was undertaken, and the number of repetitions was counted. The repetition counting was performed directly in rows #2 and #11 of Tables I (a)-(b). The results of the many-to-many model with density map output (#8) are superior to those of the many-to-many model with binary sequence output (#10). The ground-truth density maps were generated by approximating a Gaussian distribution between the start and end of each repetition . The model that was trained on and predicted based on density maps was more robust to noise and fluctuations in body joints, as well as irregularities and imperfections in completing exercises in the patients in the KIMORE dataset. There is a significant difference between the results of the two models described above (#8 and #10) and those of the many-to-one model with repetition counts output (#11). One reason for this is that more ground-truth information was available for the training of the first two models. The first two models described above were provided with labels for every timestamp; however, the many-to-one model was provided with only one label for the entire network. The results based on body joints captured by the Kinect camera (#8) were far better than those extracted from RGB videos (#1). Due to the low quality of videos in the KIMORE dataset, the high distance of the subjects to the camera, imperfect lighting conditions, and blurred faces in the dataset to preserve privacy, OpenPose [ref]23 had difficulty extracting body joints from the dataset, resulting in low-quality body joints compared to Kinect body joints. Therefore, the OpenPose [ref]23 input to the models was noisy, resulting in suboptimal performance. Comparing the results of the many-to-many model with density map output (#8) as described in Section III-A2 (an LSTM trailed by a 1D CNN and a linear layer) with the results of the many-to-many model with density map with only an LSTM trailed by a linear layer and without 1D CNN (#9) shows the importance of including 1D CNN in the proposed model. Across all settings, the proposed method outperformed the modified TransRAC method (#3-4), Section IV-C. The reason for this can be attributed to two factors: the extreme complexity of the modified TransRAC model in comparison to the simple yet effective sequential models used in this paper, as well as the limited number of training samples in the KIMORE dataset. It is common for healthcare and rehabilitation datasets to have a small number of training samples. In this regard, it illustrates the necessity of taking the amount of data into account when selecting and designing the architecture of deep neural networks. The RGB videos of exercises included in the KIMORE dataset were input into the original TransRAC model which was pre-trained on the RepCount video dataset  (#2). The results are much inferior to those predicted by the proposed architectures. The RepCount dataset contains videos of healthy subjects performing repetitive actions perfectly, while the KIMORE dataset contains rehabilitation exercises conducted by patients with imperfect repetitive actions. Comparing the results of different features provided to the many-to-many model with density map output, body joints (#8), features extracted from body joints (#6), and their concatenation (#7) indicates that for the repetition counting and segmentation tasks, there is no need to extract handcrafted features from body joints  and the body joints as the input to the models result in the best performance. According to the results of the general model trained and evaluated on all the samples in the dataset (#8), as compared to the exercise-specific models trained and evaluated on specific exercises (#5), exercise-specific models are not needed for repetition counting and segmentation tasks, and general models perform marginally better than exercise-specific models. Comparing the performance of the models for specific exercises reveals that almost all methods had difficulty segmenting and counting repetitions for Ex. 4 in the KIMORE dataset. This is due to the fact that Ex. 4 involved pelvis rotations, i.e., movements along the z axis, which is relatively difficult to capture by depth cameras and analyze by models. As the movements in Ex. 4 differed from those in other exercises, which involved movements of the hands and feet along the x and y axes, it was difficult to generalize models to the samples in Ex. 4. There is a similar overall trend in the performance of different methods in different settings across all four evaluation metrics, MAE, OBO, IOU, and MAE-F. Overall, the general many-to-many model with density map output trained with Kinect body joints achieved superior results with the lowest total MAE (0.5313) and the highest total OBO (0.9233) for repetition counting, as well as the highest total IOU (0.6886) and the lowest total MAE-F (28) for repetition segmentation.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: The body joints captured by the Kinect camera in the dataset (rows #4-11 in tables), the raw RGB videos in the dataset (#2), and the body joints extracted from the RGB videos by OpenPose (#1 and #3) [ref]23 were analyzed in the experiments in Table I.
