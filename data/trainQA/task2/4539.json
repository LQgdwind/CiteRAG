Komodakis et al.  used an attention-based distillation method to match the activation-based and gradient-based spatial attention maps. The flow of solution procedure (FSP) [ref]23, generated by computing the Gram matrix of features across layers, was used to transfer knowledge. The RKD  captures cross-instance relations by designing a loss function to penalize the structure variations. Li et al.  developed a new framework to correct noisy labels by using knowledge learned from small clean datasets and semantic knowledge graphs. Different from them, we not only pull the features between the student and the teacher directly, but also allows the student network to learn the relative positional relationships between instances in the teacher’s network during the distillation process. This relative positional relationship, specifically (which instances are close, far, and how they are distributed), within a mini-batch, is what we call “structure.” Hence the name of our distillation method is “structure-aware.”  Structure—aware distillation methods:\nStructure-aware distillation adopts the idea of distilling knowledge from structural data. The CRCD  estimates the mutual relation and transfers structured knowledge from anchor teacher to anchor student in a contrastive learning framework. Pairwise distillation methods distilled pairwise and holistic similarities . The similarity-preserving KD  constrains the similarity between teacher network features and the student one, which complements the conventional distillation methods.\nHowever, different from their works, we propose to a new method use graph neural network to model the similarity relationship between different modalities, by updating the “node” and “edge” inside one modality, forming an entire graph-level representation to describe this modality and then take them closer. Cross-modal distillation using contrastive learning:\nMost recently, KD methods using the contrastive learning pulls the representations of positive pairs but push the negative pairs. The Contrastive Multiview Coding (CMC)  is a cross-view learning method to align different views of the same instances by contrastive learning. The Contrastive Representation Distillation (CRD)  transfers knowledge by instance-level contrastive learning and uses a large memory bank to store negative samples.\nChen et al.  proposed to use contrastive learning to distill information from the image and audio to video analysis. Different from other contrastive learning KD method, we proposed a novel dual-modality K-hard negative queues, storing the negative samples of the sleep stages. In addition, we designed the symmetric contrastive distillation losses, leveraging negative pairs from two modalities.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: Knowledge distillation (KD): The KD  [ref]20 [ref]21 methods transfer knowledge from the teacher to the student network, by supervising the student network using the pseudo labels.
