      "content": "Paper Title: Knowledge Distillation Methods for Efficient Unsupervised Adaptation Across Multiple Domains\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConvolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many visual recognition tasks, i.e., classification, object detection, and segmentation. However, a key limitation that hampers their scalability is their poor generalization to data from new unseen domains, where there exists a shift between data collected for training, source domain, and one/multiple deployment environments, target domains. Particularly, in real-world video surveillance applications like person re-identification, deep Siamese networks are commonly trained to process videos captured over a distributed network of cameras. The variations in data distributions in terms of the different types of the cameras, viewpoints, and capture conditions can cause a significant domain shift, and degrade accuracy [ref]1. Another drawback of state-of-the-art CNNs is the computational complexity, which impedes its adoption in real-time applications.\nAlthough it is possible to address the domain shift problem by annotating target domain data and applying supervised transfer learning, the cost of collecting and annotating a large image dataset for each target domain can be prohibitively costly. To alleviate this issue when only unlabeled target data is available, several unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques have been proposed. Currently, most of UDA techniques focus on learning domain invariant features by minimizing a distance or discrepancy between the two data distributions [ref]2, to encourage domain confusion by using adversarial losses [ref]3 , or both . Lastly, it is also possible to learn a mapping between source and target images  , such that images captured in different domains have a similar appearance, which mimics standard supervised learning. While these techniques are very useful for single-target domain adaptation (STDA), they fail to adapt to a multi-target domain adaptation (MTDA) scenario, a relatively unexplored setting of practical importance, where a single model is trained to generalize well across multiple different target domains. A simple solution would be to solve the problem of MTDA by having one CNN trained on each target domain. Nevertheless, this would be very costly in terms of computational resources. For instance, in person re-identification, MTDA can be addressed by adapting a CNN per target domain, or blending target data to adapt a common CNN, although in many real-world applications, these solutions are too costly, and may lead to a reduction in accuracy. Current literature tackles the MTDA task by either taking advantage of domain labels from each target domain  or ignoring these labels and mix all the target domains together . The Figure 1 illustrates the difference between STDA, MTDA and some possible solutions for an MTDA setting. Current techniques allow to accelerate and compress CNNs while preserving its accuracy. These approaches include: quantization   , low-rank approximation  , knowledge distillation (KD)     and network pruning     . However, the direction of jointly compressing and adapting CNN to a target domain remains largely unexplored. To the best of our knowledge, only the Transfer Channel Pruning (TCP) technique  has been proposed to first solve the UDA problem, and then pruning the adapted model. As for using UDA and KD, while recent work   resort to KD to address the UDA task, they focus on reducing the domain gap, rather than the computational cost. Furthermore, most KD techniques rely on labeled dataset whereas in the UDA setting, we do not have access to these labels, which represents an important challenge for the co-joint optimization of KD and UDA. While it is possible to adopt a compressed CNN to a new target domain, we argue that this scenario will likely degrade the performance of the CNN since over-parametrization is often important for generalization . Another alternative could be to first adapt a model to the target domain and then compress it. However, we experimentally demonstrate that such a scenario results in poor performance due to the lack of label information for knowledge distillation. In this paper, we resolve the aforementioned problem by progressively distilling knowledge from a teacher model that is continuously doing domain adaptation to the student. We argue that this can improve the performance since the student learns how to adapt to a new domain instead of learning directly from a previously targeted domain. In addition, we overcome the problem of unsupervised KD for the student model by jointly optimizing UDA and KD and by keeping the student model consistent with the source domain. Our proposed approach can also be generalized for a multi-target domain adaptation – MTDA, where there exist multiple target domains– by assigning each teacher to a different target domain. In order to address the problem of CNN complexity and domain shift over one or multiple domains, this paper introduces the following contributions.\n1) we propose a new approach for joint KD and UDA that allows training CNNs such that they generalize well on one or multiple target domains;\n2) we introduce a consistency loss that ensures that the student models also learn source domain knowledge from the teacher model in order to overcome the challenges of unsupervised KD on target data;\n3) this paper extends our previous work  in a substantial way by providing new algorithms and extensive experimental results to validate our approach on different UDA and feature distillation techniques;\n4) finally, we extend to the MTDA setting, where our KD-MTDA approach relies on multiple teachers to provide a higher capacity to generalize for multiple target domains, as well to distill their compressed knowledge to a smaller common student CNN that can perform well across multiple target domains. The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of state-of-the-art methods for compression and UDA with CNNs. Then, Section 3 introduces our proposed KD approaches for STDA and MTDA of CNNs. The experimental methodology employed for validation, and the results and discussions are described in Sections 4 and 5, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: network of cameras.
