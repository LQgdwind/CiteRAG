      "content": "Paper Title: Accelerating Iterated Persistent Homology Computations with Warm Starts\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPersistent homology is an algebraic invariant of filtered topological spaces commonly used in topological data analysis and in other areas of applied and computational topology. At its core, persistent homology is typically computed using factorizations of the boundary matrices obtained from applying the chain functor (with field coefficients) to a finite cell complex . A variety of improvements and optimizations to this algorithm have been developed       along with efficient implementations  [ref]5  which have allowed for the computation of persistent homology of increasingly large filtrations. However, a variety of problems require not just the computation of persistent homology of a single large filtration but of many related filtrations - examples include feature generation for data in machine learning tasks     as well as in continuous optimization problems with persistent homology included in the objective  [ref]10 5   . In this work, we develop an update scheme for computing persistent homology which updates the computation for a related problem with a warm-start and this scheme can be used efficiently in applications which require iterated computations. We provide a brief introduction to the necessary building blocks from algebraic topology to describe our algorithms. For a more complete introduction to computational topology and persistent homology, we refer to  . A cell complex 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} is a collection of contractible cells of varying dimensions in which q𝑞q-dimensional cells are connected to (q−1)𝑞1(q-1)-dimensional cells with maps on their boundaries. For simplicity, one may consider simplicial or cubical complexes where these boundary maps are determined combinatorially. Furthermore, we will only consider finite cell complexes.\nHomology (with field coefficients) in dimension q𝑞q is a functor from a topological category to the category of vector spaces over a field k𝑘k. The homological dimension q𝑞q captures information about q𝑞q-dimensional features: q=0𝑞0q=0 encodes connected components, q=1𝑞1q=1 encodes loops, and general q𝑞q encodes q𝑞q-dimensional voids. A filtration, or filtered cell complex, is a sequence of cell complexes related by inclusion Persistent homology is the application of homology with coefficients in a field k𝑘k to the filtration in Equation 1. The result can be considered as a k​[T]𝑘delimited-[]𝑇k[T] module  where the grading by T𝑇T contains information about the filtration index, or as a diagram of vector spaces connected by linear maps induced by inclusion known as a type-A quiver representation  . Both representations are characterized up to isomorphism by persistence barcodes which are multisets of pairs {(bi,di)}i≥0subscriptsubscript𝑏𝑖subscript𝑑𝑖𝑖0\\{(b_{i},d_{i})\\}_{i\\geq 0} that describe the birth and death of homological features in the filtration. Persistent Homology is computed by first applying the cellular chain functor to cell complexes. A chain complex C∗​(𝒳)subscript𝐶∗𝒳C_{\\ast}(\\mathcal{X}) consists of vector spaces Cq​(𝒳)subscript𝐶𝑞𝒳C_{q}(\\mathcal{X}), q=0,1,…𝑞01…q=0,1,\\dots with a basis element for each q𝑞q-dimensional cell, and maps which map the basis element of a cell to a linear combination of basis elements of cells in its boundary. The boundary maps have the property Dq−1∘Dq=0subscript𝐷𝑞1subscript𝐷𝑞0D_{q-1}\\circ D_{q}=0, and homology is computed as the quotient vector space Most algorithms for computing persistent homology are based on computing a factorization of filtered boundary matrix, meaning the rows and columns of Dqsubscript𝐷𝑞D_{q} are arranged in the order of appearance of cells in the filtration: where Vqsubscript𝑉𝑞V_{q} is upper-triangular and Rqsubscript𝑅𝑞R_{q} is reduced, which means that it has unique low pivots, i.e. the index of the last non-zero row of each column (if it exists) is unique. The computation of Rqsubscript𝑅𝑞R_{q} is implicit in the early work of Edelsbrunner, Lester, and Zomorodian , an explicit algorithm and analysis for Rqsubscript𝑅𝑞R_{q} was given by Zomorodian and Carlsson , and then a factorization viewpoint was introduced by Cohen-Steiner, Edelsbrunner, and Morozov  when developing a scheme for updating persistent homology, the starting point for this work. We can obtain the persistence information from the factorization in Equation 4 for each dimension q𝑞q. Only Rqsubscript𝑅𝑞R_{q} is needed to read off persistent homology: a q𝑞q-dimensional homology class is born when a cell is added that generates a zero column in Rqsubscript𝑅𝑞R_{q}, and this class dies when the index of the birth cell is the pivot of a column of a cell in Rq+1subscript𝑅𝑞1R_{q+1} . It is only necessary to form Vqsubscript𝑉𝑞V_{q} if one wishes to obtain a representative for the homology class, or, as we shall see, update the decomposition.\nA variety of optimizations have been developed for efficient computation of persistent homology which are compatible with the formation of Vqsubscript𝑉𝑞V_{q}, particularly the clearing   and compression   optimizations which are used by state-of-the-art implementations for computing persistent homology  [ref]5.\nOther practical accelerations for persistent homology include the use of discrete Morse theory  and efficient data structures . Our work is motivated by several applications in topological data analysis. First, in exploratory data analysis, one may wish to compute the persistent homology of geometric filtrations (i.e. built using pairwise distances) on point-cloud data. Sometimes several constructions and metrics may be considered, and there may be large amounts of redundant computation done processing the same region for each choice. Second, in a variety of data analysis problems persistent homology is computed as a feature for each datum in a data set      5. Often there is a shared structure which we might expect to exploit. Finally, recent work using persistent homology in gradient-based optimization [ref]10     5 creates a situation where a topological space undergoes relatively minor modifications in each gradient step. We wish to be able to reuse computation to the largest extent possible. The idea of simply updating the factorization in Equation 4 for a series of iterated problems is related to a variety of similar techniques in sparse numerical linear algebra and numerical optimization to update L​U𝐿𝑈LU factorizations  0 6 7. Our goal is to re-use a previous computation to the largest extent possible, known as a “warm start” to the problem. In this work we provide algorithms to compute persistent homology of one filtration starting from the persistent homology of another by updating the associated matrix factorizations. We analyze the complexity of this update in terms of how close the two filtrations are to each other, namely in terms of the number of cells added and deleted from the filtration and in terms of how the filtration’s order changes.\nThis approach generalizes the earlier work of Cohen-Steiner, Edelsbrunner, and Morozov  to include addition and removal of cells from a filtration, and includes an analysis that can be applied to general updates beyond elementary permutations. We additionally adapt our update schemes to cohomology and show how to incorporate the clearing optimization.\nBecause we perform all updates in a single batch, our method is better suited for blocked or parallel algorithms than the method described in .\nWe provide several examples of how our techniques provide practical speedups for both level set and geometric filtrations, and our implementations are made publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/YuanL12/TDA_Updating_Persistence.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: the chain functor (with field coefficients) to a finite cell complex .
