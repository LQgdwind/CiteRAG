      "content": "Paper Title: Progressive Correspondence Pruning by Consensus Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor camera pose estimation, we exploit the outdoor YFCC100M¬† and indoor SUN3D¬†[ref]46 datasets, following the settings in¬†[ref]47  (more results on ScanNet¬† and the benchmark of¬†[ref]47 can be found in the appendix). Initial matches are generated by nearest neighbor matching with SIFT¬†, unless otherwise specified.\nThe keypoint coordinates in ùë™ùë™{\\bm{C}} are normalized using the camera intrinsics, as in¬†[ref]29. Following¬†, we report the AUCs of the pose error at different thresholds (5‚àò,10‚àò,20‚àòsuperscript5superscript10superscript205^{\\circ},10^{\\circ},20^{\\circ}). Table¬†1 provides the quantitative results on YFCC100M and SUN3D. For RANSAC¬†, MAGSAC¬†, and NGRANSAC¬†, we cleaned the initial correspondences using the ratio test of¬† with a threshold of 0.90.90.9, because we observed the results without ratio test to be significantly worse. For the other methods, following¬†, we employ RANSAC as a robust estimator when estimating the essential matrices.\nOur CLNet delivers the best AUCs on both two datasets, even outperforms the most recent SuperGlue which requires descriptors as input (please refer to the appendix for more comparison with SuperGlue).\n We further consider the case of estimating the essential matrices without a robust estimator, i.e., without RANSAC. In this case, we use a weighted 8-point algorithm, as suggested in ¬†[ref]29 [ref]47 . As shown in Table¬†2, our CLNet achieves remarkably superior results, showing that our iterative pruning scheme makes our approach effective even without requiring an additional RANSAC step. To evaluate generalization ability, we test all learning-based methods on SUN3D with SIFT, and on YFCC100M with ORB¬†5, DoG-HardNet¬†, or SuperPoint¬†, employing the models trained on YFCC100M with SIFT. Our choices of ORB, DoG-HardNet and SuperPoint were motivated by their popularity in SLAM¬†0, demonstrated robustness¬†, and joint detector/descriptor learning ability, respectively. As shown in Table¬†3, CLNet achieves the best performance in all settings, which shows the robustness of our method to different datasets and detector-descriptor combinations.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: For camera pose estimation, we exploit the outdoor YFCC100M¬† and indoor SUN3D¬†[ref]46 datasets, following the settings in¬†[ref]47  (more results on ScanNet¬† and the benchmark of¬†[ref]47 can be found in the appendix).

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
