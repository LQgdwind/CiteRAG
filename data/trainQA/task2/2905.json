      "content": "Paper Title: Exploiting Cross-Modal Prediction and Relation Consistency for Semi-Supervised Image Captioning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe comparison models fall into three categories: 1) state-of-the-art supervised captioning methods: SCST¬†[ref]17, AoANet¬†, AAT¬†[ref]40, ORT¬† and GIC¬†. Note that these methods can only utilize the supervised image-sentence pairs. 2) state-of-the-art unsupervised captioning methods: Graph-align¬† and UIC¬†. These approaches utilize the independent image set and corpus set for training. 3) state-of-the-art semi-supervised method: A3VSE¬†. Moreover, we conduct extra ablation studies to evaluate each term in our proposed CPRC: 1) AoANet+P, we combine the label prediction consistency with the original AoANet generation loss as multi-task loss (only using the supervised data); 2) AoANet+C, we combine the relation consistency loss with the original AoANet generation loss as multi-task loss (only using the supervised data); 3) PL, we replace the prediction consistency with pseudo labeling as traditional semi-supervised methods; 4) AC, we replace the relation consistency with augmentation consistency as traditional semi-supervised methods; 5) Embedding+, we replace the relational consistency loss with embedding consistency loss, which minimizes the difference between the embedding of image inputs and generated sentences; 6) Semantic+, we replace the relational consistency loss with prediction consistency loss, which minimizes the difference between the predictions of image inputs and generated sentences; 7) Strong+, we replace the weak augmentation with strong augmentation for CPRC; 8) w/o Prediction, CPRC only retains the relation consistency loss in Eq. 8; 9) w/o Relation, CPRC only retains the prediction consistency in Eq. 8; and 10) w/o œÑùúè\\tau, CPRC removes the confidence threshold as Eq. 7. For evaluation, we use different metrics, including BLEU¬†, METEOR¬†, ROUGE-L¬†, CIDEr-D¬†[ref]34 and SPICE¬†, to evaluate the proposed method and comparison methods. All the metrics are computed with the publicly released code222https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption. In fact, the CIDer-D and SPICE metric is more suitable for the image caption task¬† [ref]34. One of the problems with using metrics such as BlEU, ROUGE, CIDEr and METEOR is that these metrics are primarily sensitive to n-gram overlap. However, n-gram overlap is neither necessary nor sufficient for two sentences to convey the same meaning¬†[GimenezM07a]. As shown in the example provided by¬†, consider the following two captions (a,b) from the MS COCO dataset: A young girl standing on top of a tennis court. A giraffe standing on top of a green field. The captions describe two different images. However, the mentioned n-gram metrics produces a high similarity score due to the presence of the long 5-gram phrase ‚Äústanding on top of a‚Äù in both captions. Meanwhile, the following captions (c,d) obtained from the same image: A shiny metal pot filled with some diced veggies. The pan on the stove has chopped vegetables in it. These captions convey almost the same meaning, whereas exhibit low n-gram similarity as they have no words in common. To solve this problem, SPICE¬† estimated caption quality by transforming both candidate and reference captions into a graph-based semantic representation (i.e., scene graph). The scene graph can explicitly encodes the objects, attributes and relationships found in image captions, abstracting away most of the lexical and syntactic idiosyncrasies of natural language in the process. CIDer-D¬†[ref]34 measured the similarity of a candidate sentence to a majority of how most people describe the image (i.e. the reference sentences).\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: The comparison models fall into three categories: 1) state-of-the-art supervised captioning methods: SCST¬†[ref]17, AoANet¬†, AAT¬†[ref]40, ORT¬† and GIC¬†. Note that these methods can only utilize the supervised image-sentence pairs. 2) state-of-the-art unsupervised captioning methods: Graph-align¬† and UIC¬†.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
