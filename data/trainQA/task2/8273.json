We assume D⊂ℚ𝐷ℚD\\subset\\mathbb{Q} is any finite domain and the polymorphism in question is the dual discriminator operation ∇∇\\nabla that preserves ΓΓ\\Gamma (see Definition 2.9). The dual discriminator is a majority operation   and is often used as a starting point in many CSP-related classifications .\nFor a finite domain D𝐷D, a ternary operation f𝑓f is called a majority operation if f​(a,a,b)=f​(a,b,a)=f​(b,a,a)=a𝑓𝑎𝑎𝑏𝑓𝑎𝑏𝑎𝑓𝑏𝑎𝑎𝑎f(a,a,b)=f(a,b,a)=f(b,a,a)=a for all a,b∈D𝑎𝑏𝐷a,b\\in D. The dual discriminator on a domain D𝐷D, denoted by ∇∇\\nabla, is a majority operation such that ∇(a,b,c)=a∇𝑎𝑏𝑐𝑎\\nabla(a,b,c)=a for pairwise distinct a,b,c∈D𝑎𝑏𝑐𝐷a,b,c\\in D. Observe that both R1subscript𝑅1R_{1} and R2subscript𝑅2R_{2} from Example 2.10 are ∇∇\\nabla-closed.\nThe well-known 2-SAT problem is another example of a CSP whose language is closed under the Boolean majority polymorphism (note that the majority operation on a Boolean set is also a dual discriminator operation). In the remainder we will assume that the solution set is non-empty, as this can be verified in polynomial time using the Arc-Consistency (AC) algorithm 7. The constraints for ∇∇\\nabla-closed problems can be assumed to be binary  [ref]33 and are of three types: permutation constraints, complete constraints and two-fan constraints  . Bulatov and Rafiey [ref]12 proved that the IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma) over a finite domain is decidable in polynomial time, without showing a proof of membership. They did so by cleverly eliminating the permutation constraints, but were unable to recover a proof for the original problem. We show that a Gröbner basis of the ideal restricted to the permutation constraints can be computed in polynomial time in Section 4.1. We then show in Section 4.2 that the Gröbner basis of constraints that are complete and two-fan constraints can come from a fixed set (see Definition 4.4).\nWe prove in Section 4.3 that the Gröbner basis of the entire ideal can be found in polynomial time. This Gröbner basis is independent of degree d𝑑d of the input polynomial: it only contains polynomials with degree less than or equal to |D|!𝐷|D|!.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: that the solution set is non-empty, as this can be verified in polynomial time using the Arc-Consistency (AC) algorithm 7.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
