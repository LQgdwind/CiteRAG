      "content": "Paper Title: MGNNI: Multiscale Graph Neural Networks with Implicit Layers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely adopted on graph-related tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification .\nIn general, GNNs utilize both node attributes and graph topology to produce meaningful node representations for downstream applications.\nTo achieve this, most modern GNNs follow a ‚Äúmessage passing‚Äù mechanism: at each iteration, they iteratively aggregate representations of neighboring nodes of each node with its own representation to generate new representations. During this process, each iteration is typically parameterized as a single-layer neural network with learnable weights.\nMany GNN models have been proposed by adopting different aggregations techniques (e.g., GCN with renormalization , GAT with attentive aggregations on neighbors , and SGC  using aggregations without non-linear activation).\nIn spite of the effectiveness achieved by the aforementioned GNNs on different tasks, they fail to effectively capture long-range information on graphs, since a GNN with T layers can only capture information up to T hops away. To overcome this deficiency of previous GNNs, recent work has proposed implicit graph neural networks 3  1 to effectively capture long-range dependencies.\nThese implicit graph neural networks generally define a fixed-point equation as an implicit layer for aggregation and generate the equilibrium Z‚àósuperscriptùëçZ^{*} as the node representations.\nTo get the equilibrium, they either use an iterative solver to solve the equation or directly obtain a closed-form solution with guaranteed convergence. Meanwhile, they utilize implicit differentiation to achieve ùí™‚Äã(1)ùí™1\\mathcal{O}(1) memory complexity when computing the gradients during the iterations.\nAs mentioned in Gu et¬†al. 3, Liu et¬†al. , these models can be treated as a graph neural network with infinite layers which has the same transformation and shared weights in each layer.\nThis makes them able to effectively capture long-range dependencies without excessive memory requirements as compared with previous GNNs. Despite the superiority of implicit GNNs shown in several applications requiring long-range information, an important question ‚Äî what the farthest range these models can capture information from ‚Äî has not been studied.\nAlthough these models are usually claimed as GNNs with infinite depth 3 , in this paper, we first point out the effective range of these models (i.e., the maximum hops they can effectively capture dependencies for each node) is actually bounded by a certain value.\nWe provide analyses on the intrinsic relationship between the effective range and the convergence of the iterative equation used in implicit GNNs.\nSpecifically, these models usually use a contraction factor Œ≥ùõæ\\gamma to ensure the convergence of the iterative map  1, which indeed exponentially decays the distant information during the aggregation at the same time.\nThis design inherently limits the effective range of propagation and hinders their ability to capture long-range dependencies. Besides the limited effective range, implicit GNNs also cannot effectively capture multiscale information on graphs, i.e., graph features at various scales.\nIn contrast, several GNNs without implicit layers [ref]30    have been proposed to utilize multiscale information to improve the model capacity.\nFor example, Xu et¬†al. [ref]30 proposes JKNet which leverages different neighborhood ranges by skip connections and adaptive aggregations of hidden representations at different layers.\nMixHop  learns neighborhood mixing relationships by mixing hidden representations at various distances.\nThese explicit GNN models demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing multiscale information from neighbors at various scales.\nHowever, it is still not clear how to utilize multiscale information with implicit GNNs since there are no different ‚Äúlayers‚Äù in implicit GNNs that can be used for capturing multiscale information at different scales. Motivated by the above limitations of previous implicit GNNs, we propose our multiscale graph neural network with implicit layers (MGNNI) which brings multiscale modeling into implicit GNNs and expands their effective range for capturing long-range dependencies. We summarize the contributions of this work as follows: We introduce the concept of effective range for implicit GNNs, and provide theoretical analyses on the effective range that previous implicit GNNs can capture distant information from. We then point out that their effective range is limited although previous models are generally regarded as GNNs with infinite layers. We propose MGNNI as a new implicit GNN model with multiscale propagation to expand the effective range and capture underlying graph information at various scales. We conduct comprehensive experiments with synthetic datasets and real-world datasets on both node classification and graph classification to demonstrate that MGNNI has better performance and a better ability to capture both long-range and multiscale information compared with other baselines.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: the limited effective range, implicit GNNs also cannot effectively capture multiscale information on graphs, i.e., graph features at various scales.\nIn contrast, several GNNs without implicit layers [ref]30    have been proposed to utilize multiscale information to improve the model capacity.\nFor example, Xu et¬†al.
