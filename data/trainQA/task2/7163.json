Auctions are modelled as games of (in)complete information, with continuous type- and action-spaces. Traditionally, the solution concept of an auction game has then been a (Bayes)-Nash equilibrium (BNE); a set of bidding strategies for each agent such that no agent may unilaterally deviate and increase their payoff. However, the assertion that the expected behaviour of agents in an auction is a BNE is problematic for several reasons. First, the Bayes-Nash equilibrium need not be unique. In this case, we are faced with an equilibrium selection problem ; how do we know which of the equilibria will be the result of play? This turns out not to be a problem after all, as in a variety of single-parameter auctions, the unique BNE ends up being the canonical symmetric equilibrium . The harder-to-rectify issue relates to computational complexity; it is computationally hard to compute a BNE in arbitrary games  [ref]8 , or even for the standard first- or second-price auctions   . The theory of learning in games asks if and when independent learning behavior leads to equilibrium if the game is being played repeatedly  [ref]22. It provides a potential resolution to the equilibrium selection problem; the idea is that we may assume agents implement some learning algorithm, and then attempt to obtain a qualitative description or theoretical guarantees on their behaviour. A classical result is that the class of no-regret learning algorithms converges to the so-called [coarse] correlated equilibrium ([C]CE) of a game . This is a generalisation of the idea of a Nash equilibrium for a game of complete information and can be solved for in time polynomial in the size of the game. However, what the correct form of a (C)CE is in the Bayesian setting is a contentious issue , and not much is known about the Bayesian (C)CE (B(C)CE) of single-item auctions. A result of Feldman et al.¬† [ref]14 show that even for the complete information first-price auction, there are CCE dissimilar to the BNE of the auction, even though its correlated equilibria are convex combinations of pure strategy NE. Meanwhile, Lopomo et al.¬† show that the Bayesian CE of a discretised first-price auction with two buyers and two types tends to a Nash equilibrium as the discretisation of the bidding space becomes more refined. We also remark that known results on the convergence of common no-regret learning algorithms to a BNE in these auction settings is conditional. In the complete information setting, Deng et al.  show that mean-based algorithms converge to an NE of a discretised first-price auction, despite the fact that the set of CCE is a large superset of the NE in this game. On the Bayesian front, Feng et al.¬† show that for two buyer discretised second- and first-price auctions, mean-based learning algorithms place high probability about the equilibrium bidding strategies. However, these probability lower bounds depend on the length of a pre-training round where buyers sample their bids uniformly at random. A number of articles recently introduced learning algorithms for Bayesian auction games and showed convergence to an ŒµùúÄ\\varepsilon-BNE on a wide variety of auction models ranging from simple single-object auctions in the independent private values (IPV) model to interdependent valuations and models with multiple objects  . The SODA algorithm uses first-order methods to learn distributional strategies in a discretised version of the auction game . While it can always be checked empirically whether an approximate equilibrium was found, the approach even provides an ex-post guarantee. This means, that if the algorithm converges, it has to be a Bayes-Nash equilibrium. However, the (ex-ante) reasons for the convergence of such learning algorithms in auction games have been an open problem so far; we dub this issue the convergence puzzle. Our paper provides an answer for the case of the single-object first-price and all-pay auction, two standard auction formats. Our main result is: In first-price and all-pay auctions under the standard symmetric IPV model, the unique BCCE with symmetric, differentiable and strictly increasing bidding strategies is the unique strict BNE. We provide this result for the standard model with continuous type and action spaces via an infinite-dimensional linear program. The result is based on a new modeling approach using Wasserstein distances and an infinite-dimensional linear program (LP) to characterize the size of BCCEs. Our result on the continuous auction in fact follows from our study of discretised auction settings, which is another contribution we make. Our observation is that, for discretised auctions, the BCCE polytope shrinks with respect to the expected Wasserstein distance from the canonical equilibrium with increasing levels of discretisation. Unlike the infinite dimensional case, this result in fact holds without any assumptions on the bidding strategies. We will first introduce this result, as we extend the appropriate linear programming framework in the discretised case to the continuous one in the proof of our main result. We remark that the conditions under which the BCCE of discretised auctions are close to the canonical equilibrium are also important for the design of practical learning algorithms. The paper proceeds as follows: Section¬†2 introduces the necessary definitions and the notation, as well as notions of discrete and continuous auctions. Section¬†3 introduces a linear programming model characterising the BCCE of these auctions, where we introduce the Wasserstein-222 distance as an objective. The extended LP formulation tends to have size exponential in the number of players, types and actions, rendering it impractical to solve. Therefore, we come up with an LP relaxation that is tractable for numerical analysis. The analysis for the first-price and all-pay auction allows for an interesting observation: the worst-case Wasserstein distance to the canonical equilibrium of the auction decreases with increasing levels of discretisation. For the all-pay auction, this is the case independent of the prior distribution, whereas for the first-price auction, this behavior is only observed for concave priors. Also, the convergence is not monotonous and depends on the type of discretisation. This motivates us to analyze the continuous case. We characterise conditions for the uniqueness of the BCCE in discretised auctions in Section¬†3.4, before we discuss the uniqueness of the BCCE in the continuous game in Section¬†4. We analyze the corresponding infinite-dimensional LP, and show that if we limit our attention to symmetric, differentiable, and strictly increasing strategies in this LP, then the objective function value is null, and weak duality holds. This result is independent of the prior distribution. Overall, our work finds an appropriate framework to analyse the convergence of no-regret algorithms in Bayesian auction games, and it identifies the tools required to establish results within it.\nWe don‚Äôt yet know if the uniqueness of BCCEs also holds for other auction models in which we see empirical convergence. The analysis of other models including auctions with asymmetries or multiple units is left for future research.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: the unique BNE ends up being the canonical symmetric equilibrium .
