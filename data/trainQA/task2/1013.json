For the Boolean case, it was shown  that VPA describe the same class of queries as MSO over nested words, called MSOmatchsubscriptMSOmatch\\text{MSO}_{\\textsf{match}}.\nFormally, fix a structured alphabet ΣΣ\\Sigma and let w∈Σ<*>𝑤superscriptΣ<*>w\\in\\Sigma^{\\texttt{<*>}} be a word of length n𝑛n.\nWe encode w𝑤w as a structure: where [1,n]1𝑛[1,n] is the domain, ≤\\leq\nis the total order over [1,n]1𝑛[1,n], Pa={i∣w​[i]=a}subscript𝑃𝑎conditional-set𝑖𝑤delimited-[]𝑖𝑎P_{a}=\\{i\\mid w[i]=a\\}, and 𝗆𝖺𝗍𝖼𝗁𝗆𝖺𝗍𝖼𝗁\\sf{match} is a binary relation over [1,n]1𝑛[1,n] that corresponds to the matching relation of open and close symbols: match​(i,j)match𝑖𝑗\\textsf{match}(i,j) is true iff w​[i]𝑤delimited-[]𝑖w[i] is an open symbol and w​[j]𝑤delimited-[]𝑗w[j] is its matching close symbol.\nBy some abuse of notation, we also use w𝑤w to denote its corresponding logical structure.\nA MSOmatchsubscriptMSOmatch\\text{MSO}_{\\textsf{match}} formula φ𝜑\\varphi over ΣΣ\\Sigma is given by: where a∈Σ𝑎Σa\\in\\Sigma, x𝑥x and y𝑦y are first-order variables and X𝑋X is a monadic second order (MSO) variable.\nWe write φ​(X1,…,Xn)𝜑subscript𝑋1…subscript𝑋𝑛\\varphi(X_{1},\\ldots,X_{n}) where X1,…,Xnsubscript𝑋1…subscript𝑋𝑛X_{1},\\ldots,X_{n} are the free MSO variables of φ𝜑\\varphi (first-order variables are a special case of MSO variables).\nThen we write w⊧φ​(A1,…,An)models𝑤𝜑subscript𝐴1…subscript𝐴𝑛w\\models\\varphi(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}) for A1,…,An⊆[1,n]subscript𝐴1…subscript𝐴𝑛1𝑛A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\subseteq[1,n] when w𝑤w satisfies φ𝜑\\varphi by replacing each variable Xisubscript𝑋𝑖X_{i} with the set Aisubscript𝐴𝑖A_{i}. Here, we assume the standard semantics for MSO logic [ref]43. Given that VPT is an extension of VPA, it should not be a surprise that we can translate these results to VPT. In particular, the result in  can be easily extended to link VPT with formulas expressible in MSOmatchsubscriptMSOmatch\\text{MSO}_{\\textsf{match}}. Let φ​(X1,…,Xm)𝜑subscript𝑋1…subscript𝑋𝑚\\varphi(X_{1},\\ldots,X_{m}) be a MSOmatchsubscriptMSOmatch\\text{MSO}_{\\textsf{match}} formula with m𝑚m free variables X1,…,Xmsubscript𝑋1…subscript𝑋𝑚X_{1},\\ldots,X_{m}.\nThere is a VPT TT\\pazocal{T}\\! for which there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set\n⟦T⟧(w)\\llbracket\\pazocal{T}\\!\\mkern 1.0mu\\rrbracket(w)\nand the set {(A1,…,Am)∣w⊧φ​(A1,…,Am)}conditional-setsubscript𝐴1…subscript𝐴𝑚models𝑤𝜑subscript𝐴1…subscript𝐴𝑚\\{(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{m})\\mid w\\models\\varphi(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{m})\\} for any word w∈Σ<*>𝑤superscriptΣ<*>w\\in\\Sigma^{\\texttt{<*>}}.\nMoreover, for every VPT TT\\pazocal{T}\\! there is an MSOmatchsubscriptMSOmatch\\text{MSO}_{\\textsf{match}} formula φ​(X1,…,Xm)𝜑subscript𝑋1…subscript𝑋𝑚\\varphi(X_{1},\\ldots,X_{m}) for which the same one-to-one correspondence holds. In other words, VPT has the same expressive power as MSO over nested words. Given that fragments of query languages over nested documents (e.g., navigational XPath 4, JSON Navigational Logic ) are usually included in MSO, this shows that VPT is an expressive formalism for query evaluation over nested documents.\nAs an example, in the appendix we show how to translate some XPath queries into , including QQ\\pazocal{Q}. We say that a T=(Q,Σ,Γ,Ω,Δ,I,F)TQΣΓΩΔIF\\pazocal{T}\\!=(Q,\\Sigma,\\Gamma,\\Omega,\\Delta,I,F) is input/output deterministic (I/O-deterministic for short) if |I|=1𝐼1|I|=1 and ΔΔ\\Delta is a partial function of the form Δ:(Q×Σ<×Ω→Q×Γ)∪(Q×Σ>×Ω×Γ→Q)∪(Q×Σ|×Ω→Q):Δ→𝑄superscriptΣ<Ω𝑄Γ→𝑄superscriptΣ>ΩΓ𝑄→𝑄superscriptΣ|Ω𝑄\\Delta:(Q\\times\\Sigma^{\\texttt{<}}\\times\\Omega\\to Q\\times\\Gamma)\\cup(Q\\times\\Sigma^{\\texttt{>}}\\times\\Omega\\times\\Gamma\\to Q)\\cup(Q\\times\\Sigma^{\\texttt{|}}\\times\\Omega\\to Q).\nOn the other hand, we say that TT\\pazocal{T}\\! is input/output unambiguous (I/O-unambiguous for short) if for every w∈Σ<*>𝑤superscriptΣ<*>w\\in\\Sigma^{\\texttt{<*>}} and every μ∈⟦T⟧(w)\\mu\\in\\llbracket\\pazocal{T}\\!\\mkern 1.0mu\\rrbracket(w) there is exactly one accepting run ρ𝜌\\rho of TT\\pazocal{T}\\! over w𝑤w such that μ=out​(ρ)𝜇out𝜌\\mu=\\textsf{out}(\\rho).\nNotice that an I/O-deterministic is also I/O-unambiguous and in both models for each output there exists at most one run. The definition of I/O-deterministic is in line with the notion of I/O-deterministic variable automata of  and I/O-unambiguous is a generalization of this idea that is enough for the purpose of our enumeration algorithm. One can show that for every TT\\pazocal{T}\\! there exists an equivalent I/O-deterministic and, therefore, an equivalent I/O-unambiguous . For every TT\\pazocal{T}\\! there exists an I/O-deterministic T′superscriptT′\\pazocal{T}\\!^{\\prime} of size O​(2|Q|2​|Γ|)Osuperscript2superscriptQ2Γ\\pazocal{O}(2^{|Q|^{2}|\\Gamma|}) such that ⟦T⟧(w)=⟦T′⟧(w)\\llbracket\\pazocal{T}\\!\\mkern 1.0mu\\rrbracket(w)=\\llbracket\\pazocal{T}\\!^{\\prime}\\mkern 1.0mu\\rrbracket(w) for every w∈Σ<*>𝑤superscriptΣ<*>w\\in\\Sigma^{\\texttt{<*>}}. In this paper, we are interested on the following streaming enumeration problem for . Let CC\\pazocal{C} be a class of (e.g. I/O-deterministic ). \n\n\n\nProblem:\nEnumVPT​[C]EnumVPTdelimited-[]C\\textsc{EnumVPT}[\\pazocal{C}]\n\n\n\nInput:\na T∈CTC\\pazocal{T}\\!\\in\\pazocal{C} and w∈Σ<*>𝑤superscriptΣ<*>w\\in\\Sigma^{\\texttt{<*>}}\n\nOutput:\nEnumerate ⟦T⟧(w)\\llbracket\\pazocal{T}\\!\\mkern 1.0mu\\rrbracket(w)\n\n\n The main result of the paper is that for the class of I/O-unambiguous , the streaming full-enumeration version of this problem can be solved efficiently. The streaming full-enumeration problem of EnumVPT for the class of I/O-unambiguous can be solved with update-time O​(|Q|2​|Δ|)OsuperscriptQ2Δ\\pazocal{O}(|Q|^{2}|\\Delta|) and output-linear delay. For the general class of , it can be solved with update-time O​(2|Q|2​|Δ|)Osuperscript2superscriptQ2Δ\\pazocal{O}(2^{|Q|^{2}|\\Delta|}) and output-linear delay. The result for the class of all is a consequence of Lemma 4.2 and the enumeration algorithm for I/O-unambiguous (see Section 5 and 6). For both cases, if the is fixed (i.e., in data complexity), then the update-time of the streaming algorithm is constant. For the streaming version of EnumVPT, one can have ΔΔ\\Delta-enumeration with a small loss of efficiency by solving the full-enumeration problem. Specifically, one can show that for any I/O-unambiguous TT\\pazocal{T}\\! there is an I/O-unambiguous T′superscriptT′\\pazocal{T}\\!^{\\prime} of linear size with respect to |T|T|\\pazocal{T}\\!| such that ⟦T′⟧(w)=⟦T⟧(w)∖⋃{⟦T⟧(w[1,i])∣i<|w|,w[1,i]∈Σ<*>}\\llbracket\\pazocal{T}\\!^{\\prime}\\mkern 1.0mu\\rrbracket(w)=\\llbracket\\pazocal{T}\\!\\mkern 1.0mu\\rrbracket(w)\\setminus\\bigcup\\,\\{\\llbracket\\pazocal{T}\\!\\mkern 1.0mu\\rrbracket(w[1,i])\\mid i<|w|,w[1,i]\\in\\Sigma^{\\texttt{<*>}}\\} for each w∈Σ<*>𝑤superscriptΣ<*>w\\in\\Sigma^{\\texttt{<*>}}. The streaming ΔΔ\\Delta-enumeration problem of EnumVPT for the class of I/O-unambiguous can be solved with update-time O​(|Q|2​|Δ|)OsuperscriptQ2Δ\\pazocal{O}(|Q|^{2}|\\Delta|) and output-linear delay. For the general class of , it can be solved with update-time O​(2|Q|2​|Δ|)Osuperscript2superscriptQ2Δ\\pazocal{O}(2^{|Q|^{2}|\\Delta|}) and output-linear delay. We could have considered a more general definition of VPT to produce outputs for prefix-nested words. This would be desirable for having some sort of earliest query answering  which is important in practical scenarios. We remark that the algorithm of Theorem 4.3 can be extended for this case at the cost of making the presentation more complicated. For the sake of presentation, we defer this extension to the full version of this paper. Space lower bounds of evaluating a .\nThis subsection deals with the space used by the streaming evaluation algorithm of Theorem 4.3.\nIndeed, this algorithm could use linear space in the worst case. In the following we explore some lower bounds in the space needed by any algorithm, and show that this bound is tight for a certain type of . To study the minimum number of bits needed to solve EnumVPT we need to introduce some definitions.\nFix a TT\\pazocal{T}\\! and w∈prefix​(Σ<*>)𝑤prefixsuperscriptΣ<*>w\\in\\textsf{prefix}(\\Sigma^{\\texttt{<*>}}). Let\n𝗈𝗎𝗍𝗉𝗎𝗍𝗐𝖾𝗂𝗀𝗁𝗍​(T,w)𝗈𝗎𝗍𝗉𝗎𝗍𝗐𝖾𝗂𝗀𝗁𝗍Tw\\mathsf{outputweight}(\\pazocal{T}\\!,w) be the number of positions less than |w|𝑤|w| that appear in some output of ⟦T⟧(w⋅w′)\\llbracket\\pazocal{T}\\!\\mkern 1.0mu\\rrbracket(w\\cdot w^{\\prime}) for some w⋅w′∈Σ<*>⋅𝑤superscript𝑤′superscriptΣ<*>w\\cdot w^{\\prime}\\in\\Sigma^{\\texttt{<*>}}.\nFurthermore, for a well-nested word u𝑢u let 0​p​t​(u)0𝑝𝑡𝑢0pt(u) be the maximum number of nesting pairs inside u𝑢u, formally, 0​p​t​(a)=00𝑝𝑡𝑎00pt(a)=0 for a∈Σ|∪{ε}𝑎superscriptΣ|𝜀a\\in\\Sigma^{\\texttt{|}}\\cup\\{\\varepsilon\\}, 0​p​t​(u1⋅u2)=max⁡{0​p​t​(u1),0​p​t​(u2)}0𝑝𝑡⋅subscript𝑢1subscript𝑢20𝑝𝑡subscript𝑢10𝑝𝑡subscript𝑢20pt(u_{1}\\cdot u_{2})=\\max\\{0pt(u_{1}),0pt(u_{2})\\}, and 0​p​t​(<​a⋅u⋅b​>)=0​p​t​(u)+10𝑝𝑡⋅<𝑎𝑢𝑏>0𝑝𝑡𝑢10pt({\\scriptsize\\texttt{<}}a\\cdot u\\cdot b{\\scriptsize\\texttt{>}})=0pt(u)+1. For w∈prefix​(Σ<*>)𝑤prefixsuperscriptΣ<*>w\\in\\textsf{prefix}(\\Sigma^{\\texttt{<*>}}), we define 0​p​t​(w)=min⁡{0​p​t​(w′)∣w​ is a prefix of ​w′}0𝑝𝑡𝑤conditional0𝑝𝑡superscript𝑤′𝑤 is a prefix of superscript𝑤′0pt(w)=\\min\\{0pt(w^{\\prime})\\mid w\\text{ is a prefix of }w^{\\prime}\\}.\nWe can now state some worst-case space lower bounds for EnumVPT. There exists a TT\\pazocal{T}\\! such that every streaming evaluation algorithm for EnumVPT with input TT\\pazocal{T}\\! and SS\\pazocal{S} requires at least Ω​(0​p​t​(S​[1,n]))Ω0𝑝𝑡S1n\\Omega(0pt(\\pazocal{S}[1,n])) bits of space. There exists a TT\\pazocal{T}\\! such that every streaming evaluation algorithm for EnumVPT with input TT\\pazocal{T}\\! and SS\\pazocal{S} requires at least Ω​(𝗈𝗎𝗍𝗉𝗎𝗍𝗐𝖾𝗂𝗀𝗁𝗍​(T,S​[1,n]))Ω𝗈𝗎𝗍𝗉𝗎𝗍𝗐𝖾𝗂𝗀𝗁𝗍TS1n\\Omega(\\mathsf{outputweight}(\\pazocal{T}\\!,\\pazocal{S}[1,n])) bits of space. In  , the authors provide lower bounds on the amount of space needed for evaluating XPath in terms of the nesting and the concurrency (see  for a definition).\nOne can show that the output weight of TT\\pazocal{T}\\! and w𝑤w is always above the concurrency of TT\\pazocal{T}\\! and w𝑤w. Despite this, one can check that both notions coincide for the space lower bound given in Proposition 4.5. The previous results show that, in the worst case, any streaming evaluation algorithm for VPT will require space of at least the depth of the document or the output weight.\nTo show that Theorem 4.3 is optimal in the worst-case, we need to consider a further assumption of our . We say that a TT\\pazocal{T}\\! is trimmed  if for every w∈prefix​(Σ<*>)𝑤prefixsuperscriptΣ<*>w\\in\\textsf{prefix}(\\Sigma^{\\texttt{<*>}}) and every (partial) run ρ𝜌\\rho of TT\\pazocal{T}\\! over w𝑤w, there exists w′superscript𝑤′w^{\\prime} and an accepting run ρ′superscript𝜌′\\rho^{\\prime} of TT\\pazocal{T}\\! over w⋅w′⋅𝑤superscript𝑤′w\\cdot w^{\\prime} such that ρ𝜌\\rho is a prefix of ρ′superscript𝜌′\\rho^{\\prime}.\nThis notion is the analog of trimmed non-deterministic automata. Similarly to Lemma 4.2, one can show that for every TT\\pazocal{T}\\! there exists a trimmed I/O-deterministic T′superscriptT′\\pazocal{T}\\!^{\\prime} equivalent to TT\\pazocal{T}\\! (i.e., by extending the construction in  to VPT).\nThe next result shows that, if the input to EnumVPT is a trimmed I/O-unambiguous , then the memory footprint is at most the maximum between the depth and output weight of the input. The streaming enumeration problem of EnumVPT for the class of trimmed I/O-unambiguous can be solved with update-time O​(|Q|2​|Δ|)OsuperscriptQ2Δ\\pazocal{O}(|Q|^{2}|\\Delta|), output-linear delay and O​(max⁡{0​p​t​(S​[1,n]),𝗈𝗎𝗍𝗉𝗎𝗍𝗐𝖾𝗂𝗀𝗁𝗍​(T,S​[1,n])}×|Q|2​|Δ|)O0ptS1n𝗈𝗎𝗍𝗉𝗎𝗍𝗐𝖾𝗂𝗀𝗁𝗍TS1nsuperscriptQ2Δ\\pazocal{O}(\\max\\{0pt(\\pazocal{S}[1,n]),\\mathsf{outputweight}(\\pazocal{T}\\!,\\pazocal{S}[1,n])\\}\\times|Q|^{2}|\\Delta|) space for every stream SS\\pazocal{S}. Unfortunately, the algorithm provided in Theorem 4.3 is not instance optimal, in the sense of using the lowest number of bits needed for each specific (see the appendix).\nNote that an instance optimal algorithm for the streaming enumeration problem of VPT will imply a solution to the weak evaluation problem, stated by Segoufin and Vianu 2. This is an open problem in the area (see  for some recent results), so we leave this for future work.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: when w𝑤w satisfies φ𝜑\\varphi by replacing each variable Xisubscript𝑋𝑖X_{i} with the set Aisubscript𝐴𝑖A_{i}. Here, we assume the standard semantics for MSO logic [ref]43. Given that VPT is an extension of VPA, it should not be a surprise that we can translate these results to VPT.
