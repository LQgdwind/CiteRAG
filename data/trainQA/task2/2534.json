Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

It involves mainly node classification [ref]19 [ref]29 , image classification [ref]29 [ref]31, machine translation problem , recommendation system  . GCN do convolution operation on graph data-structure in two ways defined in [ref]19 and . Kipf et. al [ref]19 have used layer-wise propagation rule for nodes which was inspired from first order approximation of spectral convolutions on graphs. They have applied convolution operation based on the graph structure. It is limited to the characteristics of the graph. While Veličković et. al  have learned node connectivity using neighbourhood of node. So it is more flexible to GCN. So we are using GCN architecture motivated by  to learn node embedding adaptively.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: GCN captures information passing through node in graph.
