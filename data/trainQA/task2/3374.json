      "content": "Paper Title: Perfect Matching in Random Graphs is as Hard as Tseitin\\TCSthanks Supported by the Approximability and Proof Complexity project funded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe show that indeed the perfect matching principle requires large size\non random d𝑑d-regular graphs (for some constant d𝑑d) in the\nSum-of-Squares, Polynomial Calculus, and bounded-depth Frege proof\nsystems. Our results apply more generally to Tseitin-like formulas defined by\nlinear equations over the reals induced by some graph, so let us now define these. For a graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) and integer vector b∈ℤV𝑏superscriptℤ𝑉b\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{V}, consider the\nsystem of linear equations over the reals having a variable xesubscript𝑥𝑒x_{e} for\neach e∈E𝑒𝐸e\\in E, and the equation ∑e∋vxe=bvsubscript𝑣𝑒subscript𝑥𝑒subscript𝑏𝑣\\sum_{e\\ni v}x_{e}=b_{v} for each\nv∈V𝑣𝑉v\\in V. Let Card⁡(G,b)Card𝐺𝑏\\operatorname{Card}(G,b) denote this system of linear equations\nalong with the Boolean constraints xe∈{0,1}subscript𝑥𝑒01x_{e}\\in\\{0,1\\} (viewed as a\nquadratic equation xe2−xe=0superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑒2subscript𝑥𝑒0x_{e}^{2}-x_{e}=0) for each edge – in\nSection 2.2 the encoding is discussed in more detail. Note\nthat Card⁡(G,1→)Card𝐺→1\\operatorname{Card}(G,\\vec{1}) corresponds to the perfect matching problem\nin G𝐺G and in general Card⁡(G,b)Card𝐺𝑏\\operatorname{Card}(G,b) can be viewed as asserting that\nG𝐺G has a “matching” where each vertex is matched exactly bvsubscript𝑏𝑣b_{v}\ntimes. Note that whenever ∑v∈Vbvsubscript𝑣𝑉subscript𝑏𝑣\\sum_{v\\in V}b_{v} is odd, Card⁡(G,b)Card𝐺𝑏\\operatorname{Card}(G,b)\nis unsatisfiable (since the equations imply\n∑vbv=2​∑exesubscript𝑣subscript𝑏𝑣2subscript𝑒subscript𝑥𝑒\\sum_{v}b_{v}=2\\sum_{e}x_{e} which is even)111As pointed out\nto us by Aleksa Stanković, decidability of Card⁡(G,b)Card𝐺𝑏\\operatorname{Card}(G,b) is in\npolynomial time: starting with the all 00 assignment, iteratively\nbuild up an assignment that may match some vertices fewer times than\nrequired. If there is a satisfying assignment, then there is always\nan augmenting path along which the current assignment can be\nimproved, i.e., more edges set to 111, by a similar argument as for\nmatchings . Such a path can be found in polynomial\ntime by an adaptation of the blossom algorithm .. We focus on the special case of Card⁡(G,b)Card𝐺𝑏\\operatorname{Card}(G,b) where G𝐺G is d𝑑d-regular\nand b=t→=(t,t,…,t)𝑏→𝑡𝑡𝑡…𝑡b=\\vec{t}=(t,t,\\ldots,t) is the all-t𝑡t vector for some\nt∈[d]𝑡delimited-[]𝑑t\\in[d]. If in this scenario both n𝑛n and t𝑡t are odd (implying\nd𝑑d is even) then as observed above Card⁡(G,t→)Card𝐺→𝑡\\operatorname{Card}(G,\\vec{t}) is\nunsatisfiable. On the other hand if n𝑛n is odd and t𝑡t is even then\nCard⁡(G,t→)Card𝐺→𝑡\\operatorname{Card}(G,\\vec{t}) is always satisfiable (because such G𝐺G admits a\n222-factorization). The remaining case when n𝑛n is even may be either\nsatisfiable or unsatisfiable, but for a random d𝑑d-regular G𝐺G with\nd≥3𝑑3d\\geq 3, Card⁡(G,t)Card𝐺𝑡\\operatorname{Card}(G,t) will be satisfiable with high probability\n(because such G𝐺G can be partitioned into perfect matchings with high\nprobability). If we let ℱDsubscriptℱ𝐷\\mathscr{F}_{{D}} denote a Frege system restricted to depth-D𝐷D formulas\n(see Section 2.1),\nthen our main theorem is as follows. There is a constant d0subscript𝑑0d_{0} such that for all constants d≥d0𝑑subscript𝑑0d\\geq d_{0} and\nt∈[d]𝑡delimited-[]𝑑t\\in[d], the following holds asymptotically almost surely\nover a random d𝑑d-regular graph G𝐺G on n𝑛n vertices. 𝖣𝖾𝗀(Card(G,t→)⊢PCF⟂)=Ω(n/logn)\\operatorname{\\sf{Deg}}(\\operatorname{Card}(G,\\vec{t})\\vdash_{\\text{\\tiny PC${}_{\\mathbb{F}}$}}\\,\\perp)=\\Omega(n/\\log n)\nfor any fixed field 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} with char⁡(𝔽)≠2char𝔽2\\operatorname{char}(\\mathbb{F})\\neq 2. 𝖣𝖾𝗀(Card(G,t→)⊢SoS⟂)=Ω(n/logn)\\operatorname{\\sf{Deg}}(\\operatorname{Card}(G,\\vec{t})\\vdash_{\\text{\\tiny SoS}}\\,\\perp)=\\Omega(n/\\log n). There is a δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0 such that\n𝖲𝗂𝗓𝖾(Card(G,t→)⊢ℱD⟂)=exp(Ω(nδ/D))\\operatorname{\\sf{Size}}(\\operatorname{Card}(G,\\vec{t})\\vdash_{\\text{\\tiny$\\mathscr{F}_{{D}}$}}\\,\\perp)=\\exp\\big{(}\\Omega(n^{\\delta/D})\\big{)},\nfor all\nD≤δ​log⁡nlog⁡log⁡n𝐷𝛿𝑛𝑛D\\leq\\frac{\\delta\\log n}{\\log\\log n}. The interesting case of the above theorem is when both n𝑛n and t𝑡t are\nodd so that Card⁡(G,t)Card𝐺𝑡\\operatorname{Card}(G,t) is unsatisfiable; in the other cases\nCard⁡(G,t→)Card𝐺→𝑡\\operatorname{Card}(G,\\vec{t}) is satisfiable with high probability and the\nlower bounds are vacuous. By known size-degree tradeoffs for Polynomial Calculus\n  and Sum-of-Squares\n the degree\nlower bounds in Theorem 1.1 imply near-optimal size\nlower bounds of exp⁡(Ω​(n/log2⁡n))Ω𝑛superscript2𝑛\\exp\\big{(}\\Omega(n/\\log^{2}n)\\big{)}. Apart from the perfect matching formula, another special case of\nCard⁡(G,t→)Card𝐺→𝑡\\operatorname{Card}(G,\\vec{t}) is the so-called even coloring formula,\nintroduced by Markström [ref]48,\nwhich is the case when t=deg⁡(v)/2𝑡degree𝑣2t=\\deg(v)/2.\nAn open problem of Buss and Nordström\n[16, Open Problem 7.7]\nasks whether these formulas\nare hard on spectral expanders for Polynomial Calculus over fields of\ncharacteristic ≠2absent2\\neq 2. Theorem 1.1 partially resolves\nthis open problem, establishing that it is hard on random graphs\n(rather than on all spectral expanders). See Section 6 for\nsome further remarks on what parts of our proof use the randomness\nassumption. We will give a more detailed overview of how the results are obtained\nin Section 1.3 below, but for now let us mention that we obtain them\nusing embedding techniques, as introduced to proof complexity by\nPitassi et al. 4 (see discussion of related work\nin Section 1.2).\nIn particular for, say, the SoS lower\nbound, our starting point is the Ω​(n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(n) worst-case degree\nlower bound in sparse graphs, and we then prove that these hard\ninstances can be embedded in a random d𝑑d-regular graph in such a way\nthat the hardness of refuting the formula is preserved. To achieve this, one of the components we need is a new graph\nembedding theorem which may be of independent interest.\nVery loosely speaking,\nwe show that any bounded-degree graph with O​(n/log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n/\\log n)\nedges can be embedded as a topological minor in any\nbounded-degree α𝛼\\alpha-expander on n𝑛n vertices and sufficiently many\nedges.\nIn addition, for our application to perfect matching (and more\ngenerally the Card⁡(G,t→)Card𝐺→𝑡\\operatorname{Card}(G,\\vec{t}) formulas), we need to be able to\ncontrol the parities of the path lengths used in the topological\nembedding, and we show that as long as every large linear-sized subgraph\ncontains an odd cycle of length Ω​(1/α)Ω1𝛼\\Omega(1/\\alpha), this is indeed\npossible. Somewhat informally, we prove the following. Let G𝐺G be a\nconstant degree\nα𝛼\\alpha-expander on\nn𝑛n vertices.\nIf H𝐻H is a graph with at most ε​nlog⁡n𝜀𝑛𝑛\\frac{\\varepsilon n}{\\log n}\nedges and\nΔ​(H)≪α2⋅d​(G)much-less-thanΔ𝐻⋅superscript𝛼2𝑑𝐺\\Delta(H)\\ll\\alpha^{2}\\cdot d(G),\nthen G𝐺G contains\nH𝐻H as a topological minor.\nFurthermore, if all large vertex induced subgraphs of G𝐺G\ncontain an odd cycle of length Ω​(1/α)Ω1𝛼\\Omega(1/\\alpha),\nthen one can choose the parities\nof the length of all the edge embeddings in the minor. This generalizes various classical results of a similar flavor\n(e.g. [ref]39   ).\nSee the next subsection for a discussion comparing these (and other) existing\nembedding results to ours. As a further illustration of the applicability of this theorem we\npartially resolve a question of\nFilmus et al. .\nThey prove\nthat with high probability for random d𝑑d-regular graphs G𝐺G, where d≥4𝑑4d\\geq 4,\nPC requires space\nΩ​(n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(\\sqrt{n}) to refute the Tseitin\nformula, and conjecture that PC\nin fact requires space Ω​(n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(n). On the other hand, Galesi et\nal.  considered it plausible that the\nΩ​(n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(\\sqrt{n}) bound is optimal. We (almost) resolve this question by\nproving Ω​(n/log⁡n)Ω𝑛𝑛\\Omega(n/\\log n) space lower bounds for the Tseitin formula\ndefined on vertex expanders, but only of large enough (constant)\naverage degree. For all α>0𝛼0\\alpha>0 there is a d0subscript𝑑0d_{0} such that the following\nholds. Let G𝐺G be a bounded degree α𝛼\\alpha-expander on n𝑛n\nvertices of average degree at least d0subscript𝑑0d_{0}. Then\nover any field 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} it holds that PCF requires space\nΩ​(n/log⁡n)Ω𝑛𝑛\\Omega(n/\\log n) to refute the Tseitin formula defined on G𝐺G. Let us mention that the constant hidden in the lower bound\nΩ​(n/log⁡n)Ω𝑛𝑛\\Omega(n/\\log n) depends on the maximum degree of G𝐺G. Unlike\nTheorem 1.1, vertex expansion is sufficient and we\nrequire no randomness. This lower bound is obtained by embedding a\nworst-case instance, due to Filmus et al., into a vertex expander. We\nprovide more details in Section 6.1.\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: Apart from the perfect matching formula, another special case of\nCard⁡(G,t→)Card𝐺→𝑡\\operatorname{Card}(G,\\vec{t}) is the so-called even coloring formula,\nintroduced by Markström [ref]48,\nwhich is the case when t=deg⁡(v)/2𝑡degree𝑣2t=\\deg(v)/2.\nAn open problem of Buss and Nordström\n[16, Open Problem 7.7]\nasks whether these formulas\nare hard on spectral expanders for Polynomial\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
