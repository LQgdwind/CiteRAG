      "content": "Paper Title: On Calibrating Semantic Segmentation Models: Analyses and An Algorithm\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDNN calibration. The methods of calibrating DNNs can be categorized into three groups, regularized training, uncertainty estimation, and post-hoc calibration [ref]9. Regularized training focuses on calibrating DNN over training, such as [ref]46   . Some methods estimate uncertainty using Bayesian methods    and deep ensemble  . Post-hoc calibration conducts post-processing on the output of DNN to obtain well-calibrated results. While some post-hoc approaches exchange hurting accuracy for better calibration, like histogram binning [ref]11 , some retain original accuracy of DNNs and only add calibration map to the last layer of DNNs to adjust probability distribution pattern. Several existing binary calibration maps are extended to multiclass calibration. For example, [ref]11 extended temperature scaling and vector scaling aka Logistic scaling[ref]11, to multiclasss calibration for DNN, and revealed temperature scaling is simple but more effective. To enrich calibration map, Dirichlet scaling was proposed by extending Beta scaling  to multiclass DNN calibration. Recently, Meta-cal integrated bipartite-ranking model with selective classification to improve calibration map for better calibrated model. Despite the success of these existing approaches in image classification calibration, there is no work to discuss their performance on semantic segmentation. Calibration beyond image classification. Several extensions based upon existing calibrators have been proposed to solve calibration beyond image classification. For example,  modeled predictive uncertainty with spatial correlation matrix in stochastic process and incorporated this information into model training for more calibrated segmentation model.  proposed local temperature scaling that extends temperature scaling to pixels, and thus, better captures spatial heterogeneity of temperature for a better calibrated segmentation model.  conducted model ensembling to improve calibration and evaluate the improvement by both conventional and the proposed segment-level uncertainty metrics.  addressed semantic segmentation calibration through adversarial training a stochastic network which enables more accurate uncertainty estimation and robust prediction.  proposed a multi-headed Variational U-Net by combining ensemble modeling with variational inference and improves model training with better in-distribution calibration and out-of-distribution detection.  addressed visual object detector calibration with plug-and-play training-time calibration loss and improved uncertainty optimization. Domain-shift calibration. Domain generalization is an important challenge to DNN since model generalization to unseen data could be unpredictable when training and test data distributions differ . In terms of model calibration, performance degradation can also be critical  . To alleviate this problem, a variety of approaches have been proposed.  corrected covariant shift by importance weighting to achieve better calibrated models.  proposed a simple yet effective scheme by perturbing image for classification model calibration improvement.  proposed TransCal to improve image classification calibration degradation under the scenario of natural distribution shift.  leveraged multiple calibration domain to reduce disparity between source and target domain, thus improving model calibration on shift target domain.\nDespite some progress in domain-shift calibration, there is still no domain-shift study on semantic segmentation calibration. Semantic segmentation. Semantic segmentation is an important visual understanding task. Different from image classification, semantic segmentation focuses on pixel-level classification within an image. Due to this difference, semantic segmentation models are developed in consideration of spatial correlation between pixels. DeepLab family, as an important dilated convolution model, integrates multiscale spatial context into segmentation modeling . SegFormer incorporates hierarchical architectures to encode multiscale features and performs efficient semantic segmentation through ViT structure .\nSegmenter is a straightforward ViT extension to semantic segmentation by decoding global context of the encoded embedding features from ViT outputs. K-net is a unifying framework for all segmentation tasks . ConvNeXt is proposed as an alternative to ViT and shows accurate segmentation 4.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: DNN calibration.
