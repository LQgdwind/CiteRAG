      "content": "Paper Title: SGCE-Font: Skeleton Guided Channel Expansion for Chinese Font Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs shown in Figure 2, the components of Chinese characters such as strokes and skeletons directly reflect certain structure information of Chinese characters. Motivated by this, many kinds of component information of Chinese characters have been widely used in the literature    [ref]34  [ref]17   [ref]11  to improve the generation performance. In the early stage, traditional models    firstly decompose the Chinese characters into several basic components such as strokes and radicals, and then assemble them to yield new Chinese characters by leveraging some effective machine learning methods. It should be pointed out that the decomposition of strokes or radicals is generally hand-crafted and thus very costly. To address this issue, several end-to-end models based on deep learning are introduced to extract these important components of Chinese characters and incorporate them into the generation procedure [ref]34  [ref]17   [ref]11  . Specifically, [ref]34 firstly adopted a coherent point drift algorithm to divide the Chinese characters into strokes, and then produced new font strokes by fusing the styles of two existing font strokes, and further yielded new fonts through assembling them.  suggested a stroke refinement branch to particularly focus on the generation of thin strokes.  introduced a simple one-bit stroke encoding to represent the stroke information and incorporated it into the CycleGAN model as the supervision information. By the use of such stroke encoding, the mode collapse of CycleGAN can be remarkably reduced . In the recent paper , the authors proposed a square-block translation based self-supervised scheme for the generation of Chinese characters, inspired by the fact that structures of Chinese characters are closely related to the square-block transformations. As compared to [ref]34   , this paper exploits the skeleton instead of the stroke representing certain local structure information [ref]34   and the square-block transformation representing certain global structure information , mainly motivated by the observation that skeletons can provide both local and global structure information of Chinese characters. Besides the stroke and character structure information, several works based on the skeleton-like information have been studied in the literature    [ref]17 [ref]11.  introduced two neural network modules to realize the extraction of strokes and writing trajectories of Chinese characters respectively, and then incorporated them into the generation of Chinese fonts.  proposed a three-stage GAN model including the skeleton extraction, skeleton transformation and stroke rendering for multi-chirography image translation. [ref]11 proposed a font fusion network based on GAN and disentangled representation learning to generate brand new fonts, where the disentangled representation learning was introduced to obtain the stoke style and skeleton shape.  incorporated the skeleton of Chinese characters into the generator and utilized it as certain structural constraint to supervise the model, while similar idea was also used in [ref]17 for the generation of brush handwriting Chinese font. It should be pointed out that both  and [ref]17 are based on the paired data and through introducing auxiliary network modules to extract skeletons, while this paper is based on the unpaired data and through using some simple mathematical verification conditions to extract the skeleton. Distinguished from previous studies struggling to increase the model complexity to utilize these components of Chinese characters to help the generation tasks, we aim to perform much simpler and more effective supervision for a relatively simple GAN model to achieve its full potential. As discussed before, the proposed skeleton guided channel expansion module is very simple but effective to provide certain local and global supervision for GAN models to alleviate the mode collapse issue and enhance the performance, while does not introduce any additional model complexity.\nThe skeleton information used in this paper can provide richer spatial structure information and semantic information of Chinese characters, and the suggested channel expansion way to exploit the skeleton information can provide stronger guidance for the generator.\nMoreover, the proposed module can be easily adapted to many existing GAN models to improve their performance.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: directly reflect certain structure information of Chinese characters.
