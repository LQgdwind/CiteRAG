      "content": "Paper Title: Gradient tracking and variance reduction for decentralized optimization and machine learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe now discuss some recent progress on several key aspects of decentralized optimization relevant to the first-order stochastic approaches described in this article. Directed Graphs: The methods described in this article are restricted to undirected graphs. Over directed graphs, the main challenge is that the weight matrices are either row-stochastic (RS) or column-stochastic (CS), but cannot be doubly-stochastic (DS), in general. A well-studied solution to this issue is based on the push-sum (type) algorithms [ref]39 that enable consensus with non-DS weights with the help of eigenvector estimation. Combining push-sum respectively with\nDSGD  , and GT-DGD    leads to SGP , and ADD-OPT  that require CS weights. A similar idea is used in FROST [ref]42 to implement decentralized optimization with RS weights. The issue with push-sum based extensions is that they require eigenvector estimation, which in itself is an iterative procedure and may slow down the underlying algorithms especially when the corresponding communication graphs are not well-connected. More recently, it is shown that GT-DGD (16), ADD-OPT, and FROST are special cases of the AB algorithm   that employs RS weights in (16a) and CS weights in (16b), and thus is immediately applicable to arbitrary directed graphs. The AB framework naturally leads to stochastic optimization with gradient tracking over directed graphs, see SAB  that extends GT-DSGD to directed graphs, and further opens the possibility to extend GT-SAGA and GT-SVRG to their directed counterparts. Communication and computation aspects: Communication efficiency is an important aspect of decentralized optimization since communication can potentially become a bottleneck of the system when nodes are frequently transmitting high-dimensional vectors (model parameters) in the network. Different communication-efficient schemes [ref]45 , communication/computation tradeoffs , asynchronous implementations , and quantization techniques   have been studied with existing decentralized methods to efficiently manage the resources at each node. Master-worker architectures: The problems described in this article have experienced a significant research activity because of their direct applicability to large-scale training problems in machine learning  . Since these applications are typically hosted in controlled settings, e.g., data centers with highly-sophisticated communication and a large number of highly-efficient computing clusters, master-worker architectures and parameter-server models have become popular. In such architectures, see Fig. 2 (left), a central master maintains the current model parameters and communicates strategically with the workers, which individually hold a local batch of the total training data.\nIndeed, this architecture is not restricted to data centers alone and is also applicable to certain Internet-of-Things (IoT) scenarios where the devices are able to communicate to the master either directly via the cloud or via a mesh network among the devices. Various programming models and several variants of master-worker configurations have been proposed, such as MapReduce, All-Reduce, and federated learning , that are tailored for specific computing needs and environments. We emphasize that, on the contrary, the motivation behind the decentralized methods studied in this article comes from the scenarios where communication among the nodes is ad hoc, unstructured, and specialized topologies are not available.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: matrices are either row-stochastic (RS) or column-stochastic (CS), but cannot be doubly-stochastic (DS), in general.
