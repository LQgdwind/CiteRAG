For Aim 2 it directly minimize H​(P​(ϕ​(𝐗),𝐘))𝐻𝑃italic-ϕ𝐗𝐘H(P({\\phi({\\mathbf{X}}),{\\mathbf{Y}}})). DANN [ref]13: Minimize feature divergences of source domains. DANN [ref]13 minimizes feature divergences of source domains adverbially without considering conditions. Therefore its empirical objective for Aim 1 is For Aim 2 it directly minimizes H​(P​(ϕ​(𝐗),𝐘))𝐻𝑃italic-ϕ𝐗𝐘H(P({\\phi({\\mathbf{X}}),{\\mathbf{Y}}})). CORAL : Minimize the distance between the second-order statistics of source domains. Since CORAL  only minimizes the second-order distance between souce feature distributions, its objective\ncan be summarized as: By grouping it, CORAL  has −H​(𝔼​[P​(ϕ​(𝐗n))])𝐻𝔼delimited-[]𝑃italic-ϕsubscript𝐗𝑛-H(\\mathbb{E}[P({\\phi({\\mathbf{X}}_{n})})]) for Aim 1 and H​(P​(ϕ​(𝐗),𝐘))+H​(P​(ϕ​(𝐗)))𝐻𝑃italic-ϕ𝐗𝐘𝐻𝑃italic-ϕ𝐗H(P({\\phi({\\mathbf{X}}),{\\mathbf{Y}}}))+H(P({\\phi({\\mathbf{X}})})) for Aim 2. CIDG : Minimizing the conditioned domain gap. CIDG  tries to learn conditional domain invariant features: For Aim 2 it directly minimizes H​(P​(ϕ​(𝐗),𝐘))𝐻𝑃italic-ϕ𝐗𝐘H(P({\\phi({\\mathbf{X}}),{\\mathbf{Y}}})). MDA [ref]16: Minimizing domain gap compared to the decision gap.\nSome previous works, such as MDA [ref]16, follow the hypothesis that the generalization is guaranteed while the decision gap is larger than the domain gap. Therefore, instead of directly minimizing the domain gap, MDA minimizes the ratio between the domain gap and the decision gap. The overall objective of MDA can be summarized as: Since the entropy is non-negative and the constants can be omitted, Eq. LABEL:eq:MDA is equivalent to: By grouping Eq. LABEL:eq:MDA2, we have that for Aim 1 it minimizes minϕ⁡H​(𝔼​[P​(ϕ​(𝐗n),𝐘n)])subscriptitalic-ϕ𝐻𝔼delimited-[]𝑃italic-ϕsubscript𝐗𝑛subscript𝐘𝑛\\min_{\\phi}H(\\mathbb{E}[P({\\phi({\\mathbf{X}}_{n}),{\\mathbf{Y}}_{n}})]), and for Aim 2 it minimizes H(P(ϕ(𝐗)∣𝐘))−H(𝔼[P(ϕ(𝐗)∣𝐘)]))+H(P(ϕ(𝐗)))H(P({\\phi({\\mathbf{X}})\\mid{\\mathbf{Y}}}))-H(\\mathbb{E}[P({\\phi({\\mathbf{X}})\\mid{\\mathbf{Y}}})]))+H(P(\\phi({\\mathbf{X}}))). MIRO , SIMPLE : Using pre-trained models as 𝒪𝒪\\mathcal{O}.\nOne feasible way to obtain 𝒪𝒪\\mathcal{O} is adopting pre-trained oracle models such as MIRO  and SIMPLE . Note that the pre-trained models are exposed to additional data besides those provided. Therefore, for Aim 1: they have:\n Differently, MIRO only uses one pre-trained model, as its 𝒪≜𝒪1≜𝒪superscript𝒪1\\mathcal{O}\\triangleq\\mathcal{O}^{1}; meanwhile, SIMPLE combines K𝐾K pre-trained models as the oracle model: 𝒪≜∑k=1Kvk​𝒪k≜𝒪superscriptsubscript𝑘1𝐾subscript𝑣𝑘superscript𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}\\triangleq\\sum_{k=1}^{K}v_{k}\\mathcal{O}^{k} where v𝑣v is the weight vector.\nFor Aim 2 it directly minimizes H​(P​(ϕ​(𝐗),𝐘))𝐻𝑃italic-ϕ𝐗𝐘H(P({\\phi({\\mathbf{X}}),{\\mathbf{Y}}})). RobustNet . RobustNet employs the instance selective whitening loss, which disentangles domain-specific and domain-invariant properties from higher-order statistics of the feature representation and selectively suppresses domain-specific ones. Therefore, it implicitly whitens the 𝐘𝐘{\\mathbf{Y}}-irrelevant features in 𝐗𝐗{\\mathbf{X}}. Thus, its objective can be simplified as:\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: This section shows how we uniformly simplify the objectives of previous methods.
