      "content": "Paper Title: CoFiNet: Reliable Coarse-to-fine Correspondences for Robust Point Cloud Registration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCorrespondence search is a core topic of computer vision and establishing reliable correspondences is a key to success in many fundamental vision tasks, such as tracking, reconstruction, flow estimation, and particularly, point cloud registration. Point cloud registration aims at recovering the transformation between a pair of partially overlapped point clouds. It is a fundamental task in a wide range of real applications, including scene reconstruction, autonomous driving, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), etc. However, due to the unordered and irregular properties of point clouds, extracting reliable correspondences from them has been a challenging task for a long time. From early-stage hand-crafted methods      to recently emerged deep learning-based approaches [ref]6    0 1 2, many works contributed to improving the reliability of correspondences. We can broadly categorize recent deep learning-based point cloud registration methods into three categories. The first 3 4 5 follows the idea of ICP 6, where they iteratively find dense correspondences and compute pose estimation. The second 7 8 includes the correspondence-free methods based on the intuition that the feature distance between two well-aligned point clouds should be small. Such methods encode the whole point cloud as a single feature and iteratively optimize the relative pose between two frames by minimizing the distance of corresponding features. Though achieving reasonable results on synthetic object datasets 9, both of them struggle on large-scale real benchmarks 0 [ref]6, as the first suffers from low correspondence precision and high computational complexity, while the second lacks robustness to noise and partial overlap. Differently, the last category of methods [ref]6    0 1 2 tackles point cloud registration in a two-stage manner. They firstly learn local descriptors of down-sampled sparse points (nodes) for matching, and afterward use robust pose estimators, e.g., RANSAC 1, for recovering the relative transformation. Their two-stage strategy makes them achieve state-of-the-art performance on large-scale real benchmarks 0 [ref]6. Uniform sampling   and keypoint detection 2 0 1 2 are two common ways to introduce sparsity. Compared to uniform sampling that samples points randomly, keypoint detection estimates the saliency of points and samples points with strong geometry features, which significantly reduces the ambiguity of matching. However, the sparsity by nature challenges repeatability, i.e., sub-sampling increases the risk where a certain point loses its corresponding point in the other frame, which constrains the performance of detection-based methods 2 0 1 2. Recently, a coarse-to-fine mechanism is leveraged by our 2D counterparts 3 4 5 to avoid direct keypoint detection, which shows superiority over the state-of-the-art detection-based method 6. However, in 3D point cloud matching, where keypoint detectors usually perform worse, existing deep learning-based methods do not yet exploit such a coarse-to-fine strategy. To fill the gap, we focus on leveraging the coarse-to-fine mechanism to eliminate the side effects of detecting sparse keypoints. Nevertheless, designing such a coarse-to-fine pipeline in point cloud matching is non-trivial, mainly due to the inherent unordered and irregular nature of point clouds. To this end, we propose a weighting scheme for coarse node matching and a density-adaptive matching module for correspondence refinement, which enables CoFiNet to extract coarse-to-fine correspondences from point clouds. More specifically, on a coarse scale, the weighting scheme proportional to local overlap ratios guides the model to propose correspondences of nodes whose vicinity areas share more overlap, which effectively squeezes the search space of the consecutive refinement. On a finer scale, the density-adaptive matching module refines coarse correspondence proposals to point level by solving a differentiable optimal transport problem 6 with awareness to varying point density, which shows more robustness on irregular points. An overview of our proposed method can be found in Fig. 1. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: A detection-free learning framework that treats point cloud registration as a coarse-to-fine correspondence problem, where point correspondences are consecutively refined from coarse proposals that are extracted from unordered and irregular point clouds. A weighting scheme that, on a coarse scale, guides our model to learn to match uniformly down-sampled nodes whose vicinity areas share more overlap, which significantly shrinks the search space for the refinement. A differentiable density-adaptive matching module that refines coarse correspondences to point level based on solving an optimal transport problem with awareness to point density, which is more robust to the varying point density. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first deep learning-based work that incorporates a coarse-to-fine mechanism in correspondence search for point cloud registration. Extensive experiments are conducted on both indoor and outdoor benchmarks to show our superiority. Notably, CoFiNet surpasses the state-of-the-art with much fewer parameters. Compared to 2, we only use around two-third and one-fourth of parameters on indoor and outdoor benchmarks, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: point clouds, extracting reliable correspondences from them has been a challenging task for a long time.
