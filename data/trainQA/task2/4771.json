This stream of data has grown so large that only automated methods can feasibly analyze it. One critical component of remote sensing analysis is object detection: locating objects of interest on the Earth’s surface in overhead imagery. Automated object detection algorithms have advanced by leaps and bounds over the last decade, but they still require vast amounts of labeled data for training, which is expensive and tedious to produce. Any technique that can reduce the resources needed to label objects in overhead imagery is therefore desirable. Most existing datasets for training overhead object detectors are labeled with horizontal bounding boxes [ref]5, object-aligned bounding boxes [ref]60, or segmentation masks 12. These methods of labeling appear to have been inherited from work on natural images – primarily cell phone pictures. Unlike objects in cell phone pictures, objects in overhead images are only seen in a narrow range of viewpoints and scales. This paper examines whether the extra work required to create such detailed labels is worthwhile in terms of the resulting detector performance. In this paper, we show that centerpoints alone are sufficient for training overhead object detectors for most targets in overhead imagery and that they require significantly less time and work by labelers then image-aligned or object-aligned bounding boxes. We designed single- and two-stage object detection architectures for centerpoints based on RetinaNet 3 and Faster Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) 4. We compare the performance of our Centerpoint RetinaNet and Centerpoint R-CNN against RetinaNet and Faster R-CNN trained with horizontal and object-aligned bounding boxes on a variety of overhead datasets, and show that our centerpoint detectors match or exceed the performance of bounding box detectors. In Section 2, we review past work on object detection, focusing on overhead imagery. In Section 3, we describe our centerpoint architectures and our methods for evaluating detectors for centerpoints, horizontal bounding boxes, and object-aligned bounding boxes on a common basis. In Section 4, we present the results of our experiments using each detector on a variety of overhead datasets. In Section 5, we conclude by discussing the implications of our results for further work in object detection in overhead imagery.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: can reduce the resources needed to label objects in overhead imagery is therefore desirable.
