      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-task robot data for dual-arm fine manipulation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImitation learning, particularly behavior cloning , directly maps a robot’s sensory observation to an action in a supervised learning manner. Methods that use deep learning for imitation learning [ref]2  can learn tasks in a model-free manner, which makes them applicable to unknown environments and object dynamics. Deep imitation learning, unlike search-based approaches (e.g., [ref]20 ) or inverse reinforcement learning (e.g., ), which learns a reward function from demonstrations, is safe and sample efficient because it only uses robot demonstrations performed by experts. In studies such as [ref]3   , researchers successfully implemented imitation learning that targets fine-grained tasks, such as opening a lid or manipulation with chopsticks. However, in these studies, training was often specialized for one task, which left the expected versatility and adaptability of future robots to new environments/tasks unassessed. Fu et al.  recently upgraded the robot system originally developed by [ref]3 to a mobile manipulator for dual-arm fine manipulation, such as pushing chairs or cooking; however, their dataset lacks scale (50 demonstrations per task) and does not include visual attention labels, which we consider to be essential for fine manipulation tasks that require high-resolution vision. Regarding versatility and adaptability, learning multi-task manipulation skills using a large robot dataset is a topic that has been extensively researched recently. In many studies, researchers were encouraged by the advancements in language models  and adopted imitation learning conditioned on natural language instructions as a breakthrough in multi-task learning.\nSharma et al.  presented a dataset that comprises 8.3k episodes for a dual-arm robot that features tasks such as pushing with two hands.\nBrohan et al.  showed that using a dataset containing 130k language-instructed episodes and various tasks enabled generalization to various backgrounds and objects in object manipulation, and focused mainly on grasping222In this research, pick refers to the picking up of thin objects from a table; hence, grasp is used to represent what is conventionally referred to as pick., placing, and moving objects. In a subsequent study, Brohan et al.  further demonstrated that the use of a large vision-language model enabled the emergence of task reasoning for unseen objects.\nIn another study, a single-arm robot was used , and data from 60.1k episodes across 24 environments with open vocabulary were collected and trained, which encompassed 13 skills in various scenes, such as stacking and folding clothes.\nFang et al. 6 created a multi-robot/multi-modal dataset containing 110k episodes of contact-rich, single-arm tasks, such as cutting or plugging, accompanied by language descriptions.\nTo the best of our knowledge, publicly available robot manipulation datasets at scale do not yet include examples of dual-arm fine manipulation (refer to Table I), such as the grasping of sub-centimeter-level objects, picking up thin objects, or opening zippers placed on a table, which are difficult to grasp because of their small size. Our DAA dataset, accompanied by the relatively large 224k episodes,333Each episode is structured to encompass only one semantic task. For instance, in a robot’s grasp-and-place action, “grasp” and “place” are considered to be separate episodes. As a result, the number of episodes cannot be directly compared with those in other datasets, such as RT-1. fills this gap by featuring dual-arm, fine manipulation skills, and incorporating visual attention signals and dual-action labels to help learning.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Imitation learning, particularly behavior cloning , directly maps a robot’s sensory observation to an action in a supervised learning manner.
