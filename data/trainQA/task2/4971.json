      "content": "Paper Title: Time-rEversed diffusioN tEnsor Transformer: A new TENET of Few-Shot Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nObject detectors based on deep learning, usually addressed by supervised models, achieve impressive performance       but they rely on a large number of images with human-annotated class labels/object bounding boxes. Moreover, object detectors cannot be easily extended to new class concepts not seen during training. Such a restriction limits supervised object detectors to predefined scenarios. In contrast, humans excel at rapidly adapting to new scenarios by ‚Äústoring knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem‚Äù¬†, also called as ‚Äútransfer of practice‚Äù¬†. Few-shot Object Detection (FSOD)    5 [ref]7  [ref]51 methods mimic this ability, and enable detection of test classes that are disjoint from training classes. They perform this adaptation using a few ‚Äúsupport‚Äù images from test classes. Successful FSOD models must (i) find promising candidate regions-of-Interest (RoIs) in query images; and (ii) accurately regress bounding box locations and predict RoI classes, under large intra-class geometric and photometric variations. To address the first requirement, approaches 5 [ref]7  [ref]51 use the region proposal network . For example, FSOD-ARPN [ref]7, PNSD  and KFSOD [ref]51 cross-correlate query feature maps with a class prototype formed from average-pooled (ie., first-order) features, second-order pooled representations and kernel-pooled representations, respectively.\nThese methods use a single class prototype which limits their ability to leverage diverse information from different class samples.\nInspired by Transformers , approach  uses average pooling over support feature maps to generate a vector descriptor per map. Attention mechanism is then used to modulate query image features using such descriptors. The above methods rely on first- and second-order pooling, while so-called higher-order pooling is more discriminative   .\nThus, we propose a non-trivial Time-rEversed diffusioN tEnsor Transformer (TENET). With TENET, higher-order tensors undergo a time-reversed heat diffusion to condense signal on super-diagonals of tensors, after which coefficients of these super-diagonals are passed to a Multi-Head\nAttention transformer block.\nTENET performs second-, third- and fourth-order pooling. However, higher-order pooling suffers from several issues, ie., (i) high computational complexity of computing tensors with three/more modes, (ii) non-robust tensor estimates due to the limited number of vectors being aggregated, and (iii) tensor burstiness. To this end, we propose a Tensor Shrinkage Operator (TSO) which generalizes spectral power normalization (SPN) operators , such as the Fast Spectral MaxExp operator (MaxExp(F)) , to higher-order tensors. As such, it can be used to reduce tensor burstiness.\nMoreover, by building on the linear algebra of the heat diffusion process (HDP)  and recent generalisation of HDP to SPN operators , we also argue that such operators can reverse the diffusion of signal in autocorrelation or covariance matrices, and high-order tensors, instead of just reducing the burstiness. Using a parametrization which lets us control the reversal of diffusion, TSO condenses signal captured by a tensor toward its super-diagonal, preserving information along it.\nThis super-diagonal serves as our final representation, reducing the feature size from drsuperscriptùëëùëüd^{r} to dùëëd, making our representation computationally tractable.\nFinally, shrinkage operators are known for their ability to estimate covariances well when only a small number of samples are available .\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show that MaxExp(F) is a shrinkage operator, and to propose TSO for orders r‚â•2ùëü2r\\!\\geq\\!2. To address the second requirement, FSOD-ARPN introduces a multi-relation head that captures global, local and patch relations between support and query objects, while PNSD passes second-order autocorrelation matrices to a similarity network. However, FSOD-ARPN and PNSD do not model spatial relations .\nThe QSAM  uses attention to highlight the query RoI vectors that are similar to the set of support vectors (obtained using only first-order spatial average pooling).\nThus, we introduce a Transformer Relation Head (TRH) to improve modeling of spatial relations.\nTRH computes self-attention between spatially-aware features and global spatially invariant first-, second- and higher-order TENET representations of support and/or query RoI features. The second attention mechanism of TRH performs cross-attention between ZùëçZ support embeddings (for ZùëçZ-shot if Z‚â•2ùëç2Z\\!\\geq\\!2), and a set of global representations of query RoIs. This attention encodes similarities between query RoIs and support samples. Our FSOD pipeline contains TENET Region Proposal Network (TENET RPN) and the TRH, both equipped with discriminative TENET representations, improving generation of RoI proposals and modeling of query-support relations. Below are our contributions: We propose a Time-rEversed diffusiON tEnsor Transformer, called TENET, which captures high-order patterns (multi-way feature cooccurrences) and decorrelates them/reduces tensor burstiness. To this end, we generalize the MaxExp(F) operator  for autocorrelation/covariance matrices to higher-order tensors by introducing the so-called Tensor Shrinkage Operator (TSO). We propose a Transformer Relation Head (TRH) that is sensitive both to the variability between the ZùëçZ support samples provided in a ZùëçZ-shot scenario, and to positional variability between support and query objects. In ¬ß4.1, we demonstrate that TSO emerges from the MLE-style minimization over the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the input and output spectrum, with the latter being regularized by the Tsallis entropy . Thus, we show that TSO meets the definition of shrinkage estimator whose target is the identity matrix (tensor). Our proposed method outperforms the state of the art on novel classes by 4.0%, 4.7% and 6.1% mAP on PASCAL VOC 2007, FSOD, and COCO respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: scenarios by ‚Äústoring knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem‚Äù¬†, also called as ‚Äútransfer of practice‚Äù¬†.
