      "content": "Paper Title: A Max-Min Entropy Framework for Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs mentioned in Sec.5.3, the ultimate goal of RL is to maximize the reward sum in rewarded environments and exploration is one of the means to achieve this goal. Based on the enhanced exploration performance of MME, we expect MME/DE-MME to show good performance in rewarded environments too.\nIn order to verify this, we considered three types of difficult control tasks for which current state-of-the-art RL algorithms do not show satisfactory performance: Two types of sparse-reward tasks (SparseMujoco tasks and DelayedMujoco tasks) and high dimensional Humanoid tasks.\nSparseMujoco   is a sparse version of Mujoco  in OpenAI Gym [ref]8, and the reward is 111 if the agent crosses the x𝑥x-axis threshold τ𝜏\\tau, otherwise 00. DelayedMujoco [ref]19  is a delayed version of Mujoco in which the reward is accumulated for D𝐷D time steps and the agent receives the accumulated reward sum once every D𝐷D time steps. During the accumulation time, the agent receives no reward. These sparse-reward environments have widely been considered as challenging environments for validating the performance of exploration in many previous works  [ref]25 . First, we compared the performance of MME algorithms to that of maximum entropy SAC in the sparse-reward tasks. For MME, we considered two versions: vanilla MME proposed in Sec.5.2, and disentangled MME (DE-MME) proposed in Sec.5.3. For MME/DE-MME, we fixed απsubscript𝛼𝜋\\alpha_{\\pi} of MME and DE-MME to be equal to α𝛼\\alpha of SAC, and chose proper αQsubscript𝛼𝑄\\alpha_{Q} for each task. Detailed experimental setup is provided in Appendix B. Figs. 6 and 6 show the performance averaged over 101010 random seeds on SparseMujoco tasks and 555 random seeds on DelayedMujoco tasks, respectively. It is seen that the proposed MME shows much higher performance than SAC in the considered environments with rewards.\nIt is also seen that MME itself performs well enough in most environments but DE-MME indeed yields performance gain over vanilla MME and the gain is large in SparseWalker.\nThus, disentanglement of exploration from exploitation is beneficial to MME for better reward performance in rewarded environments, as discussed in Sec.5.3. We provided the corresponding max average return tables in Appendix C and ablation study for further analysis in Appendix D. There, one of ablation study empirically shows that the performance enhancement by MME is caused by improved exploration of MME as we intended. Finally, we compared the performance of MME/DE-MME to that of\npopular general RL algorithms and recent exploration methods\non the considered sparse-reward environments (SparseMujoco and DelayedMujoco tasks) and\ndense-reward high-dimensional Mujoco tasks (Humanoid, HumanoidStandup).\nWe considered several action-based exploration methods: SAC combined with divergence  (SAC-Div) and diversity actor-critic (DAC) [ref]25, and state-based exploration methods with random network distillation (RND)  and MaxEnt (State) . For general RL algorithms, we considered several on-policy RL algorithms: proximal policy optimization (PPO)  and trust-region policy optimization (TRPO) , and entropy-based off-policy RL algorithms: soft Q-learning (SQL)  and SAC . We provided detailed explanation and implementation for each algorithm in Appendix C.\nTable 1 summarizes the max average return result. It is seen that MME/DE-MME have superior performance to other methods. \n\n\n\n\n\nMME\n\n\n\nDE-MME\n\n\n\nDAC\n\n\n\nSAC-Div\n\n\n\nRND\n\n\n\nMaxEnt(State)\n\n\n\n\nSps.Hopper\n\n\n\n902.50±plus-or-minus\\pm4.36\n\n\n\n893.30±plus-or-minus\\pm6.72\n\n\n\n900.30±plus-or-minus\\pm3.93\n\n\n\n817.40±plus-or-minus\\pm253.54\n\n\n\n897.90±plus-or-minus\\pm6.06\n\n\n\n879.50±plus-or-minus\\pm30.96\n\n\n\n\nSps.HalfCheetah\n\n\n\n903.50±plus-or-minus\\pm34.97\n\n\n\n924.90±plus-or-minus\\pm39.57\n\n\n\n915.90±plus-or-minus\\pm50.71\n\n\n\n394.70±plus-or-minus\\pm405.53\n\n\n\n827.80±plus-or-minus\\pm85.61\n\n\n\n924.70±plus-or-minus\\pm24.44\n\n\n\n\nSps.Walker2d\n\n\n\n818.00±plus-or-minus\\pm208.60\n\n\n\n886.60±plus-or-minus\\pm25.77\n\n\n\n665.10±plus-or-minus\\pm355.66\n\n\n\n278.50±plus-or-minus\\pm398.23\n\n\n\n750.90±plus-or-minus\\pm179.09\n\n\n\n705.30±plus-or-minus\\pm274.88\n\n\n\n\nSps.Ant\n\n\n\n953.70±plus-or-minus\\pm28.39\n\n\n\n973.60±plus-or-minus\\pm12.55\n\n\n\n935.80±plus-or-minus\\pm37.08\n\n\n\n870.70±plus-or-minus\\pm121.14\n\n\n\n920.60±plus-or-minus\\pm107.50\n\n\n\n940.70±plus-or-minus\\pm43.84\n\n\n\n\nDel.
