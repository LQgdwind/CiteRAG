      "content": "Paper Title: Formally Certified Approximate Model CountingThe first two authors contributed equally.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis discussion is focused on formally verified algorithms and\nproof checkers. Readers are referred to Chakraborty et\nal.  and references therein for related\nliterature on approximate model counting. Prior research on certificate-based approaches focuses on deterministic\nmethods in model counting. Prior work on certified exact model\ncounting focuses either on the development of proofs, such as\nMICE  and CPOG , along with\ntheir respective toolchains, or on analyzing the complexity of the\nproof system . Some efforts have been directed toward\ncertifying deterministic approximate counting algorithms which,\nhowever, require access to a Σ2PsubscriptsuperscriptΣP2\\mathrm{\\Sigma^{P}_{2}} oracle and did not\nyield practical implementations . Our work develops the\nfirst certification framework for randomized approximate model\ncounting. Various randomized\nalgorithms have been formally analyzed in Isabelle/HOL, including randomized\nquicksort, random binary tree data\nstructures 5, and approximation of frequency\nmoments in data\nstreams    .\nThese prior efforts as well as ours, all build upon the foundations for measure\nand probability theory in\nIsabelle/HOL  .\nProperties of approximate membership query structures (including Bloom filters)\nhave been verified in Coq . Pioneering work\non formal verification of randomized algorithms, including the Miller-Rabin\nprimality test, was carried out by Joe Hurd in HOL4 [ref]29. A\ncommon objective of these prior efforts, and that of ours, is to put the\nguarantees of randomized algorithms on formal foundations. Formally verified proof checkers have been developed for several\n(deterministic) algorithms and theories, such as the CNF unsatisfiability\ncheckers used by the SAT\ncommunity   .\nWithin Isabelle/HOL, the Pastèque tool \nchecks proofs in the practical algebraic calculus, which can be used to\nvalidate algebraic reasoning; the CeTA tool \nis based on an extensive library of results for certifying properties of\nrewriting systems; and the LEDA project developed specialized proof checkers\nfor graph algorithms .\nCoqQFBV [ref]47 is similar in design to our\napproach in that a higher-level Coq-generated tool for verified\nbit-blasting is used in concert with a lower-level verified proof\nchecker for CNF formulas. Given 𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢\\mathsf{ApproxMC}’s reliance on\nCNF-XOR formulas, certification of CNF-XOR unsatisfiability emerged as a key\nchallenge in our work. To this end, we provide a brief overview of three prior\nstate-of-the-art approaches for certified CNF-XOR reasoning. The first approach uses proof generation and certification of XOR\nreasoning based on Binary Decision Diagrams\n(BDDs) . It uses\nCryptoMiniSat , a SAT solver specifically\nmade to work on CNF-XOR instances and\nTBUDDY  to produce FRAT proof certificates  for\nCryptoMiniSat’s XOR reasoning;\nFRAT-rs  is used as the elaboration\nbackend and a verified LRAT proof\nchecker   can be\nused to check the elaborated proofs. The second approach, due to Gocht and\nNordström , relies on pseudo-Boolean reasoning\nand its associated proof system to justify both CNF and parity\nreasoning. This approach was demonstrated on MiniSat equipped with an XOR\nreasoning engine, with 𝖵𝖾𝗋𝗂𝖯𝖡𝖵𝖾𝗋𝗂𝖯𝖡\\mathsf{VeriPB} as a proof checker; pseudo-Boolean proofs are\nalso supported by a verified proof checker . The third approach is to rely on the standard SAT solvers accompanied\nwith standard CNF proof formats and (verified)\ncheckers   .\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: (including Bloom filters)\nhave been verified in Coq . Pioneering work\non formal verification of randomized algorithms, including the Miller-Rabin\nprimality test, was carried out by Joe Hurd in HOL4 [ref]29.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
