      "content": "Paper Title: The exact subgraph hierarchy and its local variant for the stable set problem for Paley graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis paper deals with the stable set problem, a fundamental combinatorial optimization problem. Given an undirected simple graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) with |V|=n𝑉𝑛|V|=n vertices and |E|=m𝐸𝑚|E|=m edges, a subset of vertices S⊆V𝑆𝑉S\\subseteq V is called a stable set if no two vertices of S𝑆S are adjacent. A stable set of largest possible cardinality in G𝐺G is called maximum stable set, and its cardinality is denoted by α​(G)𝛼𝐺\\alpha(G). The stable set problem asks to determine α​(G)𝛼𝐺\\alpha(G). It is an NP-hard problem contained in Karp’s list  from 1972. Therefore, unless P = NP, there is no polynomial time algorithm to solve the stable set problem. A method that can be employed for solving the stable set problem is branch-and-bound, which strongly depends on good upper bounds.\nOne possible upper bound on the stability number of a graph is given by the Lovász theta function [ref]23, which was introduced in 1979 and which can be computed as the optimal objective function value of a semidefinite program (SDP). Since its introduction, the Lovász theta function as well as its strengthenings have been extensively studied. One of the first refinements is the one proposed by Schrijver . The Lovász theta function can also be tightened using a hierarchical approach. Such a hierarchy is a systematic procedure to strengthen a relaxation by adding additional variables or constraints, and, usually starting from the Lovász theta function at the first level of the hierarchy, it involves multiple levels, each providing a tighter relaxation than the previous one. The most prominent hierarchies based on semidefinite programming (SDP) are the ones from Sherali and Adams , Lovász and Schrijver  and Lasserre . Laurent investigated the computational application of these hierarchies to the stable set polytope in . In , Adams, Anjos, Rendl, and Wiegele proposed the exact subgraph hierarchy for classes of NP-hard problems that are based on graphs and for which the projection of the problem onto a subgraph shares the same structure as the original problem. In particular, they considered the Max-Cut and the stable set problems. The approach from  for the latter starts by computing the Lovász theta function at the first level of the hierarchy. At level k𝑘k of the hierarchy it considers all subsets of k𝑘k vertices and requires the exact subgraph constraint to be fulfilled, a constraint that ensures that for the corresponding subgraph the solution is exact. Computational studies of the exact subgraph hierarchy for the stable set, the Max-Cut, and graph coloring problems were performed by Gaar  and by Gaar and Rendl 0. The results for the stable set problem presented in  reveal that for some graphs, higher levels of the hierarchy do not necessarily yield tighter bounds on their stability numbers than the ones obtained at the first level of the hierarchy. One such example is the Paley graph on 616161 vertices, for which an improvement of the bound was realized only on the sixth level of the hierarchy. On the other hand, for certain graphs, a significant improvement of the bounds on their stability numbers was achieved already on the second level of the hierarchy. A question that naturally arises and that we address in this paper is whether, for all Paley graphs, there is no improvement of the bound on the stability number up to a certain level of the exact subgraph hierarchy and, if so, whether there is a theoretical explanation for it. So far, the stability numbers of Paley graphs have gained some attention in the literature. Several authors investigated closed-form bounds on stability numbers of Paley graphs already a long time ago, for example, Broere, Döman, and Ridley  and Cohen .\nThe best closed-form upper bound for a certain class of Paley graphs was given only recently by Hanson and Petridis 6. Upper SDP bounds on the stability numbers of Paley graphs based on block-diagonal SDP hierarchies for 0/1 programming were investigated by Gvozdenovic, Laurent, and Vallentin 5. Furthermore, Magsino, Mixon, and Parshall  argued that one can obtain bounds on the stability number of Paley graphs by considering certain subgraphs only. In particular, they showed that the Schrijver refinement of the Lovász theta function applied on these subgraphs yields bounds that are sometimes better than the ones proposed in 6.\nIn this paper, we generalize the approach of  for all vertex-transitive graphs, which eventually leads us to the introduction of a new hierarchy for their stable set problem. Contribution and outline \nIn this paper, we consider upper bounds on the stability numbers of Paley graphs Pqsubscript𝑃𝑞P_{q} of order q𝑞q based on exact subgraph constraints from two different aspects. First, we systematically investigate various levels of the exact subgraph hierarchy for Paley graphs, starting with the construction of an optimal solution for the SDP to compute the first level—the Lovász theta function. Then, we examine whether the upper bounds for the stability numbers of Paley graphs on higher levels of the exact subgraph hierarchy improve. In particular, we identify a specific level ℓ​(q)=⌊q+32⌋ℓ𝑞𝑞32\\ell(q)=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{\\sqrt{q}+3}{2}\\right\\rfloor for which adding exact subgraph constraints on subgraphs of orders 2,…,ℓ​(q)2…ℓ𝑞{2,\\ldots,\\ell(q)} fails to provide better bounds on the stability numbers for the Paley graph Pqsubscript𝑃𝑞P_{q}. Moreover, for certain Paley graphs, we prove that adding exact subgraph constraints on subgraphs of order ℓ​(q)+1ℓ𝑞1\\ell(q)+1 also fails to improve the Lovász theta function as an upper bound on the stability number. As a consequence, the exact subgraph hierarchy does not perform well at providing upper bounds on the stability number of a Paley graph Pqsubscript𝑃𝑞P_{q}, as it only has the potential to improve the bound starting from level ℓ​(q)+1ℓ𝑞1\\ell(q)+1 or even ℓ​(q)+2ℓ𝑞2\\ell(q)+2. Second, to address this limitation, we present an alternative approach for the computation of upper bounds on the stability numbers of Paley graphs. For this purpose, we introduce the local exact subgraph hierarchy for the stable set problem for vertex-transitive graphs, which includes Paley graphs. To do so, we fix one vertex of the graph G𝐺G to be in a maximum stable set and apply the exact subgraph hierarchy to the local graph of G𝐺G, i.e., to the subgraph of G𝐺G in which the remaining vertices of the maximum stable set can be. We prove that for any vertex-transitive graph, the bounds obtained from the local exact subgraph hierarchy are at least as good as those from the exact subgraph hierarchy. In our computational study, we demonstrate that this new hierarchy yields bounds on the stability numbers of Paley graphs that are significantly better than the bounds obtained from the exact subgraph hierarchy and that are even tighter than the ones proposed in 6 and . Specifically, our computations reveal that for every Paley graph considered, the upper bound on the stability number at the second level of the local exact subgraph hierarchy is significantly tighter than at the first (and consequently ℓ​(q)ℓ𝑞\\ell(q)-th) level of the exact subgraph hierarchy. This demonstrates that the local exact subgraph hierarchy effectively overcomes the issue of stagnant upper bounds for multiple levels of the exact subgraph hierarchy. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.\nIn Section 2, we give an overview of the theoretical concepts used in this work, including Paley graphs, the Lovász theta function, and the exact subgraph hierarchy. In Section 3, we investigate various levels of the exact subgraph hierarchy for Paley graphs that do not yield improved upper bounds on their stability numbers. In Section 4, we introduce the local exact subgraph hierarchy for the stable set problem for vertex-transitive graphs and investigate its effectiveness in finding upper bounds on stability numbers of Paley graphs. We conclude with a short discussion of our results and open questions in Section 5. Notation and terminology  We close this section with some notation and terminology.\nWe denote by ℕ0subscriptℕ0\\mathbb{N}_{0} the natural numbers including zero. The vector of all-ones of length n𝑛n is denoted by 𝟙nsubscript1𝑛\\mathds{1}_{n} and we write 𝟙n×n=𝟙n​𝟙nTsubscript1𝑛𝑛subscript1𝑛subscriptsuperscript1𝑇𝑛\\mathds{1}_{n\\times n}=\\mathds{1}_{n}\\mathds{1}^{T}_{n} for the matrix of all-ones. Let 0nsubscript0𝑛0_{n} be the zero matrix and Insubscript𝐼𝑛I_{n} the identity matrix of order n𝑛n. We denote by eisubscript𝑒𝑖e_{i} the column i𝑖i of the matrix Insubscript𝐼𝑛I_{n}. Furthermore, we set If a∈ℝn𝑎superscriptℝ𝑛a\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}, then Diag⁡(a)Diag𝑎\\operatorname{Diag}(a) denotes a n×n𝑛𝑛n\\times n diagonal matrix with a𝑎a on the main diagonal, while if X∈ℝn×n𝑋superscriptℝ𝑛𝑛X\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}, then diag⁡(X)diag𝑋\\operatorname{diag}(X) is a vector of length n𝑛n containing the main diagonal of X𝑋X. For basic graph theoretical concepts, we use the notion of graphs, the order, the complement graph G¯¯𝐺\\overline{G} of a graph G𝐺G, the induced subgraph, as well as the set of neighbors of a vertex of Diestel . We recall that a clique is a subset of vertices such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent. The cardinality of a maximum clique in G𝐺G is denoted by ω​(G)𝜔𝐺\\omega(G). Since a stable set in G𝐺G is a clique in G¯¯𝐺\\overline{G}, we have α​(G)=ω​(G¯)𝛼𝐺𝜔¯𝐺\\alpha(G)=\\omega(\\overline{G}).\nA matrix X∈ℝn×n𝑋superscriptℝ𝑛𝑛X\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n} is circulant if Xi+1,j+1=Xi​jsubscript𝑋𝑖1𝑗1subscript𝑋𝑖𝑗X_{i+1,j+1}=X_{ij} for all i,j∈ℤn={0,1,…,n−1}𝑖𝑗subscriptℤ𝑛01…𝑛1i,j\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{n}=\\{0,1,\\ldots,n-1\\}.\nA graph G𝐺G on n𝑛n vertices is circulant if there exists a labeling of its vertices with ℤnsubscriptℤ𝑛\\mathbb{Z}_{n} such that its adjacency matrix is circulant. If G𝐺G is circulant, its complement G¯¯𝐺\\overline{G} is also circulant. Furthermore, a graph G𝐺G is vertex-transitive if its automorphism group acts transitively on V𝑉V. Analogously, a graph G𝐺G is edge-transitive if its automorphism group acts transitively on E𝐸E. A regular graph G𝐺G that is neither complete nor empty is said to be strongly regular with parameters (n,r,a,c)𝑛𝑟𝑎𝑐(n,r,a,c) if it is r𝑟r-regular, if every pair of adjacent vertices has a𝑎a common neighbors, and if every pair of distinct non-adjacent vertices has c𝑐c common neighbors.
