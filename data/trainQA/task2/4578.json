      "content": "Paper Title: Byzantines can also Learn from History: Fall of Centered Clipping in Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRobust aggregators. Defence mechanisms against the presence of Byzantine agents in collaborative learning and distributed computations has been studied in the literature for nearly 40 years . With the increasing deployment of large-scale systems that employ collaborative learning, such as FL, the risks and potential consequences of such attacks are also growing . Many robust aggregation methods have been studied to counter possible adversarial clients. Most solutions replace FedAVG  with more robust aggregation methods built upon various statistical and geometrical assumptions, such as coordinate-wise median (CM) , geometric median   , and consensus reaching methods like majority voting [ref]4. However, since these aggregators are based on purely statistical assumptions, their robustness fails against the SotA attacks, in which the adversaries can statistically conceal themselves as benign clients. Furthermore, these assumptions may not hold in real FL implementations, in which the data distributions tend to be heterogeneous (non-IID) across clients. As a result of which, benign clients may be labeled as adversaries, and discarded by the aggregator. TM  has been proposed as an improvement over CM by calculating the mean after discarding the outliers. RFA  addressed the issue of heterogeneous data distributions by employing a geometric median in their aggregator. Krum/Multi-Krum  calculate a geometric distance from each client to every other participating client to score them based on their distances, then discard the clients with the lowest scores. One particular downside of the Krum and Multi-Krum methods is that due to the scoring function, they are slower aggregators (O‚Äã(k2)ùëÇsuperscriptùëò2O(k^{2})) compared to other aggregators (O‚Äã(k)ùëÇùëòO(k)), where kùëòk denotes the number of clients. Bulyan  is proposed to prevent Byzantine clients that target very specific locations in the gradients, while being close to the mean in the rest of the gradient values. Bulyan uses the same selection method in Krum, and then applies TM to the selected subset of clients. Nevertheless, these traditional aggregators discard outlier benign clients one way or another ; and therefore, their robustness tends to fail in the case of heterogeneous data distributions. Recently, CC  is proposed to aggregate all the participating clients, where outlier gradients are scaled and clipped based on the center that is selected by the aggregator using the history of the previous aggregations. This provides better convergence by not fully discarding the outliers and a natural defense mechanism against Byzantines that can act as an outlier. Incorporating acceleration frameworks.\nThe momentum SGD   has been introduced to accelerate the convergence of the SGD framework and to escape saddle points to achieve a better minima  . These advantages of the acceleration methods, particularly momentum SGD, promote their use also in the FL framework, with the possibilities of incorporating momentum locally at the clients and globally at the server . In the context of Byzantine resilience, only a limited number of works have analyzed the impact of the momentum SGD. In , it has been shown that, in terms of Byzantine resilience, utilizing momentum locally at the clients is better than globally at the PS. In , the authors propose RESAM (RESilient Averaging of Momentums), which specifically employs the local momentum of the benign clients instead of their gradients. In , the authors have shown that, besides reducing the variance among the updates, the momentum term from the previous iteration can also be used as a reference for the momentum of the next iteration in order to neutralize Byzantine attacks trough clipping. However, as we show in this work, malicious clients can also follow a similar strategy to improve their attack strength, and escape from clipping. Model poisoning attacks and defenses.\nWe can identify three SotA model poisoning attacks that have often been studied in the literature to circumvent the existing robust aggregators [ref]18 [ref]3 . The common ground of these attacks is that Byzantine clients statistically stay close to benign clients to prevent easy detection and poison the global model by coupling their attacks across multiple iterations. However, these attacks do not consider momentum and directly target the gradient values of the clients. In a recent work , the authors show that existing Byzantine-robust FL algorithms are significantly more susceptible to model poisoning attacks than previous SOTA attacks of ALIE [ref]3 and Fang [ref]18 by introducing min-max and min-sum attacks to amplify the existing poisoning attacks and introduced a divide-and-conquer (DnC) framework to prevent such attacks. Some of the existing defenses for backdoor attacks, such as FLAME , offer some level of robustness against untargeted model poisoning attacks; however, they are not designed to prevent SotA time-coupled model poisonings attacks such as ALIE or IPM. Recently proposed FLtrust  claims to offer more robustness than TM  and Krum; however, unlike other aggregators, FLtrust requires part of the dataset to be available at the PS, which may not be possible in most FL applications due to privacy concerns. Finally, proposed model poisoning defenses, namely DnC and FLtrust, do not employ either local or global momentum and only consider the gradient values of the clients.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: robust aggregation methods built upon various statistical and geometrical assumptions, such as coordinate-wise median (CM) , geometric median   , and consensus reaching methods like majority voting [ref]4.
