      "content": "Paper Title: Explainable Link Prediction for Emerging Entities in Knowledge Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAn alternative stream of research has explored means of identifying specific paths of inference, which is the task we consider in this paper. To this end, the Path Ranking Algorithm (PRA) [ref]22 uses random walks with restarts for multi-hop reasoning. Following PRA, other approaches    [ref]13 also leverage random walk based inference. However, the reasoning paths that these methods follow are gathered by random walks independently of the query relation. Recent approaches have instead adopted policy gradient based reinforcement learning for a more focused exploration of reasoning paths. Policy gradient based models such as DeepPath , MINERVA , MINERVA with Reward Shaping and Action Dropout , and M-Walk [ref]31 formulate the KG reasoning task as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process and learn a policy conditioned on the query relation. Such reasoning techniques have also been invoked for explainable recommendation 2  3 and explainable dialogue systems 6.\nAlthough the inference paths are explainable in these models (if reward shaping is omitted), there may be a substantial performance gap in comparison with embedding-based models. Another sub-category of path-based methods, e.g., AMIE+ , AnyBURL , and RuleS  proceed by mining Horn rules from the the existing knowledge graphs for link prediction. The body of a Horn rule provides the reasoning path. Although these approaches are capable of fast rule mining and can easily be applied to unseen emerging entities, the quality of the learned rules are affected by the sparsity of the knowledge graph.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: An alternative stream of research has explored means of identifying specific paths of inference, which is the task we consider in this paper.
