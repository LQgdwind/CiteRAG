      "content": "Paper Title: Syntax and Domain Aware Model for Unsupervised Program Translation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThreats to internal validity include the influence of the model hyper-parameter settings for both our model and the reproduced baseline model TransCoder*.\nTo ensure a fair comparison between TransCoder and SDA-Trans, we use the same setting with the strong baseline TransCoder [ref]21 in our backbone model. For our proposed components, i.e., GAT layers and heads, we chose the hyper-parameters through a small-scale grid search and manual selection.\nFor TransCoder*, as the authors of [ref]21 offered the artifact and running scripts to re-train their model with new training data 999https://github.com/facebookresearch/TransCoder#train-a-new-model. We follow their scripts to train TranCoder* with our data. During the training, we tuned the mini-batch size and initial learning rate according to our GPU memory and the model’s initial performance. Then we use the same configuration in SDA-Trans. We have tried our best to make sure the training process is stable and finish training until the model is converged. However, it cannot be denied that when the datasets changes, the original model’s performance could be affected. We have tried our best to make TransCoder* approximate its optimal performance, and make the comparison between TransCoder* and SDA-Trans fair. Therefore, there is a minor threat to the hyper-parameter tuning. Threats to external validity include the quality of the datasets. We use the Python and Java programs of the CodeSearchNet dataset  to pre-train our model. CodeSearchNet contains function-document pairs collected from GitHub repositories, covering 6 kinds of languages. It is widely used in code pre-train models [ref]10 , and these model has achieved great performance in various downstream tasks. Thus, most of the programs can be viewed as high-quality. For evaluation, we use the dataset built in TransCoder [ref]21. The evaluation set is composed of hundreds of parallel functions in 3 languages, and some of the programs have unit tests that can be used to evaluate the correctness of generated translations. Nerveless, the evaluation scale is not big and comprehensive enough, and further evaluation on big data and other programming languages is needed.\nBesides, a further threat is related to the baseline choice. TransCoder-ST  is state-of-the-art for unsupervised code translation, which outperforms TransCoder [ref]21 substantially. It is an incremental work on TransCoder and relies on large-scale pre-trained models as its backbone.\nSpecifically, TransCoder-ST improves TransCoder by filtering out invalid translations through an automated unit-testing system during back-translation, which reduces the noise and further boosts translation performance. The essential question of high training costs and poor cross-lingual transfer is not solved. We believe their filtering technology is orthogonal to SDA-Trans, which can also be used to improve the back-translation performance in our model. Thus, we don’t consider it as a baseline in this paper. Threats to construct validity relate to the property of the evaluation measure. We adopted BLEU-4 score and exact match accuracy to measure the quality of the translated programs by comparing the predicted programs with the ground truth, and these two metrics are generally used in the previous program translation work. Besides, we further introduce computational accuracy to evaluate the semantic correctness of the generated translations.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: settings for both our model and the reproduced baseline model TransCoder*.\nTo ensure a fair comparison between TransCoder and SDA-Trans, we use the same setting with the strong baseline TransCoder [ref]21 in our backbone model.
