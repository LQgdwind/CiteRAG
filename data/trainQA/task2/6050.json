      "content": "Paper Title: Text-to-Audio Generation using Instruction-Tuned LLM and Latent Diffusion Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe use the pre-trained LLM Flan-T5-Large (780M)  as the text encoder (Et​e​x​tsubscript𝐸𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡E_{text}) to obtain text encoding τ∈ℝL×dt​e​x​t𝜏superscriptℝ𝐿subscript𝑑𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡\\tau\\in\\mathbb{R}^{L\\times d_{text}}, where L𝐿L and dt​e​x​tsubscript𝑑𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡d_{text} are the token count and token-embedding size, respectively. Due to the pre-training of Flan-T5 models on a large-scale chain-of-thought- (CoT) and instruction-based dataset, Dai et al.  posit that they are able to learn a new task very well from the in-context information by mimicking gradient descent through attention weights. This property is missing in the older large models, such as RoBERTa [ref]19 (used by Liu et al. [ref]18) and T5 0 (used by Kreuk et al. ). Considering each input sample a distinct task, it might be reasonable to assume that the gradient-descent mimicking property could be pivotal in learning the mapping between textual and acoustic concepts without fine-tuning the text encoder. The richer pre-training may also allow the encoder to better emphasize the key details with less noise and enriched context. This again may lead to the better transformation of the relevant textual concepts into their acoustics counterparts. Consequently, we keep the text encoder frozen, assuming the subsequent reverse diffusion process (see Section 2.2) would be able to learn the inter-modality mapping well for audio prior to construction. We also suspect that fine-tuning Et​e​x​tsubscript𝐸𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡E_{text} may degrade its in-context learning ability due to gradients from the audio modality that is out of distribution to the pre-training dataset. This is in contrast with Liu et al. [ref]18 that fine-tunes the pre-trained text encoder as a part of the text-audio joint-representation learning (CLAP) to allow audio prior reconstruction from text. In Section 3, we empirically show that such joint-representation learning may not be necessary for text-to-audio transformation.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: are able to learn a new task very well from the in-context information by mimicking gradient descent through attention weights.
