      "content": "Paper Title: Revisiting data augmentation for subspace clustering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we evaluate the proposed approaches on both synthetic and real-world data sets. All experiments are implemented in Matlab (R2019b), and run on a laptop with Intel Core i7-9750H, @2.60 GHz CPU and 16 GB RAM. The code is available from https://sites.google.com/site/nicolasgillis/code. We use two metrics to evaluate the clustering algorithms: Error rate (err) which belongs to the interval [0−100]delimited-[]0100[0-100] and the lower values correspond to better clustering performance: where ℓ∈{1,…,p}nℓsuperscript1…𝑝𝑛\\ell\\in\\{1,\\dots,p\\}^{n} and ℓ^∈{1,…,p}n^ℓsuperscript1…𝑝𝑛\\hat{\\ell}\\in\\{1,\\dots,p\\}^{n} are the ground-truth and estimated labels by a clustering algorithm, respectively. In addition, 𝟏(.)\\mathbf{1}(.) is the indicator function which returns one if the input condition is satisfied. Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) which we scale between 0 and 100. A larger NMI value indicates a more accurate clustering. where I​(⋅;⋅)𝐼⋅⋅I(\\cdot;\\cdot) and H​(⋅)𝐻⋅H(\\cdot) are the mutual information metric\nand the entropy function, respectively. We compare the proposed approaches with state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised SC approaches.\nFor unsupervised SC, we selected popular SC algorithms including the classic algorithms of SSC , LRR , and LSR ; as well as SC with elastic net regularization in EnSC , greedy SC using OMP , nonlinear kernel based SC approach in KSSC , and scalable kNN based SC algorithms, namely kNN-SSC , kNN-LRR and kNN-LSR.\nFor semi-supervised SC, in addition to the state-of-the-art algorithms of NNLRR , NNLRS , S3​Rsuperscript𝑆3𝑅S^{3}R and S2​L​R​Rsuperscript𝑆2𝐿𝑅𝑅S^{2}LRR in [ref]25,\nwe compare the proposed AkS-SC with SSC-LP, LRR-LP, LSR-LP, which are based on the proposed AkS-SC without augmentation but using the iterative label propagation scheme.\nThe parameters of these approaches are selected and tuned according to the recommendations in the corresponding papers. We use two real-world data sets: The COIL-20 data set (Columbia Object Image Library)  contains 1440 images of 20 objects. Each category has 72 images of an object which were captured from different views/poses. All the images are cropped and processed to 128×128128128128\\times 128 pixels. Following the common approach in SC literature, we downsampled the images to to 32×32323232\\times 32 pixels . The MNIST data set contains 70000 images of 10 handwritten digits with the size 28×\\times28 pixels. This data set is divided into 60000 training images and 10000 testing images. We selected the first 50 images per digit from the MNIST test data set. Based on the common practice introduced in , we use a scattering convolution network  to extract feature vectors of dimension 3472, and then project them to dimension 100 using PCA. In addition to this, we will use a carefully designed synthetic data generation model to analyze in detail the effect of augmentation in the semi-supervised setting; see Section 5.2.1.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: namely kNN-SSC , kNN-LRR and kNN-LSR.\nFor semi-supervised SC, in addition to the state-of-the-art algorithms of NNLRR , NNLRS , S3​Rsuperscript𝑆3𝑅S^{3}R and S2​L​R​Rsuperscript𝑆2𝐿𝑅𝑅S^{2}LRR in [ref]25,\nwe compare the proposed AkS-SC with SSC-LP, LRR-LP, LSR-LP, which are based on the proposed AkS-SC without augmentation but using the iterative label propagation scheme.\nThe parameters of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
