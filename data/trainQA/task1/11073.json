Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Modal logic, fundamentally\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Non-classical generalizations of classical modal logic have been developed in the contexts of constructive mathematics and natural language semantics. In this paper, we discuss a general approach to the semantics of non-classical modal logics via algebraic representation theorems. We begin with complete lattices L𝐿L equipped with an antitone operation ¬\\neg sending 111 to 00, a completely multiplicative operation □□\\Box, and a completely additive operation ◇◇\\Diamond. Such lattice expansions can be represented by means of a set X𝑋X together with binary relations ⊲⊲\\vartriangleleft, R𝑅R, and Q𝑄Q, satisfying some first-order conditions, used to represent (L,¬)𝐿(L,\\neg), □□\\Box, and ◇◇\\Diamond, respectively. Indeed, any lattice L𝐿L equipped with such a ¬\\neg, a multiplicative □□\\Box, and an additive ◇◇\\Diamond embeds into the lattice of propositions of a frame (X,⊲,R,Q)𝑋⊲𝑅𝑄(X,\\vartriangleleft,R,Q). Building on our recent study of fundamental logic, we focus on the case where ¬\\neg is dually self-adjoint (a≤¬b𝑎𝑏a\\leq\\neg b implies b≤¬a𝑏𝑎b\\leq\\neg a) and ◇​¬a≤¬□​a◇𝑎□𝑎\\Diamond\\neg a\\leq\\neg\\Box a. In this case, the representations can be constrained so that R=Q𝑅𝑄R=Q, i.e., we need only add a single relation to (X,⊲)𝑋⊲(X,\\vartriangleleft) to represent both □□\\Box and ◇◇\\Diamond. Using these results, we prove that a system of fundamental modal logic is sound and complete with respect to an elementary class of bi-relational structures (X,⊲,R)𝑋⊲𝑅(X,\\vartriangleleft,R).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
