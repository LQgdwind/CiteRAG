Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Generating Negative Samples for Sequential Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. To make Sequential Recommendation (SR) successful, recent works focus on designing effective sequential encoders, fusing side information, and mining extra positive self-supervision signals. The strategy of sampling negative items at each time step is less explored. Due to the dynamics of users’ interests and model updates during training, considering randomly sampled items from a user’s non-interacted item set as negatives can be uninformative. As a result, the model will inaccurately learn user preferences toward items. Identifying informative negatives is challenging because informative negative items are tied with both dynamically changed interests and model parameters (and sampling process should also be efficient). To this end, we propose to Generate Negative Samples (items) for SR (GenNi). A negative item is sampled at each time step based on the current SR model’s learned user preferences toward items. An efficient implementation is proposed to further accelerate the generation process, making it scalable to large-scale recommendation tasks. Extensive experiments on four public datasets verify the importance of providing high-quality negative samples for SR and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GenNi.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
