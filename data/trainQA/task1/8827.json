      "content": "Paper Title: 3D Molecular Geometry Analysis with 2D Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Ground-state 3D geometries of molecules are essential for many molecular analysis tasks. Modern quantum mechanical methods can compute accurate 3D geometries but are computationally prohibitive. Currently, an efficient alternative to computing ground-state 3D molecular geometries from 2D graphs is lacking. Here, we propose a novel deep learning framework to predict 3D geometries from molecular graphs. To this end, we develop an equilibrium message passing neural network (EMPNN) to better capture ground-state geometries from molecular graphs. To provide a testbed for 3D molecular geometry analysis, we develop a benchmark that includes a large-scale molecular geometry dataset, data splits, and evaluation protocols. Experimental results show that EMPNN can efficiently predict more accurate ground-state 3D geometries than RDKit and other deep learning methods. Results also show that the proposed framework outperforms self-supervised learning methods on property prediction tasks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 48\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
