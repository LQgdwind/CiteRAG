Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 58 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: ENGAGE: Explanation Guided Data Augmentation for Graph Representation Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The recent contrastive learning methods, due to their effectiveness in representation learning, have been widely applied to modeling graph data. Random perturbation is widely used to build contrastive views for graph data, which however, could accidentally break graph structures and lead to suboptimal performance. In addition, graph data is usually highly abstract, so it is hard to extract intuitive meanings and design more informed augmentation schemes. Effective representations should preserve key characteristics in data and abandon superfluous information. In this paper, we propose ENGAGE (ExplaNation Guided data AuGmEntation), where explanation guides the contrastive augmentation process to preserve the key parts in graphs and explore removing superfluous information. Specifically, we design an efficient unsupervised explanation method called smoothed activation map as the indicator of node importance in representation learning. Then, we design two data augmentation schemes on graphs for perturbing structural and feature information, respectively. We also provide justification for the proposed method in the framework of information theories. Experiments of both graph-level and node-level tasks, on various model architectures and on different real-world graphs, are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of ENGAGE. The code of ENGAGE can be found here 111 https://github.com/sycny/ENGAGE..\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 58\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
