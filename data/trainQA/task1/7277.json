Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data.

      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Product Graphs from Spectral Templates\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Graph Learning (GL) is at the core of inference and analysis of connections in data mining and machine learning (ML). By observing a dataset of graph signals, and considering specific assumptions, Graph Signal Processing (GSP) tools can provide practical constraints in the GL approach. One applicable constraint can infer a graph with desired frequency signatures, i.e., spectral templates. However, a severe computational burden is a challenging barrier, especially for inference from high-dimensional graph signals. To address this issue and in the case of the underlying graph having graph product structure, we propose learning product (high dimensional) graphs from product spectral templates with significantly reduced complexity rather than learning them directly from high-dimensional graph signals, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been addressed in the related areas. In contrast to the rare current approaches, our approach can learn all types of product graphs (with more than two graphs) without knowing the type of graph products and has fewer parameters. Experimental results on both the synthetic and real-world data, i.e., brain signal analysis and multi-view object images, illustrate explainable and meaningful factor graphs supported by expert-related research, as well as outperforming the rare current restricted approaches.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
