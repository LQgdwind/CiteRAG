Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Comparing computational entropies below majority (or: When is the dense model theorem false?)\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Computational pseudorandomness studies the extent to which a random variable ùêôùêô\\mathbf{Z} looks like the uniform distribution according to a class of tests ‚Ñ±‚Ñ±\\mathcal{F}. Computational entropy generalizes computational pseudorandomness by studying the extent which a random variable looks like a high entropy distribution. There are different formal definitions of computational entropy with different advantages for different applications. Because of this, it is of interest to understand when these definitions are equivalent. We consider three notions of computational entropy which are known to be equivalent when the test class ‚Ñ±‚Ñ±\\mathcal{F} is closed under taking majorities. This equivalence constitutes (essentially) the so-called dense model theorem of Green and Tao (and later made explicit by Tao-Zeigler, Reingold et al., and Gowers). The dense model theorem plays a key role in Green and Tao‚Äôs proof that the primes contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions and has since been connected to a surprisingly wide range of topics in mathematics and computer science, including cryptography, computational complexity, combinatorics and machine learning. We show that, in different situations where ‚Ñ±‚Ñ±\\mathcal{F} is not closed under majority, this equivalence fails. This in turn provides examples where the dense model theorem is false.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
