Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Error Mitigation of Near-Term Quantum Simulations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Near-term quantum computers provide a promising platform for finding ground states of quantum systems, which is an essential task in physics, chemistry, and materials science. Near-term approaches, however, are constrained by the effects of noise as well as the limited resources of near-term quantum hardware. We introduce neural error mitigation, which uses neural networks to improve estimates of ground states and ground-state observables obtained using near-term quantum simulations. To demonstrate our method’s broad applicability, we employ neural error mitigation to find the ground states of the H22{}_{\\text{2}} and LiH molecular Hamiltonians, as well as the lattice Schwinger model, prepared via the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Our results show that neural error mitigation improves numerical and experimental VQE computations to yield low energy errors, high fidelities, and accurate estimations of more-complex observables like order parameters and entanglement entropy, without requiring additional quantum resources. Furthermore, neural error mitigation is agnostic with respect to the quantum state preparation algorithm used, the quantum hardware it is implemented on, and the particular noise channel affecting the experiment, contributing to its versatility as a tool for quantum simulation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
