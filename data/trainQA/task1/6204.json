Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Target High-Utility Itemsets\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract For applied intelligence, utility-driven pattern discovery algorithms can identify insightful and useful patterns in databases. However, in these techniques for pattern discovery, the number of patterns can be huge, and the user is often only interested in a few of those patterns. Hence, targeted mining of high-utility itemsets has emerged as a key research topic, where the aim is to find a subset of patterns that meet a target pattern constraint instead of all patterns. This is a challenging task because efficiently finding tailored patterns in a very large search space requires a targeted mining algorithm. A first algorithm called TargetUM has been proposed, which adopts an approach similar to post-processing using a tree structure, but the running time and memory consumption are unsatisfactory in many situations. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a novel list-based algorithm with pattern matching mechanism, named THUIM (Targeted High-Utility Itemset Mining), which can quickly match high-utility itemsets during the mining process to select the target patterns. Extensive experiments were conducted on different datasets to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with state-of-the-art algorithms. Results show that THUIM performs very well in terms of runtime and memory consumption, and has good scalability compared to TargetUM.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
