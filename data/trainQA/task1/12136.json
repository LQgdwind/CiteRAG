Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: FedDW: Distilling Weights through Consistency Optimization in Heterogeneous Federated Learning *Corresponding Author\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Federated Learning (FL) is an innovative distributed machine learning paradigm that enables neural network training across devices without centralizing data. While this addresses issues of information sharing and data privacy, challenges arise from data heterogeneity across clients and increasing network scale, leading to impacts on model performance and training efficiency. Previous research shows that in IID environments, the parameter structure of the model is expected to adhere to certain specific consistency principles. Thus, identifying and regularizing these consistencies can mitigate issues from heterogeneous data. We found that both soft labels derived from knowledge distillation and the classifier head parameter matrix, when multiplied by their own transpose, capture the intrinsic relationships between data classes. These shared relationships suggest inherent consistency. Therefore, the work in this paper identifies the consistency between the two and leverages it to regulate training, underpinning our proposed FedDW framework. Experimental results show FedDW outperforms 10 state-of-the-art FL methods, improving accuracy by an average of 3% in highly heterogeneous settings. Additionally, we provide a theoretical proof that FedDW offers higher efficiency, with the additional computational load from backpropagation being negligible. The code is available at https://github.com/liuvvvvv1/FedDW.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
