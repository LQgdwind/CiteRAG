Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: AutoML4ETC: Automated Neural Architecture Search for Real-World Encrypted Traffic Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep learning (DL) has been successfully applied to encrypted network traffic classification in experimental settings. However, in production use, it has been shown that a DL classifier’s performance inevitably decays over time. Re-training the model on newer datasets has been shown to only partially improve its performance. Manually re-tuning the model architecture to meet the performance expectations on newer datasets is time-consuming and requires domain expertise. We propose AutoML4ETC, a novel tool to automatically design efficient and high-performing neural architectures for encrypted traffic classification. We define a novel, powerful search space tailored specifically for the early classification of encrypted traffic using packet header bytes. We show that with different search strategies over our search space, AutoML4ETC generates neural architectures that outperform the state-of-the-art encrypted traffic classifiers on several datasets, including public benchmark datasets and real-world TLS and QUIC traffic collected from the Orange mobile network. In addition to being more accurate, AutoML4ETC’s architectures are significantly more efficient and lighter in terms of the number of parameters. Finally, we make AutoML4ETC publicly available for future research.111Paper has been accepted for publication in IEEE TNSM journal.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
