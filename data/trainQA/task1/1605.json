      "content": "Paper Title: An electronic neuromorphic system for real-time detection of High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs) in intracranial EEG\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The analysis of biomedical signals for clinical studies and therapeutic applications can benefit from compact and portable devices that can process these signals locally, in real-time, without the need for off-line processing. An example is the recording of intracranial EEG (iEEG) during epilepsy surgery with the detection of High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs, 80-500 Hz), which are a biomarker for the epileptogenic zone. Conventional approaches of HFO detection involve the offline analysis of prerecorded data, often on bulky computers. However, clinical applications during surgery or in long-term intracranial recordings demand a self-sufficient embedded device that is battery-powered to avoid interfering with other electronic equipment in the operation room. Mixed-signal and analog-digital neuromorphic circuits offer the possibility of building compact, embedded and low-power neural network processing systems that can analyze data on-line and produce results with short latency in real-time. These characteristics are well suited for clinical applications that involve the processing of biomedical signals at (or very close to) the sensor level. In this work, we present a neuromorphic system that combines for the first time a neural recording headstage with a signal-to-spike conversion circuit and a multi-core spiking neural network (SNN) architecture on the same die for recording, processing, and detecting clinically relevant HFOs in iEEG from epilepsy patients. The device was fabricated using a standard 0.18 Œºùúá\\mum CMOS technology node and has a total area of 99 mm2. We demonstrate its application to HFO detection in the iEEG recorded from 9 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy who subsequently underwent epilepsy surgery. The total average power consumption of the chip during the detection task was 614.3 Œºùúá\\muW. We show how the neuromorphic system can reliably detect HFOs: the system predicts postsurgical seizure outcome with state-of-the-art accuracy, specificity and sensitivity (78%, 100%, and 33% respectively). This is the first feasibility study towards identifying relevant features in intracranial human data in real-time, on-chip, using event-based processors and spiking neural networks. By providing ‚Äúneuromorphic intelligence‚Äù to neural recording circuits the approach proposed will pave the way for the development of systems that can detect HFO areas directly in the operation room and improve the seizure outcome of epilepsy surgery.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
