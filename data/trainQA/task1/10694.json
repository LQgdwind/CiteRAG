Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Neuromorphic Face Analysis: a Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Neuromorphic sensors, also known as event cameras, are a class of imaging devices mimicking the function of biological visual systems. Unlike traditional frame-based cameras, which capture fixed images at discrete intervals, neuromorphic sensors continuously generate events that represent changes in light intensity or motion in the visual field with high temporal resolution and low latency. These properties have proven to be interesting in modeling human faces, both from an effectiveness and a privacy-preserving point of view. Neuromorphic face analysis however is still a raw and unstructured field of research, with several attempts at addressing different tasks with no clear standard or benchmark. This survey paper presents a comprehensive overview of capabilities, challenges and emerging applications in the domain of neuromorphic face analysis, to outline promising directions and open issues. After discussing the fundamental working principles of neuromorphic vision and presenting an in-depth overview of the related research, we explore the current state of available data, standard data representations, emerging challenges, and limitations that require further investigation. This paper aims to highlight the recent process in this evolving field to provide to both experienced and newly come researchers an all-encompassing analysis of the state of the art along with its problems and shortcomings.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 48\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
