      "content": "Paper Title: On Finding Small Hyper-Gradients in Bilevel Optimization: Hardness Results and Improved Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Bilevel optimization reveals the inner structure of otherwise oblique optimization problems, such as hyperparameter tuning, neural architecture search, and meta-learning. A common goal in bilevel optimization is to minimize a hyper-objective that implicitly depends on the solution set of the lower-level function. Although this hyper-objective approach is widely used, its theoretical properties have not been thoroughly investigated in cases where the lower-level functions lack strong convexity. In this work, we first provide hardness results to show that the goal of finding stationary points of the hyper-objective for nonconvex-convex bilevel optimization can be intractable for zero-respecting algorithms. Then we study a class of tractable nonconvex-nonconvex bilevel problems when the lower-level function satisfies the Polyak-≈Åojasiewicz (PL) condition. We show a simple first-order algorithm can achieve better complexity bounds of ùí™~‚Äã(œµ‚àí2)~ùí™superscriptitalic-œµ2\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\epsilon^{-2}), ùí™~‚Äã(œµ‚àí4)~ùí™superscriptitalic-œµ4\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\epsilon^{-4}) and ùí™~‚Äã(œµ‚àí6)~ùí™superscriptitalic-œµ6\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\epsilon^{-6}) in the deterministic, partially stochastic, and fully stochastic setting respectively. The complexities in the first two cases are optimal up to logarithmic factors.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
