      "content": "Paper Title: Geometry-Complete Diffusion for 3D Molecule Generation and Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Motivation: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have recently taken the field of generative modeling by storm, pioneering new state-of-the-art results in disciplines such as computer vision and computational biology for diverse tasks ranging from text-guided image generation to structure-guided protein design. Along this latter line of research, methods have recently been proposed for generating 3D molecules using equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) within a DDPM framework. However, such methods are unable to learn important geometric and physical properties of 3D molecules during molecular graph generation, as they adopt molecule-agnostic and non-geometric GNNs as their 3D graph denoising networks, which negatively impacts their ability to effectively scale to datasets of large 3D molecules. Results: In this work, we address these gaps by introducing the Geometry-Complete Diffusion Model (GCDM) for 3D molecule generation, which outperforms existing 3D molecular diffusion models by significant margins across conditional and unconditional settings for the QM9 dataset as well as for the larger GEOM-Drugs dataset. Importantly, we demonstrate that the geometry-complete denoising process GCDM learns for 3D molecule generation allows the model to generate realistic and stable large molecules at the scale of GEOM-Drugs, whereas previous methods fail to do so with the features they learn. Additionally, we show that extensions of GCDM can not only effectively design 3D molecules for specific protein pockets but also that GCDMâ€™s geometric features can effectively be repurposed to directly optimize the geometry and chemical composition of existing 3D molecules for specific molecular properties, demonstrating new, real-world versatility of molecular diffusion models.
