Such predictions are of significant interest to the process stakeholders. However, most of the state-of-the-art methods for predictive monitoring require the training of complex machine learning models, which is often inefficient. Moreover, most of these methods require a hyper-parameter optimization that requires several repetitions of the training process which is not feasible in many real-life applications. In this paper, we propose an instance selection procedure that allows sampling training process instances for prediction models. We show that our instance selection procedure allows for a significant increase of training speed for next activity and remaining time prediction methods while maintaining reliable levels of prediction accuracy.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
