Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Mesh Total Generalized Variation for Denoising\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recent studies have shown that the Total Generalized Variation (TGV) is highly effective in preserving sharp features as well as smooth transition variations for image processing tasks. However, currently there is no existing work that is suitable for applying TGV to 3D data, in particular, triangular meshes. In this paper, we develop a novel framework for discretizing second-order TGV on triangular meshes. Further, we propose a TGV-based variational method for the denoising of face normal fields on triangular meshes. The TGV regularizer in our method is composed of a first-order term and a second-order term, which are automatically balanced. The first-order term allows our TGV regularizer to locate and preserve sharp features, while the second-order term allows our regularizer to recognize and recover smoothly curved regions. To solve the optimization problem, we introduce an efficient iterative algorithm based on variable-splitting and augmented Lagrangian method. Extensive results and comparisons on synthetic and real scanning data validate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art visually and numerically.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
