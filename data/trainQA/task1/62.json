      "content": "Paper Title: Vector Single-Source Surface Integral Equation for TE Scattering From Cylindrical Multilayered Objects\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A single-source surface integral equation (SS-SIE) for transverse electric (TE) scattering from cylindrical multilayered objects is proposed in this paper. By incorporating the differential surface admittance operator (DSAO) and recursively applying the surface equivalence theorem from innermost to outermost boundaries, an equivalent model with only electric current density on the outermost boundary can be obtained. In addition, an integration approach is proposed, where the small argument expansion of the Hankel function is used to evaluate the singular and nearly singular integrals. Compared with other SIEs, such as the Poggio-Miller-Chang-Harrington-Wu-Tsai (PMCHWT) formulation, the computational expenditure is reduced for multilayered structures because only a single source is needed on the outermost boundary. As shown in the numerical results, the proposed method generates only 19% of unknowns, uses 26% of memory, and requires 29% of the CPU time of the PMCHWT formulation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 54\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
