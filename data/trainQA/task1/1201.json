Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Biologically Plausible Audio-Visual Integration Model for Continual Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The problem of catastrophic forgetting has a history of more than 30 years and has not been completely solved yet. Since the human brain has natural ability to perform continual lifelong learning, learning from the brain may provide solutions to this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel biologically plausible audio-visual integration model (AVIM) based on the assumption that the integration of audio and visual perceptual information in the medial temporal lobe during learning is crucial to form concepts and make continual learning possible. Specifically, we use multi-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley neurons to build the model and adopt the calcium-based synaptic tagging and capture as the model’s learning rule. Furthermore, we define a new continual learning paradigm to simulate the possible continual learning process in the human brain. We then test our model under this new paradigm. Our experimental results show that the proposed AVIM can achieve state-of-the-art continual learning performance compared with other advanced methods such as OWM, iCaRL and GEM. Moreover, it can generate stable representations of objects during learning. These results support our assumption that concept formation is essential for continuous lifelong learning and suggest the proposed AVIM is a possible concept formation mechanism.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
