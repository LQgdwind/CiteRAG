Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: The Evolving Causal Structure of Equity Risk Factors\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. In recent years, multi-factor strategies have gained increasing popularity in the financial industry, as they allow investors to have a better understanding of the risk drivers underlying their portfolios. Moreover, such strategies promise to promote diversification and thus limit losses in times of financial turmoil. However, recent studies have reported a significant level of redundancy between these factors, which might enhance risk contagion among multi-factor portfolios during financial crises. Therefore, it is of fundamental importance to better understand the relationships among factors. Empowered by recent advances in causal structure learning methods, this paper presents a study of the causal structure of financial risk factors and its evolution over time. In particular, the data we analyze covers 111111 risk factors concerning the US equity market, spanning a period of 29 years at daily frequency. Our results show a statistically significant sparsifying trend of the underlying causal structure. However, this trend breaks down during periods of financial stress, in which we can observe a densification of the causal network driven by a growth of the out-degree of the market factor node. Finally, we present a comparison with the analysis of factors cross-correlations, which further confirms the importance of causal analysis for gaining deeper insights in the dynamics of the factor system, particularly during economic downturns. Our findings are especially significant from a risk-management perspective. They link the evolution of the causal structure of equity risk factors with market volatility and a worsening macroeconomic environment, and show that, in times of financial crisis, exposure to different factors boils down to exposure to the market risk factor.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
