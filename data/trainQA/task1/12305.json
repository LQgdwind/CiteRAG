Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Paradigm Shift to Assembly-like Finite Element Model Updating\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In general, there is a mismatch between a finite element model of a structure and its real behaviour. In aeronautics, this mismatch must be small because finite element models are a fundamental part of the development of an aircraft and of increasing importance with the trend to more flexible wings in modern designs. Finite element model updating can be computationally expensive for complex structures and surrogate models can be employed to reduce the computational burden. A novel approach for finite element model updating, namely assembly-like, is proposed and validated using real experimental data. The assembly-like model updating framework implies that the model is updated as parts are assembled. Benchmarking against the classical global, or one-shot, approach demonstrates that the proposed method is more computationally efficient since it takes 20% fewer iterations to obtain convergence, also using fewer parameters for the model evaluations. Despite the increase in computational performance, the new approach retains the fidelity of the global approach.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
