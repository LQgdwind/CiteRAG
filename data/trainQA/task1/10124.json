Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: PAC-Bayes-Chernoff Bounds for Unbounded Losses\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We introduce a new PAC-Bayes oracle bound for unbounded losses. This result can be understood as a PAC-Bayesian version of the Cramér-Chernoff bound. The proof technique relies on controlling the tails of certain random variables involving the Cramér transform of the loss. We highlight several applications of the main theorem. First, we show that our result naturally allows exact optimization of the free parameter on many PAC-Bayes bounds. Second, we recover and generalize previous results. Finally, we show that our approach allows working with richer assumptions that result in more informative and potentially tighter bounds. In this direction, we provide a general bound under a new “model-dependent bounded CGF” assumption from which we obtain bounds based on parameter norms and log-Sobolev inequalities. All these bounds can be minimized to obtain novel posteriors.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
