Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Better Plasticity-Stability Trade-off in Incremental Learning: A Simple Linear Connector\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Plasticity-stability dilemma is a main problem for incremental learning, where plasticity is referring to the ability to learn new knowledge, and stability retains the knowledge of previous tasks. Many methods tackle this problem by storing previous samples, while in some applications, training data from previous tasks cannot be legally stored. In this work, we propose to employ mode connectivity in loss landscapes to achieve better plasticity-stability trade-off without any previous samples. We give an analysis of why and how to connect two independently optimized optima of networks, null-space projection for previous tasks and simple SGD for the current task, can attain a meaningful balance between preserving already learned knowledge and granting sufficient flexibility for learning a new task. This analysis of mode connectivity also provides us a new perspective and technology to control the trade-off between plasticity and stability. We evaluate the proposed method on several benchmark datasets. The results indicate our simple method can achieve notable improvement, and perform well on both the past and current tasks. On 10-split-CIFAR-100 task, our method achieves 79.79% accuracy, which is 6.02% higher. Our method also achieves 6.33% higher accuracy on TinyImageNet. Code is available at https://github.com/lingl1024/Connector.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
