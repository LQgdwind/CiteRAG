Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Spatial-Temporal Federated Learning for Lifelong Person Re-identification on Distributed Edges\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Data drift is a thorny challenge when deploying person re-identification (ReID) models into real-world devices, where the data distribution is significantly different from that of the training environment and keeps changing. To tackle this issue, we propose a federated spatial-temporal incremental learning approach, named FedSTIL, which leverages both lifelong learning and federated learning to continuously optimize models deployed on many distributed edge clients. Unlike previous efforts, FedSTIL aims to mine spatial-temporal correlations among the knowledge learnt from different edge clients. Specifically, the edge clients first periodically extract general representations of drifted data to optimize their local models. Then, the learnt knowledge from edge clients will be aggregated by centralized parameter server, where the knowledge will be selectively and attentively distilled from spatial- and temporal-dimension with carefully designed mechanisms. Finally, the distilled informative spatial-temporal knowledge will be sent back to correlated edge clients to further improve the recognition accuracy of each edge client with a lifelong learning method. Extensive experiments on a mixture of five real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms others by nearly 4% in Rank-1 accuracy, while reducing communication cost by 62%. All implementation codes are publicly available on https://github.com/MSNLAB/Federated-Lifelong-Person-ReID.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
