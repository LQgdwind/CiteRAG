Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Quantum Advantage with Shallow Circuits Under Arbitrary Corruption\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recent works by Bravyi, Gosset and König (Science 2018), Bene Watts et al. (STOC 2019), Coudron, Stark and Vidick (QIP 2019) and Le Gall (CCC 2019) have shown unconditional separations between the computational powers of shallow (i.e., small-depth) quantum and classical circuits: quantum circuits can solve in constant depth computational problems that require logarithmic depth to solve with classical circuits. Using quantum error correction, Bravyi, Gosset, König and Tomamichel (Nature Physics 2020) further proved that a similar separation still persists even if quantum circuits are subject to local stochastic noise. In this paper, we consider the case where any constant fraction of the qubits (for instance, huge blocks of qubits) may be arbitrarily corrupted at the end of the computation. We make a first step forward towards establishing a quantum advantage even in this extremely challenging setting: we show that there exists a computational problem that can be solved in constant depth by a quantum circuit but such that even solving any large subproblem of this problem requires logarithmic depth with bounded fan-in classical circuits. This gives another compelling evidence of the computational power of quantum shallow circuits. In order to show our result, we consider the Graph State Sampling problem (which was also used in prior works) on expander graphs. We exploit the “robustness” of expander graphs against vertex corruption to show that a subproblem hard for small-depth classical circuits can still be extracted from the output of the corrupted quantum circuit.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
