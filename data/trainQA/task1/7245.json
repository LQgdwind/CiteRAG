Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Leveraging Graph-based Cross-modal Information Fusion for Neural Sign Language Translation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Sign Language (SL), as the mother tongue of the deaf community, is a special visual language that most hearing people cannot understand. In recent years, neural Sign Language Translation (SLT), as a possible way for bridging communication gap between the deaf and the hearing people, has attracted widespread academic attention. We found that the current mainstream end-to-end neural SLT models, which tries to learning language knowledge in a weakly supervised manner, could not mine enough semantic information under the condition of low data resources. Therefore, we propose to introduce additional word-level semantic knowledge of sign language linguistics to assist in improving current end-to-end neural SLT models. Concretely, we propose a novel neural SLT model with multi-modal feature fusion based on the dynamic graph, in which the cross-modal information, i.e. text and video, is first assembled as a dynamic graph according to their correlation, and then the graph is processed by a multi-modal graph encoder to generate the multi-modal embeddings for further usage in the subsequent neural translation models. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce graph neural networks, for fusing multi-modal information, into neural sign language translation models. Moreover, we conducted experiments on a publicly available popular SLT dataset RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T. and the quantitative experiments show that our method can improve the model.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
