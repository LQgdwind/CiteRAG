      "content": "Paper Title: A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning and Grey Models\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Artificial Intelligence (AI) has recently shown its capabilities for almost every field of life. Machine Learning, which is a subset of AI, is a ‘hot’ topic for researchers. Machine Learning outperforms other classical forecasting techniques in almost all-natural applications and it is a crucial part of modern research. Many modern Machine Learning methods require a large amount of training data. Due to the small datasets, the researchers may not prefer to use Machine Learning algorithms that require large training data. To tackle this issue, this survey illustrates, and demonstrates related studies for significance of Grey Machine Learning (GML). Which is capable of handling large datasets as well as small datasets for time series forecasting likely outcomes. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of the existing grey models and machine learning forecasting techniques. To allow an in-depth understanding for the readers, a brief description of Machine Learning, as well as various forms of conventional grey forecasting models are discussed. Moreover, a brief description on the importance of GML framework is presented.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 189 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 189\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
