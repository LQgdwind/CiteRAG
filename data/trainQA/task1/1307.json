Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Data Synopses Management based on a Deep Learning Model\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Pervasive computing involves the placement of processing units and services close to end users to support intelligent applications that will facilitate their activities. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the Edge Computing (EC), one can find room for placing services at various points in the interconnection of the aforementioned infrastructures. Of significant importance is the processing of the collected data to provide analytics and knowledge. Such a processing can be realized upon the EC nodes that exhibit increased computational capabilities compared to IoT devices. An ecosystem of intelligent nodes is created at the EC giving the opportunity to support cooperative models towards the provision of the desired analytics. Nodes become the hosts of geo-distributed datasets formulated by the IoT devices reports. Upon the datasets, a number of queries/tasks can be executed either locally or remotely. Queries/tasks can be offloaded for performance reasons to deliver the most appropriate response. However, an offloading action should be carefully designed being always aligned with the data present to the hosting node. In this paper, we present a model to support the cooperative aspect in the EC infrastructure. We argue on the delivery of data synopses distributed in the ecosystem of EC nodes making them capable to take offloading decisions fully aligned with data present at every peer. Nodes exchange their data synopses to inform their peers. We propose a scheme that detects the appropriate time to distribute the calculated synopsis trying to avoid the network overloading especially when synopses are frequently extracted due to the high rates at which IoT devices report data to EC nodes. Our approach involves a Deep Learning model for learning the distribution of calculated synopses and estimate future trends. Upon these trends, we are able to find the appropriate time to deliver synopses to peer nodes. We provide the description of the proposed mechanism and evaluate it based on real datasets. An extensive experimentation upon various scenarios reveals the pros and cons of the approach by giving numerical results.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
