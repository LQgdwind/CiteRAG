      "content": "Paper Title: GNNFormer: A Graph-based Framework for Cytopathology Report Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Cytopathology report generation is a necessary step for the standardized examination of pathology images. However, manually writing detailed reports brings heavy workloads for pathologists. To improve efficiency, some existing works have studied automatic generation of cytopathology reports, mainly by applying image caption generation frameworks with visual encoders originally proposed for natural images. A common weakness of these works is that they do not explicitly model the structural information among cells, which is a key feature of pathology images and provides significant information for making diagnoses. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based framework called GNNFormer, which seamlessly integrates graph neural network (GNN) and Transformer into the same framework, for cytopathology report generation. To the best of our knowledge, GNNFormer is the first report generation method that explicitly models the structural information among cells in pathology images. It also effectively fuses structural information among cells, fine-grained morphology features of cells and background features to generate high-quality reports. Experimental results on the NMI-WSI dataset show that GNNFormer can outperform other state-of-the-art baselines.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
