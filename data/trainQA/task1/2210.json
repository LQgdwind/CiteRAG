Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: LCS Graph Kernel Based on Wasserstein Distance in Longest Common Subsequence Metric Space\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract For graph learning tasks, many existing methods utilize a message-passing mechanism where vertex features are updated iteratively by aggregation of neighbor information. This strategy provides an efficient means for graph features extraction, but obtained features after many iterations might contain too much information from other vertices, and tend to be similar to each other. This makes their representations less expressive. Learning graphs using paths, on the other hand, can be less adversely affected by this problem because it does not involve all vertex neighbors. However, most of them can only compare paths with the same length, which might engender information loss. To resolve this difficulty, we propose a new Graph Kernel based on a Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) similarity. Moreover, we found that the widely-used ‚Ñõ‚Ñõ\\mathcal{R}-convolution framework is unsuitable for path-based Graph Kernel because a huge number of comparisons between dissimilar paths might deteriorate graph distances calculation. Therefore, we propose a novel metric space by exploiting the proposed LCS-based similarity, and compute a new Wasserstein-based graph distance in this metric space, which emphasizes more the comparison between similar paths. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost, we propose an adjacent point merging operation to sparsify point clouds in the metric space. The source code is available at https://github.com/AkiraJM/LCSGK.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
