      "content": "Paper Title: Enhancing Road Safety through Accurate Detection of Hazardous Driving Behaviors with Graph Convolutional Recurrent Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Car accidents remain a significant public safety issue worldwide, with the majority of them attributed to driver errors stemming from inadequate driving knowledge, non-compliance with regulations, and poor driving habits. To improve road safety, Driving Behavior Detection (DBD) systems have been proposed in several studies to identify safe and unsafe driving behavior. Many of these studies have utilized sensor data obtained from the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus to construct their models. However, the use of publicly available sensors is known to reduce the accuracy of detection models, while incorporating vendor-specific sensors into the dataset increases accuracy. To address the limitations of existing approaches, we present a reliable DBD system based on Graph Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (GConvLSTM) that enhances the precision and practicality of DBD models using public sensors. Additionally, we incorporate non-public sensors to evaluate the model’s effectiveness. Our proposed model achieved a high accuracy of 97.5% for public sensors and an average accuracy of 98.1% for non-public sensors, indicating its consistency and accuracy in both settings. To enable local driver behavior analysis, we deployed our DBD system on a Raspberry Pi at the network edge, with drivers able to access daily driving condition reports, sensor data, and prediction results through a monitoring dashboard. Furthermore, the dashboard issues voice warnings to alert drivers of hazardous driving conditions. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed system can effectively detect hazardous and unsafe driving behavior, with potential applications in improving road safety and reducing the number of accidents caused by driver errors.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
