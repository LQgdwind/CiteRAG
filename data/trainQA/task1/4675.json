Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Settling the Horizon-Dependence of Sample Complexity in Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Recently there is a surge of interest in understanding the horizon-dependence of the sample complexity in reinforcement learning (RL). Notably, for an RL environment with horizon length HùêªH, previous work have shown that there is a probably approximately correct (PAC) algorithm that learns an O‚Äã(1)ùëÇ1O(1)-optimal policy using polylog‚Äã(H)polylogùêª\\mathrm{polylog}(H) episodes of environment interactions when the number of states and actions is fixed. It is yet unknown whether the polylog‚Äã(H)polylogùêª\\mathrm{polylog}(H) dependence is necessary or not. In this work, we resolve this question by developing an algorithm that achieves the same PAC guarantee while using only O‚Äã(1)ùëÇ1O(1) episodes of environment interactions, completely settling the horizon-dependence of the sample complexity in RL. We achieve this bound by (i) establishing a connection between value functions in discounted and finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) and (ii) a novel perturbation analysis in MDPs. We believe our new techniques are of independent interest and could be applied in related questions in RL.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
