Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Differentiable Multi-Fidelity Fusion: Efficient Learning of Physics Simulations with Neural Architecture Search and Transfer Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract With rapid progress in deep learning, neural networks have been widely used in scientific research and engineering applications as surrogate models. Despite the great success of neural networks in fitting complex systems, two major challenges still remain: i) the lack of generalization on different problems/datasets, and ii) the demand for large amounts of simulation data that are computationally expensive. To resolve these challenges, we propose the differentiable multi-fidelity (DMF) model, which leverages neural architecture search (NAS) to automatically search the suitable model architecture for different problems, and transfer learning to transfer the learned knowledge from low-fidelity (fast but inaccurate) data to high-fidelity (slow but accurate) model. Novel and latest machine learning techniques such as hyperparameters search and alternate learning are used to improve the efficiency and robustness of DMF. As a result, DMF can efficiently learn the physics simulations with only a few high-fidelity training samples, and outperform the state-of-the-art methods with a significant margin (with up to 58%percent\\% improvement in RMSE) based on a variety of synthetic and practical benchmark problems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
