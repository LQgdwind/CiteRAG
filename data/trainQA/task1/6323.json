Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Generalized Policy Improvement Algorithms with Theoretically Supported Sample Reuse\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Data-driven, learning-based control methods offer the potential to improve operations in complex systems, and model-free deep reinforcement learning represents a popular approach to data-driven control. However, existing classes of algorithms present a trade-off between two important deployment requirements for real-world control: (i) practical performance guarantees and (ii) data efficiency. Off-policy algorithms make efficient use of data through sample reuse but lack theoretical guarantees, while on-policy algorithms guarantee approximate policy improvement throughout training but suffer from high sample complexity. In order to balance these competing goals, we develop a class of Generalized Policy Improvement algorithms that combines the policy improvement guarantees of on-policy methods with the efficiency of sample reuse. We demonstrate the benefits of this new class of algorithms through extensive experimental analysis on a variety of continuous control tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
