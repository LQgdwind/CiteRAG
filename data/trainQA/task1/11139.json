Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Maturity of Vehicle Digital Twins: From Monitoring to Enabling Autonomous Driving\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Digital twinning of vehicles is an iconic application of digital twins, as the concept of twinning dates back to the twinning of NASA space vehicles. Although digital twins (DTs) in the automotive industry have been recognized for their ability to improve efficiency in design and manufacturing, their potential to enhance land vehicle operation has yet to be fully explored. Most existing DT research on vehicle operations, aside from the existing body of work on autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs), focuses on electrified passenger cars. However, the use and value of twinning varies depending on the goal, whether it is to provide cost-efficient and sustainable freight transport without disruptions, sustainable public transport focused on passenger well-being, or fully autonomous vehicle operation. In this context, DTs are used for a range of applications, from real-time battery health monitoring to enabling fully autonomous vehicle operations. This leads to varying requirements, complexities, and maturities of the implemented DT solutions. This paper analyzes recent trends in DT-driven efficiency gains for freight, public, and autonomous vehicles and discusses their required level of maturity based on a maturity tool. The application of our DT maturity tool reveals that most DTs have reached level 3 and enable real-time monitoring. Additionally, DTs of level 5 already exist in closed environments, allowing for restricted autonomous operation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
