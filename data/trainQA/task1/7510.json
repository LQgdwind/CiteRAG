Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Motion Informed Object Detection of Small Insects in Time-lapse Camera Recordings\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Insects as pollinators play a crucial role in ecosystem management and world food production. However, insect populations are declining, calling for efficient methods of insect monitoring. Existing methods analyze video or time-lapse images of insects in nature, but the analysis is challenging since insects are small objects in complex and dynamic scenes of natural vegetation. In this work, we provide a dataset of primary honeybees visiting three different plant species during two months of the summer period. The dataset consists of 107,387 annotated time-lapse images from multiple cameras, including 9,423 annotated insects. We present a method pipeline for detecting insects in time-lapse RGB images. The pipeline consists of a two-step process. Firstly, the time-lapse RGB images are preprocessed to enhance insects in the images. This Motion-Informed-Enhancement technique uses motion and colors to enhance insects in images. Secondly, the enhanced images are subsequently fed into a Convolutional Neural network (CNN) object detector. The method improves the deep learning object detectors You Only Look Once (YOLO) and Faster Region-based CNN (Faster R-CNN). Using Motion-Informed-Enhancement, the YOLO-detector improves the average micro F1-score from 0.49 to 0.71, and the Faster R-CNN-detector improves the average micro F1-score from 0.32 to 0.56 on the dataset. Our dataset and proposed method provide a step forward to automate the time-lapse camera monitoring of flying insects. The dataset is published on: https://vision.eng.au.dk/mie/\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 51\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
