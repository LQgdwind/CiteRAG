Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Algorithmic Challenges in Ensuring Fairness at the Time of Decision\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Algorithmic decision-making in societal contexts such as retail pricing, loan administration, recommendations on online platforms, etc., often involves experimentation with decisions for the sake of learning, which results in perceptions of unfairness amongst people impacted by these decisions. It is hence necessary to embed appropriate notions of fairness in such decision-making processes. The goal of this paper is to highlight the rich interface between temporal notions of fairness and online decision-making through a novel meta-objective of ensuring fairness at the time of decision. Given some arbitrary comparative fairness notion for static decision-making (e.g., students should pay at most 90% of the general adult price), a corresponding online decision-making algorithm satisfies fairness at the time of decision if the said notion of fairness is satisfied for any entity receiving a decision in comparison to all the past decisions. We show that this basic requirement introduces new methodological challenges in online decision-making. We illustrate the novel approaches necessary to address these challenges in the context of stochastic convex optimization with bandit feedback under a comparative fairness constraint that imposes lower bounds on the decisions received by entities depending on the decisions received by everyone in the past. The paper showcases novel research opportunities in online decision-making stemming from temporal fairness concerns.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
