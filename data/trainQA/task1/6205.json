Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Unified Approach for Dynamic Analysis of Tensegrity Structures with Arbitrary Rigid Bodies and Rigid Bars\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper proposes a unified approach for dynamic modeling and simulations of general tensegrity structures with rigid bars and rigid bodies of arbitrary shapes. The natural coordinates are adopted as a non-minimal description in terms of different combinations of basic points and base vectors to resolve the heterogeneity between rigid bodies and rigid bars in three-dimensional space. This leads to a set of differential-algebraic equations with a constant mass matrix and free from trigonometric functions. Formulations for linearized dynamics are derived to enable modal analysis around static equilibrium. For numerical analysis of nonlinear dynamics, we derive a modified symplectic integration scheme which yields realistic results for long-time simulations, and accommodates non-conservative forces as well as boundary conditions. Numerical examples demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach for dynamic simulations of Class-1-to-kùëòk general tensegrity structures under complex situations, including dynamic external loads, cable-based deployments, and moving boundaries. The novel tensegrity structures also exemplify new ways to create multi-functional structures.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
