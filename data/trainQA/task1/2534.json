Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Learnable Non-linear Wavelet Transformation via Normalizing Flow\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Wavelet transformation stands as a cornerstone in modern data analysis and signal processing. Its mathematical essence is an invertible transformation that discerns slow patterns from fast ones in the frequency domain. Such an invertible transformation can be learned by a designed normalizing flow model. With a generalized lifting scheme as coupling layers, a factor-out layer resembling the downsampling, and parameter sharing at different levels of the model, one can train the normalizing flow to filter high-frequency elements at different levels, thus extending traditional linear wavelet transformations to learnable non-linear deep learning models. In this paper, a way of building such flow is proposed, along with a numerical analysis of the learned transformation. Then, we demonstrate the modelâ€™s ability in image lossless compression, show it can achieve SOTA compression scores while achieving a small model size, substantial generalization ability, and the ability to handle high-dimensional data.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
