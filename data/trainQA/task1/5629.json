Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data.

      "content": "Paper Title: On Understanding and Mitigating the Dimensional Collapse of Graph Contrastive Learning: a Non-Maximum Removal Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has shown promising performance in graph representation learning (GRL) without the supervision of manual annotations. GCL can generate graph-level embeddings by maximizing the Mutual Information (MI) between different augmented views of the same graph (positive pairs). However, the GCL is limited by dimensional collapse, i.e., embedding vectors only occupy a low-dimensional subspace. In this paper, we show that the smoothing effect of the permutation-invariant graph pooling and the implicit regularization of the graph convolution are two causes of the dimensional collapse in GCL. To mitigate the above issue, we propose a non-maximum removal graph contrastive learning approach (nmrGCL), which removes “prominent” dimensions (i.e., contribute most in similarity measurement) for positive pair in the pretext task. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmark datasets are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of nmrGCL, and the results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Source code will be made publicly available.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 51\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
