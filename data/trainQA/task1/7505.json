      "content": "Paper Title: Ferroelectric FET based Context-Switching FPGA Enabling Dynamic Reconfiguration for Adaptive Deep Learning Machines\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is widely used in acceleration of deep learning applications because of its reconfigurability, flexibility, and fast time-to-market. However, conventional FPGA suffers from the tradeoff between chip area and reconfiguration latency, making efficient FPGA accelerations that require switching between multiple configurations still elusive. In this paper, we perform technology-circuit-architecture co-design to break this tradeoff with no additional area cost and lower power consumption compared with conventional designs while providing dynamic reconfiguration, which can hide the reconfiguration time behind the execution time. Leveraging the intrinsic transistor structure and non-volatility of ferroelectric FET (FeFET), compact FPGA primitives are proposed and experimentally verified, including 1FeFET look-up table (LUT) cell, 1FeFET routing cell for connection blocks (CBs) and switch boxes (SBs). To support dynamic reconfiguration, two local copies of primitives are placed in parallel, which enables loading of arbitrary configuration without interrupting the active configuration execution. A comprehensive evaluation shows that compared with the SRAM-based FPGA, our dynamic reconfiguration design shows 63.0%/71.1% reduction in LUT/CB area and 82.7%/53.6% reduction in CB/SB power consumption with minimal penalty in the critical path delay (9.6%). We further implement a Super-Sub network model to show the benefit from the context-switching capability of our design. We also evaluate the timing performance of our design over conventional FPGA in various application scenarios. In one scenario that users switch between two preloaded configurations, our design yields significant time saving by 78.7% on average. In the other scenario of implementing multiple configurations with dynamic reconfiguration, our design offers time saving of 20.3% on average.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
