Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

In particular, the blocklength of a linear 333-query LCC with constant distance over any small field grows exponentially with kùëòk. This improves on the best prior lower bound of n‚â•Œ©~‚Äã(k3)ùëõ~Œ©superscriptùëò3n\\geq\\tilde{\\Omega}(k^{3}) [AGKM23], which holds even for the weaker setting of 333-query locally decodable codes (LDCs), and comes close to matching the best-known construction of 333-query LCCs based on binary Reed‚ÄìMuller codes, which achieve n‚â§2O‚Äã(k1/2)ùëõsuperscript2ùëÇsuperscriptùëò12n\\leq 2^{O(k^{1/2})}. Because there is a 333-query LDC with a strictly subexponential blocklength [Yek08, Efr09], as a corollary we obtain the first strong separation between qùëûq-query LCCs and LDCs for any constant q‚â•3ùëû3q\\geq 3. Our proof is based on a new upgrade of the method of spectral refutations via Kikuchi matrices developed in recent works [GKM22, HKM23, AGKM23] that reduces establishing (non-)existence of combinatorial objects to proving unsatisfiability of associated XOR instances. Our key conceptual idea is to apply this method with XOR instances obtained via long-chain derivations ‚Äî a structured variant of low-width resolution for XOR formulas from proof complexity [Gri01, Sch08].
