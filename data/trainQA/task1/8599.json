Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Comparison of SAT-based and ASP-based Algorithms for Inconsistency Measurement (Preprint)\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present algorithms based on satisfiability problem (SAT) solving, as well as answer set programming (ASP), for solving the problem of determining inconsistency degrees in propositional knowledge bases. We consider six different inconsistency measures whose respective decision problems lie on the first level of the polynomial hierarchy. Namely, these are the contension inconsistency measure, the forgetting-based inconsistency measure, the hitting set inconsistency measure, the max-distance inconsistency measure, the sum-distance inconsistency measure, and the hit-distance inconsistency measure. In an extensive experimental analysis, we compare the SAT-based and ASP-based approaches with each other, as well as with a set of naive baseline algorithms. Our results demonstrate that overall, both the SAT-based and the ASP-based approaches clearly outperform the naive baseline methods in terms of runtime. The results further show that the proposed ASP-based approaches perform superior to the SAT-based ones with regard to all six inconsistency measures considered in this work. Moreover, we conduct additional experiments to explain the aforementioned results in greater detail.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
