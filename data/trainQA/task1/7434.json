Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: DGEKT: A Dual Graph Ensemble Learning Method for Knowledge Tracing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Knowledge tracing aims to trace students’ evolving knowledge states by predicting their future performance on concept-related exercises. Recently, some graph-based models have been developed to incorporate the relationships between exercises to improve knowledge tracing, but only a single type of relationship information is generally explored. In this paper, we present a novel Dual Graph Ensemble learning method for Knowledge Tracing (DGEKT), which establishes a dual graph structure of students’ learning interactions to capture the heterogeneous exercise-concept associations and interaction transitions by hypergraph modeling and directed graph modeling, respectively. To ensemble the dual graph models, we introduce the technique of online knowledge distillation, due to the fact that although the knowledge tracing model is expected to predict students’ responses to the exercises related to different concepts, it is optimized merely with respect to the prediction accuracy on a single exercise at each step. With online knowledge distillation, the dual graph models are adaptively combined to form a stronger teacher model, which in turn provides its predictions on all exercises as extra supervision for better modeling ability. In the experiments, we compare DGEKT against eight knowledge tracing baselines on three benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate that DGEKT achieves state-of-the-art performance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
