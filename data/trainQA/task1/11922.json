Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Thermal Finite-Element Model of an Electric Machine Cooled by a Spray This work is funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) – Project-ID 492661287 – TRR 361, the Athene Young Investigator Program of TU Darmstadt, the Graduate School Computational Engineering at TU Darmstadt.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The need for higher power density in electrical machines require better cooling strategies. Spray cooling is a very promising and relatively simple technology to apply, but involves extremely complicated physics. In this paper, a quasi-3D thermal finite-element model of a stator winding is created, by extrusion of a 2D cross-sectional finite-element model along the winding direction. The possible effects of spray cooling are simulated as a heat flux using an impedance boundary condition at the surface of the winding overhang. The results confirm the beneficial performance of spray cooling. The model indicates that spray cooling may allow a ten times larger power density than for standard air- or water-cooled machines.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 52\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
