Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 61 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Truly Supercritical Trade-offs for Resolution, Cutting Planes, Monotone Circuits, and Weisfeiler‚ÄìLeman\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We exhibit supercritical trade-off for monotone circuits, showing that there are functions computable by small circuits for which any circuit must have depth super-linear or even super-polynomial in the number of variables, far exceeding the linear worst-case upper bound. We obtain similar trade-offs in proof complexity, where we establish the first size-depth trade-offs for cutting planes and resolution that are truly supercritical, i.e., in terms of formula size rather than number of variables, and we also show supercritical trade-offs between width and size for treelike resolution. Our results build on a new supercritical width-depth trade-off for resolution, obtained by refining and strengthening the compression scheme for the Cop-Robber game in [Grohe, Lichter, Neuen & Schweitzer 2023]. This yields robust supercritical trade-offs for dimension versus iteration number in the Weisfeiler‚ÄìLeman algorithm, which also translate into trade-offs between number of variables and quantifier depth in first-order logic. Our other results follow from improved lifting theorems that might be of independent interest.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
