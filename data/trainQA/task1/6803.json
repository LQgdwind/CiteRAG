Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Soft Diffusion Score Matching For General Corruptions\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We define a broader family of corruption processes that generalizes previously known diffusion models. To reverse these general diffusions, we propose a new objective called Soft Score Matching that provably learns the score function for any linear corruption process and yields state of the art results for CelebA. Soft Score Matching incorporates the degradation process in the network. Our new loss trains the model to predict a clean image, that after corruption, matches the diffused observation. We show that our objective learns the gradient of the likelihood under suitable regularity conditions for a family of corruption processes. We further develop a principled way to select the corruption levels for general diffusion processes and a novel sampling method that we call Momentum Sampler. We show experimentally that our framework works for general linear corruption processes, such as Gaussian blur and masking. We achieve state-of-the-art FID score 1.851.851.85 on CelebA-64, outperforming all previous linear diffusion models. We also show significant computational benefits compared to vanilla denoising diffusion.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
