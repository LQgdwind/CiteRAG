      "content": "Paper Title: BATFormer: Towards Boundary-Aware Lightweight Transformer for Efficient Medical Image Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Objective: Transformers, born to remedy the inadequate receptive fields of CNNs, have drawn explosive attention recently. However, the daunting computational complexity of global representation learning, together with rigid window partitioning, hinders their deployment in medical image segmentation. This work aims to address the above two issues in transformers for better medical image segmentation. Methods: We propose a boundary-aware lightweight transformer (BATFormer) that can build cross-scale global interaction with lower computational complexity and generate windows flexibly under the guidance of entropy. Specifically, to fully explore the benefits of transformers in long-range dependency establishment, a cross-scale global transformer (CGT) module is introduced to jointly utilize multiple small-scale feature maps for richer global features with lower computational complexity. Given the importance of shape modeling in medical image segmentation, a boundary-aware local transformer (BLT) module is constructed. Different from rigid window partitioning in vanilla transformers which would produce boundary distortion, BLT adopts an adaptive window partitioning scheme under the guidance of entropy for both computational complexity reduction and shape preservation. Results: BATFormer achieves the best performance in Dice of 92.84%percent\\%, 91.97%percent\\%, 90.26%percent\\%, and 96.30%percent\\% for the average, right ventricle, myocardium, and left ventricle respectively on the ACDC dataset and the best performance in Dice, IoU, and ACC of 90.76%percent\\%, 84.64%percent\\%, and 96.76%percent\\% respectively on the ISIC 2018 dataset. More importantly, BATFormer requires the least amount of model parameters and the lowest computational complexity compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. Conclusion and Significance: Our results demonstrate the necessity of developing customized transformers for efficient and better medical image segmentation. We believe the design of BATFormer is inspiring and extendable to other applications/frameworks.
