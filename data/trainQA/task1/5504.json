      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Sub-Quadratic Diameter Computation in Geometric Intersection Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We initiate the study of diameter computation in geometric intersection graphs from the fine-grained complexity perspective. A geometric intersection graph is a graph whose vertices correspond to some shapes in dùëëd-dimensional Euclidean space, such as balls, segments, or hypercubes, and whose edges correspond to pairs of intersecting shapes. The diameter of a graph is the largest distance realized by a pair of vertices in the graph. Computing the diameter in near-quadratic time is possible in several classes of intersection graphs [Chan and Skrepetos 2019], but it is not at all clear if these algorithms are optimal, especially since in the related class of planar graphs the diameter can be computed in ùí™~‚Äã(n5/3)~ùí™superscriptùëõ53\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^{5/3}) time [Cabello 2019, Gawrychowski et al. 2021]. In this work we (conditionally) rule out sub-quadratic algorithms in several classes of intersection graphs, i.e., algorithms of running time ùí™‚Äã(n2‚àíŒ¥)ùí™superscriptùëõ2ùõø\\mathcal{O}(n^{2-\\delta}) for some Œ¥>0ùõø0\\delta>0. In particular, there are no sub-quadratic algorithms already for fat objects in small dimensions: unit balls in ‚Ñù3superscript‚Ñù3\\mathbb{R}^{3} or congruent equilateral triangles in ‚Ñù2superscript‚Ñù2\\mathbb{R}^{2}. For unit segments and congruent equilateral triangles, we can even rule out strong sub-quadratic approximations already in ‚Ñù2superscript‚Ñù2\\mathbb{R}^{2}. It seems that the hardness of approximation may also depend on dimensionality: for axis-parallel unit hypercubes in ‚Ñù12superscript‚Ñù12\\mathbb{R}^{12}, distinguishing between diameter 2 and 3 needs quadratic time (ruling out (3/2‚àíŒµ)32ùúÄ(3/2-\\varepsilon)- approximations), whereas for axis-parallel unit squares, we give an algorithm that distinguishes between diameter 222 and 333 in near-linear time. Note that many of our lower bounds match the best known algorithms up to sub-polynomial factors. Ultimately, this fine-grained perspective may enable us to determine for which shapes we can have efficient algorithms and approximation schemes for diameter computation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
