Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Attention-based Reinforcement Learning for Combinatorial Optimization: Application to Job Shop Scheduling Problem\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Job shop scheduling problems are one of the most important and challenging combinatorial optimization problems that have been tackled mainly by exact or approximate solution approaches. However, finding an exact solution can be infeasible for real-world problems, and even with an approximate solution approach, it can require a prohibitive amount of time to find a near-optimal solution, and the found solutions are not applicable to new problems in general. To address these challenges, we propose an attention-based reinforcement learning method for the class of job shop scheduling problems by integrating a policy gradient reinforcement learning with a modified transformer architecture. An important result is that our trained learners in the proposed method can be reused to solve large-scale problems not used in training and demonstrate that our approach outperforms the results in recent studies and widely adopted heuristic rules.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
