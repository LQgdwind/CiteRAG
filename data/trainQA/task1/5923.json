Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Affective Medical Estimation and Decision Making via Visualized Learning and Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract With the advent of sophisticated machine learning (ML) techniques and the promising results they yield, especially in medical applications, where they have been investigated for different tasks to enhance the decision-making process. Since visualization is such an effective tool for human comprehension, memorization, and judgment, we have presented a first-of-its-kind estimation approach we refer to as Visualized Learning for Machine Learning (VL4ML) that not only can serve to assist physicians and clinicians in making reasoned medical decisions, but it also allows to appreciate the uncertainty visualization, which could raise incertitude in making the appropriate classification or prediction. For the proof of concept, and to demonstrate the generalized nature of this visualized estimation approach, five different case studies are examined for different types of tasks including classification, regression, and longitudinal prediction. A survey analysis with more than 100 individuals is also conducted to assess users’ feedback on this visualized estimation method. The experiments and the survey demonstrate the practical merits of the VL4ML that include: (1) appreciating visually clinical/medical estimations; (2) getting closer to the patients’ preferences; (3) improving doctor-patient communication, and (4) visualizing the uncertainty introduced through the black box effect of the deployed ML algorithm. All the source codes are shared via a GitHub repository.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 55\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
