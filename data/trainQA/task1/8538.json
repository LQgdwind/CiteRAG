Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: BERT Based Clinical Knowledge Extraction for Biomedical Knowledge Graph Construction and Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Background : Knowledge is evolving over time, often as a result of new discoveries or changes in the adopted methods of reasoning. Also, new facts or evidence may become available, leading to new understandings of complex phenomena. This is particularly true in the biomedical field, where scientists and physicians are constantly striving to find new methods of diagnosis, treatment and eventually cure. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a real way of organizing and retrieving the massive and growing amount of biomedical knowledge. Objective : We propose an end-to-end approach for knowledge extraction and analysis from biomedical clinical notes using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model and Conditional Random Field (CRF) layer. Methods : The approach is based on knowledge graphs, which can effectively process abstract biomedical concepts such as relationships and interactions between medical entities. Besides offering an intuitive way to visualize these concepts, KGs can solve more complex knowledge retrieval problems by simplifying them into simpler representations or by transforming the problems into representations from different perspectives. We created a biomedical Knowledge Graph using using Natural Language Processing models for named entity recognition and relation extraction. The generated biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) are then used for question answering. Results : The proposed framework can successfully extract relevant structured information with high accuracy (90.7% for Named-entity recognition (NER), 88% for relation extraction (RE)), according to experimental findings based on real-world 505 patient biomedical unstructured clinical notes. Conclusions : In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end system for the construction of a biomedical knowledge graph from clinical textual using a variation of BERT models.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
