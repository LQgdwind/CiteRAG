Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Key Feature Replacement of In-Distribution Samples for Out-of-Distribution Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection can be used in deep learning-based applications to reject outlier samples from being unreliably classified by deep neural networks. Learning to classify between OOD and in-distribution samples is difficult because data comprising the former is extremely diverse. It has been observed that an auxiliary OOD dataset is most effective in training a “rejection” network when its samples are semantically similar to in-distribution images. We first deduce that OOD images are perceived by a deep neural network to be semantically similar to in-distribution samples when they share a common background, as deep networks are observed to incorrectly classify such images with high confidence. We then propose a simple yet effective Key In-distribution feature Replacement BY inpainting (KIRBY) procedure that constructs a surrogate OOD dataset by replacing class-discriminative features of in-distribution samples with marginal background features. The procedure can be implemented using off-the-shelf vision algorithms, where each step within the algorithm is shown to make the surrogate data increasingly similar to in-distribution data. Design choices in each step are studied extensively, and an exhaustive comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrates KIRBY’s competitiveness on various benchmarks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
