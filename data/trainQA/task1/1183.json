Intuitively, we ‚Äúchop off‚Äù parts near local minima and maxima during the course of smoothing, where the amount cut is controlled by a parameter œÑùúè\\tau. After formalizing truncation as a functor, we show that when applied after the smoothing functor, this prevents extensive expansion of the range of the function, and yields particularly nice properties (such as maintaining connectivity) when combined with smoothing for 0‚â§œÑ‚â§2‚ÄãŒµ0ùúè2ùúÄ0\\leq\\tau\\leq 2\\varepsilon, where ŒµùúÄ\\varepsilon is the smoothing parameter. Then, for the restriction of œÑ‚àà[0,Œµ]ùúè0ùúÄ\\tau\\in[0,\\varepsilon], we have additional structure which we can take advantage of to construct a categorical flow for any choice of slope m‚àà[0,1]ùëö01m\\in[0,1]. Using the infrastructure built for a category with a flow, this then gives an interleaving distance for every m‚àà[0,1]ùëö01m\\in[0,1], which is a generalization of the original interleaving distance, which is the case m=0ùëö0m=0. While the resulting metrics are not stable, we show that any pair of these for m,m‚Ä≤‚àà[0,1)ùëösuperscriptùëö‚Ä≤01m,m^{\\prime}\\in[0,1) are strongly equivalent metrics, which in turn gives stability of each metric up to a multiplicative constant. We conclude by discussing implications of this metric within the broader family of metrics for Reeb graphs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
