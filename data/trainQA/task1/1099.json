Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Deep image prior for 3D magnetic particle imaging: A quantitative comparison of regularization techniques on Open MPI dataset\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is an imaging modality exploiting the nonlinear magnetization behavior of (super-)paramagnetic nanoparticles to obtain a space- and often also time-dependent concentration of a tracer consisting of these nanoparticles. MPI has a continuously increasing number of potential medical applications. One prerequisite for successful performance in these applications is a proper solution to the image reconstruction problem. More classical methods from inverse problems theory, as well as novel approaches from the field of machine learning, have the potential to deliver high-quality reconstructions in MPI. We investigate a novel reconstruction approach based on a deep image prior, which builds on representing the solution by a deep neural network. Novel approaches, as well as variational and iterative regularization techniques, are compared quantitatively in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratios and structural similarity indices on the publicly available Open MPI dataset.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
