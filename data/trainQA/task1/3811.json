Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamical System Parameter Identification using Deep Recurrent Cell Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we investigate the parameter identification problem in dynamical systems through a deep learning approach. Focusing mainly on second-order, linear time-invariant dynamical systems, the topic of damping factor identification is studied. By utilizing a six-layer deep neural network with different recurrent cells, namely GRUs, LSTMs or BiLSTMs; and by feeding input/output sequence pairs captured from a dynamical system simulator, we search for an effective deep recurrent architecture in order to resolve damping factor identification problem. Our study’s results show that, although previously not utilized for this task in the literature, bidirectional gated recurrent cells (BiLSTMs) provide better parameter identification results when compared to unidirectional gated recurrent memory cells such as GRUs and LSTM. Thus, indicating that an input/output sequence pair of finite length, collected from a dynamical system and when observed anachronistically, may carry information in both time directions for prediction of a dynamical systems parameter.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
