Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: CT Multi-Task Learning with a Large Image-Text (LIT) Model\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Large language models (LLM) not only empower multiple language tasks but also serve as a general interface across different spaces. Up to now, it has not been demonstrated yet how to effectively translate the successes of LLMs in the computer vision field to the medical imaging field which involves high-dimensional and multi-modal medical images. In this paper, we report a feasibility study of building a multi-task CT large image-text (LIT) model for lung cancer diagnosis by combining an LLM and a large image model (LIM). Specifically, the LLM and LIM are used as encoders to perceive multi-modal information under task-specific text prompts, which synergizes multi-source information and task-specific and patient-specific priors for optimized diagnostic performance. The key components of our LIT model and associated techniques are evaluated with an emphasis on 3D lung CT analysis. Our initial results show that the LIT model performs multiple medical tasks well, including lung segmentation, lung nodule detection, and lung cancer classification. Active efforts are in progress to develop large image-language models for superior medical imaging in diverse applications and optimal patient outcomes.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
