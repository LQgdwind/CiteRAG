Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The recently proposed identifiable variational autoencoder (iVAE) framework provides a promising approach for learning latent independent components (ICs). iVAEs use auxiliary covariates to build an identifiable generation structure from covariates to ICs to observations, and the posterior network approximates ICs given observations and covariates. Though the identifiability is appealing, we show that iVAEs could have local minimum solution where observations and the approximated ICs are independent given covariates. – a phenomenon we referred to as the posterior collapse problem of iVAEs. To overcome this problem, we develop a new approach, covariate-informed iVAE (CI-iVAE) by considering a mixture of encoder and posterior distributions in the objective function. In doing so, the objective function prevents the posterior collapse, resulting latent representations that contain more information of the observations. Furthermore, CI-iVAEs extend the original iVAE objective function to a larger class and finds the optimal one among them, thus having tighter evidence lower bounds than the original iVAE. Experiments on simulation datasets, EMNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and a large-scale brain imaging dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our new method.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
