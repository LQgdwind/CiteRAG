Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Architecture and Performance Evaluation of Distributed Computation Offloading in Edge Computing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Edge computing has been proposed to cope with the challenging requirements of future applications, like mobile augmented reality, since it shortens significantly the distance, hence the latency, between the end users and the processing servers. On the other hand, serverless computing is emerging among cloud technologies to respond to the need of highly scalable event-driven execution of stateless tasks. In this paper, we first investigate the convergence of the two to enable very low-latency execution of short-lived stateless tasks, whose computation is offloaded from the user terminal to servers hosted by or close to edge devices. We tackle in particular the research challenge of selecting the best executor, based on real-time measurements and simple, yet effective, prediction algorithms. Second, we propose a performance evaluation framework specifically designed for an accurate assessment of algorithms and protocols in edge computing environments, where the nodes may have very heterogeneous networking and processing capabilities. The proposed framework relies on the use of real components on lightweight virtualization mixed with simulated computation and is well-suited to the analysis of several applications and network environments. Using our framework, we evaluate our proposed architecture and algorithms in small- and large-scale edge computing scenarios, showing that our solution achieves similar or better delay performance than a centralized solution, with far less network utilization.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
