      "content": "Paper Title: Length Scale Control in Topology Optimization using Fourier Enhanced Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Length scale control is imposed in topology optimization (TO) to make designs amenable to manufacturing and other functional requirements. Broadly, there are two types of length-scale control in TO: exact and approximate. While the former is desirable, its implementation can be difficult, and is computationally expensive. Approximate length scale control is therefore preferred, and is often sufficient for early stages of design. In this paper we propose an approximate length scale control strategy for TO, by extending a recently proposed density-based TO formulation using neural networks (TOuNN). Specifically, we enhance TOuNN with a Fourier space projection, to control the minimum and/or maximum length scales. The proposed method does not involve additional constraints, and the sensitivity computations are automated by expressing the computations in an end-end differentiable fashion using the neural net’s library. The proposed method is illustrated through several numerical experiments for single and multi-material designs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
