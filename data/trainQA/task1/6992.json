      "content": "Paper Title: Synergistic information supports modality integration and flexible learning in neural networks solving multiple tasks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Striking progress has recently been made in understanding human cognition by analyzing how its neuronal underpinnings are engaged in different modes of information processing. Specifically, neural information can be decomposed into synergistic, redundant, and unique features, with synergistic components being particularly aligned with complex cognition. However, two fundamental questions remain unanswered: (a) precisely how and why a cognitive system can become highly synergistic; and (b) how these informational states map onto artificial neural networks in various learning modes. To address these questions, here we employ an information-decomposition framework to investigate the information processing strategies adopted by simple artificial neural networks performing a variety of cognitive tasks in both supervised and reinforcement learning settings. Our results show that synergy increases as neural networks learn multiple diverse tasks. Furthermore, performance in tasks requiring integration of multiple information sources critically relies on synergistic neurons. Finally, randomly turning off neurons during training through dropout increases network redundancy, corresponding to an increase in robustness. Overall, our results suggest that while redundant information is required for robustness to perturbations in the learning process, synergistic information is used to combine information from multiple modalities — and more generally for flexible and efficient learning. These findings open the door to new ways of investigating how and why learning systems employ specific information-processing strategies, and support the principle that the capacity for general-purpose learning critically relies in the system’s information dynamics.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
