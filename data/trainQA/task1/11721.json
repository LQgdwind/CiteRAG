      "content": "Paper Title: Hardware-Friendly Implementation of Physical Reservoir Computing with CMOS-based Time-domain Analog Spiking Neurons\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper introduces an analog spiking neuron that utilizes a time-domain information, i.e., a time interval of two signal transitions and a pulse width, to construct a spiking neural network (SNN) for a hardware friendly physical reservoir computing (RC) on a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) platform. A neuron with leaky integrate-and-fire is realized by employing two voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) with opposite sensitivities to the internal control voltage, and the neuron connection structure is restricted by use of only 4 neighboring neurons on the 2-dimensional plane to feasibly construct a regular network topology. Such a system enables us to compose a SNN with a counter-based readout circuit, which simplifies the hardware implementation of the SNN. Moreover, another technical advantage thanks to the bottom-up integration is the capability of dynamically capturing every neuron state in the network, which can significantly contribute to finding guidelines on how to enhance the performance for various computational tasks in temporal information processing. Diverse nonlinear physical dynamics needed for RC can be realized by collective behavior through dynamic interaction between neurons, like coupled oscillators, despite the simple network structure. With behavioral system-level simulations, we demonstrate physical RC through short-term memory and exclusive OR tasks, and the spoken digit recognition task with an accuracy of 97.7 % as well. Our system is considerably feasible for practical applications and also can be a useful platform to study the mechanism of physical RC.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
