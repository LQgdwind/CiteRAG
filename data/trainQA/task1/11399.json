Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: DRAK: Unlocking Molecular Insights with Domain-Specific Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge in LLMs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter challenges with the unique syntax of specific domains, such as biomolecules. Existing fine-tuning or modality alignment techniques struggle to bridge the domain knowledge gap and understand complex molecular data, limiting LLMs’ progress in specialized fields. To overcome these limitations, we propose an expandable and adaptable non-parametric knowledge injection framework named Domain-specific Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge (DRAK), aimed at enhancing reasoning capabilities in specific domains. Utilizing knowledge-aware prompts and gold label-induced reasoning, DRAK has developed profound expertise in the molecular domain and the capability to handle a broad spectrum of analysis tasks. We evaluated two distinct forms of DRAK variants, proving that DRAK exceeds previous benchmarks on six molecular tasks within the Mol-Instructions dataset. Extensive experiments have underscored DRAK’s formidable performance and its potential to unlock molecular insights, offering a unified paradigm for LLMs to tackle knowledge-intensive tasks in specific domains. Our code will be available soon.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 48\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
