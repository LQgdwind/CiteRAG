Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

When a topology of a distributed system is known an important task is then to map the blocks of the partition onto the processors such that the overall communication cost is reduced. We present novel multilevel algorithms that integrate graph partitioning and process mapping. Important ingredients of our algorithm include fast label propagation, more localized local search, initial partitioning, as well as a compressed data structure to compute processor distances without storing a distance matrix. Experiments indicate that our algorithms speed up the overall mapping process and, due to the integrated multilevel approach, also find much better solutions in practice. For example, one configuration of our algorithm yields better solutions than the previous state-of-the-art in terms of mapping quality while being a factor 62 faster. Compared to the currently fastest iterated multilevel mapping algorithm Scotch, we obtain 16% better solutions while investing slightly more running time.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
