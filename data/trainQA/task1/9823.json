      "content": "Paper Title: In-class Data Analysis Replications: Teaching Students while Testing Science\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Science is facing a reproducibility crisis. Overcoming it would require concerted efforts to replicate prior studies, but the incentives for researchers are currently weak, as replicating prior studies requires considerable time and effort without providing the same level of recognition as de novo research. Previous work has proposed incorporating data analysis replications into classrooms as a potential solution. However, despite the potential benefits, it is unclear whether this approach is feasible, and if so, what the involved stakeholders‚Äîstudents, educators, and scientists‚Äîshould expect from it. Can students perform a data analysis replication over the course of a class, and if so, what are the benefits for them? What are the costs and benefits for educators? And how can this solution help benchmark and improve the state of science? In the present study, we incorporated data analysis replications in the project component of the Applied Data Analysis course (CS-401) taught at EPFL (N=354ùëÅ354N=354 students). Here we report pre-registered findings based on surveys administered throughout the course. First, we demonstrate that students can replicate previously published scientific papers, most of them qualitatively and some exactly. A small fraction of replications failed, and in cases where there were known issues with papers, students correctly identified them. We find discrepancies between what students expect of data analysis replications and what they experience by doing them along with changes in expectations about reproducibility, which together serve as evidence of attitude shifts to foster students‚Äô critical thinking. Second, we provide information for educators about how much overhead is needed to incorporate replications into the classroom and identify concerns that replications bring as compared to more traditional assignments. Third, we identify tangible benefits of the in-class data analysis replications for scientific communities, such as a collection of replication reports and insights about replication barriers in scientific work that should be avoided going forward, including insufficiently described methods and datasets. Overall, we demonstrate that incorporating replication tasks into a large data science class can increase the reproducibility of scientific work as a by-product of data science instruction, thus benefiting both science and students.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
