Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Scalable In Situ Lagrangian Flow Map Extraction: Demonstrating the Viability of a Communication-Free Model\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We introduce and evaluate a new algorithm for the in situ extraction of Lagrangian flow maps, which we call Boundary Termination Optimization (BTO). Our approach is a communication-free model, requiring no message passing or synchronization between processes, improving scalability, thereby reducing overall execution time and alleviating the encumbrance placed on simulation codes from in situ processing. We terminate particle integration at node boundaries and store only a subset of the flow map that would have been extracted by communicating particles across nodes, thus introducing an accuracy-performance tradeoff. We run experiments with as many as 2048 GPUs and with multiple simulation data sets. For the experiment configurations we consider, our findings demonstrate that our communication-free technique saves as much as 2x to 4x in execution time in situ, while staying nearly as accurate quantitatively and qualitatively as previous work. Most significantly, this study establishes the viability of approaching in situ Lagrangian flow map extraction using communication-free models in the future.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
