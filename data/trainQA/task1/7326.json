      "content": "Paper Title: A Closer Cut: Computing Near-Optimal Lawn Mowing Tours\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract For a given polygonal region PùëÉP, the Lawn Mowing Problem (LMP) asks for a shortest tour TùëáT that gets within Euclidean distance 1 of every point in PùëÉP; this is equivalent to computing a shortest tour for a unit-disk cutter Cùê∂C that covers all of PùëÉP. As a geometric optimization problem of natural practical and theoretical importance, the LMP generalizes and combines several notoriously difficult problems, including minimum covering by disks, the Traveling Salesman Problem with neighborhoods (TSPN), and the ‚àÉ‚Ñù‚Ñù\\exists\\mathbb{R}-complete Art Gallery Problem (AGP). So far, there have only been theoretical approximation algorithms with worst-case bounds of 2‚Äã3‚ÄãŒ±TSP‚âà3.46‚ÄãŒ±TSP23subscriptùõºTSP3.46subscriptùõºTSP2\\sqrt{3}\\alpha_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize{TSP}}}\\approx 3.46\\alpha_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize{TSP}}}, where Œ±TSPsubscriptùõºTSP\\alpha_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize{TSP}}} is the approximation factor for the geometric TSP. Here, Œ±TSP=1+ŒµsubscriptùõºTSP1ùúÄ\\alpha_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize{TSP}}}=1+\\varepsilon is theoretically possible by using one of the famous geometric approximation schemes; however, these methods are not practically applicable for concrete instances. Moreover, there have not been any exact methods for the LMP that compute provably near-optimal solutions for instances of interesting size, owing to the combination of geometric difficulties, such as a succinct characterization of optimal solutions, as well as the lack of useful lower bounds that provide practically small performance gaps. In this paper, we conduct the first study of the Lawn Mowing Problem with a focus on practical computation of near-optimal solutions. To this end, we provide new theoretical insights: Optimal solutions are polygonal paths with a bounded number of vertices, i.e., they do not have any curved pieces, allowing a restriction to straight-line solutions; on the other hand, there can be relatively simple instances for which optimal solutions require a large class of irrational coordinates. On the practical side, we present a primal-dual approach with provable convergence properties based on solving a special case of the TSPN restricted to witness sets. In each iteration, this establishes both a valid solution and a valid lower bound, and thereby a bound on the remaining optimality gap. As we demonstrate in an extensive computational study, this allows us to achieve provably optimal and near-optimal solutions for a large spectrum of benchmark instances with up to 200020002000 vertices.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
