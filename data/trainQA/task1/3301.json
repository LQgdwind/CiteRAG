Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Importance Weighted Adversarial Discriminative Transfer for Anomaly Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Previous transfer methods for anomaly detection generally assume the availability of labeled data in source or target domains. However, such an assumption is not valid in most real applications where large-scale labeled data are too expensive. Therefore, this paper proposes an importance weighted adversarial autoencoder-based method to transfer anomaly detection knowledge in an unsupervised manner, particularly for a rarely studied scenario where a target domain has no labeled normal/abnormal data while only normal data from a related source domain exist. Specifically, the method learns to align the distributions of normal data in both source and target domains, but leave the distribution of abnormal data in the target domain unchanged. In this way, an obvious gap can be produced between the distributions of normal and abnormal data in the target domain, therefore enabling the anomaly detection in the domain. Extensive experiments on digit image datasets and the UCSD benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
