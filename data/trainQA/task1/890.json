      "content": "Paper Title: Asymmetric Leaky Private Information Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Information-theoretic formulations of the private information retrieval (PIR) problem have been investigated under a variety of scenarios. Symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) is a variant where a user is able to privately retrieve one out of K𝐾K messages from N𝑁N non-colluding replicated databases without learning anything about the remaining K−1𝐾1K-1 messages. However, the goal of perfect privacy can be too taxing for certain applications. In this paper, we investigate if the information-theoretic capacity of SPIR (equivalently, the inverse of the minimum download cost) can be increased by relaxing both user and DB privacy definitions. Such relaxation is relevant in applications where privacy can be traded for communication efficiency. We introduce and investigate the Asymmetric Leaky PIR (AL-PIR) model with different privacy leakage budgets in each direction. For user privacy leakage, we bound the probability ratios between all possible realizations of DB queries by a function of a non-negative constant ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon. For DB privacy, we bound the mutual information between the undesired messages, the queries, and the answers, by a function of a non-negative constant δ𝛿\\delta. We propose a general AL-PIR scheme that achieves an upper bound on the optimal download cost for arbitrary ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon and δ𝛿\\delta. We show that the optimal download cost of AL-PIR is upper-bounded as D∗​(ϵ,δ)≤1+1N−1−δ​eϵNK−1−1superscript𝐷italic-ϵ𝛿11𝑁1𝛿superscript𝑒italic-ϵsuperscript𝑁𝐾11D^{*}(\\epsilon,\\delta)\\leq 1+\\frac{1}{N-1}-\\frac{\\delta e^{\\epsilon}}{N^{K-1}-1}. Second, we obtain an information-theoretic lower bound on the download cost as D∗​(ϵ,δ)≥1+1N​eϵ−1−δ(N​eϵ)K−1−1superscript𝐷italic-ϵ𝛿11𝑁superscript𝑒italic-ϵ1𝛿superscript𝑁superscript𝑒italic-ϵ𝐾11D^{*}(\\epsilon,\\delta)\\geq 1+\\frac{1}{Ne^{\\epsilon}-1}-\\frac{\\delta}{(Ne^{\\epsilon})^{K-1}-1}. The gap analysis between the two bounds shows that our AL-PIR scheme is optimal when ϵ=0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon=0, i.e., under perfect user privacy and it is optimal within a maximum multiplicative gap of N−e−ϵN−1𝑁superscript𝑒italic-ϵ𝑁1\\frac{N-e^{-\\epsilon}}{N-1} for any ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0 and δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
