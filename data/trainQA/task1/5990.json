Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data.

      "content": "Paper Title: FedILC: Weighted Geometric Mean and Invariant Gradient Covariance for Federated Learning on Non-IID Data\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Federated learning is a distributed machine learning approach which enables a shared server model to learn by aggregating the locally-computed parameter updates with the training data from spatially-distributed client silos. Though successfully possessing advantages in both scale and privacy, federated learning is hurt by domain shift problems, where the learning models are unable to generalize to unseen domains whose data distribution is non-i.i.d. with respect to the training domains. In this study, we propose the Federated Invariant Learning Consistency (FedILC) approach, which leverages the gradient covariance and the geometric mean of Hessians to capture both inter-silo and intra-silo consistencies of environments and unravel the domain shift problems in federated networks. The benchmark and real-world dataset experiments bring evidence that our proposed algorithm outperforms conventional baselines and similar federated learning algorithms. This is relevant to various fields such as medical healthcare, computer vision, and the Internet of Things (IoT). The code is released at https://github.com/mikemikezhu/FedILC.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 47\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
