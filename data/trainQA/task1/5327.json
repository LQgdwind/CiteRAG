Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Non-Linear Spectral Dimensionality Reduction Under Uncertainty\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we consider the problem of non-linear dimensionality reduction under uncertainty, both from a theoretical and algorithmic perspectives. Since real-world data usually contain measurements with uncertainties and artifacts, the input space in the proposed framework consists of probability distributions to model the uncertainties associated with each sample. We propose a new dimensionality reduction framework, called Non-linear Graph Embedding with Data Uncertainty (NGEU), which leverages uncertainty information and directly extends several traditional approaches, e.g., KPCA, MDA/KMFA, to receive as inputs the probability distributions instead of the original data. We show that the proposed NGEU formulation exhibits a global closed-form solution, and we analyze, based on the Rademacher complexity, how the underlying uncertainties theoretically affect the generalization ability of the framework. Empirical results on different datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
