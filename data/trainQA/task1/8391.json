Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: The communication complexity of functions with large outputs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study the two-party communication complexity of functions with large outputs, and show that the communication complexity can greatly vary depending on what output model is considered. We study a variety of output models, ranging from the open model, in which an external observer can compute the outcome, to the XOR model, in which the outcome of the protocol should be the bitwise XOR of the players‚Äô local outputs. This model is inspired by XOR games, which are widely studied two-player quantum games. We focus on the question of error-reduction in these new output models. For functions of output size kùëòk, applying standard error reduction techniques in the XOR model would introduce an additional cost linear in kùëòk. We show that no dependency on kùëòk is necessary. Similarly, standard randomness removal techniques, incur a multiplicative cost of 2ksuperscript2ùëò2^{k} in the XOR model. We show how to reduce this factor to O‚Äã(k)ùëÇùëòO(k). In addition, we prove analogous error reduction and randomness removal results in the other models, separate all models from each other, and show that some natural problems ‚Äì including Set Intersection and Find the First Difference ‚Äì separate the models when the Hamming weights of their inputs is bounded. Finally, we show how to use the rank lower bound technique for our weak output models.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
