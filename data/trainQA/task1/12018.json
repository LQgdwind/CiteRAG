Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Backdoor Mitigation by Distance-Driven Detoxification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Backdoor attacks undermine the integrity of machine learning models by allowing attackers to manipulate predictions using poisoned training data. Such attacks lead to targeted misclassification when specific triggers are present, while the model behaves normally under other conditions. This paper considers a post-training backdoor defense task, aiming to detoxify the backdoors in pre-trained models. We begin by analyzing the underlying issues of vanilla fine-tuning and observe that it is often trapped in regions with low loss for both clean and poisoned samples. Motivated by such observations, we propose Distance-Driven Detoxification (D3), an innovative approach that reformulates backdoor defense as a constrained optimization problem. Specifically, D3 promotes the model’s departure from the vicinity of its initial weights, effectively reducing the influence of backdoors. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art (SOTA) backdoor attacks across various model architectures and datasets demonstrate that D3 not only matches but often surpasses the performance of existing SOTA post-training defense techniques.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
