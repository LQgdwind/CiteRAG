      "content": "Paper Title: Quantum statistical query learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We propose a learning model called the quantum statistical learning (𝖰𝖲𝖰𝖰𝖲𝖰\\mathsf{QSQ}) model, which extends the 𝖲𝖰𝖲𝖰\\mathsf{SQ} learning model introduced by Kearns [Kea98] to the quantum setting. Our model can be also seen as a restriction of the quantum PAC learning model: here, the learner does not have direct access to quantum examples, but can only obtain estimates of measurement statistics on them. Theoretically, this model provides a simple yet expressive setting to explore the power of quantum examples in machine learning. From a practical perspective, since simpler operations are required, learning algorithms in the 𝖰𝖲𝖰𝖰𝖲𝖰\\mathsf{QSQ} model are more feasible for implementation on near-term quantum devices. We prove a number of results about the 𝖰𝖲𝖰𝖰𝖲𝖰\\mathsf{QSQ} learning model. We first show that parity functions, O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n)-juntas and polynomial-sized DNF formulas are efficiently learnable in the 𝖰𝖲𝖰𝖰𝖲𝖰\\mathsf{QSQ} model, in contrast to the classical setting where these problems are provably hard. This implies that many of the advantages of quantum PAC learning can be realized even in the more restricted quantum 𝖲𝖰𝖲𝖰\\mathsf{SQ} learning model. It is well-known that weak statistical query dimension, denoted by 𝖶𝖾𝖺𝗄𝖲𝖰𝖣𝖨𝖬​(C)𝖶𝖾𝖺𝗄𝖲𝖰𝖣𝖨𝖬C\\mathsf{WeakSQDIM}({\\pazocal C}), characterizes the complexity of learning a concept class CC{\\pazocal C} in the classical 𝖲𝖰𝖲𝖰\\mathsf{SQ} model. We show that log⁡(𝖶𝖾𝖺𝗄𝖲𝖰𝖣𝖨𝖬​(C))𝖶𝖾𝖺𝗄𝖲𝖰𝖣𝖨𝖬C\\log(\\mathsf{WeakSQDIM}({\\pazocal C})) is a lower bound on the complexity of 𝖰𝖲𝖰𝖰𝖲𝖰\\mathsf{QSQ} learning, and furthermore it is tight for certain concept classes CC{\\pazocal C}. Additionally, we show that this quantity provides strong lower bounds for the small-bias quantum communication model under product distributions. Finally, we introduce the notion of private quantum PAC learning, in which a quantum PAC learner is required to be differentially private. We show that learnability in the 𝖰𝖲𝖰𝖰𝖲𝖰\\mathsf{QSQ} model implies learnability in the quantum private PAC model. Additionally, we show that in the private PAC learning setting, the classical and quantum sample complexities are equal, up to constant factors.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
