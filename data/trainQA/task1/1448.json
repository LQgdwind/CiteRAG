      "content": "Paper Title: Is the space complexity of planted clique recovery the same as that of detection?\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study the planted clique problem in which a clique of size k𝑘k is planted in an Erdős-Rényi graph G​(n,12)𝐺𝑛12G(n,\\frac{1}{2}), and one is interested in either detecting or recovering this planted clique. This problem is interesting because it is widely believed to show a statistical-computational gap at clique size k=Θ​(n)𝑘Θ𝑛k=\\Theta(\\sqrt{n}), and has emerged as the prototypical problem with such a gap from which average-case hardness of other statistical problems can be deduced. It also displays a tight computational connection between the detection and recovery variants, unlike other problems of a similar nature. This wide investigation into the computational complexity of the planted clique problem has, however, mostly focused on its time complexity. To begin investigating the robustness of these statistical-computational phenomena to changes in our notion of computational efficiency, we ask- Do the statistical-computational phenomena that make the planted clique an interesting problem also hold when we use ‘space efficiency’ as our notion of computational efficiency? It is relatively easy to show that a positive answer to this question depends on the existence of a O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) space algorithm that can recover planted cliques of size k=Ω​(n)𝑘Ω𝑛k=\\Omega(\\sqrt{n}). Our main result comes very close to designing such an algorithm. We show that for k=Ω​(n)𝑘Ω𝑛k=\\Omega(\\sqrt{n}), the recovery problem can be solved in O​((log∗⁡n−log∗⁡kn)⋅log⁡n)𝑂⋅superscript𝑛superscript𝑘𝑛𝑛O\\left(\\left(\\log^{*}{n}-\\log^{*}{\\frac{k}{\\sqrt{n}}}\\right)\\cdot\\log n\\right) bits of space. 1. If k=ω​(n​log(ℓ)⁡n)𝑘𝜔𝑛superscriptℓ𝑛k=\\omega(\\sqrt{n}\\log^{(\\ell)}n) 111Here log(ℓ)⁡nsuperscriptℓ𝑛\\log^{(\\ell)}n means we repeatedly take the logarithm of n𝑛n ℓℓ\\ell times. For example, log(3)⁡n=log⁡log⁡log⁡nsuperscript3𝑛𝑛\\log^{(3)}n=\\log\\log\\log n. for any constant integer ℓ>0ℓ0\\ell>0, the space usage is O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) bits. 2. If k=Θ​(n)𝑘Θ𝑛k=\\Theta(\\sqrt{n}), the space usage is O​(log∗⁡n⋅log⁡n)𝑂superscript⋅𝑛𝑛O(\\log^{*}{n}\\cdot\\log n) bits. Our result suggests that there does exist an O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) space algorithm to recover cliques of size k=Ω​(n)𝑘Ω𝑛k=\\Omega(\\sqrt{n}), since we come very close to achieving such parameters. This provides evidence that the statistical-computational phenomena that (conjecturally) hold for planted clique time complexity also (conjecturally) hold for space complexity.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
