      "content": "Paper Title: On Biased Compression for Distributed Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In the last few years, various communication compression techniques have emerged as an indispensable tool helping to alleviate the communication bottleneck in distributed learning. However, despite the fact biased compressors often show superior performance in practice when compared to the much more studied and understood unbiased compressors, very little is known about them. In this work we study three classes of biased compression operators, two of which are new, and their performance when applied to (stochastic) gradient descent and distributed (stochastic) gradient descent. We show for the first time that biased compressors can lead to linear convergence rates both in the single node and distributed settings. We prove that distributed compressed SGD method, employed with error feedback mechanism, enjoys the ergodic rate 𝒪​(δ​L​exp⁡[−μ​Kδ​L]+(C+δ​D)K​μ)𝒪𝛿𝐿𝜇𝐾𝛿𝐿𝐶𝛿𝐷𝐾𝜇{\\cal O}\\left(\\delta L\\exp[-\\frac{\\mu K}{\\delta L}]+\\frac{(C+\\delta D)}{K\\mu}\\right), where δ≥1𝛿1\\delta\\geq 1 is a compression parameter which grows when more compression is applied, L𝐿L and μ𝜇\\mu are the smoothness and strong convexity constants, C𝐶C captures stochastic gradient noise (C=0𝐶0C=0 if full gradients are computed on each node) and D𝐷D captures the variance of the gradients at the optimum (D=0𝐷0D=0 for over-parameterized models). Further, via a theoretical study of several synthetic and empirical distributions of communicated gradients, we shed light on why and by how much biased compressors outperform their unbiased variants. Finally, we propose several new biased compressors with promising theoretical guarantees and practical performance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
