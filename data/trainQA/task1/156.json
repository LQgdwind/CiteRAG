Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 61 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Distributed Learning with Dependent Samples\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper focuses on learning rate analysis of distributed kernel ridge regression (DKRR) for strong mixing sequences. Using a recently developed integral operator approach and a classical covariance inequality for Banach-valued strong mixing sequences, we succeed in deriving optimal learning rates of DKRR. As a byproduct, we deduce a sufficient condition for the mixing property to guarantee the optimal learning rates for kernel ridge regression, which fills the gap of learning rates between i.i.d. samples and strong mixing sequences. A series of numerical experiments are conducted to verify our theoretical assertions via showing excellent learning performance of DKRR in learning both toy and real world time series data. All these results extend the applicable range of distributed learning from i.i.d. samples to non-i.i.d. sequences.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper.
