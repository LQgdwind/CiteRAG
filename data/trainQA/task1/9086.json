Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Diffusion-based Image Translation using Asymmetric Gradient Guidance\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Diffusion models have shown significant progress in image translation tasks recently. However, due to their stochastic nature, there’s often a trade-off between style transformation and content preservation. Current strategies aim to disentangle style and content, preserving the source image’s structure while successfully transitioning from a source to a target domain under text or one-shot image conditions. Yet, these methods often require computationally intense fine-tuning of diffusion models or additional neural networks. To address these challenges, here we present an approach that guides the reverse process of diffusion sampling by applying asymmetric gradient guidance. This results in quicker and more stable image manipulation for both text-guided and image-guided image translation. Our model’s adaptability allows it to be implemented with both image- and latent-diffusion models. Experiments show that our method outperforms various state-of-the-art models in image translation tasks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
