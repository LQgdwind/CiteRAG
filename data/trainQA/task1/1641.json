This full version now contains full proofs of all results.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Since the early days of research in algorithms and complexity, the computation of stable matchings is a core topic. While in the classic setting the goal is to match up two agents (either from different ‚Äúgender‚Äù (this is Stable Marriage) or ‚Äúunrestricted‚Äù (this is Stable Roommates)), Knuth [1976] triggered the study of three- or multidimensional cases. Here, we focus on the study of Multidimensional Stable Roommates, known to be ùñ≠ùñØùñ≠ùñØ\\mathsf{NP}-complete since the early 1990‚Äôs. Many ùñ≠ùñØùñ≠ùñØ\\mathsf{NP}-completeness results, however, rely on general input instances that do not occur in at least some of the specific application scenarios. With the quest for identifying islands of tractability for Multidimensional Stable Roommates, we study the case of master lists. Here, as natural in applications where agents express their preferences based on ‚Äúobjective‚Äù scores, one roughly speaking assumes that all agent preferences are ‚Äúderived from‚Äù a central master list, implying that the individual agent preferences shall be similar. Master lists have been frequently studied in the two-dimensional (classic) stable matching case, but seemingly almost never for the multidimensional case. This work, also relying on methods from parameterized algorithm design and complexity analysis, performs a first systematic study of Multidimensional Stable Roommates under the assumption of master lists. Keywords. Stable matching, partially ordered sets, NP-hardness, parameterized complexity, distance-from-triviality parameterization\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 49\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
