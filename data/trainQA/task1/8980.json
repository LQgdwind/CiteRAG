Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: CVSNet: A Computer Implementation for Central Visual System of The Brain\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In computer vision, different basic blocks are created around different matrix operations, and models based on different basic blocks have achieved good results. Good results achieved in vision tasks grants them rationality. However, these experimental-based models also make deep learning long criticized for principle and interpretability. Deep learning originated from the concept of neurons in neuroscience, but recent designs detached natural neural networks except for some simple concepts. In this paper, we build an artificial neural network, CVSNet, which can be seen as a computer implementation for central visual system of the brain. Each block in CVSNet represents the same vision information as that in brains. In CVSNet, blocks differs from each other and visual information flows through three independent pathways and five different blocks. Thus CVSNet is completely different from the design of all previous models, in which basic blocks are repeated to build model and information between channels is mixed at the outset. In ablation experiment, we show the information extracted by blocks in CVSNet and compare with previous networks, proving effectiveness and rationality of blocks in CVSNet from experiment side. And in the experiment of object recognition, CVSNet achieves comparable results to ConvNets, Vision Transformers and MLPs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
