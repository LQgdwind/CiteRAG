Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Differentially Private Counterfactuals via Functional Mechanism\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Counterfactual, serving as one emerging type of model explanation, has attracted tons of attentions recently from both industry and academia. Different from the conventional feature-based explanations (e.g., attributions), counterfactuals are a series of hypothetical samples which can flip model decisions with minimal perturbations on queries. Given valid counterfactuals, humans are capable of reasoning under “what-if” circumstances, so as to better understand the model decision boundaries. However, releasing counterfactuals could be detrimental, since it may unintentionally leak sensitive information to adversaries, which brings about higher risks on both model security and data privacy. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose a novel framework to generate differentially private counterfactual (DPC) without touching the deployed model or explanation set, where noises are injected for protection while maintaining the explanation roles of counterfactual. In particular, we train an autoencoder with the functional mechanism to construct noisy class prototypes, and then derive the DPC from the latent prototypes based on the post-processing immunity of differential privacy. Further evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, showing that DPC can successfully relieve the risks on both extraction and inference attacks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 56\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
