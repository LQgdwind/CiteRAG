Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Dependability Analysis of Deep Reinforcement Learning based Robotics and Autonomous Systems through Probabilistic Model Checking\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) provides transformational capabilities to the control of Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAS), the black-box nature of DRL and uncertain deployment environments of RAS pose new challenges on its dependability. Although existing works impose constraints on the DRL policy to ensure successful completion of the mission, it is far from adequate to assess the DRL-driven RAS in a holistic way considering all dependability properties. In this paper, we formally define a set of dependability properties in temporal logic and construct a Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) to model the dynamics of risk/failures of a DRL-driven RAS interacting with the stochastic environment. We then conduct Probabilistic Model Checking (PMC) on the designed DTMC to verify those properties. Our experimental results show that the proposed method is effective as a holistic assessment framework while uncovering conflicts between the properties that may need trade-offs in training. Moreover, we find that the standard DRL training cannot improve dependability properties, thus requiring bespoke optimisation objectives. Finally, our method offers sensitivity analysis of dependability properties to disturbance levels from environments, providing insights for the assurance of real RAS.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
