The study was funded by the subsidy allocated to Kazan Federal University for the state assignment in the sphere of scientific activities (Project No. FZSM-2024-0013).\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Quantum fingerprinting is a technique that maps classical input word to a quantum state. The obtained quantum state is much shorter than the original word, and its processing uses less resources, making it useful in quantum algorithms, communication, and cryptography. One of the examples of quantum fingerprinting is quantum automata algorithm for M​O​Dp={ai⋅p∣i≥0}𝑀𝑂subscript𝐷𝑝conditional-setsuperscript𝑎⋅𝑖𝑝𝑖0MOD_{p}=\\{a^{i\\cdot p}\\mid i\\geq 0\\} languages, where p𝑝p is a prime number. However, implementing such an automaton on the current quantum hardware is not efficient. Quantum fingerprinting maps a word x∈{0,1}n𝑥superscript01𝑛x\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n} of length n𝑛n to a state \\ket​ψ​(x)\\ket𝜓𝑥\\ket{\\psi(x)} of O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) qubits, and uses O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) unitary operations. Computing quantum fingerprint using all available qubits of the current quantum computers is infeasible due to a large number of quantum operations. To make quantum fingerprinting practical, we should optimize the circuit for depth instead of width in contrast to the previous works. We propose explicit methods of quantum fingerprinting based on tools from additive combinatorics, such as generalized arithmetic progressions (GAPs), and prove that these methods provide circuit depth comparable to a probabilistic method. We also compare our method to prior work on explicit quantum fingerprinting methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
