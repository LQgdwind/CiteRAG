Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Position-aware Structure Learning for Graph Topology-imbalance by Relieving Under-reaching and Over-squashing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Topology-imbalance is a graph-specific imbalance problem caused by the uneven topology positions of labeled nodes, which significantly damages the performance of GNNs. What topology-imbalance means and how to measure its impact on graph learning remain under-explored. In this paper, we provide a new understanding of topology-imbalance from a global view of the supervision information distribution in terms of under-reaching and over-squashing, which motivates two quantitative metrics as measurements. In light of our analysis, we propose a novel position-aware graph structure learning framework named PASTEL, which directly optimizes the information propagation path and solves the topology-imbalance issue in essence. Our key insight is to enhance the connectivity of nodes within the same class for more supervision information, thereby relieving the under-reaching and over-squashing phenomena. Specifically, we design an anchor-based position encoding mechanism, which better incorporates relative topology position and enhances the intra-class inductive bias by maximizing the label influence. We further propose a class-wise conflict measure as the edge weights, which benefits the separation of different node classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior potential and adaptability of PASTEL in enhancing GNNsâ€™ power in different data annotation scenarios.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
