Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: When hard negative sampling meets supervised contrastive learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract State-of-the-art image models predominantly follow a two-stage strategy: pre-training on large datasets and fine-tuning with cross-entropy loss. Many studies have shown that using cross-entropy can result in sub-optimal generalisation and stability. While the supervised contrastive loss addresses some limitations of cross-entropy loss by focusing on intra-class similarities and inter-class differences, it neglects the importance of hard negative mining. We propose that models will benefit from performance improvement by weighting negative samples based on their dissimilarity to positive counterparts. In this paper, we introduce a new supervised contrastive learning objective, SCHaNe, which incorporates hard negative sampling during the fine-tuning phase. Without requiring specialized architectures, additional data, or extra computational resources, experimental results indicate that SCHaNe outperforms the strong baseline BEiT-3 in Top-1 accuracy across various benchmarks, with significant gains of up to 3.32%percent3.323.32\\% in few-shot learning settings and 3.41%percent3.413.41\\% in full dataset fine-tuning. Importantly, our proposed objective sets a new state-of-the-art for base models on ImageNet-1k, achieving an 86.14% accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed objective yields better embeddings and explains the improved effectiveness observed in our experiments.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
