Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: DSP: Dual Soft-Paste for Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation aims to adapt a segmentation model trained on the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain. Existing methods try to learn domain invariant features while suffering from large domain gaps that make it difficult to correctly align discrepant features, especially in the initial training phase. To address this issue, we propose a novel Dual Soft-Paste (DSP) method in this paper. Specifically, DSP selects some classes from a source domain image using a long-tail class first sampling strategy and softly pastes the corresponding image patch on both the source and target training images with a fusion weight. Technically, we adopt the mean teacher framework for domain adaptation, where the pasted source and target images go through the student network while the original target image goes through the teacher network. Output-level alignment is carried out by aligning the probability maps of the target fused image from both networks using a weighted cross-entropy loss. In addition, feature-level alignment is carried out by aligning the feature maps of the source and target images from student network using a weighted maximum mean discrepancy loss. DSP facilitates the model learning domain-invariant features from the intermediate domains, leading to faster convergence and better performance. Experiments on two challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DSP over state-of-the-art methods.
