Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: OccluTrack: Rethinking Awareness of Occlusion for Enhancing Multiple Pedestrian Tracking\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Multiple pedestrian tracking faces the challenge of tracking pedestrians in the presence of occlusion. Existing methods suffer from inaccurate motion estimation, appearance feature extraction, and association due to occlusion, leading to inadequate Identification F1-Score (IDF1), excessive ID switches (IDSw), and insufficient association accuracy and recall (AssA and AssR). We found that the main reason is abnormal detections caused by partial occlusion. In this paper, we suggest that the key insight is explicit motion estimation, reliable appearance features, and fair association in occlusion scenes. Specifically, we propose an adaptive occlusion-aware multiple pedestrian tracker, OccluTrack. We first introduce an abnormal motion suppression mechanism into the Kalman Filter to adaptively detect and suppress outlier motions caused by partial occlusion. Second, we propose a pose-guided re-ID module to extract discriminative part features for partially occluded pedestrians. Last, we design a new occlusion-aware association method towards fair IoU and appearance embedding distance measurement for occluded pedestrians. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that our OccluTrack outperforms state-of-the-art methods on MOT-Challenge datasets. Particularly, the improvements on IDF1, IDSw, AssA, and AssR demonstrate the effectiveness of our OccluTrack on tracking and association performance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
