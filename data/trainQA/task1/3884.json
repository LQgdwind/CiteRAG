Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Scalable Surface Reconstruction with Delaunay-Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We introduce a novel learning-based, visibility-aware, surface reconstruction method for large-scale, defect-laden point clouds. Our approach can cope with the scale and variety of point cloud defects encountered in real-life Multi-View Stereo (MVS) acquisitions. Our method relies on a 3D Delaunay tetrahedralization whose cells are classified as inside or outside the surface by a graph neural network and an energy model solvable with a graph cut. Our model, making use of both local geometric attributes and line-of-sight visibility information, is able to learn a visibility model from a small amount of synthetic training data and generalizes to real-life acquisitions. Combining the efficiency of deep learning methods and the scalability of energy-based models, our approach outperforms both learning and non learning-based reconstruction algorithms on two publicly available reconstruction benchmarks. Our code and data is available at https://github.com/raphaelsulzer/dgnn. \\ccsdesc [500]Computing methodologies Reconstruction \\ccsdesc[300]Computing methodologies Neural networks \\ccsdesc[300]Computing methodologies Shape inference \\printccsdesc\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
