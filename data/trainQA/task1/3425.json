Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Adaptive Multi-Source Causal Inference\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Data scarcity is a tremendous challenge in causal effect estimation. In this paper, we propose to exploit additional data sources to facilitate estimating causal effects in the target population. Specifically, we leverage additional source datasets which share similar causal mechanisms with the target observations to help infer causal effects of the target population. We propose three levels of knowledge transfer, through modelling the outcomes, treatments, and confounders. To achieve consistent positive transfer, we introduce learnable parametric transfer factors to adaptively control the transfer strength, and thus achieving a fair and balanced knowledge transfer between the sources and the target. The proposed method can infer causal effects in the target population without prior knowledge of data discrepancy between the additional data sources and the target. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method as compared with recent baselines.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
