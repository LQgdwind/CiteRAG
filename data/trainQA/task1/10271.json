Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Energy-adaptive Buffering for Efficient, Responsive, and Persistent Batteryless Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Batteryless energy harvesting systems enable a wide array of new sensing, computation, and communication platforms untethered by power delivery or battery maintenance demands. Energy harvesters charge a buffer capacitor from an unreliable environmental source until enough energy is stored to guarantee a burst of operation despite changes in power input. Current platforms use a fixed-size buffer chosen at design time to meet constraints on charge time or application longevity, but static energy buffers are a poor fit for the highly volatile power sources found in real-world deployments: fixed buffers waste energy both as heat when they reach capacity during a power surplus and as leakage when they fail to charge the system during a power deficit. To maximize batteryless system performance in the face of highly dynamic input power, we propose REACT: a responsive buffering circuit which varies total capacitance according to net input power. REACT uses a variable capacitor bank to expand capacitance to capture incoming energy during a power surplus and reconfigures internal capacitors to reclaim additional energy from each capacitor as power input falls. Compared to fixed-capacity systems, REACT captures more energy, maximizes usable energy, and efficiently decouples system voltage from stored charge‚Äîenabling low-power and high-performance designs previously limited by ambient power. Our evaluation on real-world platforms shows that REACT eliminates the tradeoff between responsiveness, efficiency, and longevity, increasing the energy available for useful work by an average 25.6% over static buffers optimized for reactivity and capacity, improving event responsiveness by an average 7.7‚Äãx7.7ùë•7.7x without sacrificing capacity, and enabling programmer directed longevity guarantees.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
