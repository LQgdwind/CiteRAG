Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Medical Entity Disambiguation Using Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Medical knowledge bases (KBs), distilled from biomedical literature and regulatory actions, are expected to provide high-quality information to facilitate clinical decision making. Entity disambiguation (also referred to as entity linking) is considered as an essential task in unlocking the wealth of such medical KBs. However, existing medical entity disambiguation methods are not adequate due to word discrepancies between the entities in the KB and the text snippets in the source documents. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have proven to be very effective and provide state-of-the-art results for many real-world applications with graph-structured data. In this paper, we introduce ED-GNN based on three representative GNNs (GraphSAGE, R-GCN, and MAGNN) for medical entity disambiguation. We develop two optimization techniques to fine-tune and improve ED-GNN. First, we introduce a novel strategy to represent entities that are mentioned in text snippets as a query graph. Second, we design an effective negative sampling strategy that identifies hard negative samples to improve the modelâ€™s disambiguation capability. Compared to the best performing state-of-the-art solutions, our ED-GNN offers an average improvement of 7.3% in terms of F1 score on five real-world datasets.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 54\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
