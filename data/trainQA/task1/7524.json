Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring Stochastic Autoregressive Image Modeling for Visual Representation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Autoregressive language modeling (ALM) has been successfully used in self-supervised pre-training in Natural language processing (NLP). However, this paradigm has not achieved comparable results with other self-supervised approaches in computer vision (e.g., contrastive learning, masked image modeling). In this paper, we try to find the reason why autoregressive modeling does not work well on vision tasks. To tackle this problem, we fully analyze the limitation of visual autoregressive methods and proposed a novel stochastic autoregressive image modeling (named SAIM) by the two simple designs. First, we serialize the image into patches. Second, we employ the stochastic permutation strategy to generate an effective and robust image context which is critical for vision tasks. To realize this task, we create a parallel encoder-decoder training process in which the encoder serves a similar role to the standard vision transformer focusing on learning the whole contextual information, and meanwhile the decoder predicts the content of the current position so that the encoder and decoder can reinforce each other. Our method significantly improves the performance of autoregressive image modeling and achieves the best accuracy (83.9%) on the vanilla ViT-Base model among methods using only ImageNet-1K data. Transfer performance in downstream tasks also shows that our model achieves competitive performance. Code is available at https://github.com/qiy20/SAIM.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
