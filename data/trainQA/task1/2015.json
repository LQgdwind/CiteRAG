Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Offline Learning of Counterfactual Predictions for Real-World Robotic Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We consider real-world reinforcement learning (RL) of robotic manipulation tasks that involve both visuomotor skills and contact-rich skills. We aim to train a policy that maps multimodal sensory observations (vision and force) to a manipulatorâ€™s joint velocities under practical considerations. We propose to use offline samples to learn a set of general value functions (GVFs) that make counterfactual predictions from the visual inputs. We show that combining the offline learned counterfactual predictions with force feedbacks in online policy learning allows efficient reinforcement learning given only a terminal (success/failure) reward. We argue that the learned counterfactual predictions form a compact and informative representation that enables sample efficiency and provides auxiliary reward signals that guide online explorations towards contact-rich states. Various experiments in simulation and real-world settings were performed for evaluation. Recordings of the real-world robot training can be found via https://sites.google.com/view/realrl.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 52\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
