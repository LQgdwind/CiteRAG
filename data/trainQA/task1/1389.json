      "content": "Paper Title: Analog Lagrange Coded Computing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A distributed computing scenario is considered, where the computational power of a set of worker nodes is used to perform a certain computation task over a dataset that is dispersed among the workers. Lagrange coded computing (LCC), proposed by Yu et al., leverages the well-known Lagrange polynomial to perform polynomial evaluation of the dataset in such a scenario in an efficient parallel fashion while keeping the privacy of data amidst possible collusion of workers. This solution relies on quantizing the data into a finite field, so that Shamir’s secret sharing, as one of its main building blocks, can be employed. Such a solution, however, is not properly scalable with the size of dataset, mainly due to computation overflows. To address such a critical issue, we propose a novel extension of LCC to the analog domain, referred to as analog LCC (ALCC). All the operations in the proposed ALCC protocol are done over the infinite fields of ℝℝ{\\mathbb{R}}/ℂℂ{\\mathbb{C}} but for practical implementations floating-point numbers are used. We characterize the privacy of data in ALCC, against any subset of colluding workers up to a certain size, in terms of the distinguishing security (DS) and the mutual information security (MIS) metrics. Also, the accuracy of outcome is characterized in a practical setting assuming operations are performed using floating-point numbers. Consequently, a fundamental trade-off between the accuracy of the outcome of ALCC and its privacy level is observed and is numerically evaluated. Moreover, we implement the proposed scheme to perform matrix-matrix multiplication over a batch of matrices. It is observed that ALCC is superior compared to the state-of-the-art LCC, implemented using fixed-point numbers, assuming both schemes use an equal number of bits to represent data symbols.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper.
