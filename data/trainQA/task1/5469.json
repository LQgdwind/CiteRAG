Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Interpretable Molecular Graph Generation via Monotonic Constraints\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Designing molecules with specific properties is a long-lasting research problem and is central to advancing crucial domains such as drug discovery and material science. Recent advances in deep graph generative models treat molecule design as graph generation problems which provide new opportunities toward the breakthrough of this long-lasting problem. Existing models, however, have many shortcomings, including poor interpretability and controllability toward desired molecular properties. This paper focuses on new methodologies for molecule generation with interpretable and controllable deep generative models, by proposing new monotonically-regularized graph variational autoencoders. The proposed models learn to represent the molecules with latent variables and then learn the correspondence between them and molecule properties parameterized by polynomial functions. To further improve the intepretability and controllability of molecule generation towards desired properties, we derive new objectives which further enforce monotonicity of the relation between some latent variables and target molecule properties such as toxicity and clogP. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the superiority of the proposed framework on accuracy, novelty, disentanglement, and control towards desired molecular properties.
