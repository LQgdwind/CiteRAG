Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: On the Optimal Bounds for Noisy Computing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We revisit the problem of computing with noisy information considered in Feige et al. (1994), which includes computing the 𝖮𝖱𝖮𝖱\\mathsf{OR} function from noisy queries, and computing the 𝖬𝖠𝖷,𝖲𝖤𝖠𝖱𝖢𝖧𝖬𝖠𝖷𝖲𝖤𝖠𝖱𝖢𝖧\\mathsf{MAX},\\mathsf{SEARCH}, and 𝖲𝖮𝖱𝖳𝖲𝖮𝖱𝖳\\mathsf{SORT} functions from noisy pairwise comparisons. For K𝐾K given elements, the goal is to correctly recover the desired function with probability at least 1−δ1𝛿1-\\delta when the outcome of each query is flipped with probability p𝑝p. We consider both the adaptive sampling setting where each query can be adaptively designed based on past outcomes, and the non-adaptive sampling setting where the query cannot depend on past outcomes. The prior work provides tight bounds on the worst-case query complexity in terms of the dependence on K𝐾K. However, the upper and lower bounds do not match in terms of the dependence on δ𝛿\\delta and p𝑝p. We improve the lower bounds for all the four functions under both adaptive and non-adaptive query models. Most of our lower bounds match the upper bounds up to constant factors when either p𝑝p or δ𝛿\\delta is bounded away from 00, while the ratio between the best prior upper and lower bounds goes to infinity when p→0→𝑝0p\\rightarrow 0 or p→1/2→𝑝12p\\rightarrow 1/2. On the other hand, we also provide matching upper and lower bounds for the number of queries in expectation, improving both the upper and lower bounds for the variable-length query model.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
