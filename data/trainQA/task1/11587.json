      "content": "Paper Title: Quasi-Monte Carlo Beyond Hardy-Krause\n\nPaper Abstract: We examine the problem of numerically estimating the integral of a function f𝑓f. The classical approaches to this problem are Monte Carlo (MC) and quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. MC methods use random samples to evaluate f𝑓f and have error O​(σ​(f)/n)𝑂𝜎𝑓𝑛O(\\sigma(f)/\\sqrt{n}), where σ​(f)𝜎𝑓\\sigma(f) is the standard deviation of f𝑓f. QMC methods are based on evaluating f𝑓f at explicit point sets with low discrepancy, and as given by the classical Koksma-Hlawka inequality, they have error O~​(σ𝖧𝖪​(f)/n)~𝑂subscript𝜎𝖧𝖪𝑓𝑛\\widetilde{O}(\\sigma_{\\mathsf{HK}}(f)/n), where σ𝖧𝖪​(f)subscript𝜎𝖧𝖪𝑓\\sigma_{\\mathsf{HK}}(f) is the variation of f𝑓f in the sense of Hardy and Krause. These two methods have distinctive advantages and shortcomings, and a fundamental question is to find a method that combines the advantages of both. In this work, we give a simple randomized algorithm that produces QMC point sets with the following desirable features: 1. It achieves substantially better error than given by the classical Koksma-Hlawka inequality. In particular, it has error O~​(σ𝖲𝖮​(f)/n)~𝑂subscript𝜎𝖲𝖮𝑓𝑛\\widetilde{O}(\\sigma_{\\mathsf{SO}}(f)/n), where σ𝖲𝖮​(f)subscript𝜎𝖲𝖮𝑓\\sigma_{\\mathsf{SO}}(f) is a new measure of variation that we introduce, which is substantially smaller than the Hardy-Krause variation. 2. The algorithm only requires random samples from the underlying distribution, which makes it as flexible as MC. 3. It automatically achieves the best of both MC and QMC (and the above improvement over Hardy-Krause variation and Koksma-Hlawka inequality) in an optimal way. 4. The algorithm is extremely efficient, with an amortized O~​(1)~𝑂1\\widetilde{O}(1) runtime per sample. Our method is based on the classical transference principle in geometric discrepancy, combined with recent algorithmic innovations in combinatorial discrepancy [BDGL18, ALS21, HSSZ24], that besides producing low-discrepancy colorings, also guarantee certain subgaussian properties. This allows us to bypass several limitations of previous works in bridging the gap between MC and QMC methods and go beyond the Hardy-Krause variation. In particular, we show how to leverage subgaussianity and other structural properties of the discrepancy problem arising from the transference principle to obtain certain careful cancellations in the exact expression for the numerical integration error, which leads to our improved notion of variation. In contrast, these cancellations are completely lost in the Koksma-Hlawka inequalities and have not been exploited in previous works.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 62 most likely reference titles for this paper.
