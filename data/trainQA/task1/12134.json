      "content": "Paper Title: Feature Coding in the Era of Large Models: Dataset, Test Conditions, and Benchmark\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Large models have achieved remarkable performance across various tasks, yet they incur significant computational costs and privacy concerns during both training and inference. Distributed deployment has emerged as a potential solution, but it necessitates the exchange of intermediate information between model segments, with feature representations serving as crucial information carriers. To optimize information exchange, feature coding methods are applied to reduce transmission and storage overhead. Despite its importance, feature coding for large models remains an under-explored area. In this paper, we draw attention to large model feature coding and make three contributions to this field. First, we introduce a comprehensive dataset encompassing diverse features generated by three representative types of large models. Second, we establish unified test conditions, enabling standardized evaluation pipelines and fair comparisons across future feature coding studies. Third, we introduce two baseline methods derived from widely used image coding techniques and benchmark their performance on the proposed dataset. These contributions aim to advance the field of feature coding, facilitating more efficient large model deployment. All source code and the dataset will be made available on GitHub.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
