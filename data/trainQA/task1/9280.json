      "content": "Paper Title: Hard Sample Mining Enabled Supervised Contrastive Feature Learning for Wind Turbine Pitch System Fault Diagnosis\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The efficient utilization of wind power by wind turbines relies on the ability of their pitch systems to adjust blade pitch angles in response to varying wind speeds. However, the presence of multiple health conditions in the pitch system due to the long-term wear and tear poses challenges in accurately classifying them, thus increasing the maintenance cost of wind turbines or even damaging them. This paper proposes a novel method based on hard sample mining-enabled supervised contrastive learning (HSMSCL) to address this problem. The proposed method employs cosine similarity to identify hard samples and subsequently, leverages supervised contrastive learning to learn more discriminative representations by constructing hard sample pairs. Furthermore, the hard sample mining framework in the proposed method also constructs hard samples with learned representations to make the training process of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) more challenging and make it a more effective classifier. The proposed approach progressively improves the fault diagnosis model by introducing hard samples in the SCL and MLP phases, thus enhancing its performance in complex multi-class fault diagnosis tasks. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, two real datasets comprising wind turbine pitch system cog belt fracture data are utilized. The fault diagnosis performance of the proposed method is compared against existing methods, and the results demonstrate its superior performance. The proposed approach exhibits significant improvements in fault diagnosis performance, providing promising prospects for enhancing the reliability and efficiency of wind turbine pitch system fault diagnosis.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
