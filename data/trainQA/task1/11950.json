Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Context-Aware Adaptation in Extended Reality: A Design Space for XR Interfaces and an Adaptive Placement Strategy\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract By converting the entire 3D space around the user into a screen, Extended Reality (XR) can ameliorate traditional displays’ space limitations and facilitate the consumption of multiple pieces of information at a time. However, if designed inappropriately, these XR interfaces can overwhelm the user and complicate information access. In this work, we explored the design dimensions that can be adapted to enable suitable presentation and interaction within an XR interface. To investigate a specific use case of context-aware adaptations within our proposed design space, we concentrated on the spatial layout of the XR content and investigated non-adaptive and adaptive placement strategies. In this paper, we (1) present a comprehensive design space for XR interfaces, (2) propose Environment-referenced, an adaptive placement strategy that uses a relevant intermediary from the environment within a Hybrid Frame of Reference (FoR) for each XR object, and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of this adaptive placement strategy and a non-adaptive Body-Fixed placement strategy in four contextual scenarios varying in terms of social setting and user mobility in the environment. The performance of these placement strategies from our within-subjects user study emphasized the importance of intermediaries’ relevance to the user’s focus. These findings underscore the importance of context-aware interfaces, indicating that the appropriate use of an adaptive content placement strategy in a context can significantly improve task efficiency, accuracy, and usability.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
