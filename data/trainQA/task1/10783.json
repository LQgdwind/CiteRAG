Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: The Surprising Effectiveness of Skip-Tuning in Diffusion Sampling\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract With the incorporation of the UNet architecture, diffusion probabilistic models have become a dominant force in image generation tasks. One key design in UNet is the skip connections between the encoder and decoder blocks. Although skip connections have been shown to improve training stability and model performance, we reveal that such shortcuts can be a limiting factor for the complexity of the transformation. As the sampling steps decrease, the generation process and the role of the UNet get closer to the push-forward transformations from Gaussian distribution to the target, posing a challenge for the network’s complexity. To address this challenge, we propose Skip-Tuning, a simple yet surprisingly effective training-free tuning method on the skip connections. Our method can achieve 100% FID improvement for pretrained EDM on ImageNet 64 with only 19 NFEs (1.75), breaking the limit of ODE samplers regardless of sampling steps. Surprisingly, the improvement persists when we increase the number of sampling steps and can even surpass the best result from EDM-2 (1.58) with only 39 NFEs (1.57). Comprehensive exploratory experiments are conducted to shed light on the surprising effectiveness. We observe that while Skip-Tuning increases the score-matching losses in the pixel space, the losses in the feature space are reduced, particularly at intermediate noise levels, which coincide with the most effective range accounting for image quality improvement.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
