      "content": "Paper Title: UAV Trajectory and Multi-User Beamforming Optimization for Clustered Users Against Passive Eavesdropping Attacks With Unknown CSI\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper tackles the fundamental passive eavesdropping problem in modern wireless communications in which the location and the channel state information (CSI) of the attackers are unknown. In this regard, we propose deploying an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that serves as a mobile aerial relay (AR) to help ground base station (GBS) support a subset of vulnerable users. More precisely, our solution (1) clusters the single-antenna users in two groups to be either served by the GBS directly or via the AR, (2) employs optimal multi-user beamforming to the directly served users, and (3) optimizes the ARâ€™s 3D position, its multi-user beamforming matrix and transmit powers by combining closed-form solutions with machine learning techniques. Specifically, we design a plain beamforming and power optimization combined with a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for an AR to optimize its trajectory for the security maximization of the served users. Numerical results show that the multi-user multiple input, single output (MU-MISO) system split between a GBS and an AR with optimized transmission parameters without knowledge of the eavesdropping channels achieves high secrecy capacities that scale well with increasing the number of users. Index Terms: UAV-assisted, beamforming, DRL, eavesdropping, MU-MISO, physical layer security, power control, trajectory optimization.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
