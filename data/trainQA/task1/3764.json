Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Experience-Driven PCG via Reinforcement Learning: A Super Mario Bros Study This paper is accepted by the 2021 IEEE Conference on Games and will be included in the proceedings.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We introduce a procedural content generation (PCG) framework at the intersections of experience-driven PCG and PCG via reinforcement learning, named ED(PCG)RL, EDRL in short. EDRL is able to teach RL designers to generate endless playable levels in an online manner while respecting particular experiences for the player as designed in the form of reward functions. The framework is tested initially in the Super Mario Bros game. In particular, the RL designers of Super Mario Bros generate and concatenate level segments while considering the diversity among the segments. The correctness of the generation is ensured by a neural net-assisted evolutionary level repairer and the playability of the whole level is determined through AI-based testing. Our agents in this EDRL implementation learn to maximise a quantification of Kosterâ€™s principle of fun by moderating the degree of diversity across level segments. Moreover, we test their ability to design fun levels that are diverse over time and playable. Our proposed framework is capable of generating endless, playable Super Mario Bros levels with varying degrees of fun, deviation from earlier segments, and playability. EDRL can be generalised to any game that is built as a segment-based sequential process and features a built-in compressed representation of its game content.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
