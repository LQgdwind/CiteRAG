Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Harmonic Oscillator based Particle Swarm Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Numerical optimization techniques are widely used in a broad area of science and technology, from finding the minimal energy of systems in Physics or Chemistry to finding optimal routes in logistics or optimal strategies for high speed trading. In general, a set of parameters (parameter space) is tuned to find the lowest value of a function depending on these parameters (cost function). In most cases the parameter space is too big to be completely searched and the most efficient techniques combine stochastic elements (randomness included in the starting setting and decision making during the optimization process) with well designed deterministic process. Thus there is nothing like a universal best optimization method; rather than that, different methods and their settings are more or less efficient in different contexts. Here we present a method that integrates Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a highly effective and successful algorithm inspired by the collective behavior of a flock of birds searching for food, with the principles of Harmonic Oscillators. This physics-based approach introduces the concept of energy, enabling a smoother and a more controlled convergence throughout the optimization process. We test our method on a standard set of test functions and show that in most cases it can outperform its natural competitors including the original PSO as well as the broadly used COBYLA and Differential Evolution optimization methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
