Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: An efficient sensitivity analysis for energy performance of a building envelope: a continuous derivative based approach\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Within the framework of building energy assessment, this article proposes to use a derivative based sensitivity analysis of heat transfer models in a building envelope. Two, global and local, estimators are obtained at low computational cost, to evaluate the influence of the parameters on the model outputs. Ranking of these estimators values allows to reduce the number of model unknown parameters by excluding non-significant parameters. A comparison with variance and regression-based methods is carried out and the results highlight the satisfactory accuracy of the continuous-based approach. Moreover, for the carried investigations the approach is 100100100 times faster compared to the variance-based methods. A case study applies the method to a real-world building wall. The sensitivity of the thermal loads to local or global variations of the wall thermal is investigated. Additionally, a case study of wall with window is analyzed. Key words: heat transfer; sensitivity analysis; continuous derivative based approach; parameter estimation problem ; Dufort–Frankel numerical scheme; sensitivity coefficients\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
