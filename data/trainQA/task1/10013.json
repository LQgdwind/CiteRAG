      "content": "Paper Title: On the Amplification of Cache Occupancy Attacks in Randomized Cache Architectures\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Cache memory improves the performance of the system by buffering data close to the processor, reducing the overall access time. The difference in access time leads to a timing channel that can be leveraged by attackers to reveal sensitive information about another process. Previous works have exploited this timing channel by enforcing contention inside specific locations in the cache with victim process to launch eviction-based cache attacks. Consequently, a number of countermeasures have been proposed to thwart such attacks, with a major impetus on the use of Randomized and Partitioned Cache. Interestingly, majority of these works try to protect the last level cache (LLC) from a specific type of attack: contention-based cache attack. In this work, we explore the possibility of other cache attack variants and the implications of secured cache design rationales on such attacks. In particular, we show that one of the well-known cache randomization schemes MIRAGE, touted to be resilient against eviction-based attacks, amplifies the chances of cache occupancy attack, making it more vulnerable compared to contemporary designs. We leverage MIRAGE’s global eviction property to demonstrate covert channel with byte-level granularity, with far less cache occupancy requirement (just 10%percent1010\\% of LLC) than other schemes. For instance, ScatterCache (a randomisation scheme with lesser security guarantees than MIRAGE) and generic set-associative caches require 40%percent4040\\% and 30%percent3030\\% cache occupancy, respectively, to exhibit covert communication. Furthermore, we extend our attack vectors to include side-channel, template based fingerprinting of workloads in a cross-core setting. We demonstrate the potency of such fingerprinting on both inhouse LLC simulator as well as on SPEC2017 workloads on gem5. Finally, we pinpoint implementation inconsistencies in MIRAGE’s publicly available gem5 artifact which motivates a re-evaluation of the performance statistics of MIRAGE with respect to ScatterCache and baseline set-associative cache. We find MIRAGE, in reality, performs worse than what is previously reported in literature, a concern that should be addressed in successor generations of secured caches.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
