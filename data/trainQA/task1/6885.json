Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Task Adversarial Training Algorithm for Multi-Speaker Neural Text-to-Speech\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We propose a novel training algorithm for a multi-speaker neural text-to-speech (TTS) model based on multi-task adversarial training. A conventional generative adversarial network (GAN)-based training algorithm significantly improves the quality of synthetic speech by reducing the statistical difference between natural and synthetic speech. However, the algorithm does not guarantee the generalization performance of the trained TTS model in synthesizing voices of unseen speakers who are not included in the training data. Our algorithm alternatively trains two deep neural networks: multi-task discriminator and multi-speaker neural TTS model (i.e., generator of GANs). The discriminator is trained not only to distinguish between natural and synthetic speech but also to verify the speaker of input speech is existent or non-existent (i.e., newly generated by interpolating seen speakersâ€™ embedding vectors). Meanwhile, the generator is trained to minimize the weighted sum of the speech reconstruction loss and adversarial loss for fooling the discriminator, which achieves high-quality multi-speaker TTS even if the target speaker is unseen. Experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm improves the quality of synthetic speech better than a conventional GANSpeech algorithm.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
