Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Fully-Integrated 5mW, 0.8Gbps Energy-Efficient Chip-to-Chip Data Link for Ultra-Low-Power IoT End-Nodes in 65-nm CMOS\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The increasing complexity of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications and near-sensor processing algorithms is pushing the computational power of low-power, battery-operated end-node systems. This trend also reveals growing demands for high-speed and energy-efficient inter-chip communications to manage the increasing amount of data coming from off-chip sensors and memories. While traditional micro-controller interfaces such as SPIs cannot cope with tight energy and large bandwidth requirements, low-voltage swing transceivers can tackle this challenge thanks to their capability to achieve several Gbps of the communication speed at milliwatt power levels. However, recent research on high-speed serial links focused on high-performance systems, with a power consumption significantly larger than the one of low-power IoT end-nodes, or on stand-alone designs not integrated at a system level. This paper presents a low-swing transceiver for the energy-efficient and low power chip-to-chip communication fully integrated within an IoT end-node System-on-Chip, fabricated in CMOS 65nm technology. The transceiver can be easily controlled via a software interface; thus, we can consider realistic scenarios for the data communication, which cannot be assessed in stand-alone prototypes. Chip measurements show that the transceiver achieves 8.46x higher energy efficiency at 15.9x higher performance than a traditional microcontroller interface such as a single-SPI.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
