Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 43 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Performance Analysis of FEM Solvers on Practical Electromagnetic Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The paper presents a comparative analysis of different commercial and academic software. The comparison aims to examine how the integrated adaptive grid refinement methodologies can deal with challenging, electromagnetic-field related problems. For this comparison, two benchmark problems were examined in the paper. The first example is a solution of an L-shape domain like test problem, which has a singularity at a certain point in the geometry. The second problem is an induction heated aluminum rod, which accurate solution needs to solve a non-linear, coupled physical fields. The accurate solution of this problem requires applying adaptive mesh generation strategies or applying a very fine mesh in the electromagnetic domain, which can significantly increase the computational complexity. The results show that the fully-hp adaptive meshing strategies, which are integrated into Agros-suite, can significantly reduce the task‚Äôs computational complexity compared to the automatic h-adaptivity, which is part of the examined, popular commercial solvers.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 43 most likely reference titles for this paper.
