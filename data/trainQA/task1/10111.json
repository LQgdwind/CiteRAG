For a pair of nodes s𝑠s and t𝑡t on a graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E), the PPR value π​(s,t)𝜋𝑠𝑡\\pi(s,t) is defined as the probability that an α𝛼\\alpha-discounted random walk from s𝑠s terminates at t𝑡t, where the walk terminates with probability α𝛼\\alpha at each step. We study the classic Single-Source PPR query, which asks for PPR approximations from a given source node s𝑠s to all nodes in the graph. Specifically, we aim to provide approximations with absolute error guarantees, ensuring that the resultant PPR estimates π^​(s,t)^𝜋𝑠𝑡\\hat{\\pi}(s,t) satisfy maxt∈V⁡|π^​(s,t)−π​(s,t)|≤εsubscript𝑡𝑉^𝜋𝑠𝑡𝜋𝑠𝑡𝜀\\max_{t\\in V}\\big{|}\\hat{\\pi}(s,t)-\\pi(s,t)\\big{|}\\leq\\varepsilon for a given error bound ε𝜀\\varepsilon. We propose an algorithm that achieves this with high probability, with an expected running time of • O~​(m/ε)~𝑂𝑚𝜀\\widetilde{O}\\big{(}\\sqrt{m}/\\varepsilon\\big{)} for directed graphs333O~​(⋅)~𝑂⋅\\widetilde{O}(\\cdot) suppresses polylog⁡(n)polylog𝑛\\operatorname{polylog}(n) factors., where m=|E|𝑚𝐸m=|E|; • O~​(dmax/ε)~𝑂subscript𝑑𝜀\\widetilde{O}\\big{(}\\sqrt{d_{\\max}}/\\varepsilon\\big{)} for undirected graphs, where dmaxsubscript𝑑d_{\\max} is the maximum node degree in the graph; • O~​(nγ−1/2/ε)~𝑂superscript𝑛𝛾12𝜀\\widetilde{O}\\left(n^{\\gamma-1/2}/\\varepsilon\\right) for power-law graphs, where n=|V|𝑛𝑉n=|V| and γ∈(12,1)𝛾121\\gamma\\in\\left(\\frac{1}{2},1\\right) is the extent of the power law. These sublinear bounds improve upon existing results. We also study the case when degree-normalized absolute error guarantees are desired, requiring maxt∈V⁡|π^​(s,t)/d​(t)−π​(s,t)/d​(t)|≤εdsubscript𝑡𝑉^𝜋𝑠𝑡𝑑𝑡𝜋𝑠𝑡𝑑𝑡subscript𝜀𝑑\\max_{t\\in V}\\big{|}\\hat{\\pi}(s,t)/d(t)-\\pi(s,t)/d(t)\\big{|}\\leq\\varepsilon_{d} for a given error bound εdsubscript𝜀𝑑\\varepsilon_{d}, where the graph is undirected and d​(t)𝑑𝑡d(t) is the degree of node t𝑡t. We give an algorithm that provides this error guarantee with high probability, achieving an expected complexity of O~​(∑t∈Vπ​(s,t)/d​(t)/εd)~𝑂subscript𝑡𝑉𝜋𝑠𝑡𝑑𝑡subscript𝜀𝑑\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\sqrt{\\sum_{t\\in V}\\pi(s,t)/d(t)}\\big{/}\\varepsilon_{d}\\right). This improves over the previously known O​(1/εd)𝑂1subscript𝜀𝑑O(1/\\varepsilon_{d}) complexity.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
