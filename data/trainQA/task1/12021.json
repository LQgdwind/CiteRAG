Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: To Optimize Human-in-the-loop Learning in Repeated Routing Games\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Today navigation applications (e.g., Waze and Google Maps) enable human users to learn and share the latest traffic observations, yet such information sharing simply aids selfish users to predict and choose the shortest paths to jam each other. Prior routing game studies focus on myopic users in oversimplified one-shot scenarios to regulate selfish routing via information hiding or pricing mechanisms. For practical human-in-the-loop learning (HILL) in repeated routing games, we face non-myopic users of differential past observations and need new mechanisms (preferably non-monetary) to persuade users to adhere to the optimal path recommendations. We model the repeated routing game in a typical parallel transportation network, which generally contains one deterministic path and NùëÅN stochastic paths. We first prove that no matter under the information sharing mechanism in use or the latest routing literature‚Äôs hiding mechanism, the resultant price of anarchy (PoA) for measuring the efficiency loss from social optimum can approach infinity, telling arbitrarily poor exploration-exploitation tradeoff over time. Then we propose a novel user-differential probabilistic recommendation (UPR) mechanism to differentiate and randomize path recommendations for users with differential learning histories. We prove that our UPR mechanism ensures interim individual rationality for all users and significantly reduces PoA=‚àûPoA\\text{PoA}=\\infty to close-to-optimal PoA=1+14‚ÄãN+3PoA114ùëÅ3\\text{PoA}=1+\\frac{1}{4N+3}, which cannot be further reduced by any other non-monetary mechanism. In addition to theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments using real-world datasets to generalize our routing graphs and validate the close-to-optimal performance of UPR mechanism.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
