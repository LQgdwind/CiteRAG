Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 58 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Quantum-Classical Tradeoffs in the Random Oracle Model\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study tradeoffs between quantum and classical queries for hybrid algorithms that have black-box access to a random oracle. Although there are several established techniques for proving query lower bounds for both quantum and classical algorithms, there is no such widely applicable technique for hybrid algorithms and the optimal tradeoffs for many fundamental problems are still unknown — an optimal tradeoff for the search problem was only shown recently by Rosmanis [Ros22], although not in the random oracle model. For another fundamental problem, collision finding, the optimal tradeoff was not known. In this work, we develop a framework for recording a query transcript for quantum-classical algorithms that represents the knowledge gained by the algorithm. The main feature of this framework is to allow us to record queries in two incompatible bases — classical queries in the standard basis and quantum queries in the Fourier basis — in a consistent way. We call the framework the hybrid compressed oracle as it naturally interpolates between the classical way of recording queries and the compressed oracle framework of Zhandry [Zha19] for recording quantum queries. We demonstrate its applicability by giving a simpler proof of the optimal quantum-classical tradeoff for search and by showing an optimal tradeoff for collision finding.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
