Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 59 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Describe What to Change: A Text-guided Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Manipulating visual attributes of images through human-written text is a very challenging task. On the one hand, models have to learn the manipulation without the ground truth of the desired output. On the other hand, models have to deal with the inherent ambiguity of natural language. Previous research usually requires either the user to describe all the characteristics of the desired image or to use richly-annotated image captioning datasets. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised approach, based on image-to-image translation, that alters the attributes of a given image through a command-like sentence such as “change the hair color to black”. Contrarily to state-of-the-art approaches, our model does not require a human-annotated dataset nor a textual description of all the attributes of the desired image, but only those that have to be modified. Our proposed model disentangles the image content from the visual attributes, and it learns to modify the latter using the textual description, before generating a new image from the content and the modified attribute representation. Because text might be inherently ambiguous (blond hair may refer to different shadows of blond, e.g. golden, icy, sandy), our method generates multiple stochastic versions of the same translation. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves promising performances on two large-scale public datasets: CelebA and CUB. We believe our approach will pave the way to new avenues of research combining textual and speech commands with visual attributes.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 59\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
