Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Evaluating and Improving Continual Learning in Spoken Language Understanding\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Continual learning has emerged as an increasingly important challenge across various tasks, including Spoken Language Understanding (SLU). In SLU, its objective is to effectively handle the emergence of new concepts and evolving environments. The evaluation of continual learning algorithms typically involves assessing the modelâ€™s stability, plasticity, and generalizability as fundamental aspects of standards. However, existing continual learning metrics primarily focus on only one or two of the properties. They neglect the overall performance across all tasks, and do not adequately disentangle the plasticity versus stability/generalizability trade-offs within the model. In this work, we propose an evaluation methodology that provides a unified evaluation on stability, plasticity, and generalizability in continual learning. By employing the proposed metric, we demonstrate how introducing various knowledge distillations can improve different aspects of these three properties of the SLU model. We further show that our proposed metric is more sensitive in capturing the impact of task ordering in continual learning, making it better suited for practical use-case scenarios.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 52\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
