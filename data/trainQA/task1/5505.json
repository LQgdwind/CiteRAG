Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: WaveMix: Resource-efficient Token Mixing for Images\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Although certain vision transformer (ViT) and CNN architectures generalize well on vision tasks, it is often impractical to use them on green, edge, or desktop computing due to their computational requirements for training and even testing. We present WaveMix as an alternative neural architecture that uses a multi-scale 2D discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for spatial token mixing. Unlike ViTs, WaveMix neither unrolls the image nor requires self-attention of quadratic complexity. Additionally, DWT introduces another inductive bias – besides convolutional filtering – to utilize the 2D structure of an image to improve generalization. The multi-scale nature of the DWT also reduces the requirement for a deeper architecture compared to the CNNs, as the latter relies on pooling for partial spatial mixing. WaveMix models show generalization that is competitive with ViTs, CNNs, and token mixers on several datasets while requiring lower GPU RAM (training and testing), number of computations, and storage. WaveMix have achieved State-of-the-art (SOTA) results in EMNIST Byclass and EMNIST Balanced datasets.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
