Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Learn distributed GAN with Temporary Discriminators\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this work, we propose a method for training distributed GAN with sequential temporary discriminators. Our proposed method tackles the challenge of training GAN in the federated learning manner: How to update the generator with a flow of temporary discriminators? We apply our proposed method to learn a self-adaptive generator with a series of local discriminators from multiple data centers. We show our design of loss function indeed learns the correct distribution with provable guarantees. The empirical experiments show that our approach is capable of generating synthetic data which is practical for real-world applications such as training a segmentation model. Our TDGAN Code is available at: https://github.com/huiqu18/TDGAN-PyTorch.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
