Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Drug and Disease Interpretation Learning with Biomedical Entity Representation Transformer\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Concept normalization in free-form texts is a crucial step in every text-mining pipeline. Neural architectures based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) have achieved state-of-the-art results in the biomedical domain. In the context of drug discovery and development, clinical trials are necessary to establish the efficacy and safety of drugs. We investigate the effectiveness of transferring concept normalization from the general biomedical domain to the clinical trials domain in a zero-shot setting with an absence of labeled data. We propose a simple and effective two-stage neural approach based on fine-tuned BERT architectures. In the first stage, we train a metric learning model that optimizes relative similarity of mentions and concepts via triplet loss. The model is trained on available labeled corpora of scientific abstracts to obtain vector embeddings of concept names and entity mentions from texts. In the second stage, we find the closest concept name representation in an embedding space to a given clinical mention. We evaluated several models, including state-of-the-art architectures, on a dataset of abstracts and a real-world dataset of trial records with interventions and conditions mapped to drug and disease terminologies. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in knowledge transfer from the scientific literature to clinical trials.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 51\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
