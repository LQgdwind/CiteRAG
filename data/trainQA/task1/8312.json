Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 61 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Design Patterns for AI-based Systems: A Multivocal Literature Review and Pattern Repository\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Systems with artificial intelligence components, so-called AI-based systems, have gained considerable attention recently. However, many organizations have issues with achieving production readiness with such systems. As a means to improve certain software quality attributes and to address frequently occurring problems, design patterns represent proven solution blueprints. While new patterns for AI-based systems are emerging, existing patterns have also been adapted to this new context. The goal of this study is to provide an overview of design patterns for AI-based systems, both new and adapted ones. We want to collect and categorize patterns, and make them accessible for researchers and practitioners. To this end, we first performed a multivocal literature review (MLR) to collect design patterns used with AI-based systems. We then integrated the created pattern collection into a web-based pattern repository to make the patterns browsable and easy to find. As a result, we selected 51 resources (35 white and 16 gray ones), from which we extracted 70 unique patterns used for AI-based systems. Among these are 34 new patterns and 36 traditional ones that have been adapted to this context. Popular pattern categories include architecture (25 patterns), deployment (16), implementation (9), or security & safety (9). While some patterns with four or more mentions already seem established, the majority of patterns have only been mentioned once or twice (51 patterns). Our results in this emerging field can be used by researchers as a foundation for follow-up studies and by practitioners to discover relevant patterns for informing the design of AI-based systems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 61\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
