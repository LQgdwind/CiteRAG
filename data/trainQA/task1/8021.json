Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Comprehensive Evaluation of RSB and Spectre Vulnerability on Modern Processors\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Performance-enhancing mechanisms such as branch prediction, out-of-order execution, and return stack buffer (RSB) have been widely employed in todayâ€™s modern processing units. Although successful in increasing the CPU performance, exploiting the design flaws and security bugs in these components have set the background for various types of microarchitectural attacks such as Spectre and Meltdown. While many attacks such as Meltdown and Spectre have been numerously implemented and analyzed on Intel processors, few researches have been carried out to evaluate their impact on ARM processors. Moreover, SpectreRSB vulnerability, the newer variant of spectre attack based on RSB, has been neglected in recent studies. In this work, we first evaluate the SpectreRSB vulnerability by implementing this attack on ARM processors, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been implemented and analyzed on ARM processors. We further present a security evaluation of ARM processors by implementing different variants of Spectre-family attacks. By analyzing the results obtained from various experiments, we evaluate ARM processors security regarding their diverse microarchitectural designs. We also introduce a high throughput and noise-free covert channel, based on the RSB structure. Based on our experiments, the throughput of the covert channel is 94.19KB/s with negligible error.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
