Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: On-the-Fly Feature Based Rapid Speaker Adaptation for Dysarthric and Elderly Speech Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Accurate recognition of dysarthric and elderly speech remain challenging tasks to date. Speaker-level heterogeneity attributed to accent or gender, when aggregated with age and speech impairment, create large diversity among these speakers. Scarcity of speaker-level data limits the practical use of data-intensive model based speaker adaptation methods. To this end, this paper proposes two novel forms of data-efficient, feature-based on-the-fly speaker adaptation methods: variance-regularized spectral basis embedding (SVR) and spectral feature driven f-LHUC transforms. Experiments conducted on UASpeech dysarthric and DementiaBank Pitt elderly speech corpora suggest the proposed on-the-fly speaker adaptation approaches consistently outperform baseline iVector adapted hybrid DNN/TDNN and E2E Conformer systems by statistically significant WER reduction of 2.48%-2.85% absolute (7.92%-8.06% relative), and offline model based LHUC adaptation by 1.82% absolute (5.63% relative) respectively.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 54\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
