Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: The complexity of separability for semilinear sets and Parikh automata\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In a separability problem, we are given two sets K𝐾K and L𝐿L from a class 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}, and we want to decide whether there exists a set S𝑆S from a class 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} such that K⊆S𝐾𝑆K\\subseteq S and S∩L=∅𝑆𝐿S\\cap L=\\emptyset. In this case, we speak of separability of sets in 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} by sets in 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S}. We study two types of separability problems. First, we consider separability of semilinear sets by recognizable sets of vectors (equivalently, by sets definable by quantifier-free monadic Presburger formulas). Second, we consider separability of languages of Parikh automata by regular languages. A Parikh automaton is a machine with access to counters that can only be incremented, and have to meet a semilinear constraint at the end of the run. Both of these separability problems are known to be decidable with elementary complexity. Our main results are that both problems are \\coNP\\coNP\\coNP-complete. In the case of semilinear sets, \\coNP\\coNP\\coNP-completeness holds regardless of whether the input sets are specified by existential Presburger formulas, quantifier-free formulas, or semilinear representations. Our results imply that recognizable separability of rational subsets of Σ∗×ℕdsuperscriptΣsuperscriptℕ𝑑\\Sigma^{*}\\times\\mathbb{N}^{d} (shown decidable by Choffrut and Grigorieff) is \\coNP\\coNP\\coNP-complete as well. Another application is that regularity of deterministic Parikh automata (where the target set is specified using a quantifier-free Presburger formula) is \\coNP\\coNP\\coNP-complete as well.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
