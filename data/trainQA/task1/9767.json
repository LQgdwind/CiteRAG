Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: QKSAN: A Quantum Kernel Self-Attention Network\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Self-Attention Mechanism (SAM) excels at distilling important information from the interior of data to improve the computational efficiency of models. Nevertheless, many Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models lack the ability to distinguish the intrinsic connections of information like SAM, which limits their effectiveness on massive high-dimensional quantum data. To tackle the above issue, a Quantum Kernel Self-Attention Mechanism (QKSAM) is introduced to combine the data representation merit of Quantum Kernel Methods (QKM) with the efficient information extraction capability of SAM. Further, a Quantum Kernel Self-Attention Network (QKSAN) framework is proposed based on QKSAM, which ingeniously incorporates the Deferred Measurement Principle (DMP) and conditional measurement techniques to release half of quantum resources by mid-circuit measurement, thereby bolstering both feasibility and adaptability. Simultaneously, the Quantum Kernel Self-Attention Score (QKSAS) with an exponentially large characterization space is spawned to accommodate more information and determine the measurement conditions. Eventually, four QKSAN sub-models are deployed on PennyLane and IBM Qiskit platforms to perform binary classification on MNIST and Fashion MNIST, where the QKSAS tests and correlation assessments between noise immunity and learning ability are executed on the best-performing sub-model. The paramount experimental finding is that a potential learning advantage is revealed in partial QKSAN subclasses that acquire an impressive more than 98.05% high accuracy with very few parameters that are much less in aggregate than classical machine learning models. Predictably, QKSAN lays the foundation for future quantum computers to perform machine learning on massive amounts of data while driving advances in areas such as quantum computer vision.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
