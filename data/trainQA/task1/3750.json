The analysis of BNs might be infeasible for medium to large BNs due to the state-space explosion problem. We propose a novel reduction technique called Backward Boolean Equivalence (BBE), which preserves some properties of interest of BNs. In particular, reduced BNs provide a compact representation by grouping variables that, if initialized equally, are always updated equally. The resulting reduced state space is a subset of the original one, restricted to identical initialization of grouped variables. The corresponding trajectories of the original BN can be exactly restored. We show the effectiveness of BBE by performing a large-scale validation on the whole GINsim BN repository. In selected cases, we show how our method enables analyses that would be otherwise intractable. Our method complements, and can be combined with, other reduction methods found in the literature.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
