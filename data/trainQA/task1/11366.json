Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: ROVER: RTL Optimization via Verified E-Graph Rewriting\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Manual RTL design and optimization remains prevalent across the semiconductor industry because commercial logic and high-level synthesis tools are unable to match human designs. Our experience in industrial datapath design demonstrates that manual optimization can typically be decomposed into a sequence of local equivalence preserving transformations. By formulating datapath optimization as a graph rewriting problem we automate design space exploration in a tool we call ROVER. We develop a set of mixed precision RTL rewrite rules inspired by designers at Intel and an accompanying automated validation framework. A particular challenge in datapath design is to determine a productive order in which to apply transformations as this can be design dependent. ROVER resolves this problem by building upon the e-graph data structure, which compactly represents a design space of equivalent implementations. By applying rewrites to this data structure, ROVER generates a set of efficient and functionally equivalent design options. From the ROVER generated e-graph we select an efficient implementation. To accurately model the circuit area we develop a theoretical cost metric and then an integer linear programming model to extract the optimal implementation. To build trust in the generated design ROVER also produces a back-end verification certificate that can be checked using industrial tools. We apply ROVER to both Intel-provided and open-source benchmarks, and see up to a 63% reduction in circuit area. ROVER is also able to generate a customized library of distinct implementations from a given parameterizable RTL design, improving circuit area across the range of possible instantiations.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
