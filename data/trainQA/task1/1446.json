Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 43 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: SAF: Simulated Annealing Fair Scheduling for Hadoop Yarn Clusters\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Apache introduced YARN as the next generation of the Hadoop framework, providing resource management and a central platform to deliver consistent data governance tools across Hadoop clusters. Hadoop YARN supports multiple frameworks like MapReduce to process different types of data and works with different scheduling policies such as FIFO, Capacity, and Fair schedulers. DRF is the best option that uses short-term, without considering history information, convergence to fairness for multi-type resource allocation. However, DRF performance is still not satisfying due to trade-offs between fairness and performance regarding resource utilization. To address this problem, we propose Simulated Annealing Fair scheduling, SAF, a long-term fair scheme in resource allocation to have fairness and excellent performance in terms of resource utilization and MakeSpan. We introduce a new parameter as entropy, which is an approach to indicates the disorder in the fairness of allocated resources of the whole cluster. We implemented SAF as a pluggable scheduler in Hadoop Yarn Cluster and evaluated it with standard MapReduce benchmarks in Yarn Scheduler Load Simulator (SLS) and CloudSim Plus simulation framework. Finally, the results of both simulation tools are evidence to prove our claim. Compared to DRF, SAF increases resource utilization of YARN clusters significantly and decreases MakeSpan to an appropriate level.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 43 most likely reference titles for this paper.
