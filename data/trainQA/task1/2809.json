Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Quasi-structured quadrilateral meshing in Gmsh – a robust pipeline for complex CAD models\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We propose an end-to-end pipeline to robustly generate high-quality quadrilateral meshes for complex CAD models. An initial quad-dominant mesh is generated with frontal point insertion guided by a locally integrable cross field and a scalar size map adapted to the small CAD features. After triangle combination and midpoint-subdivision into an all-quadrilateral mesh, the topology of the mesh is modified to reduce the number of irregular vertices. The idea is to preserve the irregular vertices matching cross-field singularities and to eliminate the others. The topological modifications are either local and based on disk quadrangulations, or more global with the remeshing of patches of quads according to predefined patterns. Validity of the quad mesh is guaranteed by monitoring element quality during all operations and reverting the changes when necessary. Advantages of our approach include robustness, strict respect of the CAD features and support for user-prescribed size constraints. The quad mesher, which is available in Gmsh, is validated and illustrated on two datasets of CAD models.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
