Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: HCFL: A High Compression Approach for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning in Very Large Scale IoT Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Federated learning (FL) is a new artificial intelligence concept that enables Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices to learn a collaborative model without sending the raw data to centralized nodes for processing. Despite numerous advantages, low computing resources at IoT devices and high communication costs for exchanging model parameters make applications of FL in massive IoT networks very limited. In this work, we develop a novel compression scheme for FL, called high-compression federated learning (HCFL), for very large scale IoT networks. HCFL can reduce the data load for FL processes without changing their structure and hyperparameters. In this way, we not only can significantly reduce communication costs, but also make intensive learning processes more adaptable on low-computing resource IoT devices. Furthermore, we investigate a relationship between the number of IoT devices and the convergence level of the FL model and thereby better assess the quality of the FL process. We demonstrate our HCFL scheme in both simulations and mathematical analyses. Our proposed theoretical research can be used as a minimum level of satisfaction, proving that the FL process can achieve good performance when a determined configuration is met. Therefore, we show that HCFL is applicable in any FL-integrated networks with numerous IoT devices.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
