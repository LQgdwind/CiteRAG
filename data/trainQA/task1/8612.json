Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 59 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms on real-world data: how many do we need?\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this study we evaluate 323232 unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms on 525252 real-world multivariate tabular datasets, performing the largest comparison of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms to date. On this collection of datasets, the kùëòk-thNN (distance to the kùëòk-nearest neighbor) algorithm significantly outperforms the most other algorithms. Visualizing and then clustering the relative performance of the considered algorithms on all datasets, we identify two clear clusters: one with ‚Äúlocal‚Äù datasets, and another with ‚Äúglobal‚Äù datasets. ‚ÄúLocal‚Äù anomalies occupy a region with low density when compared to nearby samples, while ‚Äúglobal‚Äù occupy an overall low density region in the feature space. On the local datasets the kùëòkNN (kùëòk-nearest neighbor) algorithm comes out on top. On the global datasets, the EIF (extended isolation forest) algorithm performs the best. Also taking into consideration the algorithms‚Äô computational complexity, a toolbox with these three unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms suffices for finding anomalies in this representative collection of multivariate datasets. By providing access to code and datasets, our study can be easily reproduced and extended with more algorithms and/or datasets.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper.
