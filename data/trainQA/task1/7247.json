      "content": "Paper Title: Farm-wide virtual load monitoring for offshore wind structures via Bayesian neural networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Offshore wind structures are exposed to a harsh marine environment and are subject to deterioration mechanisms throughout their operational lifetime. Even if the deterioration evolution of structural elements can be estimated through physics-based deterioration models, the uncertainties involved in the process hurdle the selection of lifecycle management decisions, e.g., lifetime extension. In this scenario, the collection of relevant information through an efficient monitoring system enables the reduction of uncertainties, ultimately driving more optimal lifecycle decisions. However, a full monitoring instrumentation implemented on all wind turbines in a farm might become unfeasible due to practical and economical constraints. Besides, certain load monitoring systems often become defective after a few years of marine environment exposure. Addressing the aforementioned concerns, a farm-wide virtual load monitoring scheme directed by a fleet-leader wind turbine offers an attractive solution. Fetched with data retrieved from a fully instrumented wind turbine, a model can be firstly trained and then deployed, thus yielding load predictions of non-fully monitored wind turbines, from which only standard data remains available, e.g., SCADA. During its deployment stage, the pretrained virtual monitoring model might, however, receive previously unseen monitoring data, thus often producing inaccurate load predictions. In this paper, we propose a virtual load monitoring framework formulated via Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and we provide relevant implementation details needed for the construction, training, and deployment of BNN data-based virtual monitoring models. As opposed to their deterministic counterparts, BNNs intrinsically announce the uncertainties associated with generated load predictions and allow to detect inaccurate load estimations generated for non-fully monitored wind turbines. The proposed virtual load monitoring is thoroughly tested through an experimental campaign in an operational offshore wind farm and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of BNN models for ‘fleet-leader’-based farm-wide virtual monitoring.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
