      "content": "Paper Title: A DeepLearning Framework for Dynamic Estimation of Origin-Destination Sequence\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract OD matrix estimation is a critical problem in the transportation domain. The principle method uses the trafﬁc sensor measured information such as trafﬁc counts to estimate the trafﬁc demand represented by the OD matrix. The problem is divided into two categories: static OD matrix estimation and dynamic OD matrices sequence(OD sequence for short) estimation. The above two face the underdetermination problem caused by abundant estimated parameters and insufﬁcient constraint information. In addition, OD sequence estimation also faces the lag challenge: due to different traffic conditions such as congestion, identical vehicle will appear on different road sections during the same observation period, resulting in identical OD demands correspond to different trips. To this end, this paper proposes an integrated method, which uses deep learning methods to infer the structure of OD sequence and uses structural constraints to guide traditional numerical optimization. Our experiments show that the neural network(NN) can effectively infer the structure of the OD sequence and provide practical constraints for numerical optimization to obtain better results. Moreover, the experiments show that provided structural information contains not only constraints on the spatial structure of OD matrices but also provides constraints on the temporal structure of OD sequence, which solve the effect of the lagging problem well.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
