Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 59 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Cyber-physical and business perspectives using Federated Digital Twins in multinational and multimodal transportation systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Digital Twin (DT) technologies promise to remove cyber-physical barriers in systems and services and provide seamless management of distributed resources effectively. Ideally, full-fledged instantiations of DT offer bi-directional features for physical-virtual representations, tackling data governance, risk assessment, security and privacy protections, resilience, and performance, to name a few characteristics. More broadly, Federated Digital Twins (FDT) are distributed physical-virtual counterparts that collaborate for enacting synchronisation and accurate mapping of multiple DT instances. In this work we focus on understanding and conceptualising the cyber-physical and business perspectives using FDT in multinational and multimodal transportation systems. These settings enforce a plethora of regulations, compliance, standards in the physical counterpart that must be carefully considered in the virtual mirroring. Our aim is to discuss the regulatory and technical underpinnings and, consequently, the existing operational and budgetary overheads to factor in when designing or operating FDT.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 59\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
