Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: An Exposition of Pathfinding Strategies Within Lightning Network Clients\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The Lightning Network is a peer-to-peer network designed to address Bitcoin’s scalability challenges, facilitating rapid, cost-effective, and instantaneous transactions through bidirectional, blockchain-backed payment channels among network peers. Due to a source-based routing of payments, different pathfinding strategies are used in practice, trading off different objectives for each other such as payment reliability and routing fees. This paper explores differences within pathfinding strategies used by prominent Lightning Network node implementations, which include different underlying cost functions and different constraints, as well as different greedy algorithms of shortest path-type. Surprisingly, we observe that the pathfinding problems that most LN node implementations attempt to solve are NP-complete, and cannot be guaranteed to be optimally solved by the variants of Dijkstra’s algorithm currently deployed in production. Through comparative analysis and simulations, we evaluate efficacy of different pathfinding strategies across metrics such as success rate, fees, path length, and timelock. Our experiments indicate that the strategies used by LND tend to be advantageous in terms of payment reliability, Eclair tends to result in paths with low fees, and that LDK exhibits average reliability with larger fee levels for smaller payment amounts; furthermore, CLN stands out for its minimal timelock paths. Additionally, we investigate the impact of Lightning node connectivity levels on routing efficiency. The findings of our analysis provide insights towards future improvements of pathfinding strategies and algorithms used within the Lightning Network.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
