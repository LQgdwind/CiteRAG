Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Discourse-level Relation Extraction via Graph Pooling\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The ability to capture complex linguistic structures and long-term dependencies among words in the passage is essential for discourse-level relation extraction (DRE) tasks. Graph neural networks (GNNs), one of the methods to encode dependency graphs, have been shown effective in prior works for DRE. However, relatively little attention has been paid to receptive fields of GNNs, which can be crucial for cases with extremely long text that requires discourse understanding. In this work, we leverage the idea of graph pooling and propose to use pooling-unpooling framework on DRE tasks. The pooling branch reduces the graph size and enables the GNNs to obtain larger receptive fields within fewer layers; the unpooling branch restores the pooled graph to its original resolution so that representations for entity mention can be extracted. We propose Clause Matching (CM), a novel linguistically inspired graph pooling method for NLP tasks. Experiments on two DRE datasets demonstrate that our models significantly improve over baselines when modeling long-term dependencies is required, which shows the effectiveness of the pooling-unpooling framework and our CM pooling method.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
