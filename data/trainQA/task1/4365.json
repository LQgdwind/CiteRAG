Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Dual Dynamic Representations on Time-Sliced User-Item Interaction Graphs for Sequential Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Sequential Recommendation aims to recommend items that a target user will interact with in the near future based on the historically interacted items. While modeling temporal dynamics is crucial for sequential recommendation, most of the existing studies concentrate solely on the user side while overlooking the sequential patterns existing in the counterpart, i.e., the item side. Although a few studies investigate the dynamics involved in the dual sides, the complex user-item interactions are not fully exploited from a global perspective to derive dynamic user and item representations. In this paper, we devise a novel Dynamic Representation Learning model for Sequential Recommendation (DRL-SRe). To better model the user-item interactions for characterizing the dynamics from both sides, the proposed model builds a global user-item interaction graph for each time slice and exploits time-sliced graph neural networks to learn user and item representations. Moreover, to enable the model to capture fine-grained temporal information, we propose an auxiliary temporal prediction task over consecutive time slices based on temporal point process. Comprehensive experiments on three public real-world datasets demonstrate DRL-SRe outperforms the state-of-the-art sequential recommendation models with a large margin.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
