Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Doubly Stochastic Subspace Clustering\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Many state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods follow a two-step process by first constructing an affinity matrix between data points and then applying spectral clustering to this affinity. Most of the research into these methods focuses on the first step of generating the affinity, which often exploits the self-expressive property of linear subspaces, with little consideration typically given to the spectral clustering step that produces the final clustering. Moreover, existing methods often obtain the final affinity that is used in the spectral clustering step by applying ad-hoc or arbitrarily chosen postprocessing steps to the affinity generated by a self-expressive clustering formulation, which can have a significant impact on the overall clustering performance. In this work, we unify these two steps by learning both a self-expressive representation of the data and an affinity matrix that is well-normalized for spectral clustering. In our proposed models, we constrain the affinity matrix to be doubly stochastic, which results in a principled method for affinity matrix normalization while also exploiting known benefits of doubly stochastic normalization in spectral clustering. We develop a general framework and derive two models: one that jointly learns the self-expressive representation along with the doubly stochastic affinity, and one that sequentially solves for one then the other. Furthermore, we leverage sparsity in the problem to develop a fast active-set method for the sequential solver that enables efficient computation on large datasets. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art subspace clustering performance on many common datasets in computer vision.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
