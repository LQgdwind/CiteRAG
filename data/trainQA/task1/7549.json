Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Complex-valued Retrievals From Noisy Images Using Diffusion Models\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In diverse microscopy modalities, sensors measure only real-valued intensities. Additionally, the sensor readouts are affected by Poissonian-distributed photon noise. Traditional restoration algorithms typically aim to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between the original and recovered images. This often leads to blurry outcomes with poor perceptual quality. Recently, deep diffusion models (DDMs) have proven to be highly capable of sampling images from the a-posteriori probability of the sought variables, resulting in visually pleasing high-quality images. These models have mostly been suggested for real-valued images suffering from Gaussian noise. In this study, we generalize annealed Langevin Dynamics, a type of DDM, to tackle the fundamental challenges in optical imaging of complex-valued objects (and real images) affected by Poisson noise. We apply our algorithm to various optical scenarios, such as Fourier Ptychography, Phase Retrieval, and Poisson denoising. Our algorithm is evaluated on simulations and biological empirical data.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
