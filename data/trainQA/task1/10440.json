      "content": "Paper Title: Graph Domain Adaptation: Challenges, Progress and Prospects\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract As graph representation learning often suffers from label scarcity problems in real-world applications, researchers have proposed graph domain adaptation (GDA) as an effective knowledge-transfer paradigm across graphs. In particular, to enhance model performance on target graphs with specific tasks, GDA introduces a bunch of task-related graphs as source graphs and adapts the knowledge learnt from source graphs to the target graphs. Since GDA combines the advantages of graph representation learning and domain adaptation, it has become a promising direction of transfer learning on graphs and has attracted an increasing amount of research interest in recent years. In this paper, we comprehensively overview the studies of GDA and present a detailed survey of recent advances. Specifically, we outline the research status and challenges, propose a taxonomy, introduce the details of representative works, and discuss the prospects. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first survey for graph domain adaptation. A detailed paper list is available at https://github.com/Skyorca/Awesome-Graph-Domain-Adaptation-Papers.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 57\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
