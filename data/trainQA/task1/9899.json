Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: The Complexity of Verifying Boolean Programs as Differentially Private\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study the complexity of the problem of verifying differential privacy for while-like programs working over boolean values and making probabilistic choices. Programs in this class can be interpreted into finite-state discrete-time Markov Chains (DTMC). We show that the problem of deciding whether a program is differentially private for specific values of the privacy parameters is 𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄\\mathbf{PSPACE}-complete. To show that this problem is in 𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄\\mathbf{PSPACE}, we adapt classical results about computing hitting probabilities for DTMC. To show 𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄\\mathbf{PSPACE}-hardness we use a reduction from the problem of checking whether a program almost surely terminates or not. We also show that the problem of approximating the privacy parameters that a program provides is 𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄\\mathbf{PSPACE}-hard. Moreover, we investigate the complexity of similar problems also for several relaxations of differential privacy: Rényi differential privacy, concentrated differential privacy, and truncated concentrated differential privacy. For these notions, we consider gap-versions of the problem of deciding whether a program is private or not and we show that all of them are PSPACE-complete.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
