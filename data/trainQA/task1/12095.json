Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Computational methods for finding bi-regular cages\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract An ({r,m};g)ùëüùëöùëî(\\{r,m\\};g)-graph is a (simple, undirected) graph of girth g‚â•3ùëî3g\\geq 3 with vertices of degrees rùëür and mùëöm where 2‚â§r<m2ùëüùëö2\\leq r<m . Given r,m,gùëüùëöùëîr,m,g, we seek the ({r,m};g)ùëüùëöùëî(\\{r,m\\};g)-graphs of minimum order, called ({r,m};g)ùëüùëöùëî(\\{r,m\\};g)-cages or bi-regular cages, whose order is denoted by n‚Äã({r,m};g)ùëõùëüùëöùëîn(\\{r,m\\};g). In this paper, we use computational methods for finding ({r,m};g)ùëüùëöùëî(\\{r,m\\};g)-graphs of small order. Firstly, we present an exhaustive generation algorithm, which leads to ‚Äì previously unknown ‚Äì exhaustive lists of ({r,m};g)ùëüùëöùëî(\\{r,m\\};g)-cages for 242424 different triples (r,m,g)ùëüùëöùëî(r,m,g). This also leads to the improvement of the lower bound of n‚Äã({4,5};7)ùëõ457n(\\{4,5\\};7) from 66 to 69. Secondly, we improve 494949 upper bounds of n‚Äã({r,m};g)ùëõùëüùëöùëîn(\\{r,m\\};g) based on constructions that start from rùëür-regular graphs. Lastly, we generalize a theorem by Aguilar, Araujo-Pardo and Berman [arXiv:2305.03290, 2023], leading to 737373 additional improved upper bounds.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 51\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
