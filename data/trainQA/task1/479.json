Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 59 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Explaining Question Answering Models through Text Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Large pre-trained language models (LMs) have been shown to perform surprisingly well when fine-tuned on tasks that require commonsense and world knowledge. However, in end-to-end architectures, it is difficult to explain what is the knowledge in the LM that allows it to make a correct prediction. In this work, we propose a model for multi-choice question answering, where a LM-based generator generates a textual hypothesis that is later used by a classifier to answer the question. The hypothesis provides a window into the information used by the fine-tuned LM that can be inspected by humans. A key challenge in this setup is how to constrain the model to generate hypotheses that are meaningful to humans. We tackle this by (a) joint training with a simple similarity classifier that encourages meaningful hypotheses, and (b) by adding loss functions that encourage natural text without repetitions. We show on several tasks that our model reaches performance that is comparable to end-to-end architectures, while producing hypotheses that elucidate the knowledge used by the LM for answering the question.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 59\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
