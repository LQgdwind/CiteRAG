Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Online Foundation Model Selection in Robotics\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Foundation models have recently expanded into robotics after excelling in computer vision and natural language processing. The models are accessible in two ways: open-source or paid, closed-source options. Users with access to both face a problem when deciding between effective yet costly closed-source models and free but less powerful open-source alternatives. We call it the model selection problem. Existing supervised-learning methods are impractical due to the high cost of collecting extensive training data from closed-source models. Hence, we focus on the online learning setting where algorithms learn while collecting data, eliminating the need for large pre-collected datasets. We thus formulate a user-centric online model selection problem and propose a novel solution that combines an open-source encoder to output context and an online learning algorithm that processes this context. The encoder distills vast data distributions into low-dimensional features, i.e., the context, without additional training. The online learning algorithm aims to maximize a composite reward that includes model performance, execution time, and costs based on the context extracted from the data. It results in an improved trade-off between selecting open-source and closed-source models compared to non-contextual methods, as validated by our theoretical analysis. Experiments across language-based robotic tasks such as Waymo Open Dataset, ALFRED, and Open X-Embodiment demonstrate real-world applications of the solution. The results show that the solution significantly improves the task success rate by up to 14%percent1414\\%.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 55\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
