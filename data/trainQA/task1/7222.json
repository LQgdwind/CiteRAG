Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Optimal transportation for electrical impedance tomography\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. This work establishes a framework for solving inverse boundary problems with the geodesic based quadratic Wasserstein distance (W2subscriptùëä2W_{2}). A general form of the Fr√©chet gradient is systematically derived by optimal transportation (OT) theory. In addition, a fast algorithm based on the new formulation of OT on ùïä1superscriptùïä1\\mathbb{S}^{1} is developed to solve the corresponding optimal transport problem. The computational complexity of the algorithm is reduced to O‚Äã(N)ùëÇùëÅO(N) from O‚Äã(N3)ùëÇsuperscriptùëÅ3O(N^{3}) of the traditional method. Combining with the adjoint-state method, this framework provides a new computational approach for solving the challenging electrical impedance tomography (EIT) problem. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
