      "content": "Paper Title: FairRec: Fairness Testing for Deep Recommender Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Deep learning-based recommender systems (DRSs) are increasingly and widely deployed in the industry, which brings significant convenience to people’s daily life in different ways. However, recommender systems are also shown to suffer from multiple issues, e.g., the echo chamber and the Matthew effect111The echo chamber refers to the effect that the user interest is reinforced by being repeatedly recommended similar items, resulting in a person being limited to a narrow range of content. The Matthew effect describes a phenomenon in which popular items have a cumulative advantage and therefore take up more exposure, limiting users’ opportunities to see other items., of which the notation of “fairness” plays a core role. For instance, the system may be regarded as unfair to 1) a certain user, if the user gets worse recommendations than other users, or 2) an item (to recommend), if the item is much less likely to be exposed to the user than other items. While many fairness notations and corresponding fairness testing approaches have been developed for traditional deep classification models, they are essentially hardly applicable to DRSs. One major difficulty is that there still lacks a systematic understanding and mapping between the existing fairness notations and the diverse testing requirements for deep recommender systems, not to mention further testing or debugging activities. To address the gap, we propose FairRec, a unified framework that supports fairness testing of DRSs from multiple customized perspectives, e.g., model utility, item diversity, item popularity, etc. We also propose a novel, efficient search-based testing approach to tackle the new challenge, i.e., double-ended discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) algorithm, to effectively search for hidden fairness issues in the form of certain disadvantaged groups from a vast number of candidate groups. Given the testing report, by adopting a simple re-ranking mitigation strategy on these identified disadvantaged groups, we show that the fairness of DRSs can be significantly improved. We conducted extensive experiments on multiple industry-level DRSs adopted by leading companies. The results confirm that FairRec is effective and efficient in identifying the deeply hidden fairness issues, e.g., achieving ∼similar-to\\sim95% testing accuracy with ∼similar-to\\simhalf to 1/8 time.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
