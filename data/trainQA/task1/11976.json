Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Guidelines for Submission to HPCA 2025\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Oblivious RAM (ORAM) hides the memory access patterns, enhancing data privacy by preventing attackers from discovering sensitive information based on the sequence of memory accesses. The performance of ORAM is often limited by its inherent trade-off between security and efficiency, as concealing memory access patterns imposes significant computational and memory overhead. While prior works focus on improving the ORAM performance by prefetching and eliminating ORAM requests, we find that their performance is very sensitive to workload locality behavior and incurs additional management overhead caused by the ORAM stash pressure. This paper presents Palermo: a protocol-hardware co-design to improve ORAM performance. The key observation in Palermo is that classical ORAM protocols enforce restrictive dependencies between memory operations that result in low memory bandwidth utilization. Palermo introduces a new protocol that overlaps large portions of memory operations, within a single and between multiple ORAM requests, without breaking correctness and security guarantees. Subsequently, we propose an ORAM controller architecture that executes the proposed protocol to service ORAM requests. The hardware is responsible for concurrently issuing memory requests as well as imposing the necessary dependencies to ensure a consistent view of the ORAM tree across requests. Using a rich workload mix, we demonstrate that Palermo outperforms the RingORAM baseline by 2.8√ó\\times, on average, incurring a negligible area overhead of 5.78mm2 (less than 2% in 12th generation Intel CPU after technology scaling) and 2.14W without sacrificing security. We further show that Palermo also outperforms the state-of-the-art works PageORAM, PrORAM, and IR-ORAM.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
