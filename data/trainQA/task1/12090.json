      "content": "Paper Title: Leakage-Robust Bayesian Persuasion\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper introduces the concept of leakage-robust Bayesian persuasion. Situated between public Bayesian persuasion [KG11] (and its multi-receiver variants [CCG23, Xu20]) and private Bayesian persuasion [AB19], leakage-robust persuasion considers a setting where one or more signals privately communicated by a sender to the receivers may be leaked. We study the design of leakage-robust Bayesian persuasion schemes and quantify the price of robustness using two formalisms: - The first notion, k𝑘k-worst-case persuasiveness, requires a signaling scheme to remain persuasive as long as each receiver observes no more than k𝑘k leaked signals from other receivers. We quantify the Price of Worst-case Robustness (𝖯𝗈𝖶𝖱ksubscript𝖯𝗈𝖶𝖱𝑘\\mathsf{PoWR}_{k})— i.e., the gap in sender’s utility as compared to the optimal private persuasion scheme—as Θ​(min⁡{2k,n})Θsuperscript2𝑘𝑛\\Theta(\\min\\{2^{k},n\\}) for supermodular sender utilities and Θ​(k)Θ𝑘\\Theta(k) for submodular or XOS sender utilities, where n𝑛n is the number of receivers. This result also establishes that in some instances, Θ​(log⁡k)Θ𝑘\\Theta(\\log k) leakages are sufficient for the utility of the optimal leakage-robust persuasion to degenerate to that of public persuasion. - The second notion, expected downstream utility robustness, relaxes the persuasiveness requirement and instead considers the impact on sender’s utility resulting from receivers best responding to their observations. By quantifying the Price of Downstream Robustness (𝖯𝗈𝖣𝖱𝖯𝗈𝖣𝖱\\mathsf{PoDR}) as the gap between the sender’s expected utility over the randomness in the leakage pattern as compared to private persuasion, our results show that, over several natural and structured distributions of leakage patterns, 𝖯𝗈𝖣𝖱𝖯𝗈𝖣𝖱\\mathsf{PoDR} improves 𝖯𝗈𝖶𝖱𝖯𝗈𝖶𝖱\\mathsf{PoWR} to Θ​(k)Θ𝑘\\Theta(k) or even Θ​(1)Θ1\\Theta(1), where k𝑘k is the maximum number of leaked signals observable to each receiver across leakage patterns in the distribution. En route to these results, we show that subsampling and masking serve as general-purpose algorithmic paradigms for transforming any private persuasion signaling scheme to one that is leakage-robust, with minmax optimal loss in sender’s utility.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
