      "content": "Paper Title: Topology optimization of wind farm layouts\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A novel approach for the solution of the wind farm layout optimization problem is presented. The annual energy production is maximized with constraints on the minimum and maximum number of wind turbines placed, and on the minimum spacing between the wind turbines. The proposed approach relies on a density-based topology optimization method, where continuous density variables varying between zero and one are assigned to each potential wind turbine location. A wind turbine exists if its associated variable equals one, otherwise it does not exist if the associated variable is zero. Intermediate values of the density variables are penalized with interpolation schemes traditionally used in the context of multi-material structural topology optimization. The penalized intermediate values of the design variables become uneconomical and the optimization algorithm is implicitly pushed towards a preference of crisp 00-111 final values. The optimization problem is solved with a gradient-based algorithm based on first-order information. Because of the proposed problem formulation, the functions involved are formulated explicitly in terms of the design variables and their analytical gradients can be calculated directly. The numerical results highlight the capability of the proposed approach in finding far from intuitive wind farm layouts with small computational resources and time.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
