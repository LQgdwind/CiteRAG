Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Tele-Knowledge Pre-training for Fault Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this work, we share our experience on tele-knowledge pre-training for fault analysis, a crucial task in telecommunication applications that requires a wide range of knowledge normally found in both machine log data and product documents. To organize this knowledge from experts uniformly, we propose to create a Tele-KG (tele-knowledge graph). Using this valuable data, we further propose a tele-domain language pre-training model TeleBERT and its knowledge-enhanced version, a tele-knowledge re-training model KTeleBERT. which includes effective prompt hints, adaptive numerical data encoding, and two knowledge injection paradigms. Concretely, our proposal includes two stages: first, pre-training TeleBERT on 20 million tele-related corpora, and then re-training it on 1 million causal and machine-related corpora to obtain KTeleBERT. Our evaluation on multiple tasks related to fault analysis in tele-applications, including root-cause analysis, event association prediction, and fault chain tracing, shows that pre-training a language model with tele-domain data is beneficial for downstream tasks. Moreover, the KTeleBERT re-training further improves the performance of task models, highlighting the effectiveness of incorporating diverse tele-knowledge into the model.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
