Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Supermodular Rank: Set Function Decomposition and Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We define the supermodular rank of a function on a lattice. This is the smallest number of terms needed to decompose it into a sum of supermodular functions. The supermodular summands are defined with respect to different partial orders. We characterize the maximum possible value of the supermodular rank and describe the functions with fixed supermodular rank. We analogously define the submodular rank. We use submodular decompositions to optimize set functions. Given a bound on the submodular rank of a set function, we formulate an algorithm that splits an optimization problem into submodular subproblems. We show that this method improves the approximation ratio guarantees of several algorithms for monotone set function maximization and ratio of set functions minimization, at a computation overhead that depends on the submodular rank. Keywords: supermodular cone, imset inequality, set function optimization, greedy algorithm, approximation ratio\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
