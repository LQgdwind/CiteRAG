Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Dual Box Embeddings for the Description Logic ℰ⁢ℒ⁺⁺\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. OWL ontologies, whose formal semantics are rooted in Description Logic (DL), have been widely used for knowledge representation. Similar to Knowledge Graphs (KGs), ontologies are often incomplete, and maintaining and constructing them has proved challenging. While classical deductive reasoning algorithms use the precise formal semantics of an ontology to predict missing facts, recent years have witnessed growing interest in inductive reasoning techniques that can derive probable facts from an ontology. Similar to KGs, a promising approach is to learn ontology embeddings in a latent vector space, while additionally ensuring they adhere to the semantics of the underlying DL. While a variety of approaches have been proposed, current ontology embedding methods suffer from several shortcomings, especially that they all fail to faithfully model one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many relations and role inclusion axioms. To address this problem and improve ontology completion performance, we propose a novel ontology embedding method named Box22{}^{\\textsf{2}}EL for the DL ℰ​ℒ++ℰsuperscriptℒabsent\\mathcal{EL^{++}}, which represents both concepts and roles as boxes (i.e., axis-aligned hyperrectangles), and models inter-concept relationships using a bumping mechanism. We theoretically prove the soundness of Box22{}^{\\textsf{2}}EL and conduct an extensive experimental evaluation, achieving state-of-the-art results across a variety of datasets on the tasks of subsumption prediction, role assertion prediction, and approximating deductive reasoning.111Code and data are available at https://github.com/KRR-Oxford/BoxSquaredEL.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
