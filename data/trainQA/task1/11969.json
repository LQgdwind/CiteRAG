      "content": "Paper Title: FQsun: A Configurable Wave Function-Based Quantum Emulator for Power-Efficient Quantum Simulations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Quantum computing has emerged as a powerful tool for solving complex computational problems, but access to real quantum hardware remains limited due to high costs and increasing demand for efficient quantum simulations. Unfortunately, software simulators on CPUs/GPUs such as Qiskit, ProjectQ, and Qsun offer flexibility and support for a large number of qubits, they struggle with high power consumption and limited processing speed, especially as qubit counts scale. Accordingly, quantum emulators implemented on dedicated hardware, such as FPGAs and analog circuits, offer a promising path for addressing energy efficiency concerns. However, existing studies on hardware-based emulators still face challenges in terms of limited flexibility, lack of fidelity evaluation, and power consumption. To overcome these gaps, we propose FQsun, a quantum emulator that enhances performance by integrating four key innovations: efficient memory organization, a configurable Quantum Gate Unit (QGU), optimized scheduling, and multiple number precisions. Five FQsun versions with different number precisions, including 16-bit floating point, 32-bit floating point, 16-bit fixed point, 24-bit fixed point, and 32-bit fixed point, are implemented on the Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA, utilizing between 9,226 and 18,093 LUTs, 1,440 and 7,031 FFs, 344 and 464 BRAMs, and 14 and 88 DSPs and consuming a maximum power of 2.41W. Experimental results demonstrate high accuracy in normalized gate speed, fidelity, and mean square error, particularly with 32-bit fixed-point and floating-point versions, establishing FQsun’s capability as a precise quantum emulator. Benchmarking on quantum algorithms such as Quantum Fourier Transform, Parameter-Shift Rule, and Random Quantum Circuits reveals that FQsun achieves superior power-delay product, outperforming traditional software simulators on powerful CPUs by up to 9.87×1039.87superscript103\\text{9.87}\\times\\text{10}^{\\text{3}} times. Additionally, FQsun shows significantly improved normalized gate speed compared to hardware-based emulators, ranging from 1.31 times to 1.51 ×1010absentsuperscript1010\\times\\text{10}^{\\text{10}} times, highlighting its potential as a scalable and energy-efficient solution for advanced quantum simulations.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
