Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Toward Understanding Bias Correlations for Mitigation in NLP\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Natural Language Processing (NLP) models have been found discriminative against groups of different social identities such as gender and race. With the negative consequences of these undesired biases, researchers have responded with unprecedented effort and proposed promising approaches for bias mitigation. In spite of considerable practical importance, current algorithmic fairness literature lacks an in-depth understanding of the relations between different forms of biases. Social bias is complex by nature. Numerous studies in social psychology identify the “generalized prejudice”, i.e., generalized devaluing sentiments across different groups. For example, people who devalue ethnic minorities are also likely to devalue women and gays. Therefore, this work aims to provide a first systematic study toward understanding bias correlations in mitigation. In particular, we examine bias mitigation in two common NLP tasks – toxicity detection and word embeddings – on three social identities, i.e., race, gender, and religion. Our findings suggest that biases are correlated and present scenarios in which independent debiasing approaches dominant in current literature may be insufficient. We further investigate whether jointly mitigating correlated biases is more desired than independent and individual debiasing. Lastly, we shed light on the inherent issue of debiasing-accuracy trade-off in bias mitigation. This study serves to motivate future research on joint bias mitigation that accounts for correlated biases.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
