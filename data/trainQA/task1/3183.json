Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: RelTransformer: A Transformer-Based Long-Tail Visual Relationship Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The visual relationship recognition (VRR) task aims at understanding the pairwise visual relationships between interacting objects in an image. These relationships typically have a long-tail distribution due to their compositional nature. This problem gets more severe when the vocabulary becomes large, rendering this task very challenging. This paper shows that modeling an effective message-passing flow through an attention mechanism can be critical to tackling the compositionality and long-tail challenges in VRR. The method, called RelTransformer, represents each image as a fully-connected scene graph and restructures the whole scene into the relation-triplet and global-scene contexts. It directly passes the message from each element in the relation-triplet and global-scene contexts to the target relation via self-attention. We also design a learnable memory to augment the long-tail relation representation learning. Through extensive experiments, we find that our model generalizes well on many VRR benchmarks. Our model outperforms the best-performing models on two large-scale long-tail VRR benchmarks, VG8K-LT (+2.0% overall acc) and GQA-LT (+26.0% overall acc), both having a highly skewed distribution towards the tail. It also achieves strong results on the VG200 relation detection task. Our code is available at https://github.com/Vision-CAIR/RelTransformer.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
