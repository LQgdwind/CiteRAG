Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: DeepAAT: Deep Automated Aerial Triangulation for Fast UAV-based Mapping\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Automated Aerial Triangulation (AAT), aiming to restore image pose and reconstruct sparse points simultaneously, plays a pivotal role in earth observation. With its rich research heritage spanning several decades in photogrammetry, AAT has evolved into a fundamental process widely applied in large-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based mapping. Despite its advancements, classic AAT methods still face challenges like low efficiency and limited robustness. This paper introduces DeepAAT, a deep learning network designed specifically for AAT of UAV imagery. DeepAAT considers both spatial and spectral characteristics of imagery, enhancing its capability to resolve erroneous matching pairs and accurately predict image poses. DeepAAT marks a significant leap in AAT’s efficiency, ensuring thorough scene coverage and precision. Its processing speed outpaces incremental AAT methods by hundreds of times and global AAT methods by tens of times while maintaining a comparable level of reconstruction accuracy. Additionally, DeepAAT’s scene clustering and merging strategy facilitate rapid localization and pose determination for large-scale UAV images, even under constrained computing resources. The experimental results demonstrate DeepAAT’s substantial improvements over conventional AAT methods, highlighting its potential in the efficiency and accuracy of UAV-based 3D reconstruction tasks. To benefit the photogrammetry society, the code of DeepAAT will be released at: https://github.com/WHU-USI3DV/DeepAAT.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
