      "content": "Paper Title: On finding dense sub-lattices as low energy states of a quantum Hamiltonian\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Lattice-based cryptography has emerged as one of the most prominent candidates for post-quantum cryptography, projected to be secure against the imminent threat of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers. The Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) is to find the shortest non-zero vector in a given lattice. It is fundamental to lattice-based cryptography and believed to be hard even for quantum computers. We study a natural generalization of the SVP known as the K𝐾K-Densest Sub-lattice Problem (K𝐾K-DSP): to find the densest K𝐾K-dimensional sub-lattice of a given lattice. We formulate K𝐾K-DSP as finding the first excited state of a Z-basis Hamiltonian, making K𝐾K-DSP amenable to investigation via an array of quantum algorithms, including Grover search, quantum Gibbs sampling, adiabatic, and Variational Quantum Algorithms. The complexity of the algorithms depends on the basis through which the input lattice is presented. We present a classical polynomial-time algorithm that takes an arbitrary input basis and preprocesses it into inputs suited to quantum algorithms. With preprocessing, we prove that O​(K​N2)𝑂𝐾superscript𝑁2O(KN^{2}) qubits suffice for solving K𝐾K-DSP for N𝑁N dimensional input lattices. We empirically demonstrate the performance of a Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm K𝐾K-DSP solver for low dimensions, highlighting the influence of a good preprocessed input basis. We then discuss the hardness of K𝐾K-DSP in relation to the SVP, to see if there is reason to build post-quantum cryptography on K𝐾K-DSP. We devise a quantum algorithm that solves K𝐾K-DSP with run-time exponent (5​K​N​log⁡N)/25𝐾𝑁𝑁2(5KN\\log{N})/2. Therefore, for fixed K𝐾K, K𝐾K-DSP is no more than polynomially harder than the SVP. The central insight we use is similar in spirit to those underlying the best known classical K𝐾K-DSP algorithm due to Dadush and Micciancio. Whether the exponential dependence on K𝐾K can be lowered remains an open question.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
