Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Contrastive Supervised Distillation for Continual Representation Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we propose a novel training procedure for the continual representation learning problem in which a neural network model is sequentially learned to alleviate catastrophic forgetting in visual search tasks. Our method, called Contrastive Supervised Distillation (CSD), reduces feature forgetting while learning discriminative features. This is achieved by leveraging labels information in a distillation setting in which the student model is contrastively learned from the teacher model. Extensive experiments show that CSD performs favorably in mitigating catastrophic forgetting by outperforming current state-of-the-art methods. Our results also provide further evidence that feature forgetting evaluated in visual retrieval tasks is not as catastrophic as in classification tasks.
