Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: DragScene: Interactive 3D Scene Editing with Single-view Drag Instructions\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract 3D editing has shown remarkable capability in editing scenes based on various instructions. However, existing methods struggle with achieving intuitive, localized editing, such as selectively making flowers blossom. Drag-style editing has shown exceptional capability to edit images with direct manipulation instead of ambiguous text commands. Nevertheless, extending drag-based editing to 3D scenes presents substantial challenges due to multi-view inconsistency. To this end, we introduce DragScene, a framework that integrates drag-style editing with diverse 3D representations. First, latent optimization is performed on a reference view to generate 2D edits based on user instructions. Subsequently, coarse 3D clues are reconstructed from the reference view using a point-based representation to capture the geometric details of the edits. The latent representation of the edited view is then mapped to these 3D clues, guiding the latent optimization of other views. This process ensures that edits are propagated seamlessly across multiple views, maintaining multi-view consistency. Finally, the target 3D scene is reconstructed from the edited multi-view images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DragScene facilitates precise and flexible drag-style editing of 3D scenes, supporting broad applicability across diverse 3D representations.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 51\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
