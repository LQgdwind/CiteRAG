      "content": "Paper Title: MAJORITY-3SAT (and Related Problems) in Polynomial Time Supported by NSF CCF-1909429 and NSF CCF-1741615.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Majority-SAT (a.k.a. MAJ-SAT) is the problem of determining whether an input n𝑛n-variable formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF) has at least 2n−1superscript2𝑛12^{n-1} satisfying assignments. Majority-SAT and related problems have been studied extensively in various AI communities interested in the complexity of probabilistic planning and inference. Although Majority-SAT has been known to be PP-complete for over 40 years, the complexity of a natural variant has remained open: Majority-k𝑘kSAT, where the input CNF formula is restricted to have clause width at most k𝑘k. We prove that for every k𝑘k, Majority-k𝑘kSAT is in P; in fact, the problem can be solved in linear time (whereas the previous best-known algorithm ran in exponential time). More generally, for any positive integer k𝑘k and constant ρ∈(0,1)𝜌01\\rho\\in(0,1) with bounded denominator, we give an algorithm that can determine whether a given k𝑘k-CNF has at least ρ⋅2n⋅𝜌superscript2𝑛\\rho\\cdot 2^{n} satisfying assignments, in deterministic linear time. We find these results surprising, as many analogous problems which are hard for CNF formulas remain hard when restricted to 333-CNFs. Our algorithms have interesting positive implications for counting complexity and the complexity of inference, significantly reducing the known complexities of related problems such as E-MAJ-k𝑘kSAT and MAJ-MAJ-k𝑘kSAT. Our results immediately extend to arbitrary Boolean CSPs with constraints of arity k𝑘k. At the heart of our approach is an efficient method for solving threshold counting problems by extracting and analyzing various sunflowers found in the corresponding set system of a k𝑘k-CNF. Exploring the implications of our results, we find that the tractability of Majority-k𝑘kSAT is somewhat fragile, in intriguing ways. For the closely related GtMajority-SAT problem (where we ask whether a given formula has greater than 2n−1superscript2𝑛12^{n-1} satisfying assignments) which is also known to be 𝖯𝖯𝖯𝖯{\\mathsf{PP}}-complete, we show that GtMajority-k𝑘kSAT is in P for k≤3𝑘3k\\leq 3, but becomes NP-complete for k≥4𝑘4k\\geq 4. We also show that for Majority-SAT on k𝑘k-CNFs with one additional clause of arbitrary width, the problem is PP-complete for k≥4𝑘4k\\geq 4, is NP-hard for k=3𝑘3k=3, and remains in P for k=2𝑘2k=2. These results are counterintuitive, because the “natural” classifications of these problems would have been PP-completeness, and because there is a stark difference in the complexity of GtMajority-k𝑘kSAT and Majority-k𝑘kSAT for all k≥4𝑘4k\\geq 4.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
