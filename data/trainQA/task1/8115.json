Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Performance Limits of a Deep Learning-Enabled Text Semantic Communication under Interference\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A deep learning (DL)-enabled semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a 6G enabler while promising to minimize power usage, bandwidth consumption, and transmission delay by minimizing irrelevant information transmission. However, the benefits of such a semantic-centric design can be limited by radio frequency interference (RFI) that causes substantial semantic noise. The impact of semantic noise due to interference can be alleviated using an interference-resistant and robust (IR2) SemCom design. Nevertheless, no such design exists yet. To shed light on this knowledge gap and stimulate fundamental research on IR2 SemCom, the performance limits of a text SemCom system named DeepSC are studied in the presence of (multi-interferer) RFI. By introducing a principled probabilistic framework for SemCom, we show that DeepSC produces semantically irrelevant sentences as the power of (multi-interferer) RFI gets very large. We also derive DeepSCâ€™s practical limits and a lower bound on its outage probability under multi-interferer RFI. Toward a fundamental 6G design for an IR2 SemCom, moreover, we propose a generic lifelong DL-based IR2 SemCom system. Eventually, we corroborate the derived performance limits with Monte Carlo simulations and computer experiments, which also affirm the vulnerability of DeepSC and DL-enabled text SemCom to a wireless attack using RFI.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
