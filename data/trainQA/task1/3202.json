Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Semantic Consistency and Identity Mapping Multi-Component Generative Adversarial Network for Person Re-Identification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In a real world environment, person re-identification (Re-ID) is a challenging task due to variations in lighting conditions, viewing angles, pose and occlusions. Despite recent performance gains, current person Re-ID algorithms still suffer heavily when encountering these variations. To address this problem, we propose a semantic consistency and identity mapping multi-component generative adversarial network (SC-IMGAN) which provides style adaptation from one to many domains. To ensure that transformed images are as realistic as possible, we propose novel identity mapping and semantic consistency losses to maintain identity across the diverse domains. For the Re-ID task, we propose a joint verification-identification quartet network which is trained with generated and real images, followed by an effective quartet loss for verification. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on six challenging person Re-ID datasets: CUHK01, CUHK03, VIPeR, PRID2011, iLIDS and Market-1501.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 53\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
