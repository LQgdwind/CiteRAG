Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 60 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: DiaTrend: A dataset from advanced diabetes technology to enable development of novel analytic solutions\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Objective digital data is scarce yet needed in many domains to enable research that can transform the standard of healthcare. While data from consumer-grade wearables and smartphones is more accessible, there is critical need for similar data from clinical-grade devices used by patients with a diagnosed condition. The prevalence of wearable medical devices in the diabetes domain sets the stage for unique research and development within this field and beyond. However, the scarcity of open-source datasets presents a major barrier to progress. To facilitate broader research on diabetes-relevant problems and accelerate development of robust computational solutions, we provide the DiaTrend dataset. The DiaTrend dataset is composed of intensive longitudinal data from wearable medical devices, including a total of 27,561 days of continuous glucose monitor data and 8,220 days of insulin pump data from 54 patients with diabetes. This dataset is useful for developing novel analytic solutions that can reduce the disease burden for people living with diabetes and increase knowledge on chronic condition management in outpatient settings.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 60\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
