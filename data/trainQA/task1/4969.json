Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: MAGIC: Multimodal relAtional Graph adversarIal inferenCe for Diverse and Unpaired Text-based Image Captioning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Text-based image captioning (TextCap) requires simultaneous comprehension of visual content and reading the text of images to generate a natural language description. Although a task can teach machines to understand the complex human environment further given that text is omnipresent in our daily surroundings, it poses additional challenges in normal captioning. A text-based image intuitively contains abundant and complex multimodal relational content, that is, image details can be described diversely from multiview rather than a single caption. Certainly, we can introduce additional paired training data to show the diversity of images’ descriptions, this process is labor-intensive and time-consuming for TextCap pair annotations with extra texts. Based on the insight mentioned above, we investigate how to generate diverse captions that focus on different image parts using an unpaired training paradigm. We propose the Multimodal relAtional Graph adversarIal inferenCe (MAGIC) framework for diverse and unpaired TextCap. This framework can adaptively construct multiple multimodal relational graphs of images and model complex relationships among graphs to represent descriptive diversity. Moreover, a cascaded generative adversarial network is developed from modeled graphs to infer the unpaired caption generation in image–sentence feature alignment and linguistic coherence levels. We validate the effectiveness of MAGIC in generating diverse captions from different relational information items of an image. Experimental results show that MAGIC can generate very promising outcomes without using any image–caption training pairs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
