Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Human Attention-Guided Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Computer Vision Models\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We examined whether embedding human attention knowledge into saliency-based explainable AI (XAI) methods for computer vision models could enhance their plausibility and faithfulness. We first developed new gradient-based XAI methods for object detection models to generate object-specific explanations by extending the current methods for image classification models. Interestingly, while these gradient-based methods worked well for explaining image classification models, when being used for explaining object detection models, the resulting saliency maps generally had lower faithfulness than human attention maps when performing the same task. We then developed Human Attention-Guided XAI (HAG-XAI) to learn from human attention how to best combine explanatory information from the models to enhance explanation plausibility by using trainable activation functions and smoothing kernels to maximize XAI saliency mapâ€™s similarity to human attention maps. While for image classification models, HAG-XAI enhanced explanation plausibility at the expense of faithfulness, for object detection models it enhanced plausibility and faithfulness simultaneously and outperformed existing methods. The learned functions were model-specific, well generalizable to other databases.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
