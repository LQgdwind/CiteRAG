Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 59 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to simulate partially known spatio-temporal dynamics with trainable difference operators\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recently, using neural networks to simulate spatio-temporal dynamics has received a lot of attention. However, most existing methods adopt pure data-driven black-box models, which have limited accuracy and interpretability. By combining trainable difference operators with black-box models, we propose a new hybrid architecture explicitly embedded with partial prior knowledge of the underlying PDEs named PDE-Net++. Furthermore, we introduce two distinct options called the trainable flipping difference layer (TFDL) and the trainable dynamic difference layer (TDDL) for the difference operators. Numerous numerical experiments have demonstrated that PDE-Net++ has superior prediction accuracy and better extrapolation performance than black-box models.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
