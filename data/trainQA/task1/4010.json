Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Word2Pix: Word to Pixel Cross Attention Transformer in Visual Grounding\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Current one-stage methods for visual grounding encode the language query as one holistic sentence embedding before fusion with visual feature. Such a formulation does not treat each word of a query sentence on par when modeling language to visual attention, therefore prone to neglect words which are less important for sentence embedding but critical for visual grounding. In this paper we propose Word2Pix: a one-stage visual grounding network based on encoder-decoder transformer architecture that enables learning for textual to visual feature correspondence via word to pixel attention. The embedding of each word from the query sentence is treated alike by attending to visual pixels individually instead of single holistic sentence embedding. In this way, each word is given equivalent opportunity to adjust the language to vision attention towards the referent target through multiple stacks of transformer decoder layers. We conduct the experiments on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and RefCOCOg datasets and the proposed Word2Pix outperforms existing one-stage methods by a notable margin. The results obtained also show that Word2Pix surpasses two-stage visual grounding models, while at the same time keeping the merits of one-stage paradigm namely end-to-end training and real-time inference speed intact.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
