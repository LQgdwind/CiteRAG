Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Mixture Structure on Multi-Source Time Series for Probabilistic Forecasting\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In many data-driven applications, collecting data from different sources is increasingly desirable for enhancing performance. In this paper, we are interested in the problem of probabilistic forecasting with multi-source time series. We propose a neural mixture structure-based probability model for learning different predictive relations and their adaptive combinations from multi-source time series. We present the prediction and uncertainty quantification methods that apply to different distributions of target variables. Additionally, given the imbalanced and unstable behaviors observed during the direct training of the proposed mixture model, we develop a phased learning method and provide a theoretical analysis. In experimental evaluations, the mixture model trained by the phased learning exhibits competitive performance on both point and probabilistic prediction metrics. Meanwhile, the proposed uncertainty conditioned error suggests the potential of the mixture model’s uncertainty score as a reliability indicator of predictions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
