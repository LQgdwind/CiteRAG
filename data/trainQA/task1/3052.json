Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: GSA-Forecaster: Forecasting Graph-Based Time-Dependent Data with Graph Sequence Attention\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Forecasting graph-based time-dependent data has many practical applications. This task is challenging as models need not only to capture spatial dependency and temporal dependency within the data, but also to leverage useful auxiliary information for accurate predictions. In this paper, we analyze limitations of state-of-the-art models on dealing with temporal dependency. To address this limitation, we propose GSA-Forecaster, a new deep learning model for forecasting graph-based time-dependent data. GSA-Forecaster leverages graph sequence attention (GSA), a new attention mechanism proposed in this paper, for effectively capturing temporal dependency. GSA-Forecaster embeds the graph structure of the data into its architecture to address spatial dependency. GSA-Forecaster also accounts for auxiliary information to further improve predictions. We evaluate GSA-Forecaster with large-scale real-world graph-based time-dependent data and demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art models with 6.7% RMSE and 5.8% MAPE reduction.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 53\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
