Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 60 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Proof.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Adversarial team games model multiplayer strategic interactions in which a team of identically-interested players is competing against an adversarial player in a zero-sum game. Such games capture many well-studied settings in game theory, such as congestion games, but go well-beyond to environments wherein the cooperation of one team‚Äîin the absence of explicit communication‚Äîis obstructed by competing entities; the latter setting remains poorly understood despite its numerous applications. Since the seminal work of Von Stengel and Koller (GEB ‚Äò97), different solution concepts have received attention from an algorithmic standpoint. Yet, the complexity of the standard Nash equilibrium has remained open. In this paper, we settle this question by showing that computing a Nash equilibrium in adversarial team games belongs to the class continuous local search (\\ComplexityFont‚ÄãC‚ÄãL‚ÄãS\\ComplexityFontùê∂ùêøùëÜ\\ComplexityFont{CLS}), thereby establishing \\ComplexityFont‚ÄãC‚ÄãL‚ÄãS\\ComplexityFontùê∂ùêøùëÜ\\ComplexityFont{CLS}-completeness by virtue of the recent \\ComplexityFont‚ÄãC‚ÄãL‚ÄãS\\ComplexityFontùê∂ùêøùëÜ\\ComplexityFont{CLS}-hardness result of Rubinstein and Babichenko (STOC ‚Äò21) in potential games. To do so, we leverage linear programming duality to prove that any œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-approximate stationary strategy for the team can be extended in polynomial time to an O‚Äã(œµ)ùëÇitalic-œµO(\\epsilon)-approximate Nash equilibrium, where the O‚Äã(‚ãÖ)ùëÇ‚ãÖO(\\cdot) notation suppresses polynomial factors. As a consequence, we show that the Moreau envelop of a suitable best response function acts as a potential under certain natural gradient-based dynamics.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper.
