Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Guided-TTS 2: A Diffusion Model for High-quality Adaptive Text-to-Speech with Untranscribed Data\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We propose Guided-TTS 2, a diffusion-based generative model for high-quality adaptive TTS using untranscribed data. Guided-TTS 2 combines a speaker-conditional diffusion model with a speaker-dependent phoneme classifier for adaptive text-to-speech. We train the speaker-conditional diffusion model on large-scale untranscribed datasets for a classifier-free guidance method and further fine-tune the diffusion model on the reference speech of the target speaker for adaptation, which only takes 40 seconds. We demonstrate that Guided-TTS 2 shows comparable performance to high-quality single-speaker TTS baselines in terms of speech quality and speaker similarity with only a ten-second untranscribed data. We further show that Guided-TTS 2 outperforms adaptive TTS baselines on multi-speaker datasets even with a zero-shot adaptation setting. Guided-TTS 2 can adapt to a wide range of voices only using untranscribed speech, which enables adaptive TTS with the voice of non-human characters such as Gollum in \"The Lord of the Rings\".\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 50\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
