      "content": "Paper Title: Gibbs state preparation for commuting Hamiltonian: Mapping to classical Gibbs sampling\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Gibbs state preparation, also known as Gibbs sampling, is a key computational technique extensively used in physics, statistics, and other scientific fields. Recent efforts [1, 2, 3] for designing fast mixing Gibbs samplers for quantum Hamiltonians have largely focused on commuting local Hamiltonians (CLHs), a non-trivial subclass of Hamiltonians which include highly entangled systems such as the Toric code and quantum double model. Most previous Gibbs samplers relied on simulating the Davies generator, which is a Lindbladian associated with the thermalization process in nature. Instead of using the Davies generator, we design a different Gibbs sampler for various CLHs by giving a reduction to classical Hamiltonians, in the sense that one can efficiently prepare the Gibbs state for some CLH HùêªH on a quantum computer as long as one can efficiently do classical Gibbs sampling for the corresponding classical Hamiltonian H(c)superscriptùêªùëêH^{(c)}. Combined with existing fast mixing Gibbs samplers for classical Hamiltonians, we demonstrate that our Gibbs sampler is able to replicate state-of-the-art results [1, 2, 3] as well as prepare the Gibbs state in regimes which were previously unknown, such as the low temperature region (as long as there exists fast mixing Gibbs samplers for the corresponding classical Hamiltonians). More specifically, our reductions are as follows. ‚Ä¢ If HùêªH is a 2-local qudit CLH, then H(c)superscriptùêªùëêH^{(c)} is a 2-local qudit classical Hamiltonian. ‚Ä¢ If HùêªH is a 4-local qubit CLH on 2D lattice and there are no classical qubits, then H(c)superscriptùêªùëêH^{(c)} is a 2-local qudit classical Hamiltonian on a planar graph. As an example, our algorithm can prepare the Gibbs state for the (defected) Toric code at any non-zero temperature in ùí™‚Äã(n2)ùí™superscriptùëõ2\\mathcal{O}(n^{2}) time. ‚Ä¢ If HùêªH is a 4-local qubit CLH on 2D lattice and there are classical qubits, assuming that quantum terms are uniformly correctable, then H(c)superscriptùêªùëêH^{(c)} is a constant-local classical Hamiltonian. A further consequence of our work is on the complexity of quantum approximate counting (QAC). Classically Stockmeyer [4] showed that classical approximate counting is in BPPNPsuperscriptBPPNP\\textsf{BPP}^{\\textsf{NP}}, but no analogous quantum result is known. We show that for various CLHs we can place the corresponding QAC in BQPCSsuperscriptBQPCS\\textsf{BQP}^{\\textsf{CS}}, where CS is an oracle capable of performing arbitrary classical Gibbs sampling.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
