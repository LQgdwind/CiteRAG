However, recent experimental research proposed a novel permutation-based training method, which exhibited a desired classification performance without modifying the exact weight values. In this paper, we provide a theoretical guarantee of this permutation training method by proving its ability to guide a ReLU network to approximate one-dimensional continuous functions. Our numerical results further validate this method‚Äôs efficiency in regression tasks with various initializations. The notable observations during weight permutation suggest that permutation training can provide an innovative tool for describing network learning behavior.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
