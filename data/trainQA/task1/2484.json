      "content": "Paper Title: Intelligent Icing Detection Model of Wind Turbine Blades Based on SCADA data\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Diagnosis of ice accretion on wind turbine blades is all the time a hard nut to crack in condition monitoring of wind farms. Existing methods focus on mechanism analysis of icing process, deviation degree analysis of feature engineering. However, there have not been deep researches of neural networks applied in this field at present. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) makes it possible to train networks through continuously providing not only operation parameters and performance parameters of wind turbines but also environmental parameters and operation modes. This paper explores the possibility that using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs) and domain adaption learning to establish intelligent diagnosis frameworks under different training scenarios. Specifically, PGANC and PGANT are proposed for sufficient and non-sufficient target wind turbine labeled data, respectively. The basic idea is that we consider a two-stage training with parallel GANs, which are aimed at capturing intrinsic features for normal and icing samples, followed by classification CNN or domain adaption module in various training cases. Model validation on three wind turbine SCADA data shows that two-stage training can effectively improve the model performance. Besides, if there is no sufficient labeled data for a target turbine, which is an extremely common phenomenon in real industrial practices, the addition of domain adaption learning makes the trained model show better performance. Overall, our proposed intelligent diagnosis frameworks can achieve more accurate detection on the same wind turbine and more generalized capability on a new wind turbine, compared with other machine learning models and conventional CNNs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
