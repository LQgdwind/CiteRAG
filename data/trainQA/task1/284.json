Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 12 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: PSF–NET: A Non-parametric Point Spread Function Model for Ground Based Optical Telescopes\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Ground based optical telescopes are seriously affected by atmospheric turbulence induced aberrations. Understanding properties of these aberrations is important both for instruments design and image restoration methods development. Because the point spread function can reflect performance of the whole optic system, it is appropriate to use the point spread function to describe atmospheric turbulence induced aberrations. Assuming point spread functions induced by the atmospheric turbulence with the same profile belong to the same manifold space, we propose a non-parametric point spread function – PSF-NET. The PSF-NET has a cycle convolutional neural network structure and is a statistical representation of the manifold space of PSFs induced by the atmospheric turbulence with the same profile. Testing the PSF-NET with simulated and real observation data, we find that a well trained PSF–NET can restore any short exposure images blurred by atmospheric turbulence with the same profile. Besides, we further use the impulse response of the PSF-NET, which can be viewed as the statistical mean PSF, to analyze interpretation properties of the PSF-NET. We find that variations of statistical mean PSFs are caused by variations of the atmospheric turbulence profile: as the difference of the atmospheric turbulence profile increases, the difference between statistical mean PSFs also increases. The PSF-NET proposed in this paper provides a new way to analyze atmospheric turbulence induced aberrations, which would be benefit to develop new observation methods for ground based optical telescopes.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 12 most likely reference titles for this paper.
