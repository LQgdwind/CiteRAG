Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Fast Feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting Compression\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract With 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) advancing real-time and high-fidelity rendering for novel view synthesis, storage requirements pose challenges for their widespread adoption. Although various compression techniques have been proposed, previous art suffers from a common limitation: for any existing 3DGS, per-scene optimization is needed to achieve compression, making the compression sluggish and slow. To address this issue, we introduce Fast Compression of 3D Gaussian Splatting (FCGS), an optimization-free model that can compress 3DGS representations rapidly in a single feed-forward pass, which significantly reduces compression time from minutes to seconds. To enhance compression efficiency, we propose a multi-path entropy module that assigns Gaussian attributes to different entropy constraint paths for balance between size and fidelity. We also carefully design both inter- and intra-Gaussian context models to remove redundancies among the unstructured Gaussian blobs. Overall, FCGS achieves a compression ratio of over 20Ã—20\\times while maintaining fidelity, surpassing most per-scene SOTA optimization-based methods. Our code is available at: https://github.com/YihangChen-ee/FCGS.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 52\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
