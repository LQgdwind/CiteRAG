Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Stepping Back to SMILES Transformers for Fast Molecular Representation Inference\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In the intersection of molecular science and deep learning, tasks like virtual screening have driven the need for a high-throughput molecular representation generator on large chemical databases. However, as SMILES strings are the most common storage format for molecules, using deep graph models to extract molecular feature from raw SMILES data requires an SMILES-to-graph conversion, which significantly decelerates the whole process. Directly deriving molecular representations from SMILES is feasible, yet there exists a performance gap between the existing unpretrained SMILES-based models and graph-based models at large-scale benchmark results, while pretrain models are resource-demanding at training. To address this issue, we propose ST-KD, an end-to-end SMILES Transformer for molecular representation learning boosted by Knowledge Distillation. In order to conduct knowledge transfer from graph Transformers to ST-KD, we have redesigned the attention layers and introduced a pre-transformation step to tokenize the SMILES strings and inject structure-based positional embeddings. Without expensive pretraining, ST-KD shows competitive results on latest standard molecular datasets PCQM4M-LSC and QM9, with 3-14×3\\text{-}14\\times inference speed compared with existing graph models.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 47\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
