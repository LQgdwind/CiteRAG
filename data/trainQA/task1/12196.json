      "content": "Paper Title: A Hybrid Real-Time Framework for Efficient Fussell-Vesely Importance Evaluation Using Virtual Fault Trees and Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The Fussell-Vesely Importance (FV) reflects the potential impact of a basic event on system failure, and is crucial for ensuring system reliability. However, traditional methods for calculating FV importance are complex and time-consuming, requiring the construction of fault trees and the calculation of minimal cut set. To address these limitations, this study proposes a hybrid real-time framework to evaluate the FV importance of basic events. Our framework combines expert knowledge with a data-driven model. First, we use Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) to build a virtual fault tree that captures the relationships between basic events. Unlike traditional fault trees, which include intermediate events, our virtual fault tree consists solely of basic events, reducing its complexity and space requirements. Additionally, our virtual fault tree considers the dependencies between basic events rather than assuming their independence, as is typically done in traditional fault trees. We then feed both the event relationships and relevant data into a graph neural network (GNN). This approach enables a rapid, data-driven calculation of FV importance, significantly reducing processing time and quickly identifying critical events, thus providing robust decision support for risk control. Results demonstrate that our model performs well in terms of MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R², reducing computational energy consumption and offering real-time, risk-informed decision support for complex systems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
