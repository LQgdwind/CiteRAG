Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: DeepFire2: A Convolutional Spiking Neural Network Accelerator on FPGAs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) replace the multiply-accumulate operations of traditional neural networks by integrate-and-fire neurons, with the goal of achieving greater energy efficiency. Specialized hardware implementations of those neurons clearly have advantages over general-purpose devices in terms of power and performance, but exhibit poor scalability when it comes to accelerating large neural networks. DeepFire2 introduces a hardware architecture which can map large network layers efficiently across multiple super logic regions in a multi-die FPGA. That gives more control over resource allocation and parallelism, benefiting both throughput and energy consumption. Avoiding the use of lookup tables to implement the AND operations of an SNN, prevents the layer size to be limited by logic resources. A deep pipeline does not only lead to an increased clock speed of up to 600 MHz. We double the throughput and power efficiency compared to our previous version of DeepFire, which equates to an almost 10-fold improvement over other previous implementations. Importantly, we are able to deploy a large ImageNet model, while maintaining a throughput of over 1500 frames per second.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
