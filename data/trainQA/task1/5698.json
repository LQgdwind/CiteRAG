Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Context-aware visual tracking with joint meta-updating\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Visual object tracking acts as a pivotal component in various emerging video applications. Despite the numerous developments in visual tracking, existing deep trackers are still likely to fail when tracking against objects with dramatic variation. These deep trackers usually do not perform online update or update single sub-branch of the tracking model, for which they cannot adapt to the appearance variation of objects. Efficient updating methods are therefore crucial for tracking while previous meta-updater optimizes trackers directly over parameter space, which is prone to over-fit even collapse on longer sequences. To address these issues, we propose a context-aware tracking model to optimize the tracker over the representation space, which jointly meta-update both branches by exploiting information along the whole sequence, such that it can avoid the over-fitting problem. First, we note that the embedded features of the localization branch and the box-estimation branch, focusing on the local and global information of the target, are effective complements to each other. Based on this insight, we devise a context-aggregation module to fuse information in historical frames, followed by a context-aware module to learn affinity vectors for both branches of the tracker. Besides, we develop a dedicated meta-learning scheme, on account of fast and stable updating with limited training samples. The proposed tracking method achieves an EAO score of 0.514 on VOT2018 with the speed of 40FPS, demonstrating its capability of improving the accuracy and robustness of the underlying tracker with little speed drop.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 51\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
