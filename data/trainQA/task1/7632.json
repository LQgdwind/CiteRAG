Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: MDL-based Compressing Sequential Rules\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Nowadays, with the rapid development of the Internet, the era of big data has come. The Internet generates huge amounts of data every day. However, extracting meaningful information from massive data is like looking for a needle in a haystack. Data mining techniques can provide various feasible methods to solve this problem. At present, many sequential rule mining (SRM) algorithms are presented to find sequential rules in databases with sequential characteristics. These rules help people extract a lot of meaningful information from massive amounts of data. How can we achieve compression of mined results and reduce data size to save storage space and transmission time? Until now, there has been little research on the compression of SRM. In this paper, combined with the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle and under the two metrics (support and confidence), we introduce the problem of compression of SRM and also propose a solution named ComSR for MDL-based compressing of sequential rules based on the designed sequential rule coding scheme. To our knowledge, we are the first to use sequential rules to encode an entire database. A heuristic method is proposed to find a set of compact and meaningful sequential rules as much as possible. ComSR has two trade-off algorithms, ComSRnonnon{}_{\\text{non}} and ComSRfulful{}_{\\text{ful}}, based on whether the database can be completely compressed. Experiments done on a real dataset with different thresholds show that a set of compact and meaningful sequential rules can be found. This shows that the proposed method works.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
