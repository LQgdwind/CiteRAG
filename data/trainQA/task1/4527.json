Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Safe Driving via Expert Guided Policy Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract When learning common skills like driving, beginners usually have domain experts standing by to ensure the safety of the learning process. We formulate such learning scheme under the Expert-in-the-loop Reinforcement Learning where a guardian is introduced to safeguard the exploration of the learning agent. While allowing the sufficient exploration in the uncertain environment, the guardian intervenes under dangerous situations and demonstrates the correct actions to avoid potential accidents. Thus ERL enables both exploration and expert’s partial demonstration as two training sources. Following such a setting, we develop a novel Expert Guided Policy Optimization (EGPO) method which integrates the guardian in the loop of reinforcement learning. The guardian is composed of an expert policy to generate demonstration and a switch function to decide when to intervene. Particularly, a constrained optimization technique is used to tackle the trivial solution that the agent deliberately behaves dangerously to deceive the expert into taking over. Offline RL technique is further used to learn from the partial demonstration generated by the expert. Safe driving experiments show that our method achieves superior training and test-time safety, outperforms baselines with a substantial margin in sample efficiency, and preserves the generalizabiliy to unseen environments in test-time. Demo video and source code are available at: https://decisionforce.github.io/EGPO/. ††∗ Zhenghao Peng and Quanyi Li contribute equally to this work.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
