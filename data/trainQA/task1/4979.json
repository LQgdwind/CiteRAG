Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer.

      "content": "Paper Title: Reconfiguring Shortest Paths in Graphs1footnote 11footnote 1This project has received funding from the European Union‚Äôs Horizon 2020 research and innovation programmed under grant agreement No. 682203-ERC-[Inf-Speed-Tradeoff].\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Reconfiguring two shortest paths in a graph means modifying one shortest path to the other by changing one vertex at a time, so that all the intermediate paths are also shortest paths. This problem has several natural applications, namely: (a) revamping road networks, (b) rerouting data packets in a synchronous multiprocessing setting, (c) the shipping container stowage problem, and (d) the train marshalling problem. When modelled as graph problems, (a) is the most general case while (b), (c) and (d) are restrictions to different graph classes. We show that (a) is intractable, even for relaxed variants of the problem. For (b), (c) and (d), we present efficient algorithms to solve the respective problems. We also generalize the problem to when at most kùëòk (for a fixed integer k‚â•2ùëò2k\\geq 2) contiguous vertices on a shortest path can be changed at a time.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
