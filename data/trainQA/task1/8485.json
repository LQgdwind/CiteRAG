Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Structured Pruning for Multi-Task Deep Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Although multi-task deep neural network (DNN) models have computation and storage benefits over individual single-task DNN models, they can be further optimized via model compression. Numerous structured pruning methods are already developed that can readily achieve speedups in single-task models, but the pruning of multi-task networks has not yet been extensively studied. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of structured pruning on multi-task models. We use an existing single-task filter pruning criterion and also introduce an MTL-based filter pruning criterion for estimating the filter importance scores. We prune the model using an iterative pruning strategy with both pruning methods. We show that, with careful hyper-parameter tuning, architectures obtained from different pruning methods do not have significant differences in their performances across tasks when the number of parameters is similar. We also show that iterative structure pruning may not be the best way to achieve a well-performing pruned model because, at extreme pruning levels, there is a high drop in performance across all tasks. But when the same models are randomly initialized and re-trained, they show better results.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
