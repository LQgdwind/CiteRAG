Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: NODDLE: Node2vec based deep learning model for link prediction This research is funded by NSERC Discovery Grant (RGPIN-2017-05377), held by Dr. Vijay Mago.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Computing the probability of an edge’s existence in a graph network is known as link prediction. While traditional methods calculate the similarity between two given nodes in a static network, recent research has focused on evaluating networks that evolve dynamically. Although deep learning techniques and network representation learning algorithms, such as node2vec, show remarkable improvements in prediction accuracy, the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) method of node2vec tends to fall into a mediocre local optimum value due to a shortage of prior network information, resulting in failure to capture the global structure of the network. To tackle this problem, we propose NODDLE (integration of NOde2vec anD Deep Learning mEthod), a deep learning model which incorporates the features extracted by node2vec and feeds them into a four layer hidden neural network. NODDLE takes advantage of adaptive learning optimizers such as Adam, Adamax, Adadelta, and Adagrad to improve the performance of link prediction. Experimental results show that this method yields better results than the traditional methods on various social network datasets.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 51\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
