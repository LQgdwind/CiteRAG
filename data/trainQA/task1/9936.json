Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: On Annihilators of Explicit Polynomial Maps\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study the algebraic complexity of annihilators of polynomials maps. In particular, when a polynomial map is ‘encoded by’ a small algebraic circuit, we show that the coefficients of an annihilator of the map can be computed in 𝖯𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤𝖯𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤\\mathsf{PSPACE}. Even when the underlying field is that of reals or complex numbers, an analogous statement is true. We achieve this by using the class 𝖵𝖯𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤𝖵𝖯𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤\\mathsf{VPSPACE} that coincides with computability of coefficients in 𝖯𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤𝖯𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤\\mathsf{PSPACE}, over integers. As a consequence, we derive the following two conditional results. First, we show that a 𝖵𝖯𝖵𝖯\\mathsf{VP}-explicit hitting set generator for all of 𝖵𝖯𝖵𝖯\\mathsf{VP} would separate either 𝖵𝖯𝖵𝖯\\mathsf{VP} from 𝖵𝖭𝖯𝖵𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{VNP}, or non-uniform 𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{P} from 𝖯𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤𝖯𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤\\mathsf{PSPACE}. Second, in relation to algebraic natural proofs, we show that proving an algebraic natural proofs barrier would imply either 𝖵𝖯≠𝖵𝖭𝖯𝖵𝖯𝖵𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{VP}\\neq\\mathsf{VNP} or 𝖣𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤​(loglog∗⁡n⁡n)⊄𝖯not-subset-of𝖣𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤superscriptsuperscript∗𝑛𝑛𝖯\\mathsf{DSPACE}(\\log^{\\log^{\\ast}n}n)\\not\\subset\\mathsf{P}.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
