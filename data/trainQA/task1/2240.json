Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: AutoSelect: Automatic and Dynamic Detection Selection for 3D Multi-Object Tracking\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract 3D multi-object tracking is an important component in robotic perception systems such as self-driving vehicles. Recent work follows a tracking-by-detection pipeline, which aims to match past tracklets with detections in the current frame. To avoid matching with false positive detections, prior work filters out detections with low confidence scores via a threshold. However, finding a proper threshold is non-trivial, which requires extensive manual search via ablation study. Also, this threshold is sensitive to many factors such as target object category so we need to re-search the threshold if these factors change. To ease this process, we propose to automatically select high-quality detections and remove the efforts needed for manual threshold search. Also, prior work often uses a single threshold per data sequence, which is sub-optimal in particular frames or for certain objects. Instead, we dynamically search threshold per frame or per object to further boost performance. Through experiments on KITTI and nuScenes, our method can filter out 45.7%percent45.745.7\\% false positives while maintaining the recall, achieving new S.O.T.A. performance and removing the need for manually threshold tuning.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 54\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
