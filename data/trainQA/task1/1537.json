Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Sufficient Dimension Reduction for Average Causal Effect Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Having a large number of covariates can have a negative impact on the quality of causal effect estimation since confounding adjustment becomes unreliable when the number of covariates is large relative to the samples available. Propensity score is a common way to deal with a large covariate set, but the accuracy of propensity score estimation (normally done by logistic regression) is also challenged by large number of covariates. In this paper, we prove that a large covariate set can be reduced to a lower dimensional representation which captures the complete information for adjustment in causal effect estimation. The theoretical result enables effective data-driven algorithms for causal effect estimation. We develop an algorithm which employs a supervised kernel dimension reduction method to search for a lower dimensional representation for the original covariates, and then utilizes nearest neighbor matching in the reduced covariate space to impute the counterfactual outcomes to avoid large-sized covariate set problem. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on two semi-synthetic and three real-world datasets and the results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the algorithm.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
