Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer.

      "content": "Paper Title: Variation-based Cause Effect Identification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Mining genuine mechanisms underlying the complex data generation process in real-world systems is a fundamental step in promoting interpretability of (and thus trust in) data-driven models. Therefore, we propose a variation-based cause effect identification (VCEI) framework for causal discovery in bivariate systems from a single observational setting. Our framework relies on the principle of independence of cause and mechanism (ICM) under the assumption of an existing acyclic causal link, and offers a practical realization of this principle. Principally, we artificially construct two settings in which the marginal distributions of one covariate, claimed to be the cause, are guaranteed to have non-negligible variations. This is achieved by re-weighting samples of the marginal so that the resultant distribution is notably distinct from this marginal according to some discrepancy measure. In the causal direction, such variations are expected to have no impact on the effect generation mechanism. Therefore, quantifying the impact of these variations on the conditionals reveals the genuine causal direction. Moreover, we formulate our approach in the kernel-based maximum mean discrepancy, lifting all constraints on the data types of cause and effect covariates, and rendering such artificial interventions a convex optimization problem. We provide a series of experiments on real and synthetic data showing that VCEI is, in principle, competitive to other cause effect identification frameworks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
