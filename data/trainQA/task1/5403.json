Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Contextual Semantic Embeddings for Ontology Subsumption Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Automating ontology construction and curation is an important but challenging task in knowledge engineering and artificial intelligence. Prediction by machine learning techniques such as contextual semantic embedding is a promising direction, but the relevant research is still preliminary especially for expressive ontologies in Web Ontology Language (OWL). In this paper, we present a new subsumption prediction method named BERTSubs for classes of OWL ontology. It exploits the pre-trained language model BERT to compute contextual embeddings of a class, where customized templates are proposed to incorporate the class context (e.g., neighbouring classes) and the logical existential restriction. BERTSubs is able to predict multiple kinds of subsumers including named classes from the same ontology or another ontology, and existential restrictions from the same ontology. Extensive evaluation on five real-world ontologies for three different subsumption tasks has shown the effectiveness of the templates and that BERTSubs can dramatically outperform the baselines that use (literal-aware) knowledge graph embeddings, non-contextual word embeddings and the state-of-the-art OWL ontology embeddings.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
