Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 64 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Super-Reparametrizations of Weighted CSPs: Properties and Optimization Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The notion of reparametrizations of Weighted CSPs (WCSPs) (also known as equivalence-preserving transformations of WCSPs) is well-known and finds its use in many algorithms to approximate or bound the optimal WCSP value. In contrast, the concept of super-reparametrizations (which are changes of the weights that keep or increase the WCSP objective for every assignment) was already proposed but never studied in detail. To fill this gap, we present a number of theoretical properties of super-reparametrizations and compare them to those of reparametrizations. Furthermore, we propose a framework for computing upper bounds on the optimal value of the (maximization version of) WCSP using super-reparametrizations. We show that it is in principle possible to employ arbitrary (under some technical conditions) constraint propagation rules to improve the bound. For arc consistency in particular, the method reduces to the known Virtual AC (VAC) algorithm. We implemented the method for singleton arc consistency (SAC) and compared it to other strong local consistencies in WCSPs on a public benchmark. The results show that the bounds obtained from SAC are superior for many instance groups.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 64 most likely reference titles for this paper.
