Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: \\dnn: A Dataflow-aware Flexible Deep Learning Accelerator for Energy-Efficient Edge Devices\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper introduces \\dnn, a Flexible Neural Network accelerator, which adopts agile design principles to enable versatile dataflows, enhancing energy efficiency. Unlike conventional convolutional neural network accelerator architectures that adhere to fixed dataflows (such as input, weight, output, or row stationary) for transferring activations and weights between storage and compute units, our design revolutionizes by enabling adaptable dataflows of any type through software configurable descriptors. Considering that data movement costs considerably outweigh compute costs from an energy perspective, the flexibility in dataflow allows us to optimize the movement per layer for minimal data transfer and energy consumption, a capability unattainable in fixed dataflow architectures. To further enhance throughput and reduce energy consumption in the \\dnnarchitecture, we propose a novel sparsity-based acceleration logic that utilizes fine-grained sparsity in both the activation and weight tensors to bypass redundant computations, thus optimizing the convolution engine within the hardware accelerator. Extensive experimental results underscore a significant enhancement in the performance and energy efficiency of \\dnnrelative to existing DNN accelerators.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
