Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring the Advantages of Dense-Vector to One-Hot Encoding of Intent Classes in Out-of-Scope Detection Tasks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This work explores the intrinsic limitations of the popular one-hot encoding method in classification of intents when detection of out-of-scope (OOS) inputs is required. Although recent work has shown that there can be significant improvements in OOS detection when the intent classes are represented as dense-vectors based on domain specific knowledge, we argue in this paper that such gains are more likely due to advantages of dense-vector to one-hot encoding methods in representing the complexity of the OOS space. We start by showing how dense-vector encodings can create OOS spaces with much richer topologies than one-hot encoding methods. We then demonstrate empirically, using four standard intent classification datasets, that knowledge-free, randomly generated dense-vector encodings of intent classes can yield massive, over 20% gains over one-hot encodings, and also outperform the previous, domain knowledge-based, SOTA of one of the datasets. We finish by describing a novel algorithm to search for good dense-vector encodings and present initial but promising experimental results of its use.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
