Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data.

      "content": "Paper Title: Jointly Attacking Graph Neural Network and its Explanations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have boosted the performance for many graph-related tasks. Despite the great success, recent studies have shown that GNNs are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where adversaries can mislead the GNNsâ€™ prediction by modifying graphs. On the other hand, the explanation of GNNs (GnnExplainer) provides a better understanding of a trained GNN model by generating a small subgraph and features that are most influential for its prediction. In this paper, we first perform empirical studies to validate that GnnExplainer can act as an inspection tool and have the potential to detect the adversarial perturbations for graphs. This finding motivates us to further initiate a new problem investigation: Whether a graph neural network and its explanations can be jointly attacked by modifying graphs with malicious desires? It is challenging to answer this question since the goals of adversarial attacks and bypassing the GnnExplainer essentially contradict each other. In this work, we give a confirmative answer to this question by proposing a novel attack framework (GEAttack), which can attack both a GNN model and its explanations by simultaneously exploiting their vulnerabilities. Extensive experiments on two explainers (GnnExplainer and PGExplainer) under various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
