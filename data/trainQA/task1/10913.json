      "content": "Paper Title: COLA: Cross-city Mobility Transformer for Human Trajectory Simulation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Human trajectory data produced by daily mobile devices has proven its usefulness in various substantial fields such as urban planning and epidemic prevention. In terms of the individual privacy concern, human trajectory simulation has attracted increasing attention from researchers, targeting at offering numerous realistic mobility data for downstream tasks. Nevertheless, the prevalent issue of data scarcity undoubtedly degrades the reliability of existing deep learning models. In this paper, we are motivated to explore the intriguing problem of mobility transfer across cities, grasping the universal patterns of human trajectories to augment the powerful Transformer with external mobility data. There are two crucial challenges arising in the knowledge transfer across cities: 1) how to transfer the Transformer to adapt for domain heterogeneity; 2) how to calibrate the Transformer to adapt for subtly different long-tail frequency distributions of locations. To address these challenges, we have tailored a Cross-city mObiLity trAnsformer (COLA) with a dedicated model-agnostic transfer framework by effectively transferring cross-city knowledge for human trajectory simulation. Firstly, COLA divides the Transformer into the private modules for city-specific characteristics and the shared modules for city-universal mobility patterns. Secondly, COLA leverages a lightweight yet effective post-hoc adjustment strategy for trajectory simulation, without disturbing the complex bi-level optimization of model-agnostic knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments of COLA compared to state-of-the-art single-city baselines and our implemented cross-city baselines have demonstrated its superiority and effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/Star607/Cross-city-Mobility-Transformer.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
