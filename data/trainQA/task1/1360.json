Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Look, Listen, and Attend: Co-Attention Network for Self-Supervised Audio-Visual Representation Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. When watching videos, the occurrence of a visual event is often accompanied by an audio event, e.g., the voice of lip motion, the music of playing instruments. There is an underlying correlation between audio and visual events, which can be utilized as free supervised information to train a neural network by solving the pretext task of audio-visual synchronization. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised framework with co-attention mechanism to learn generic cross-modal representations from unlabelled videos in the wild, and further benefit downstream tasks. Specifically, we explore three different co-attention modules to focus on discriminative visual regions correlated to the sounds and introduce the interactions between them. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the pretext task while having fewer parameters compared with existing methods. To further evaluate the generalizability and transferability of our approach, we apply the pre-trained model on two downstream tasks, i.e., sound source localization and action recognition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model provides competitive results with other self-supervised methods, and also indicate that our approach can tackle the challenging scenes which contain multiple sound sources.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
