Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Sequence Modeling is a Robust Contender for Offline Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Offline reinforcement learning (RL) allows agents to learn effective, return-maximizing policies from a static dataset. Three major paradigms for offline RL are Q-Learning, Imitation Learning, and Sequence Modeling. A key open question is: which paradigm is preferred under what conditions? We study this question empirically by exploring the performance of representative algorithms — Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), Behavior Cloning (BC), and Decision Transformer (DT) — across the commonly used d4rl and robomimic benchmarks. We design targeted experiments to understand their behavior concerning data suboptimality and task complexity. Our key findings are: (1) Sequence Modeling requires more data than Q-Learning to learn competitive policies but is more robust; (2) Sequence Modeling is a substantially better choice than both Q-Learning and Imitation Learning in sparse-reward and low-quality data settings; and (3) Sequence Modeling and Imitation Learning are preferable as task horizon increases, or when data is obtained from human demonstrators. Based on the overall strength of Sequence Modeling, we also investigate architectural choices and scaling trends for DT on atari and d4rl and make design recommendations. We find that scaling the amount of data for DT by 5x gives a 2.5x average score improvement on atari.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
