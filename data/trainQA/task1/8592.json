      "content": "Paper Title: Can deepfakes be created by novice users?\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recent advancements in machine learning and computer vision have led to the proliferation of Deepfakes. As technology democratizes over time, there is an increasing fear that novice users can create Deepfakes, to discredit others and undermine public discourse. In this paper, we conduct user studies to understand whether participants with advanced computer skills and varying level of computer science expertise can create Deepfakes of a person saying a target statement using limited media files. We conduct two studies; in the first study (n=39ùëõ39n=39) participants try creating a target Deepfake in a constrained time frame using any tool they desire. In the second study (n=29ùëõ29n=29) participants use pre-specified deep learning based tools to create the same Deepfake. We find that for the first study, 23.1%percent23.123.1\\% of the participants successfully created complete Deepfakes with audio and video, whereas for the second user study, 58.6%percent58.658.6\\% of the participants were successful in stitching target speech to the target video. We further use Deepfake detection software tools as well as human examiner-based analysis, to classify the successfully generated Deepfake outputs as fake, suspicious, or real. The software detector classified 80%percent8080\\% of the Deepfakes as fake, whereas the human examiners classified 100%percent100100\\% of the videos as fake. We conclude that creating Deepfakes is a simple enough task for a novice user given adequate tools and time; however, the resulting Deepfakes are not sufficiently real-looking and are unable to completely fool detection software as well as human examiners.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
