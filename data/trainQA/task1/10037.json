For the purpose of Open Access, the authors have applied a CC BY public copyright licence to any Author Accepted Manuscript version arising from this submission. All data is provided in full in the results section of this paper.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present polynomial-time SDP-based algorithms for the following problem: For fixed k≤ℓ𝑘ℓk\\leq\\ell, given a real number ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 and a graph G𝐺G that admits a k𝑘k-colouring with a ρ𝜌\\rho-fraction of the edges coloured properly, it returns an ℓℓ\\ell-colouring of G𝐺G with an (α​ρ−ε)𝛼𝜌𝜀(\\alpha\\rho-\\varepsilon)-fraction of the edges coloured properly in polynomial time in G𝐺G and 1/ε1𝜀1/\\varepsilon. Our algorithms are based on the algorithms of Frieze and Jerrum [Algorithmica’97] and of Karger, Motwani and Sudan [JACM’98]. For k=2,ℓ=3formulae-sequence𝑘2ℓ3k=2,\\ell=3, our algorithm achieves an approximation ratio α=1𝛼1\\alpha=1, which is the best possible. When k𝑘k is fixed and ℓℓ\\ell grows large, our algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of α=1−o​(1/ℓ)𝛼1𝑜1ℓ\\alpha=1-o(1/\\ell). When k,ℓ𝑘ℓk,\\ell are both large, our algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of α=1−1/ℓ+2​ln⁡ℓ/k​ℓ−o​(ln⁡ℓ/k​ℓ)−O​(1/k2)𝛼11ℓ2ℓ𝑘ℓ𝑜ℓ𝑘ℓ𝑂1superscript𝑘2\\alpha=1-1/\\ell+2\\ln\\ell/k\\ell-o(\\ln\\ell/k\\ell)-O(1/k^{2}); if we fix d=ℓ−k𝑑ℓ𝑘d=\\ell-k and allow k,ℓ𝑘ℓk,\\ell to grow large, this is α=1−1/ℓ+2​ln⁡ℓ/k​ℓ−o​(ln⁡ℓ/k​ℓ)𝛼11ℓ2ℓ𝑘ℓ𝑜ℓ𝑘ℓ\\alpha=1-1/\\ell+2\\ln\\ell/k\\ell-o(\\ln\\ell/k\\ell). By extending the results of Khot, Kindler, Mossel and O’Donnell [SICOMP’07] to the promise setting, we show that for large k𝑘k and ℓℓ\\ell, assuming Khot’s Unique Games Conjecture (UGC), it is \\NP-hard to achieve an approximation ratio α𝛼\\alpha greater than 1−1/ℓ+2​ln⁡ℓ/k​ℓ+o​(ln⁡ℓ/k​ℓ)11ℓ2ℓ𝑘ℓ𝑜ℓ𝑘ℓ1-1/\\ell+2\\ln\\ell/k\\ell+o(\\ln\\ell/k\\ell), provided that ℓℓ\\ell is bounded by a function that is o​(exp⁡(k3))𝑜3𝑘o(\\exp(\\sqrt[3]{k})). For the case where d=ℓ−k𝑑ℓ𝑘d=\\ell-k is fixed, this bound matches the performance of our algorithm up to o​(ln⁡ℓ/k​ℓ)𝑜ℓ𝑘ℓo(\\ln\\ell/k\\ell). Furthermore, by extending the results of Guruswami and Sinop [ToC’13] to the promise setting, we prove that it is \\NP-hard to achieve an approximation ratio greater than 1−1/ℓ+8​ln⁡ℓ/k​ℓ+o​(ln⁡ℓ/k​ℓ)11ℓ8ℓ𝑘ℓ𝑜ℓ𝑘ℓ1-1/\\ell+8\\ln\\ell/k\\ell+o(\\ln\\ell/k\\ell), provided again that ℓℓ\\ell is bounded as before (but this time without assuming the UGC).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
