      "content": "Paper Title: Two Results on LPT: A Near-Linear Time Algorithm and Parcel Delivery using Drones\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The focus of this paper is to increase our understanding of the Longest Processing Time First (LPT) heuristic. LPT is a classical heuristic for the fundamental problem of uniform machine scheduling. For different machine speeds, LPT was first considered by Gonzalez et al. (SIAM J. Comput. 6(1):155‚Äì166, 1977). Since then, extensive work has been done to improve the approximation factor of the LPT heuristic. However, all known implementations of the LPT heuristic take O‚Äã(m‚Äãn)ùëÇùëöùëõO(mn) time, where mùëöm is the number of machines and nùëõn is the number of jobs. In this work, we come up with the first near-linear time implementation for LPT. Specifically, the running time is O‚Äã((n+m)‚Äã(log2‚Å°m+log‚Å°n))ùëÇùëõùëösuperscript2ùëöùëõO((n+m)(\\log^{2}{m}+\\log{n})). Somewhat surprisingly, the result is obtained by mapping the problem to dynamic maintenance of lower envelope of lines, which has been well studied in the computational geometry community. Our second contribution is to analyze the performance of LPT for the Drones Warehouse Problem (DWP), which is a natural generalization of the uniform machine scheduling problem motivated by drone-based parcel delivery from a warehouse. In this problem, a warehouse has multiple drones and wants to deliver parcels to several customers. Each drone picks a parcel from the warehouse, delivers it, and returns to the warehouse (where it can also get charged). The speeds and battery lives of the drones could be different, and due to the limited battery life, each drone has a bounded range in which it can deliver parcels. The goal is to assign parcels to the drones so that the time taken to deliver all the parcels is minimized. We prove that the natural approach of solving this problem via the LPT heuristic has an approximation factor of œïitalic-œï\\phi, where œï‚âà1.62italic-œï1.62\\phi\\approx 1.62 is the golden ratio.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
