Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: kD-STR: A Method for Spatio-Temporal Data Reduction and Modelling\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Analysing and learning from spatio-temporal datasets is an important process in many domains, including transportation, healthcare and meteorology. In particular, data collected by sensors in the environment allows us to understand and model the processes acting within the environment. Recently, the volume of spatio-temporal data collected has increased significantly, presenting several challenges for data scientists. Methods are therefore needed to reduce the quantity of data that needs to be processed in order to analyse and learn from spatio-temporal datasets. In this paper, we present the kùëòk-Dimensional Spatio-Temporal Reduction method (kùëòkD-STR) for reducing the quantity of data used to store a dataset whilst enabling multiple types of analysis on the reduced dataset. kùëòkD-STR uses hierarchical partitioning to find spatio-temporal regions of similar instances and models the instances within each region to summarise the dataset. We demonstrate the generality of kùëòkD-STR with 3 datasets exhibiting different spatio-temporal characteristics and present results for a range of data modelling techniques. Finally, we compare kùëòkD-STR with other techniques for reducing the volume of spatio-temporal data. Our results demonstrate that kùëòkD-STR is effective in reducing spatio-temporal data and generalises to datasets that exhibit different properties.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
