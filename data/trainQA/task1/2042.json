Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Channel Tiling for Improved Performance and Accuracy of Optical Neural Network Accelerators\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Low latency, high throughput inference on Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) remains a challenge, especially for applications requiring large input or large kernel sizes. 4F optics provides a solution to accelerate CNNs by converting convolutions into Fourier-domain point-wise multiplications that are computationally ’free’ in the optical domain. However, existing 4F CNN systems suffer from the all-positive sensor readout issue, making the implementation of a multi-channel, multi-layer CNN not scalable or even impractical. In this paper, we propose a simple channel tiling scheme for 4F CNN systems that utilizes the high resolution of 4F systems to perform channel summation inherently in the optical domain before sensor detection, so the outputs of different channels can be correctly accumulated. Compared to state of the art, channel tiling gives similar accuracy, significantly better robustness to sensing quantization error (33 percent improvement in required sensing precision) and noise (10dB reduction in tolerable sensing noise), 0.5X total filters required, 10-50X+ throughput improvement and 3X+ reduction in required output camera resolution/bandwidth. Not requiring any additional optical hardware, the proposed channel tiling approach addresses an important throughput and precision bottleneck of high-speed, massively-parallel optical 4F computing systems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
