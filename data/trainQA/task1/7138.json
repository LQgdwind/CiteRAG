Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Task Phasing: Automated Curriculum Learning from Demonstrations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Applying reinforcement learning (RL) to sparse reward domains is notoriously challenging due to insufficient guiding signals. Common RL techniques for addressing such domains include (1) learning from demonstrations and (2) curriculum learning. While these two approaches have been studied in detail, they have rarely been considered together. This paper aims to do so by introducing a principled task phasing approach that uses demonstrations to automatically generate a curriculum sequence. Using inverse RL from (suboptimal) demonstrations we define a simple initial task. Our task phasing approach then provides a framework to gradually increase the complexity of the task all the way to the target task, while retuning the RL agent in each phasing iteration. Two approaches for phasing are considered: (1) gradually increasing the proportion of time steps an RL agent is in control, and (2) phasing out a guiding informative reward function. We present conditions that guarantee the convergence of these approaches to an optimal policy. Experimental results on 3 sparse reward domains demonstrate that our task phasing approaches outperform state-of-the-art approaches with respect to asymptotic performance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
