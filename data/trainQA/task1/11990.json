Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Optical orthogonal codes from a combinatorial perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Optical orthogonal codes (OOCs) are sets of (0,1)01(0,1)-sequences with good auto- and cross- correlation properties. They were originally introduced for use in multi-access communication, particularly in the setting of optical CDMA communications systems. They can also be formulated in terms of families of subsets of ℤvsubscriptℤ𝑣\\mathbb{Z}_{v}, where the correlation properties can be expressed in terms of conditions on the internal and external differences within and between the subsets. With this link there have been many studies on their combinatorial properties. However, in most of these studies it is assumed that the auto- and cross-correlation values are equal; in particular, many constructions focus on the case where both correlation values are 111. This is not a requirement of the original communications application. In this paper, we “decouple” the two correlation values and consider the situation with correlation values greater than 111. We consider the bounds on each of the correlation values, and the structural implications of meeting these separately, as well as associated links with other combinatorial objects. We survey definitions, properties and constructions, establish some new connections and concepts, and discuss open questions. Keywords: Optical orthogonal codes, internal and external differences, auto-correlation, cross-correlation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
