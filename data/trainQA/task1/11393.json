Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Time-varying Extremum Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We introduce time-varying extremum graph (tveg), a topological structure to support visualization and analysis of a time-varying scalar field. The extremum graph is a substructure of the Morse-Smale complex. It captures the adjacency relationship between cells in the Morse decomposition of a scalar field. We define the tveg as a time-varying extension of the extremum graph and demonstrate how it captures salient feature tracks within a dynamic scalar field. We formulate the construction of the tveg as an optimization problem and describe an algorithm for computing the graph. We also demonstrate the capabilities of tveg towards identification and exploration of topological events such as deletion, generation, split, and merge within a dynamic scalar field via comprehensive case studies including a viscous fingers and a 3D von Kármán vortex street dataset. {CCSXML} <ccs2012> <concept> <concept_id>10003120.10003145.10003146</concept_id> <concept_desc>Human-centered computing Visualization techniques</concept_desc> <concept_significance>500</concept_significance> </concept> <concept> <concept_id>10003120.10003145.10003147.10010364</concept_id> <concept_desc>Human-centered computing Scientific visualization</concept_desc> <concept_significance>500</concept_significance> </concept> </ccs2012> \\ccsdesc [500]Human-centered computing Visualization techniques \\ccsdesc[500]Human-centered computing Scientific visualization \\printccsdesc\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
