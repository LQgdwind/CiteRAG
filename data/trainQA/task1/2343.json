      "content": "Paper Title: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Assisted Mobile Edge Computing with Heterogeneous Learning Tasks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The ever-growing popularity and rapid improving of artificial intelligence (AI) have raised rethinking on the evolution of wireless networks. Mobile edge computing (MEC) provides a natural platform for AI applications since it is with rich computation resources to train machine learning (ML) models, as well as low-latency access to the data generated by mobile and internet of things (IoT) devices. In this paper, we present an infrastructure to perform ML tasks at an MEC server with the assistance of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). In contrast to conventional communication systems where the principal criterions are to maximize the throughput, we aim at maximizing the learning performance. Specifically, we minimize the maximum learning error of all participating users by jointly optimizing transmit power of mobile users, beamforming vectors of the base station (BS), and the phase-shift matrix of the RIS. An alternating optimization (AO)-based framework is proposed to optimize the three terms iteratively, where a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm is developed to solve the power allocation problem, closed-form expressions of the beamforming vectors are derived, and an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm is designed together with an error level searching (ELS) framework to effectively solve the challenging nonconvex optimization problem of the phase-shift matrix. Simulation results demonstrate significant gains of deploying an RIS and validate the advantages of our proposed algorithms over various benchmarks. Lastly, a unified communication-training-inference platform is developed based on the CARLA platform and the SECOND network, and a use case (3D object detection in autonomous driving) for the proposed scheme is demonstrated on the developed platform.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
