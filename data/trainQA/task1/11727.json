Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: How the (Tensor-) Brain uses Embeddings and Embodiment to Encode Senses and Decode Symbols\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The tensor brain has been introduced as a computational model for perception and memory. We provide an overview of the tensor brain model, including recent developments. The tensor brain has two major layers: the representation layer and the index layer. The representation layer is a model for the subsymbolic global workspace from consciousness research. The state of the representation layer is the cognitive brain state. The index layer contains symbols for concepts, time instances, and predicates. In a bottom-up operation, the cognitive brain state is encoded by the index layer as symbolic labels. In a top-down operation, symbols are decoded and written to the representation layer. This feeds to earlier processing layers as embodiment. The top-down operation became the basis for semantic memory. The embedding vector of a concept forms the connection weights between its index and the representation layer. The embedding is the signature or “DNA” of a concept, which is decoded by the brain when its index is activated. It integrates all that is known about a concept from different experiences, modalities, and symbolic decodings. Although being computational, it has been suggested that the tensor brain might be related to the actual operation of the brain. The sequential nature of symbol generation might have been a prerequisite to the generation of natural language. We describe an attention mechanism and discuss multitasking by multiplexing. We emphasize the inherent multimodality of the tensor brain. Finally, we discuss embedded and symbolic reasoning.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
