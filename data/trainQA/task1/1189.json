Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Local Certification of Graphs with Bounded Genus\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Naor, Parter, and Yogev [SODA 2020] recently designed a compiler for automatically translating standard centralized interactive protocols to distributed interactive protocols, as introduced by Kol, Oshman, and Saxena [PODC 2018]. In particular, by using this compiler, every linear-time algorithm for deciding the membership to some fixed graph class can be translated into a ùñΩùñ¨ùñ†ùñ¨‚Äã(O‚Äã(log‚Å°n))ùñΩùñ¨ùñ†ùñ¨ùëÇùëõ\\mathsf{dMAM}(O(\\log n)) protocol for this class, that is, a distributed interactive protocol with O‚Äã(log‚Å°n)ùëÇùëõO(\\log n)-bit proof size in nùëõn-node graphs, and three interactions between the (centralizer) computationally-unbounded but non-trustable prover Merlin, and the (decentralized) randomized computationally-limited verifier Arthur. As a corollary, there is a ùñΩùñ¨ùñ†ùñ¨‚Äã(O‚Äã(log‚Å°n))ùñΩùñ¨ùñ†ùñ¨ùëÇùëõ\\mathsf{dMAM}(O(\\log n)) protocol for the class of planar graphs, as well as for the class of graphs with bounded genus. We show that there exists a distributed interactive protocol for the class of graphs with bounded genus performing just a single interaction, from the prover to the verifier, yet preserving proof size of O‚Äã(log‚Å°n)ùëÇùëõO(\\log n) bits. This result also holds for the class of graphs with bounded demi-genus, that is, graphs that can be embedded on a non-orientable surface of bounded genus. The interactive protocols described in this paper are actually proof-labeling schemes, i.e., a subclass of interactive protocols, previously introduced by Korman, Kutten, and Peleg [PODC 2005]. In particular, these schemes do not require any randomization from the verifier, and the proofs may often be computed a priori, at low cost, by the nodes themselves. Our results thus extend the recent proof-labeling scheme for planar graphs by Feuilloley et al. [PODC 2020], to graphs of bounded genus, and to graphs of bounded demigenus.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
