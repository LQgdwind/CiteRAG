Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Hierarchical Position Embedding of Graphs with Landmarks and Clustering for Link Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Learning positional information of nodes in a graph is important for link prediction tasks. We propose a representation of positional information using representative nodes called landmarks. A small number of nodes with high degree centrality are selected as landmarks, which serve as reference points for the nodes’ positions. We justify this selection strategy for well-known random graph models and derive closed-form bounds on the average path lengths involving landmarks. In a model for power-law graphs, we prove that landmarks provide asymptotically exact information on inter-node distances. We apply theoretical insights to practical networks and propose Hierarchical Position embedding with Landmarks and Clustering (HPLC). HPLC combines landmark selection and graph clustering, where the graph is partitioned into densely connected clusters in which nodes with the highest degree are selected as landmarks. HPLC leverages the positional information of nodes based on landmarks at various levels of hierarchy such as nodes’ distances to landmarks, inter-landmark distances and hierarchical grouping of clusters. Experiments show that HPLC achieves state-of-the-art performances of link prediction on various datasets in terms of HIT@K, MRR, and AUC. The code is available at https://github.com/kmswin1/HPLC.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
