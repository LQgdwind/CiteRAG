      "content": "Paper Title: Non-Clashing Teaching Maps for Balls in GraphsThis work was supported by the Austrian Science Foundation (FWF, project Y1329) and the ANR projects DISTANCIA (ANR-17-CE40-0015) and DUCAT (ANR-20-CE48-0006).\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recently, non-clashing teaching was introduced by Kirkpatrick et al. [ALT 2019] and Fallat et al. [JMLR 2023], and it was shown to be the most efficient machine teaching model that satisfies the benchmark for collusion-avoidance set by Goldman and Mathias. A teaching map T𝑇T for a concept class 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} assigns a (teaching) set T​(C)𝑇𝐶T(C) of examples to each concept C∈𝒞𝐶𝒞C\\in\\mathcal{C}. A teaching map is non-clashing if no pair of concepts of 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} are consistent with the union of their teaching sets. The size of a non-clashing teaching map (NCTM) T𝑇T is the maximum size of a teaching set T​(C)𝑇𝐶T(C), C∈𝒞𝐶𝒞C\\in\\mathcal{C}. The non-clashing teaching dimension NCTD⁡(𝒞)NCTD𝒞\\operatorname{NCTD}(\\mathcal{C}) of 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is the minimum size of an NCTM for 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}. NCTM+s and NCTD(𝒞)+{}^{+}(\\mathcal{C}) are defined analogously, except that the teacher may only use positive examples. We investigate NCTMs and NCTM+s for the concept class ℬ​(G)ℬ𝐺\\mathcal{B}(G) consisting of all balls of a graph G𝐺G. We show that the associated decision problem B-NCTD+ for NCTD+ is \\NP-complete in split, co-bipartite, and bipartite graphs. Surprisingly, we even prove that, unless the ETH fails, B-NCTD+ does not admit an algorithm running in time 22o​(𝚟𝚌)⋅n𝒪​(1)⋅superscript2superscript2𝑜𝚟𝚌superscript𝑛𝒪12^{2^{o(\\mathtt{vc})}}\\cdot n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}, nor a kernelization algorithm outputting a kernel with 2o​(𝚟𝚌)superscript2𝑜𝚟𝚌2^{o(\\mathtt{vc})} vertices, where 𝚟𝚌𝚟𝚌\\mathtt{vc} is the vertex cover number of G𝐺G. These are two extremely rare results: it is only the second (fourth, respectively) problem in \\NP to admit such a double-exponential lower bound parameterized by 𝚟𝚌𝚟𝚌\\mathtt{vc} (the treewidth, respectively), and only one of very few problems to admit such an ETH-based conditional lower bound on the number of vertices in a kernel. We complement these lower bounds with matching upper bounds. For trees, interval graphs, cycles, and trees of cycles, we then derive NCTM+s or NCTMs for ℬ​(G)ℬ𝐺\\mathcal{B}(G) of size proportional to the VC-dimension of ℬ​(G)ℬ𝐺\\mathcal{B}(G). Finally, for Gromov-hyperbolic graphs, we design an approximate version of an NCTM+ for ℬ​(G)ℬ𝐺\\mathcal{B}(G) of small size, in which only pairs of balls that have Hausdorff distance larger than some constant must satisfy the non-clashing condition.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
