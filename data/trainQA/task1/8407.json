Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: MEnsA: Mix-up Ensemble Average for Unsupervised Multi Target Domain Adaptation on 3D Point Clouds\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses the problem of distribution shift between the unlabeled target domain and labelled source domain. While the single target domain adaptation (STDA) is well studied in both 2D and 3D vision literature, multi-target domain adaptation (MTDA) is barely explored for 3D data despite its wide real-world applications such as autonomous driving systems for various geographical and climatic conditions. We establish an MTDA baseline for 3D point cloud data by proposing to mix the feature representations from all domains together to achieve better domain adaptation performance by an ensemble average, which we call Mixup Ensemble Average or MEnsA. With the mixed representation, we use a domain classifier to improve at distinguishing the feature representations of source domain from those of target domains in a shared latent space. In extensive empirical validations on the challenging PointDA-10 dataset, we showcase a clear benefit of our simple method over previous unsupervised STDA and MTDA methods by large margins (up to 17.10%percent17.1017.10\\% and 4.76%percent4.764.76\\% on averaged over all domain shifts). We make the code publicly available here.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
