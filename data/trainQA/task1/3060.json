Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: On the Impact of Knowledge-based Linguistic Annotations in the Quality of Scientific Embeddings\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In essence, embedding algorithms work by optimizing the distance between a word and its usual context in order to generate an embedding space that encodes the distributional representation of words. In addition to single words or word pieces, other features which result from the linguistic analysis of text, including lexical, grammatical and semantic information, can be used to improve the quality of embedding spaces. However, until now we did not have a precise understanding of the impact that such individual annotations and their possible combinations may have in the quality of the embeddings. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on the use of explicit linguistic annotations to generate embeddings from a scientific corpus and quantify their impact in the resulting representations. Our results show how the effect of such annotations in the embeddings varies depending on the evaluation task. In general, we observe that learning embeddings using linguistic annotations contributes to achieve better evaluation results.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
