Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Lipschitz regularization for softening material models: the Lip-field approach\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Softening material models are known to trigger spurious localizations. This may be shown theoretically by the existence of solutions with zero dissipation when localization occurs and numerically with spurious mesh dependency and localization in a single layer of elements. We introduce in this paper a new way to avoid spurious localization. The idea is to enforce a Lipschitz regularity on the internal variables responsible for the material softening. The regularity constraint introduces the needed length scale in the material formulation. Moreover, we prove bounds on the domain affected by this constraint. A first one-dimensional finite element implementation is proposed for softening elasticity and softening plasticity.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
