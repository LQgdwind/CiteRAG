      "content": "Paper Title: The Space Complexity of Sum Labelling\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A graph is called a sum graph if its vertices can be labelled by distinct positive integers such that there is an edge between two vertices if and only if the sum of their labels is the label of another vertex of the graph. Most papers on sum graphs consider combinatorial questions like the minimum number of isolated vertices that need to be added to a given graph to make it a sum graph. In this paper, we initiate the study of sum graphs from the viewpoint of computational complexity. Notice that every n𝑛n-vertex sum graph can be represented by a sorted list of n𝑛n positive integers where edge queries can be answered in 𝒪​(log⁡n)𝒪𝑛\\mathscr{O}(\\log n) time. Therefore, limiting the size of the vertex labels upper-bounds the space complexity of storing the graph in the database. We show that every n𝑛n-vertex, m𝑚m-edge, d𝑑d-degenerate graph can be made a sum graph by adding at most m𝑚m isolated vertices to it, such that the size of each vertex label is at most 𝒪​(n2​d)𝒪superscript𝑛2𝑑\\mathscr{O}(n^{2}d). This enables us to store the graph using 𝒪​(m​log⁡n)𝒪𝑚𝑛\\mathscr{O}(m\\log n) bits of memory. For sparse graphs (graphs with 𝒪​(n)𝒪𝑛\\mathscr{O}(n) edges), this matches the trivial lower bound of Ω​(n​log⁡n)Ω𝑛𝑛\\Omega(n\\log n). As planar graphs and forests have constant degeneracy, our result implies an upper bound of 𝒪​(n2)𝒪superscript𝑛2\\mathscr{O}(n^{2}) on their label size. The previously best known upper bound on the label size of general graphs with the minimum number of isolated vertices was 𝒪​(4n)𝒪superscript4𝑛\\mathscr{O}(4^{n}), due to Kratochvíl, Miller & Nguyen (2001). Furthermore, their proof was existential, whereas our labelling can be constructed in polynomial time.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
