Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Semantic Segmentation with Active Semi-Supervised Representation Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Obtaining human per-pixel labels for semantic segmentation is incredibly laborious, often making labeled dataset construction prohibitively expensive. Here, we endeavor to overcome this problem with a novel algorithm that combines semi-supervised and active learning, resulting in the ability to train an effective semantic segmentation algorithm with significantly lesser labeled data. To do this, we extend the prior state-of-the-art S4AL algorithm by replacing its mean teacher approach for semi-supervised learning with a self-training approach that improves learning with noisy labels. We further boost the neural network’s ability to query useful data by adding a contrastive learning head, which leads to better understanding of the objects in the scene, and hence, better queries for active learning. We evaluate our method on CamVid and CityScapes datasets, the de-facto standards for active learning for semantic segmentation. We achieve more than 95% of the network’s performance on CamVid and CityScapes datasets, utilizing only 12.1% and 15.1% of the labeled data, respectively. We also benchmark our method across existing stand-alone semi-supervised learning methods on the CityScapes dataset and achieve superior performance without any bells or whistles.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
