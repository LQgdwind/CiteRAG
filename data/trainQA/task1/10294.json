Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Source Collaborative Gradient Discrepancy Minimization for Federated Domain Generalization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Federated Domain Generalization aims to learn a domain-invariant model from multiple decentralized source domains for deployment on unseen target domain. Due to privacy concerns, the data from different source domains are kept isolated, which poses challenges in bridging the domain gap. To address this issue, we propose a Multi-source Collaborative Gradient Discrepancy Minimization (MCGDM) method for federated domain generalization. Specifically, we propose intra-domain gradient matching between the original images and augmented images to avoid overfitting the domain-specific information within isolated domains. Additionally, we propose inter-domain gradient matching with the collaboration of other domains, which can further reduce the domain shift across decentralized domains. Combining intra-domain and inter-domain gradient matching, our method enables the learned model to generalize well on unseen domains. Furthermore, our method can be extended to the federated domain adaptation task by fine-tuning the target model on the pseudo-labeled target domain. The extensive experiments on federated domain generalization and adaptation indicate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
