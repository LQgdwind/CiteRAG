      "content": "Paper Title: Dumpling GNN: Hybrid GNN Enables Better ADC Payload Activity Prediction Based on Chemical Structure\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a promising class of targeted cancer therapeutics, but the design and optimization of their cytotoxic payloads remain challenging. This study introduces DumplingGNN, a novel hybrid Graph Neural Network architecture specifically designed for predicting ADC payload activity based on chemical structure. By integrating Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and GraphSAGE layers, DumplingGNN effectively captures multi-scale molecular features and leverages both 2D topological and 3D structural information. We evaluate DumplingGNN on a comprehensive ADC payload dataset focusing on DNA Topoisomerase I inhibitors, as well as on multiple public benchmarks from MoleculeNet. DumplingGNN achieves state-of-the-art performance across several datasets, including BBBP (96.4% ROC-AUC), ToxCast (78.2% ROC-AUC), and PCBA (88.87% ROC-AUC). On our specialized ADC payload dataset, it demonstrates exceptional accuracy (91.48%), sensitivity (95.08%), and specificity (97.54%). Ablation studies confirm the synergistic effects of the hybrid architecture and the critical role of 3D structural information in enhancing predictive accuracy. The model’s strong interpretability, enabled by attention mechanisms, provides valuable insights into structure-activity relationships. DumplingGNN represents a significant advancement in molecular property prediction, with particular promise for accelerating the design and optimization of ADC payloads in targeted cancer therapy development.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 53\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
