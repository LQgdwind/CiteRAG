Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Encouraging Intra-Class Diversity Through a Reverse Contrastive Loss for Single-Source Domain Generalization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Traditional deep learning algorithms often fail to generalize when they are tested outside of the domain of the training data. The issue can be mitigated by using unlabeled data from the target domain at training time, but because data distributions can change dynamically in real-life applications once a learned model is deployed, it is critical to create networks robust to unknown and unforeseen domain shifts. In this paper we focus on one of the reasons behind the inability of neural networks to be so: deep networks focus only on the most obvious, potentially spurious, clues to make their predictions and are blind to useful but slightly less efficient or more complex patterns. This behaviour has been identified and several methods partially addressed the issue. To investigate their effectiveness and limits, we first design a publicly available MNIST-based benchmark to precisely measure the ability of an algorithm to find the ”hidden” patterns. Then, we evaluate state-of-the-art algorithms through our benchmark and show that the issue is largely unsolved. Finally, we propose a partially reversed contrastive loss to encourage intra-class diversity and find less strongly correlated patterns, whose efficiency is demonstrated by our experiments.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 50\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
