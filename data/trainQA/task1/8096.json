Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Q-Cogni: An Integrated Causal Reinforcement Learning Framework\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present Q-Cogni, an algorithmically integrated causal reinforcement learning framework that redesigns Q-Learning with an autonomous causal structure discovery method to improve the learning process with causal inference. Q-Cogni achieves optimal learning with a pre-learned structural causal model of the environment that can be queried during the learning process to infer cause-and-effect relationships embedded in a state-action space. We leverage on the sample efficient techniques of reinforcement learning, enable reasoning about a broader set of policies and bring higher degrees of interpretability to decisions made by the reinforcement learning agent. We apply Q-Cogni on the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) and compare against state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms. We report results that demonstrate better policies, improved learning efficiency and superior interpretability of the agentâ€™s decision making. We also compare this approach with traditional shortest-path search algorithms and demonstrate the benefits of our causal reinforcement learning framework to high dimensional problems. Finally, we apply Q-Cogni to derive optimal routing decisions for taxis in New York City using the Taxi & Limousine Commission trip record data and compare with shortest-path search, reporting results that show 85% of the cases with an equal or better policy derived from Q-Cogni in a real-world domain.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
