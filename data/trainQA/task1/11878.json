Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: DiffuseST: Unleashing the Capability of the Diffusion Model for Style Transfer\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Style transfer aims to fuse the artistic representation of a style image with the structural information of a content image. Existing methods train specific networks or utilize pre-trained models to learn content and style features. However, they rely solely on textual or spatial representations that are inadequate to achieve the balance between content and style. In this work, we propose a novel and training-free approach for style transfer, combining textual embedding with spatial features and separating the injection of content or style. Specifically, we adopt the BLIP-2 encoder to extract the textual representation of the style image. We utilize the DDIM inversion technique to extract intermediate embeddings in content and style branches as spatial features. Finally, we harness the step-by-step property of diffusion models by separating the injection of content and style in the target branch, which improves the balance between content preservation and style fusion. Various experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed DiffeseST for achieving balanced and controllable style transfer results, as well as the potential to extend to other tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/DiffuseST.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
