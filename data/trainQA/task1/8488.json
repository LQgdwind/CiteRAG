Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Near Tight Shortest Paths in the Hybrid Model\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Shortest paths problems are subject to extensive studies in classic distributed models such as the 𝖢𝖮𝖭𝖦𝖤𝖲𝖳𝖢𝖮𝖭𝖦𝖤𝖲𝖳\\mathsf{CONGEST} or 𝖢𝗈𝗇𝗀𝖾𝗌𝗍𝖾𝖽​𝖢𝗅𝗂𝗊𝗎𝖾𝖢𝗈𝗇𝗀𝖾𝗌𝗍𝖾𝖽𝖢𝗅𝗂𝗊𝗎𝖾\\mathsf{Congested\\,Clique}. These models dictate how nodes may communicate in order to determine shortest paths in a distributed input graph. This article focuses on shortest paths problems in the 𝖧𝖸𝖡𝖱𝖨𝖣𝖧𝖸𝖡𝖱𝖨𝖣\\mathsf{HYBRID} model, which combines local communication along edges of the input graph with global communication between arbitrary pairs of nodes that is restricted in terms of bandwidth. Previous work showed that it takes Ω~​(k)~Ω𝑘\\smash{\\widetilde{\\Omega}}(\\!\\sqrt{k}) rounds in the 𝖧𝖸𝖡𝖱𝖨𝖣𝖧𝖸𝖡𝖱𝖨𝖣\\mathsf{HYBRID} model for each node to learn its distance to k𝑘k dedicated source nodes (aka the k𝑘k-SSP problem), even for crude approximations. This lower bound was also matched with algorithmic solutions for k≥n2/3𝑘superscript𝑛23k\\geq n^{2/3}. However, as k𝑘k gets smaller, the gap between the known upper and lower bounds diverges and even becomes exponential for the single source shortest paths problem (SSSP). In this work we close this gap for the whole range of k𝑘k (up to terms that are polylogarithmic in n𝑛n), by giving algorithmic solutions for k𝑘k-SSP in O~​(k)~𝑂𝑘\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}\\big{(}\\!\\sqrt{k}\\big{)} rounds for any k𝑘k.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
