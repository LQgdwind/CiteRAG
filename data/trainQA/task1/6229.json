Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Collaborative Knowledge Graph Fusion by Exploiting the Open Corpus\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract To alleviate the challenges of building Knowledge Graphs (KG) from scratch, a more general task is to enrich a KG using triples from an open corpus, where the obtained triples contain noisy entities and relations. It is challenging to enrich a KG with newly harvested triples while maintaining the quality of the knowledge representation. This paper proposes a system to refine a KG using information harvested from an additional corpus. To this end, we formulate our task as two coupled sub-tasks, namely join event extraction (JEE) and knowledge graph fusion (KGF). We then propose a Collaborative Knowledge Graph Fusion Framework to allow our sub-tasks to mutually assist one another in an alternating manner. More concretely, the explorer carries out the JEE supervised by both the ground-truth annotation and an existing KG provided by the supervisor. The supervisor then evaluates the triples extracted by the explorer and enriches the KG with those that are highly ranked. To implement this evaluation, we further propose a Translated Relation Alignment Scoring Mechanism to align and translate the extracted triples to the prior KG. Experiments verify that this collaboration can both improve the performance of the JEE and the KGF.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
