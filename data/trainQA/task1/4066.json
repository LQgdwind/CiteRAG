Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Adversarial Motorial Prototype Framework for Open Set Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Open set recognition is designed to identify known classes and to reject unknown classes simultaneously. Specifically, identifying known classes and rejecting unknown classes correspond to reducing the empirical risk and the open space risk, respectively. First, the motorial prototype framework (MPF) is proposed, which classifies known classes according to the prototype classification idea. Moreover, a motorial margin constraint term is added into the loss function of the MPF, which can further improve the clustering compactness of known classes in the feature space to reduce both risks. Second, this paper proposes the adversarial motorial prototype framework (AMPF) based on the MPF. On the one hand, this model can generate adversarial samples and add these samples into the training phase; on the other hand, it can further improve the differential mapping ability of the model to known and unknown classes with the adversarial motion of the margin constraint radius. Finally, this paper proposes an upgraded version of the AMPF, AMPF++, which adds much more generated unknown samples into the training phase. In this paper, a large number of experiments prove that the performance of the proposed models is superior to that of other current works.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
