Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Exploiting Side Information for Improved Online Learning Algorithms in Wireless Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In wireless networks, the rate achieved depends on factors like level of interference, hardware impairments, and channel gain. Often, instantaneous values of some of these factors can be measured, and they provide useful information about the instantaneous rate achieved. For example, higher interference implies a lower rate. In this work, we treat any such measurable quality that has a non-zero correlation with the rate achieved as side-information and study how it can be exploited to quickly learn the channel that offers higher throughput (reward). When the mean value of the side-information is known, using control variate theory we develop algorithms that require fewer samples to learn the parameters and can improve the learning rate compared to cases where side-information is ignored. Specifically, we incorporate side-information in the classical Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm and quantify the gain achieved in the regret performance. We show that the gain is proportional to the amount of the correlation between the reward and associated side-information. We discuss in detail various side-information that can be exploited in cognitive radio and air-to-ground communication in L‚àílimit-fromùêøL-band. We demonstrate that correlation between the reward and side-information is often strong in practice and exploiting it improves the throughput significantly.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
