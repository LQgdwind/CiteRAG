Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Machine Learning based CVD Virtual Metrology in Mass Produced Semiconductor Process\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A cross-benchmark has been done on three critical aspects, data imputing, feature selection and regression algorithms, for machine learning based chemical vapor deposition (CVD) virtual metrology (VM). The result reveals that linear feature selection regression algorithm would extensively under-fit the VM data. Data imputing is also necessary to achieve a higher prediction accuracy as the data availability is only âˆ¼similar-to\\sim70% when optimal accuracy is obtained. This work suggests a nonlinear feature selection and regression algorithm combined with nearest data imputing algorithm would provide a prediction accuracy as high as 0.7. This would lead to 70% reduced CVD processing variation, which is believed to will lead to reduced frequency of physical metrology as well as more reliable mass-produced wafer with improved quality.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
