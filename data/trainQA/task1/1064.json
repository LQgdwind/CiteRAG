Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: A spectral collocation method for the Landau equation in plasma physics\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. In this paper we present a spectral collocation method for the fast evaluation of the Landau collision operator for plasma physics, which allows us to obtain spectrally accurate numerical solutions. The method is inspired by the seminal work [36], but it is specifically designed for Coulombian interactions, taking into account the particular structure of the operator. It allows us to reduce the number of discrete convolutions to provide an approximation of the Landau operator. Then, we show that the method preserves the total mass whereas momentum and energy are approximated with spectral accuracy. Numerical results for the Landau equation in three dimensions in velocity space are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the present approach.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
