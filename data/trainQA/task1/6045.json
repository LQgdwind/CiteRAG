      "content": "You are a professional academic reference prediction expert. Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Deletion and Insertion Tests in Regression Models\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A basic task in explainable AI (XAI) is to identify the most important features behind a prediction made by a black box function fùëìf. The insertion and deletion tests of Petsiuk et al., (2018) can be used to judge the quality of algorithms that rank pixels from most to least important for a classification. Motivated by regression problems we establish a formula for their area under the curve (AUC) criteria in terms of certain main effects and interactions in an anchored decomposition of fùëìf. We find an expression for the expected value of the AUC under a random ordering of inputs to fùëìf and propose an alternative area above a straight line for the regression setting. We use this criterion to compare feature importances computed by integrated gradients (IG) to those computed by Kernel SHAP (KS) as well as LIME, DeepLIFT, vanilla gradient and input√ó\\timesgradient methods. KS has the best overall performance in two datasets we consider but it is very expensive to compute. We find that IG is nearly as good as KS while being much faster. Our comparison problems include some binary inputs that pose a challenge to IG because it must use values between the possible variable levels and so we consider ways to handle binary variables in IG. We show that sorting variables by their Shapley value does not necessarily give the optimal ordering for an insertion-deletion test. It will however do that for monotone functions of additive models, such as logistic regression.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
