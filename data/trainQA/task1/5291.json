Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Reduced polynomial invariant integrity basis for in-plane magneto-mechanical loading\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. The description of the behavior of a material subjected to multi-physics loadings requires the formulation of constitutive laws that usually derive from Gibbs free energies, using invariant quantities depending on the considered physics and material symmetries. On the other hand, most of crystalline materials can be described by their crystalline texture and the associated preferred directions of strong crystalline symmetry (the so-called fibers). Moreover, among the materials produced industrially, many are manufactured in the form of sheets or of thin layers. This article has for object the study of the magneto-mechanical coupling which is a function of the stress ùùàùùà\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} and the magnetization ùë¥ùë¥\\boldsymbol{M}. We consider a material with cubic symmetry whose texture can be described by one of three fibers denoted as Œ∏ùúÉ\\theta, Œ≥ùõæ\\gamma or Œ±‚Ä≤superscriptùõº‚Ä≤\\alpha^{\\prime}, and which is thin enough so that both the stress and the magnetization can be considered as in-plane quantities. We propose an algorithm able to derive linear relations between the 30 cubic invariants IksubscriptùêºùëòI_{k} of a minimal integrity basis describing a magneto-elastic problem, when they are restricted to in-plane loading conditions and for different fiber orientations. The algorithm/program output is a reduced list of invariants of cardinal 7 for the {100}-oriented Œ∏ùúÉ\\theta fiber, of cardinal 15 for the {110}-oriented Œ±‚Ä≤superscriptùõº‚Ä≤\\alpha^{\\prime} fiber and of cardinal 8 for the {111}-oriented Œ≥ùõæ\\gamma fiber. This reduction (compared to initial cardinal 30) can be of great help for the formulation of low-parameter macroscopic magneto-mechanical models.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
