Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 58 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Distributed Algorithms for Covering, Packing and Maximum Weighted Matching\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper gives poly-logarithmic-round, distributed Œ¥ùõø\\delta-approximation algorithms for covering problems with submodular cost and monotone covering constraints (Submodular-cost Covering). The approximation ratio Œ¥ùõø\\delta is the maximum number of variables in any constraint. Special cases include Covering Mixed Integer Linear Programs (CMIP), and Weighted Vertex Cover (with Œ¥=2ùõø2\\delta=2). Via duality, the paper also gives poly-logarithmic-round, distributed Œ¥ùõø\\delta-approximation algorithms for Fractional Packing linear programs (where Œ¥ùõø\\delta is the maximum number of constraints in which any variable occurs), and for Max Weighted c-Matching in hypergraphs (where Œ¥ùõø\\delta is the maximum size of any of the hyperedges; for graphs Œ¥=2ùõø2\\delta=2). The paper also gives parallel (RNC) 2-approxi-mation algorithms for CMIP with two variables per constraint and Weighted Vertex Cover. The algorithms are randomized. All of the approximation ratios exactly match those of comparable centralized algorithms.111Preliminary versions appeared in Koufogiannakis09DistributedCovering ; Koufogiannakis09DistributedPacking .
