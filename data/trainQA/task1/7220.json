Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: FerroX : A GPU-accelerated, 3D Phase-Field Simulation Framework for Modeling Ferroelectric Devices ∗ E-mail: prabhatkumar@lbl.gov, jackie_zhiyao@lbl.gov\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present a massively parallel, 3D phase-field simulation framework for modeling ferroelectric materials based scalable logic devices. This code package, FerroX, self-consistently solves the time-dependent Ginzburg Landau (TDGL) equation for ferroelectric polarization, Poisson’s equation for electric potential, and charge equation for carrier densities in semiconductor regions. The algorithm is implemented using the AMReX software framework [1], which provides effective scalability on manycore and GPU-based supercomputing architectures. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm with excellent scaling results on NERSC multicore and GPU systems, with a significant (15x) speedup on the GPU using a node-by-node comparison. We further demonstrate the applicability of the code in simulations of ferroelectric domain-wall induced negative capacitance (NC) effect in Metal-Ferroelectric-Insulator-Metal (MFIM) and Metal-Ferroelectric-Insulator-Semiconductor-Metal (MFISM) devices. The charge (Q) v.s. voltage (V) responses for these 3D structures clearly indicates stabilized negative capacitance with multidomain formation, which is corroborated by amplification of the voltage at the interface between the ferroelectric and dielectric layers.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
