      "content": "Paper Title: Testing and learning structured quantum Hamiltonians\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We consider the problems of testing and learning an n𝑛n-qubit Hamiltonian H=∑xλx​σx𝐻subscript𝑥subscript𝜆𝑥subscript𝜎𝑥H=\\sum_{x}\\lambda_{x}\\sigma_{x} expressed in its Pauli basis, from queries to its evolution operator U=e−i​H​t𝑈superscript𝑒𝑖𝐻𝑡U=e^{-iHt} with respect the normalized Frobenius norm. To this end, we prove the following results (with and without quantum memory) for Hamiltonians whose Pauli spectrum involves only k𝑘k-local terms or has sparsity at most s𝑠s: 1. Local Hamiltonians: We give a tolerant testing protocol to decide if a Hamiltonian is ε1subscript𝜀1\\varepsilon_{1}-close to k𝑘k-local or ε2subscript𝜀2\\varepsilon_{2}-far from k𝑘k-local, with O​(1/(ε2−ε1)4)𝑂1superscriptsubscript𝜀2subscript𝜀14O(1/(\\varepsilon_{2}-\\varepsilon_{1})^{4}) queries, thereby solving two open questions posed in a recent work by Bluhm, Caro and Oufkir [5]. For learning a k𝑘k-local Hamiltonian up to error ε𝜀\\varepsilon, we give a protocol with query complexity and total time evolution exp⁡(O​(k2+k​log⁡(1/ε)))𝑂superscript𝑘2𝑘1𝜀\\exp(O(k^{2}+k\\log(1/\\varepsilon))). Our algorithm leverages the non-commutative Bohnenblust-Hille inequality in order to get a complexity independent of n𝑛n. 2. Sparse Hamiltonians: We give a protocol for testing whether a Hamiltonian is ε1subscript𝜀1\\varepsilon_{1}-close to being s𝑠s-sparse or ε2subscript𝜀2\\varepsilon_{2}-far from being s𝑠s-sparse, with O​(s6/(ε22−ε12)6)𝑂superscript𝑠6superscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝜀22superscriptsubscript𝜀126O(s^{6}/(\\varepsilon_{2}^{2}-\\varepsilon_{1}^{2})^{6}) queries. For learning up to error ε𝜀\\varepsilon, we show that O​(s4/ε8)𝑂superscript𝑠4superscript𝜀8O(s^{4}/\\varepsilon^{8}) queries suffices. 3. Learning without quantum memory: The learning results stated above have no dependence on the system size n𝑛n, but require n𝑛n-qubit quantum memory. We give subroutines that allow us to reproduce all the above learning results without quantum memory; increasing the query complexity by a (log⁡n)𝑛(\\log n)-factor in the local case and an n𝑛n-factor in the sparse case. 4. Testing without quantum memory: We give a new subroutine called Pauli hashing, which allows one to tolerantly test s𝑠s-sparse Hamiltonians using O~​(s14/(ε22−ε12)18)~𝑂superscript𝑠14superscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝜀22superscriptsubscript𝜀1218\\tilde{O}(s^{14}/(\\varepsilon_{2}^{2}-\\varepsilon_{1}^{2})^{18}) query complexity. A key ingredient is showing that s𝑠s-sparse Pauli channels can be tested in a tolerant fashion as being ε1subscript𝜀1\\varepsilon_{1}-close to being s𝑠s-sparse or ε2subscript𝜀2\\varepsilon_{2}-far under the diamond norm, using O~​(s2/(ε2−ε1)6)~𝑂superscript𝑠2superscriptsubscript𝜀2subscript𝜀16\\tilde{O}(s^{2}/(\\varepsilon_{2}-\\varepsilon_{1})^{6}) queries via Pauli hashing. In order to prove these results, we prove new structural theorems for local Hamiltonians, sparse Pauli channels and sparse Hamiltonians. We complement our learning algorithms with lower bounds that are polynomially weaker. Furthermore, our algorithms use short time evolutions and do not assume prior knowledge of the terms on which the Pauli spectrum is supported on, i.e., we do not require prior knowledge about the support of the Hamiltonian terms.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 62 most likely reference titles for this paper.
