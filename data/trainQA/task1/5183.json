Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: WATCH: Wasserstein Change Point Detection for High-Dimensional Time Series Data\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Detecting relevant changes in dynamic time series data in a timely manner is crucially important for many data analysis tasks in real-world settings. Change point detection methods have the ability to discover changes in an unsupervised fashion, which represents a desirable property in the analysis of unbounded and unlabeled data streams. However, one limitation of most of the existing approaches is represented by their limited ability to handle multivariate and high-dimensional data, which is frequently observed in modern applications such as traffic flow prediction, human activity recognition, and smart grids monitoring. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap by proposing WATCH, a novel Wasserstein distance-based change point detection approach that models an initial distribution and monitors its behavior while processing new data points, providing accurate and robust detection of change points in dynamic high-dimensional data. An extensive experimental evaluation involving a large number of benchmark datasets shows that WATCH is capable of accurately identifying change points and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 53\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
