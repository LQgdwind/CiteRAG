      "content": "Paper Title: Asymptotic Causal Inference\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We investigate causal inference in the asymptotic regime as the number of variables n→∞→𝑛n\\rightarrow\\infty using an information-theoretic framework. We define structural entropy of a causal model in terms of its description complexity measured by the logarithmic growth rate, measured in bits, of all directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) on n𝑛n variables, parameterized by the edge density d𝑑d. Structural entropy yields non-intuitive predictions. If we randomly sample a DAG from the space of all models over n𝑛n variables, as n→∞→𝑛n\\rightarrow\\infty, in the range d∈(0,18)𝑑018d\\in(0,\\frac{1}{8}), almost surely 𝒟𝒟{\\cal D} is a two-layer DAG! Semantic entropy quantifies the reduction in entropy where edges are removed by causal intervention. Semantic causal entropy is defined as the ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi-divergence Dϕ​(P∥PS)subscript𝐷italic-ϕconditional𝑃subscript𝑃𝑆D_{\\phi}(P\\parallel P_{S}) between the observational distribution P𝑃P and the interventional distribution PSsubscript𝑃𝑆P_{S}, where a subset S𝑆S of edges are intervened on to determine their causal influence. We compare the decomposability properties of semantic entropy for different choices of ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi, including ϕ​(t)=t​log⁡titalic-ϕ𝑡𝑡𝑡\\phi(t)=t\\log t (KL-divergence), ϕ=12​(t−1)2italic-ϕ12superscript𝑡12\\phi=\\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{t}-1)^{2} (squared Hellinger distance), and ϕ=12​|t−1|italic-ϕ12𝑡1\\phi=\\frac{1}{2}|t-1| (total variation distance). We apply our framework to generalize a recently popular bipartite experimental design for studying causal inference on large datasets, where interventions are carried out on one set of variables (e.g., power plants, items in an online store), but outcomes are measured on a disjoint set of variables (residents near power plants, or shoppers). We generalize bipartite designs to k𝑘k-partite designs, and describe an optimization framework for finding the optimal k𝑘k-level DAG architecture for any value of d∈(0,12)𝑑012d\\in(0,\\frac{1}{2}). As d𝑑d increases, a sequence of phase transitions occur over disjoint intervals of d𝑑d, with deeper DAG architectures emerging as d→12→𝑑12d\\rightarrow\\frac{1}{2}. We also give a quantitative bound on the number of samples needed to reliably test for average causal influence for a k𝑘k-partite design.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
