Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Meta-learning for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation with closed-form solvers\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This article proposes a meta-learning method for estimating the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) from a few observational data. The proposed method learns how to estimate CATEs from multiple tasks and uses the knowledge for unseen tasks. In the proposed method, based on the meta-learner framework, we decompose the CATE estimation problem into sub-problems. For each sub-problem, we formulate our estimation models using neural networks with task-shared and task-specific parameters. With our formulation, we can obtain optimal task-specific parameters in a closed form that are differentiable with respect to task-shared parameters, making it possible to perform effective meta-learning. The task-shared parameters are trained such that the expected CATE estimation performance in few-shot settings is improved by minimizing the difference between a CATE estimated with a large amount of data and one estimated with just a few data. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing meta-learning approaches and CATE estimation methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
