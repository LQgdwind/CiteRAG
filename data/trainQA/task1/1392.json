Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Towards a Decomposable Metric for Explainable Evaluation of Text Generation from AMR\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Systems that generate natural language text from abstract meaning representations such as AMR are typically evaluated using automatic surface matching metrics that compare the generated texts to reference texts from which the input meaning representations were constructed. We show that besides well-known issues from which such metrics suffer, an additional problem arises when applying these metrics for AMR-to-text evaluation, since an abstract meaning representation allows for numerous surface realizations. In this work we aim to alleviate these issues by proposing ‚Ñ≥‚Äã‚Ñ±Œ≤‚Ñ≥subscript‚Ñ±ùõΩ\\mathcal{M}\\mathcal{F}_{\\beta}, a decomposable metric that builds on two pillars. The first is the principle of meaning preservation ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M}: it measures to what extent a given AMR can be reconstructed from the generated sentence using SOTA AMR parsers and applying (fine-grained) AMR evaluation metrics to measure the distance between the original and the reconstructed AMR. The second pillar builds on a principle of (grammatical) form ‚Ñ±‚Ñ±\\mathcal{F} that measures the linguistic quality of the generated text, which we implement using SOTA language models. In two extensive pilot studies we show that fulfillment of both principles offers benefits for AMR-to-text evaluation, including explainability of scores. Since ‚Ñ≥‚Äã‚Ñ±Œ≤‚Ñ≥subscript‚Ñ±ùõΩ\\mathcal{M}\\mathcal{F}_{\\beta} does not necessarily rely on gold AMRs, it may extend to other text generation tasks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
