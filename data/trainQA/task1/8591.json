Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Deep state-space modeling for explainable representation, analysis, and generation of professional human poses\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The analysis of human movements has been extensively studied due to its wide variety of practical applications, such as human-robot interaction, human learning applications, or clinical diagnosis. Nevertheless, the state-of-the-art still faces scientific challenges when modeling human movements. To begin, new models must account for the stochasticity of human movement and the physical structure of the human body in order to accurately predict the evolution of full-body motion descriptors over time. Second, while utilizing deep learning algorithms, their explainability in terms of body posture predictions needs to be improved as they lack comprehensible representations of human movement. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing three novel methods for creating explainable representations of human movement. In this study, human body movement is formulated as a state-space model adhering to the structure of the Gesture Operational Model (GOM), whose parameters are estimated through the application of deep learning and statistical algorithms. The trained models are used for the full-body dexterity analysis of expert professionals, in which dynamic associations between body joints are identified, and for generating artificially professional movements.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 47\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
