Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: An efficient monolithic solution scheme for FE2 problems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The FE2 method is a very flexible but computationally expensive tool for multiscale simulations. In conventional implementations, the microscopic displacements are iteratively solved for within each macroscopic iteration loop, although the macroscopic strains imposed as boundary conditions at the micro-scale only represent estimates. In order to reduce the number of expensive micro-scale iterations, the present contribution presents a monolithic FE2 scheme, for which the displacements at the micro-scale and at the macro-scale are solved for in a common Newton-Raphson loop. In this case, the linear system of equations within each iteration is solved by static condensation, so that only very limited modifications to the conventional, staggered scheme are necessary. The proposed monolithic FE2 algorithm is implemented into the commercial FE code Abaqus. Benchmark examples demonstrate that the monolithic scheme saves up to ≈\\approx 60% of computational costs. Keywords: computational homogenization; multiscale methods; FE2; HPC; monolithic scheme\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
