      "content": "Paper Title: SparrowSNN: A Hardware/software Co-design for Energy Efficient ECG Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Given its high risk and often asymptomatic nature, real-time continuous monitoring is essential. Unlike traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), spiking neural networks (SNNs) are well-known for their energy efficiency, making them ideal for wearable devices and energy-constrained edge computing platforms. However, current energy measurement of SNN implementations for detecting heart diseases typically rely on empirical values, often overlooking hardware overhead. Additionally, the integer and fire activations in SNNs require multiple memory accesses and repeated computations, which can further compromise energy efficiency. In this paper, we propose sparrowSNN, a redesign of the standard SNN workflow from a hardware perspective, and present a dedicated ASIC design for SNNs, optimized for ultra-low power wearable devices used in heartbeat classification. Using the MIT-BIH dataset, our SNN achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 98.29% for SNNs, with energy consumption of 31.39 nJ per inference and power usage of 6.1Œºùúá\\muW, making sparrowSNN the highest accuracy with the lowest energy use among comparable systems. We also compare the energy-to-accuracy trade-offs between SNNs and quantized ANNs, offering recommendations on insights on how best to use SNNs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
