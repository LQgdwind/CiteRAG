Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Complexity of fixed point counting problems in Boolean NetworksThis work extends some early results announced in [11].\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A Boolean network (BN) with n𝑛n components is a discrete dynamical system described by the successive iterations of a function f:{0,1}n→{0,1}n:𝑓→superscript01𝑛superscript01𝑛f:\\{0,1\\}^{n}\\to\\{0,1\\}^{n}. This model finds applications in biology, where fixed points play a central role. For example, in genetic regulations, they correspond to cell phenotypes. In this context, experiments reveal the existence of positive or negative influences among components. The digraph of influences is called signed interaction digraph (SID), and one SID may correspond to a large number of BNs. The present work opens a new perspective on the well-established study of fixed points in BNs. When biologists discover the SID of a BN they do not know, they may ask: given that SID, can it correspond to a BN having at least/at most k𝑘k fixed points? Depending on the input, we prove that these problems are in 𝖯𝖯\\mathrm{\\sf P} or complete for 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathrm{\\sf NP}, 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯superscript𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathrm{\\sf NP}^{\\mathrm{\\sf NP}}, 𝖭𝖯#​𝖯superscript𝖭𝖯#𝖯\\mathrm{\\sf NP}^{\\mathrm{\\sf\\#P}} or 𝖭𝖤𝖷𝖯𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤𝖭𝖤𝖷𝖯𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤\\mathrm{\\sf NEXPTIME}.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
