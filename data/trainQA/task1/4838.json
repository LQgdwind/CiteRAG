Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Novel Machine Learning Approach to Data Inconsistency with respect to a Fuzzy Relation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Inconsistency in prediction problems occurs when instances that relate in a certain way on condition attributes, do not follow the same relation on the decision attribute. For example, in ordinal classification with monotonicity constraints, it occurs when an instance dominating another instance on condition attributes has been assigned to a worse decision class. It typically appears as a result of perturbation in data caused by incomplete knowledge (missing attributes) or by random effects that occur during data generation (instability in the assessment of decision attribute values). Inconsistencies with respect to a crisp preorder relation (expressing either dominance or indiscernibility between instances) can be handled using symbolic approaches like rough set theory and by using statistical/machine learning approaches that involve optimization methods. Fuzzy rough sets can also be seen as a symbolic approach to inconsistency handling with respect to a fuzzy relation. In this article, we introduce a new machine learning method for inconsistency handling with respect to a fuzzy preorder relation. The novel approach is motivated by the existing machine learning approach used for crisp relations. We provide statistical foundations for it and develop optimization procedures that can be used to eliminate inconsistencies. The article also proves important properties and contains didactic examples of those procedures.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
