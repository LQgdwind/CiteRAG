Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Bayesian Assessments of Aeroengine Performance with Transfer Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Aeroengine performance is determined by temperature and pressure profiles along various axial stations within an engine. Given limited sensor measurements both along and between axial stations, we require a statistically principled approach to inferring these profiles. In this paper we detail a Bayesian methodology for interpolating the spatial temperature or pressure profile at axial stations within an aeroengine. The profile at any given axial station is represented as a spatial Gaussian random field on an annulus, with circumferential variations modelled using a Fourier basis and radial variations modelled with a squared exponential kernel. This Gaussian random field is extended to ingest data from multiple axial measurement planes, with the aim of transferring information across the planes. To facilitate this type of transfer learning, a novel planar covariance kernel is proposed, with hyperparameters that characterise the correlation between any two measurement planes. In the scenario where precise frequencies comprising the temperature field are unknown, we utilise a sparsity-promoting prior on the frequencies to encourage sparse representations. This easily extends to cases with multiple engine planes whilst accommodating frequency variations between the planes. The main quantity of interest, the spatial area average is readily obtained in closed form. We term this the Bayesian area average and demonstrate how this metric offers far more precise averages than a sector area average—a widely used area averaging approach. Furthermore, the Bayesian area average naturally decomposes the posterior uncertainty into terms characterising insufficient sampling and sensor measurement error respectively. This too provides a significant improvement over prior standard deviation based uncertainty breakdowns.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
