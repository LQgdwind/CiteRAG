Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Reusable Surrogate Models: Graph-Based Transfer Learning on Trusses\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Surrogate models have several uses in engineering design, including speeding up design optimization, noise reduction, test measurement interpolation, gradient estimation, portability, and protection of intellectual property. Traditionally, surrogate models require that all training data conform to the same parametrization (e.g. design variables), limiting design freedom and prohibiting the reuse of historical data. In response, this paper proposes Graph-based Surrogate Models (GSMs) for trusses. The GSM can accurately predict displacement fields from static loads given the structureâ€™s geometry as input, enabling training across multiple parametrizations. GSMs build upon recent advancements in geometric deep learning which have led to the ability to learn on undirected graphs: a natural representation for trusses. To further promote flexible surrogate models, the paper explores transfer learning within the context of engineering design, and demonstrates positive knowledge transfer across data sets of different topologies, complexities, loads and applications, resulting in more flexible and data-efficient surrogate models for trusses.
