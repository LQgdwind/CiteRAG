We show that the minimum weight of a Euclidean (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-spanner for n𝑛n points in the unit square [0,1]2superscript012[0,1]^{2} is O​(ε−3/2​n)𝑂superscript𝜀32𝑛O(\\varepsilon^{-3/2}\\,\\sqrt{n}), and this bound is the best possible. The upper bound is based on a new spanner algorithm in the plane. It improves upon the baseline O​(ε−2​n)𝑂superscript𝜀2𝑛O(\\varepsilon^{-2}\\sqrt{n}), obtained by combining a tight bound for the weight of a Euclidean minimum spanning tree (MST) on n𝑛n points in [0,1]2superscript012[0,1]^{2}, and a tight bound for the lightness of Euclidean (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-spanners, which is the ratio of the spanner weight to the weight of the MST. Our result generalizes to Euclidean d𝑑d-space for every constant dimension d∈ℕ𝑑ℕd\\in\\mathbb{N}: The minimum weight of a Euclidean (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-spanner for n𝑛n points in the unit cube [0,1]dsuperscript01𝑑[0,1]^{d} is Od​(ε(1−d2)/d​n(d−1)/d)subscript𝑂𝑑superscript𝜀1superscript𝑑2𝑑superscript𝑛𝑑1𝑑O_{d}(\\varepsilon^{(1-d^{2})/d}n^{(d-1)/d}), and this bound is the best possible. For the n×n𝑛𝑛n\\times n section of the integer lattice in the plane, we show that the minimum weight of a Euclidean (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-spanner is between Ω​(ε−3/4⋅n2)Ω⋅superscript𝜀34superscript𝑛2\\Omega(\\varepsilon^{-3/4}\\cdot n^{2}) and O​(ε−1​log⁡(ε−1)⋅n2)𝑂⋅superscript𝜀1superscript𝜀1superscript𝑛2O(\\varepsilon^{-1}\\log(\\varepsilon^{-1})\\cdot n^{2}). These bounds become Ω​(ε−3/4⋅n)Ω⋅superscript𝜀34𝑛\\Omega(\\varepsilon^{-3/4}\\cdot\\sqrt{n}) and O​(ε−1​log⁡(ε−1)⋅n)𝑂⋅superscript𝜀1superscript𝜀1𝑛O(\\varepsilon^{-1}\\log(\\varepsilon^{-1})\\cdot\\sqrt{n}) when scaled to a grid of n𝑛n points in the unit square. In particular, this shows that the integer grid is not an extremal configuration for minimum weight Euclidean (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-spanners.
