Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer.

      "content": "Paper Title: Size Should not Matter: Scale-invariant Stress Metrics\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The normalized stress metric measures how closely distances between vertices in a graph drawing match the graph-theoretic distances between those vertices. It is one of the most widely employed quality metrics for graph drawing, and is even the optimization goal of several popular graph layout algorithms. However, normalized stress can be misleading when used to compare the outputs of two or more algorithms, as it is sensitive to the size of the drawing compared to the graph-theoretic distances used. Uniformly scaling a layout will change the value of stress despite not meaningfully changing the drawing. In fact, the change in stress values can be so significant that a clearly better layout can appear to have a worse stress score than a random layout. In this paper, we study different variants for calculating stress used in the literature (raw stress, normalized stress, etc.) and show that many of them are affected by this problem, which threatens the validity of experiments that compare the quality of one algorithm to that of another. We then experimentally justify one of the stress calculation variants, scale-normalized stress, as one that fairly compares drawing outputs regardless of their size. We also describe an efficient computation for scale-normalized stress and provide an open source implementation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
