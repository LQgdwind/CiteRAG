      "content": "Paper Title: SparseP: Towards Efficient Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication on Real Processing-In-Memory Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Several manufacturers have already started to commercialize near-bank Processing-In-Memory (PIM) architectures, after decades of research efforts. Near-bank PIM architectures place simple cores close to DRAM banks. Recent research demonstrates that they can yield significant performance and energy improvements in parallel applications by alleviating data access costs. Real PIM systems can provide high levels of parallelism, large aggregate memory bandwidth and low memory access latency, thereby being a good fit to accelerate the Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication (SpMV) kernel. SpMV has been characterized as one of the most significant and thoroughly studied scientific computation kernels. It is primarily a memory-bound kernel with intensive memory accesses due its algorithmic nature, the compressed matrix format used, and the sparsity patterns of the input matrices given. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of SpMV on a real-world PIM architecture, and presents SparseP, the first SpMV library for real PIM architectures. We make three key contributions. First, we implement a wide variety of software strategies on SpMV for a multithreaded PIM core, including (1) various compressed matrix formats, (2) load balancing schemes across parallel threads and (3) synchronization approaches, and characterize the computational limits of a single multithreaded PIM core. Second, we design various load balancing schemes across multiple PIM cores, and two types of data partitioning techniques to execute SpMV on thousands of PIM cores: (1) 1D-partitioned kernels to perform the complete SpMV computation only using PIM cores, and (2) 2D-partitioned kernels to strive a balance between computation and data transfer costs to PIM-enabled memory. Third, we compare SpMV execution on a real-world PIM system with 2528 PIM cores to an Intel Xeon CPU and an NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU to study the performance and energy efficiency of various devices, i.e., both memory-centric PIM systems and conventional processor-centric CPU/GPU systems, for the SpMV kernel. SparseP software package provides 25 SpMV kernels for real PIM systems supporting the four most widely used compressed matrix formats, i.e., CSR, COO, BCSR and BCOO, and a wide range of data types. SparseP is publicly and freely available at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/SparseP. Our extensive evaluation using 26 matrices with various sparsity patterns provides new insights and recommendations for software designers and hardware architects to efficiently accelerate the SpMV kernel on real PIM systems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 253 most likely reference titles for this paper.
