Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Practical Reasoning in DatalogMTL\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract DatalogMTL is an extension of Datalog with metric temporal operators that has found an increasing number of applications in recent years. Reasoning in DatalogMTL is, however, of high computational complexity, which makes reasoning in modern data-intensive applications challenging. In this paper we present a practical reasoning algorithm for the full DatalogMTL language, which we have implemented in a system called MeTeoR. Our approach effectively combines an optimised (but generally non-terminating) materialisation (a.k.a. forward chaining) procedure, which provides scalable behaviour, with an automata-based component that guarantees termination and completeness. To ensure favourable scalability of the materialisation component, we propose a novel seminaïve materialisation procedure for DatalogMTL enjoying the non-repetition property, which ensures that each specific rule application will be considered at most once throughout the entire execution of the algorithm. Moreover, our materialisation procedure is enhanced with additional optimisations which further reduce the number of redundant computations performed during materialisation by disregarding rules as soon as it is certain that they cannot derive new facts in subsequent materialisation steps. Our extensive evaluation supports the practicality of our approach.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
