Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: On the pathwidth of hyperbolic 3-manifoldsThis paper is based on previously unpublished parts of the author‚Äôs PhD thesis [24].\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract According to Mostow‚Äôs celebrated rigidity theorem, the geometry of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds is already determined by their topology. In particular, the volume of such manifolds is a topological invariant and, as such, has been investigated for half a century. Motivated by the algorithmic study of 3-manifolds, Maria and Purcell have recently shown that every closed hyperbolic 3-manifold ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M} with volume vol‚Å°(‚Ñ≥)vol‚Ñ≥\\operatorname{vol}(\\mathcal{M}) admits a triangulation with dual graph of treewidth at most C‚ãÖvol‚Å°(‚Ñ≥)‚ãÖùê∂vol‚Ñ≥C\\cdot\\operatorname{vol}(\\mathcal{M}), for some universal constant Cùê∂C. Here we improve on this result by showing that the volume provides a linear upper bound even on the pathwidth of the dual graph of some triangulation, which can potentially be much larger than the treewidth. Our proof relies on a synthesis of tools from 3-manifold theory: generalized Heegaard splittings, amalgamations, and the thick-thin decomposition of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. We provide an illustrated exposition of this toolbox and also discuss the algorithmic consequences of the result.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper.
