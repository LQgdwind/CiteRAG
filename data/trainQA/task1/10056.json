      "content": "Paper Title: Transformer-QEC: Quantum Error Correction Code Decoding with Transferable Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Quantum computing has the potential to solve problems that are intractable for classical systems, yet the high error rates in contemporary quantum devices often exceed tolerable limits for useful algorithm execution. Quantum Error Correction (QEC) mitigates this by employing redundancy, distributing quantum information across multiple data qubits and utilizing syndrome qubits to monitor their states for errors. The syndromes are subsequently interpreted by a decoding algorithm to identify and correct errors in the data qubits. This task is complex due to the multiplicity of error sources affecting both data and syndrome qubits as well as syndrome extraction operations. Additionally, identical syndromes can emanate from different error sources, necessitating a decoding algorithm that evaluates syndromes collectively. Although machine learning (ML) decoders such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been proposed, they often focus on local syndrome regions and require retraining when adjusting for different code distances. To address these issues, we introduce a transformer-based QEC decoder, termed Transformer-QEC, which employs self-attention to achieve a global receptive field across all input syndromes. It incorporates a mixed loss training approach, combining both local physical error and global parity label losses. Moreover, the transformer architecture’s inherent adaptability to variable-length inputs allows for efficient transfer learning, enabling the decoder to adapt to varying code distances without retraining. Evaluation on six code distances and ten different error configurations demonstrates that our model consistently outperforms non-ML decoders, such as Union Find (UF) and Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM), and other ML decoders, thereby achieving best logical error rates. Moreover, the transfer learning can save over 10×\\times of training cost.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
