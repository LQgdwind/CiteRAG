Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Networks Enhancement with Logical Knowledge\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In the recent past, there has been a growing interest in Neural-Symbolic Integration frameworks, i.e., hybrid systems that integrate connectionist and symbolic approaches to obtain the best of both worlds. In a previous work, we proposed KENN (Knowledge Enhanced Neural Networks), a Neural-Symbolic architecture that injects prior logical knowledge into a neural network by adding a new final layer which modifies the initial predictions accordingly to the knowledge. Among the advantages of this strategy, there is the inclusion of clause weights, learnable parameters that represent the strength of the clauses, meaning that the model can learn the impact of each clause on the final predictions. As a special case, if the training data contradicts a constraint, KENN learns to ignore it, making the system robust to the presence of wrong knowledge. In this paper, we propose an extension of KENN for relational data. To evaluate this new extension, we tested it with different learning configurations on Citeseer, a standard dataset for Collective Classification. The results show that KENN is capable of increasing the performances of the underlying neural network even in the presence relational data, outperforming other two notable methods that combine learning with logic.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
