Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: A splitting random-choice dynamic relaxation method for smoothed particle hydrodynamics\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract For conventional smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), obtaining the static solution of a problem is time-consuming. To address this drawback, we propose an efficient dynamic relaxation method by adding large artificial-viscosity-based damping into the momentum conservation equation. Then, operator splitting methods are introduced to discretize the added viscous term for relaxing the time-step limit. To further improve the convergence rate, a random-choice strategy is adopted, in which the viscous term is imposed randomly rather than at every time step. In addition, to avoid the thread-conflict induced by applying shared-memory parallelization to accelerate implicit method, a splitting cell-linked list scheme is devised. A number of benchmark tests suggest that the present method helps systems achieve equilibrium state efficiently.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
