      "content": "Paper Title: Cyclotomic Identity Testing and Applications\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We consider the cyclotomic identity testing (CIT) problem: given a polynomial f​(x1,…,xk)𝑓subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑘f(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{k}), decide whether f​(ζne1,…,ζnek)𝑓superscriptsubscript𝜁𝑛subscript𝑒1…superscriptsubscript𝜁𝑛subscript𝑒𝑘f(\\zeta_{n}^{e_{1}},\\ldots,\\zeta_{n}^{e_{k}}) is zero, where ζn=e2​π​i/nsubscript𝜁𝑛superscript𝑒2𝜋𝑖𝑛\\zeta_{n}=e^{2\\pi i/n} is a primitive complex n𝑛n-th root of unity and e1,…,eksubscript𝑒1…subscript𝑒𝑘e_{1},\\ldots,e_{k} are integers, represented in binary. When f𝑓f is given by an algebraic circuit, we give a randomized polynomial-time algorithm for CIT assuming the generalised Riemann hypothesis (GRH), and show that the problem is in coNP unconditionally. When f𝑓f is given by a circuit of polynomially bounded degree, we give a randomized NC algorithm. In case f𝑓f is a linear form we show that the problem lies in NC. Towards understanding when CIT can be solved in deterministic polynomial-time, we consider so-called diagonal depth-3 circuits, i.e., polynomials f=∑i=1mgidi𝑓superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑚superscriptsubscript𝑔𝑖subscript𝑑𝑖f=\\sum_{i=1}^{m}g_{i}^{d_{i}}, where gisubscript𝑔𝑖g_{i} is a linear form and disubscript𝑑𝑖d_{i} a positive integer given in unary. We observe that a polynomial-time algorithm for CIT on this class would yield a sub-exponential-time algorithm for polynomial identity testing. However, assuming GRH, we show that if the linear forms gisubscript𝑔𝑖g_{i} are all identical then CIT can be solved in polynomial time. Finally, we use our results to give a new proof that equality of compressed strings, i.e., strings presented using context-free grammars, can be decided in randomized NC.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
