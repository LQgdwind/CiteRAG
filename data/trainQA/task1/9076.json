Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Gotta: Generative Few-shot Question Answering by Prompt-based Cloze Data Augmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Few-shot question answering (QA) aims at precisely discovering answers to a set of questions from context passages while only a few training samples are available. Although existing studies have made some progress and can usually achieve proper results, they suffer from understanding deep semantics for reasoning out the questions. In this paper, we develop Gotta, a Generative prOmpT-based daTa Augmentation framework to mitigate the challenge above. Inspired by the human reasoning process, we propose to integrate the cloze task to enhance few-shot QA learning. Following the recent success of prompt-tuning, we present the cloze task in the same format as the main QA task, allowing the model to learn both tasks seamlessly together to fully take advantage of the power of prompt-tuning. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that Gotta consistently outperforms competitive baselines, validating the effectiveness of our proposed prompt-tuning-based cloze task, which not only fine-tunes language models but also learns to guide reasoning in QA tasks. Further analysis shows that the prompt-based loss incorporates the auxiliary task better than the multi-task loss, highlighting the strength of prompt-tuning on the few-shot QA task.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
