Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: End-To-End Bias Mitigation: Removing Gender Bias in Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Machine Learning models have been deployed across many different aspects of society, often in situations that affect social welfare. Although these models offer streamlined solutions to large problems, they may contain biases and treat groups or individuals unfairly based on protected attributes such as gender. In this paper, we introduce several examples of machine learning gender bias in practice followed by formalizations of fairness. We provide a survey of fairness research by detailing influential pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing bias mitigation algorithms. We then propose an end-to-end bias mitigation framework, which employs a fusion of pre-, in-, and post-processing methods to leverage the strengths of each individual technique. We test this method, along with the standard techniques we review, on a deep neural network to analyze bias mitigation in a deep learning setting. We find that our end-to-end bias mitigation framework outperforms the baselines with respect to several fairness metrics, suggesting its promise as a method for improving fairness. As society increasingly relies on artificial intelligence to help in decision-making, addressing gender biases present in deep learning models is imperative. To provide readers with the tools to assess the fairness of machine learning models and mitigate the biases present in them, we discuss multiple open source packages for fairness in AI.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
