Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Probabilistic Deep Learning for Real-Time Large Deformation Simulations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract For many novel applications, such as patient-specific computer-aided surgery, conventional solution techniques of the underlying nonlinear problems are usually computationally too expensive and are lacking information about how certain can we be about their predictions. In the present work, we propose a highly efficient deep-learning surrogate framework that is able to accurately predict the response of bodies undergoing large deformations in real-time. The surrogate model has a convolutional neural network architecture, called U-Net, which is trained with force-displacement data obtained with the finite element method. We propose deterministic and probabilistic versions of the framework. The probabilistic framework utilizes the Variational Bayes Inference approach and is able to capture all the uncertainties present in the data as well as in the deep-learning model. Based on several benchmark examples, we show the predictive capabilities of the framework and discuss its possible limitations.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
