Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: CLAN: Continuous Learning using Asynchronous Neuroevolution on Commodity Edge Devices This work was performed while Parth Mannan was a graduate student at Georgia Institute of Technology.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recent advancements in machine learning algorithms, especially the development of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have transformed the landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI). With every passing day, deep learning based methods are applied to solve new problems with exceptional results. The portal to the real world is the edge. The true impact of AI can only be fully realized if we can have AI agents continuously interacting with the real world and solving everyday problems. Unfortunately, high compute and memory requirements of DNNs acts a huge barrier towards this vision. Today we circumvent this problem by deploying special purpose inference hardware on the edge while procuring trained models from the cloud. This approach, however, relies on constant interaction with the cloud for transmitting all the data, training on massive GPU clusters, and downloading updated models. This is challenging for bandwidth, privacy, and constant connectivity concerns that autonomous agents may exhibit. In this paper we evaluate techniques for enabling adaptive intelligence on edge devices with zero interaction with any high-end cloud/server. We build a prototype distributed system of Raspberry Pis communicating via WiFi running NeuroEvolutionary (NE) learning and inference. We evaluate the performance of such a collaborative system and detail the compute/communication characteristics of different arrangements of the system that trade-off parallelism versus communication. Using insights from our analysis, we also propose algorithmic modifications to reduce communication by up to 3.6x during the learning phase to enhance scalability even further and match performance of higher end computing devices at scale. We believe that these insights will enable algorithm-hardware co-design efforts for enabling continuous learning on the edge.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
