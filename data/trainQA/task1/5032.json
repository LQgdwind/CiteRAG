Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: On the stability of multigraded Betti numbers and Hilbert functions\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Multigraded Betti numbers are one of the simplest invariants of multiparameter persistence modules. This invariant is useful in theory‚Äîit completely determines the Hilbert function of the module and the isomorphism type of the free modules in its minimal free resolution‚Äîas well as in practice‚Äîit is easy to visualize and it is one of the main outputs of current multiparameter persistent homology software, such as RIVET. However, to the best of our knowledge, no stability result with respect to the interleaving distance has been established for this invariant so far, and this potential lack of stability limits its practical applications. We prove a stability result for multigraded Betti numbers, using an efficiently computable bottleneck-type dissimilarity function we introduce. Our notion of matching is inspired by recent work on signed barcodes, and allows matching bars of the same module in homological degrees of different parity, in addition to matchings bars of different modules in homological degrees of the same parity. Our stability result is a combination of Hilbert‚Äôs syzygy theorem, Bjerkevik‚Äôs bottleneck stability for free modules, and a novel stability result for projective resolutions. We also prove, in the two-parameter case, a 111-Wasserstein stability result for Hilbert functions with respect to the 111-presentation distance of Bjerkevik and Lesnick.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
