Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Data-Efficient Protein 3D Geometric Pretraining via Refinement of Diffused Protein Structure Decoy\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Learning meaningful protein representation is important for a variety of biological downstream tasks such as structure-based drug design. Having witnessed the success of protein sequence pretraining, pretraining for structural data which is more informative has become a promising research topic. However, there are three major challenges facing protein structure pretraining: insufficient sample diversity, physically unrealistic modeling, and the lack of protein-specific pretext tasks. To try to address these challenges, we present the 3D Geometric Pretraining. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for protein pretraining and a 3D geometric-based, data-efficient, and protein-specific pretext task: RefineDiff (Refine the Diffused Protein Structure Decoy). After pretraining our geometric-aware model with this task on limited data(less than 1% of SOTA models), we obtained informative protein representations that can achieve comparable performance for various downstream tasks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
