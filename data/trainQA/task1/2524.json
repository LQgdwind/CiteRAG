Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: PConv: Simple yet Effective Convolutional Layer for Generative Adversarial Network\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper presents a novel convolutional layer, called perturbed convolution (PConv), which focuses on achieving two goals simultaneously: improving the generative adversarial network (GAN) performance and alleviating the memorization problem in which the discriminator memorizes all images from a given dataset as training progresses. In PConv, perturbed features are generated by randomly disturbing an input tensor before performing the convolution operation. This approach is simple but surprisingly effective. First, to produce a similar output even with the perturbed tensor, each layer in the discriminator should learn robust features having a small local Lipschitz value. Second, since the input tensor is randomly perturbed during the training procedure like the dropout in neural networks, the memorization problem could be alleviated. To show the generalization ability of the proposed method, we conducted extensive experiments with various loss functions and datasets including CIFAR-10, CelebA, CelebA-HQ, LSUN, and tiny-ImageNet. The quantitative evaluations demonstrate that PConv effectively boosts the performance of GAN and conditional GAN in terms of Frechet inception distance (FID).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
