Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Multilevel Approach to Variance Reduction in the Stochastic Estimation of the Trace of a MatrixSubmitted to the editors DATE. \\fundingThis work was funded by the European Commission within the STIMULATE project.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The trace of a matrix function f‚Äã(A)ùëìùê¥f(A), most notably of the matrix inverse, can be estimated stochastically using samples x‚àó‚Äãf‚Äã(A)‚Äãxsuperscriptùë•ùëìùê¥ùë•x^{*}f(A)x if the components of the random vectors xùë•x obey an appropriate probability distribution. However such a Monte-Carlo sampling suffers from the fact that the accuracy depends quadratically of the samples to use, thus making higher precision estimation very costly. In this paper we suggest and investigate a multilevel Monte-Carlo approach which uses a multigrid hierarchy to stochastically estimate the trace. This results in a substantial reduction of the variance, so that higher precision can be obtained at much less effort. We illustrate this for the trace of the inverse using three different classes of matrices.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
