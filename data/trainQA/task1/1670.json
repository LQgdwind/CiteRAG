Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Disentangling causal effects for hierarchical reinforcement learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Exploration and credit assignment are still challenging problems for RL agents under sparse rewards. We argue that these challenges arise partly due to the intrinsic rigidity of operating at the level of actions. Actions can precisely define how to perform an activity but are ill-suited to describe what activity to perform. Instead, controlled effects describe transformations in the environment caused by the agent. These transformations are inherently composable and temporally abstract, making them ideal for descriptive tasks. This work introduces CEHRL111pronounced ’ciril’., a hierarchical method leveraging the compositional nature of controlled effects to expedite the learning of task-specific behavior and aid exploration. Borrowing counterfactual and normality measures from causal literature, CEHRL learns an implicit hierarchy of transformations an agent can perform on the environment. This hierarchy allows a high-level policy to set temporally abstract goals and, by doing so, long-horizon credit assignment. Experimental results show that using effects instead of actions provides a more efficient exploration mechanism. Moreover, by leveraging prior knowledge in the hierarchy, CEHRL assigns credit to few effects instead of many actions and consequently learns tasks more rapidly.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
