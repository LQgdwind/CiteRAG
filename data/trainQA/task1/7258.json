Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Dual Generator Offline Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In offline RL, constraining the learned policy to remain close to the data is essential to prevent the policy from outputting out-of-distribution (OOD) actions with erroneously overestimated values. In principle, generative adversarial networks (GAN) can provide an elegant solution to do so, with the discriminator directly providing a probability that quantifies distributional shift. However, in practice, GAN-based offline RL methods have not performed as well as alternative approaches, perhaps because the generator is trained to both fool the discriminator and maximize return – two objectives that can be at odds with each other. In this paper, we show that the issue of conflicting objectives can be resolved by training two generators: one that maximizes return, with the other capturing the “remainder” of the data distribution in the offline dataset, such that the mixture of the two is close to the behavior policy. We show that not only does having two generators enable an effective GAN-based offline RL method, but also approximates a support constraint, where the policy does not need to match the entire data distribution, but only the slice of the data that leads to high long term performance. We name our method DASCO, for Dual-Generator Adversarial Support Constrained Offline RL. On benchmark tasks that require learning from sub-optimal data, DASCO significantly outperforms prior methods that enforce distribution constraint.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
