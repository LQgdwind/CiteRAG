      "content": "Paper Title: EI-MTD: Moving Target Defense for Edge Intelligence against Adversarial Attacks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Edge intelligence has played an important role in constructing smart cities, but the vulnerability of edge nodes to adversarial attacks becomes an urgent problem. The so-called adversarial example can fool a deep learning model on the edge node for misclassification. Due to the transferability property of adversarial examples, the adversary can easily fool a black-box model by a local substitute model. The edge nodes have limited resources, which cannot afford a complicated defense mechanism as that on the cloud data center. To address the challenge, we propose a dynamic defense mechanism, namely EI-MTD. The mechanism first obtains robust member models of small size through differential knowledge distillation from a complicated teacher mode on the cloud data center. Then, a dynamic scheduling policy, which builds on a Bayesian Stackelberg game, is applied to the choice of a target model for service. This dynamic defense mechanism can prohibit the adversary from selecting an optimal substitute model for black-box attacks. We also conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed mechanism, and the results show that EI-MTD could protect edge intelligence effectively against adversarial attacks in black-box settings.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
