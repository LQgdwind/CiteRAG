      "content": "Paper Title: CPL-SLAM: Efficient and Certifiably Correct Planar Graph-Based SLAM Using the Complex Number Representation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we consider the problem of planar graph-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) that involves both poses of the autonomous agent and positions of observed landmarks. We present CPL-SLAM, an efficient and certifiably correct algorithm to solve planar graph-based SLAM using the complex number representation. We formulate and simplify planar graph-based SLAM as the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) on the product of unit complex numbers, and relax this nonconvex quadratic complex optimization problem to convex complex semidefinite programming (SDP). Furthermore, we simplify the corresponding complex semidefinite programming to Riemannian staircase optimization (RSO) on the complex oblique manifold that can be solved with the Riemannian trust region (RTR) method. In addition, we prove that the SDP relaxation and RSO simplification are tight as long as the noise magnitude is below a certain threshold. The efficacy of this work is validated through applications of CPL-SLAM and comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods on planar graph-based SLAM, which indicates that our proposed algorithm is capable of solving planar graph-based SLAM certifiably, and is more efficient in numerical computation and more robust to measurement noise than existing state-of-the-art methods. The C++ code for CPL-SLAM is available at https://github.com/MurpheyLab/CPL-SLAM.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper.
