      "content": "Paper Title: Channels of Small Log-Ratio Leakage and Characterization of Two-Party Differentially Private Computation An extended abstract of this work appeared in TCC 2019 [24]\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Consider a ppt two-party protocol Π=(𝖠,𝖡)Π𝖠𝖡\\Pi=(\\mathsf{A},\\mathsf{B}) in which the parties get no private inputs and obtain outputs O𝖠,O𝖡∈{0,1}superscript𝑂𝖠superscript𝑂𝖡01O^{\\mathsf{A}},O^{\\mathsf{B}}\\in\\left\\{0,1\\right\\}, and let V𝖠superscript𝑉𝖠V^{\\mathsf{A}} and V𝖡superscript𝑉𝖡V^{\\mathsf{B}} denote the parties’ individual views. Protocol ΠΠ\\Pi has α𝛼\\alpha-agreement if Pr⁡[O𝖠=O𝖡]=12+αPrsuperscript𝑂𝖠superscript𝑂𝖡12𝛼\\Pr[O^{\\mathsf{A}}=O^{\\mathsf{B}}]=\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\alpha. The leakage of ΠΠ\\Pi is the amount of information a party obtains about the event {O𝖠=O𝖡}superscript𝑂𝖠superscript𝑂𝖡\\left\\{O^{\\mathsf{A}}=O^{\\mathsf{B}}\\right\\}; that is, the leakage ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon is the maximum, over 𝖯∈{𝖠,𝖡}𝖯𝖠𝖡\\mathsf{P}\\in\\left\\{\\mathsf{A},\\mathsf{B}\\right\\}, of the distance between V𝖯|O𝖠=O𝖡evaluated-atsuperscript𝑉𝖯superscript𝑂𝖠superscript𝑂𝖡V^{\\mathsf{P}}|_{O^{\\mathsf{A}}=O^{\\mathsf{B}}} and V𝖯|O𝖠≠O𝖡evaluated-atsuperscript𝑉𝖯superscript𝑂𝖠superscript𝑂𝖡V^{\\mathsf{P}}|_{O^{\\mathsf{A}}\\neq O^{\\mathsf{B}}}. Typically, this distance is measured in statistical distance, or, in the computational setting, in computational indistinguishability. For this choice, Wullschleger [TCC ’09] showed that if ϵ≪αmuch-less-thanitalic-ϵ𝛼\\epsilon\\ll\\alpha then the protocol can be transformed into an OT protocol. We consider measuring the protocol leakage by the log-ratio distance (which was popularized by its use in the differential privacy framework). The log-ratio distance between X,Y𝑋𝑌X,Y over domain ΩΩ\\Omega is the minimal ϵ≥0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon\\geq 0 for which, for every v∈Ω𝑣Ωv\\in\\Omega, log⁡Pr⁡[X=v]Pr⁡[Y=v]∈[−ϵ,ϵ]Pr𝑋𝑣Pr𝑌𝑣italic-ϵitalic-ϵ\\log\\frac{\\Pr[X=v]}{\\Pr[Y=v]}\\in[-\\epsilon,\\epsilon]. In the computational setting, we use computational indistinguishability from having log-ratio distance ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon. We show that a protocol with (noticeable) accuracy α∈Ω​(ϵ2)𝛼Ωsuperscriptitalic-ϵ2\\alpha\\in\\Omega(\\epsilon^{2}) can be transformed into an OT protocol (note that this allows ϵ≫αmuch-greater-thanitalic-ϵ𝛼\\epsilon\\gg\\alpha). We complete the picture, in this respect, showing that a protocol with α∈o​(ϵ2)𝛼𝑜superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\alpha\\in o(\\epsilon^{2}) does not necessarily imply OT. Our results hold for both the information theoretic and the computational settings, and can be viewed as a “fine grained” approach to “weak OT amplification”. We then use the above result to fully characterize the complexity of differentially private two-party computation for the XOR function, answering the open question put by Goyal, Khurana, Mironov, Pandey, and Sahai [ICALP ’16] and Haitner, Nissim, Omri, Shaltiel, and Silbak [FOCS ’18]. Specifically, we show that for any (noticeable) α∈Ω​(ϵ2)𝛼Ωsuperscriptitalic-ϵ2\\alpha\\in\\Omega(\\epsilon^{2}), a two-party protocol that computes the XOR function with α𝛼\\alpha-accuracy and ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-differential privacy can be transformed into an OT protocol. This improves upon Goyal et al. that only handle α∈Ω​(ϵ)𝛼Ωitalic-ϵ\\alpha\\in\\Omega(\\epsilon), and upon Haitner et al. who showed that such a protocol implies (infinitely-often) key agreement (and not OT). Our characterization is tight since OT does not follow from protocols in which α∈o​(ϵ2)𝛼𝑜superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\alpha\\in o(\\epsilon^{2}), and extends to functions (over many bits) that “contain” an “embedded copy” of the XOR function.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
