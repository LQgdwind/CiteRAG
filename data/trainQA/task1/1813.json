      "content": "Paper Title: An Algorithm for Learning Smaller Representations of Models With Scarce Data\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract 111This paper has not been fully peer-reviewed. We present a greedy algorithm for solving binary classification problems in situations where the dataset is either too small or not fully representative of the problem being solved, and obtaining more data is not possible. This algorithm is of particular interest when training small models that have trouble generalizing. It relies on a trained model with loose accuracy constraints, an iterative hyperparameter pruning procedure, and a function used to generate new data. Analysis on correctness and runtime complexity under ideal conditions and an extension to deep neural networks is provided. In the former case we obtain an asymptotic bound of O​(|Θ|2​(log⁡|Θ|+|θ|2+Tf​(|D|))+S¯​|Θ|​|E|)𝑂superscriptΘ2Θsuperscript𝜃2subscript𝑇𝑓𝐷¯𝑆Θ𝐸O\\left(\\lvert\\Theta\\rvert^{2}\\left(\\log{\\lvert\\Theta\\rvert}+\\lvert\\theta\\rvert^{2}+T_{f}\\left(\\lvert D\\rvert\\right)\\right)+\\bar{S}\\lvert\\Theta\\rvert\\lvert E\\rvert\\right), where |Θ|Θ\\lvert\\Theta\\rvert is the cardinality of the set of hyperparameters θ𝜃\\theta to be searched; |E|𝐸\\lvert E\\rvert and |D|𝐷\\lvert D\\rvert are the sizes of the evaluation and training datasets, respectively; S¯¯𝑆\\bar{S} and f¯¯𝑓\\bar{f} are the inference times for the trained model and the candidate model; and Tf​(|D|)subscript𝑇𝑓𝐷T_{f}({\\lvert D\\rvert}) is a polynomial on |D|𝐷\\lvert D\\rvert and f¯¯𝑓\\bar{f}. Under these conditions, this algorithm returns a solution that is 1≤r≤2​(1−2−|Θ|)1𝑟21superscript2Θ1\\leq r\\leq 2(1-{2^{-\\lvert\\Theta\\rvert}}) times better than simply enumerating and training with any θ∈Θ𝜃Θ\\theta\\in\\Theta. As part of our analysis of the generating function we also prove that, under certain assumptions, if an open cover of D𝐷D has the same homology as the manifold where the support of the underlying probability distribution lies, then D𝐷D is learnable, and viceversa.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
