      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient and Scalable Architecture for Multiple-chip Implementation of Simulated Bifurcation Machines\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Ising machines are specialized computers for finding the lowest energy states of Ising spin models, onto which many practical combinatorial optimization problems can be mapped. Simulated bifurcation (SB) is a quantum-inspired parallelizable algorithm for Ising problems that enables scalable multi-chip implementations of Ising machines. However, the computational performance of a previously proposed multi-chip architecture tends to saturate as the number of chips increases for a given problem size because both computation and communication are exclusive in the time domain. In this paper, we propose a streaming architecture for multi-chip implementations of SB-based Ising machines with full spin-to-spin connectivity. The data flow in in-chip computation is harmonized with the data flow in inter-chip communication, enabling the computation and communication to overlap and the communication time to be hidden. Systematic experiments demonstrate linear strong scaling of performance up to the vicinity of the ideal communication limit determined only by the latency of chip-to-chip communication. Our eight-FPGA (field-programmable gate array) cluster can compute a 32,768-spin problem with a high pipeline efficiency of 97.9%. The performance of a 79-FPGA cluster for a 100,000-spin problem, projected using a theoretical performance model validated on smaller experimental clusters, is comparable to that of a state-of-the-art 100,000-spin optical Ising machine.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
