Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Graph Neural Networks Intersect Probabilistic Graphical Models: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Graphs are a powerful data structure to represent relational data and are widely used to describe complex real-world data structures. Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) have been well-developed in the past years to mathematically model real-world scenarios in compact graphical representations of distributions of variables. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are new inference methods developed in recent years and are attracting growing attention due to their effectiveness and flexibility in solving inference and learning problems over graph-structured data. These two powerful approaches have different advantages in capturing relations from observations and how they conduct message passing, and they can benefit each other in various tasks. In this survey, we broadly study the intersection of GNNs and PGMs. Specifically, we first discuss how GNNs can benefit from learning structured representations in PGMs, generate explainable predictions by PGMs, and how PGMs can infer object relationships. Then we discuss how GNNs are implemented in PGMs for more efficient inference and structure learning. In the end, we summarize the benchmark datasets used in recent studies and discuss promising future directions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
