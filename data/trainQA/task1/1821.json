Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Learnable Graph-regularization for Matrix Decomposition\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Low-rank approximation models of data matrices have become important machine learning and data mining tools in many fields including computer vision, text mining, bioinformatics and many others. They allow for embedding high-dimensional data into low-dimensional spaces, which mitigates the effects of noise and uncovers latent relations. In order to make the learned representations inherit the structures in the original data, graph-regularization terms are often added to the loss function. However, the prior graph construction often fails to reflect the true network connectivity and the intrinsic relationships. In addition, many graph-regularized methods fail to take the dual spaces into account. Probabilistic models are often used to model the distribution of the representations, but most of previous methods often assume that the hidden variables are independent and identically distributed for simplicity. To this end, we propose a learnable graph-regularization model for matrix decomposition (LGMD), which builds a bridge between graph-regularized methods and probabilistic matrix decomposition models. LGMD learns two graphical structures (i.e., two precision matrices) in real-time in an iterative manner via sparse precision matrix estimation and is more robust to noise and missing entries. Extensive numerical results and comparison with competing methods demonstrate its effectiveness.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
