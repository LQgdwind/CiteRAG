Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Computational Complexity of Detecting Proximity to Losslessly Compressible Neural Network Parameters\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract To better understand complexity in neural networks, we theoretically investigate the idealised phenomenon of lossless network compressibility, whereby an identical function can be implemented with a smaller network. We give an efficient formal algorithm for optimal lossless compression in the setting of single-hidden-layer hyperbolic tangent networks. To measure lossless compressibility, we define the rank of a parameter as the minimum number of hidden units required to implement the same function. Losslessly compressible parameters are atypical, but their existence has implications for nearby parameters. We define the proximate rank of a parameter as the rank of the most compressible parameter within a small L‚àûsuperscriptùêøL^{\\infty} neighbourhood. Unfortunately, detecting nearby losslessly compressible parameters is not so easy: we show that bounding the proximate rank is an ùí©‚Äãùí´ùí©ùí´\\mathcal{NP}-complete problem, using a reduction from Boolean satisfiability via a geometric problem involving covering points in the plane with small squares. These results underscore the computational complexity of measuring neural network complexity, laying a foundation for future theoretical and empirical work in this direction.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
