      "content": "Paper Title: A constant time complexity algorithm for the unbounded knapsack problem with bounded coefficients\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Benchmark instances for the unbounded knapsack problem are typically generated according to specific criteria within a given constant range RùëÖR, and these instances can be referred to as the unbounded knapsack problem with bounded coefficients (UKPB). In order to increase the difficulty of solving these instances, the knapsack capacity Cùê∂C is usually set to a very large value. Therefore, an exact algorithm that neither time complexity nor space complexity includes the capacity coefficient Cùê∂C is highly anticipated. In this paper, we propose an exact algorithm with time complexity of O‚Äã(R4)ùëÇsuperscriptùëÖ4O(R^{4}) and space complexity of O‚Äã(R3)ùëÇsuperscriptùëÖ3O(R^{3}). The algorithm initially divides the multiset NùëÅN into two multisubsets, N1subscriptùëÅ1N_{1} and N2subscriptùëÅ2N_{2}, based on the profit density of their types. For the multisubset N2subscriptùëÅ2N_{2} composed of types with profit density lower than the maximum profit density type, we utilize a recent branch and bound (B&B) result by Dey et al. (Math. Prog., pp 569-587, 2023) to determine the maximum selection number for types in N2subscriptùëÅ2N_{2}. We then employ the Unbounded-DP algorithm to exactly solve for the types in N2subscriptùëÅ2N_{2}. For the multisubset N1subscriptùëÅ1N_{1} composed of the maximum profit density type and its counterparts with the same profit density, we transform it into a linear Diophantine equation and leverage relevant conclusions from the Frobenius problem to solve it efficiently. In particular, the proof techniques required by the algorithm are primarily covered in the first-year mathematics curriculum, which is convenient for subsequent researchers to grasp.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
