      "content": "Paper Title: Real-Time Model Calibration with Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The dynamic, real-time, and accurate inference of model parameters from empirical data is of great importance in many scientific and engineering disciplines that use computational models (such as a digital twin) for the analysis and prediction of complex physical processes. However, fast and accurate inference for processes with large and high dimensional datasets cannot easily be achieved with state-of-the-art methods under noisy real-world conditions. The primary reason is that the inference of model parameters with traditional techniques based on optimisation or sampling often suffers from computational and statistical challenges, resulting in a trade-off between accuracy and deployment time. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for inference of model parameters based on reinforcement learning. The contribution of the paper is twofold: 1) We reformulate the inference problem as a tracking problem with the objective of learning a policy that forces the response of the physics-based model to follow the observations; 2) We propose the constrained Lyapunov-based actor-critic (CLAC) algorithm to enable the robust and accurate inference of physics-based model parameters in real time under noisy real-world conditions. The proposed methodology is demonstrated and evaluated on two model-based diagnostics test cases utilizing two different physics-based models of turbofan engines. The performance of the methodology is compared to that of two alternative approaches: a state update method (unscented Kalman filter) and a supervised end-to-end mapping with deep neural networks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms all other tested methods in terms of speed and robustness, with high inference accuracy.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
