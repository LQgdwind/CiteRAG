Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring ML testing in practice – Lessons learned from an interactive rapid review with Axis Communications\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. There is a growing interest in industry and academia in machine learning (ML) testing. We believe that industry and academia need to learn together to produce rigorous and relevant knowledge. In this study, we initiate a collaboration between stakeholders from one case company, one research institute, and one university. To establish a common view of the problem domain, we applied an interactive rapid review of the state of the art. Four researchers from Lund University and RISE Research Institutes and four practitioners from Axis Communications reviewed a set of 180 primary studies on ML testing. We developed a taxonomy for the communication around ML testing challenges and results and identified a list of 12 review questions relevant for Axis Communications. The three most important questions (data testing, metrics for assessment, and test generation) were mapped to the literature, and an in-depth analysis of the 35 primary studies matching the most important question (data testing) was made. A final set of the five best matches were analysed and we reflect on the criteria for applicability and relevance for the industry. The taxonomies are helpful for communication but not final. Furthermore, there was no perfect match to the case company’s investigated review question (data testing). However, we extracted relevant approaches from the five studies on a conceptual level to support later context-specific improvements. We found the interactive rapid review approach useful for triggering and aligning communication between the different stakeholders.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 47\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
