Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Applying recent advances in Visual Question Answering to Record Linkage\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Multi-modal Record Linkage is the process of matching multi-modal records from multiple sources that represent the same entity. This field has not been explored in research and we propose two solutions based on Deep Learning architectures that are inspired by recent work in Visual Question Answering. The neural networks we propose use two different fusion modules, the Recurrent Neural Network + Convolutional Neural Network fusion module and the Stacked Attention Network fusion module, that jointly combine the visual and the textual data of the records. The output of these fusion models is the input of a Siamese Neural Network that computes the similarity of the records. Using data from the Avito Duplicate Advertisements Detection dataset, we train these solutions and from the experiments, we concluded that the Recurrent Neural Network + Convolutional Neural Network fusion module outperforms a simple model that uses hand-crafted features. We also find that the Recurrent Neural Network + Convolutional Neural Network fusion module classifies dissimilar advertisements as similar more frequently if their average description is bigger than 40 words. We conclude that the reason for this is that the longer advertisements have a different distribution then the shorter advertisements who are more prevalent in the dataset. In the end, we also conclude that further research needs to be done with the Stacked Attention Network, to further explore the effects of the visual data on the performance of the fusion modules.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
