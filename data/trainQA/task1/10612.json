      "content": "Paper Title: Investigating Out-of-Distribution Generalization of GNNs: An Architecture Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited remarkable performance under the assumption that test data comes from the same distribution of training data. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption may not always be valid. Consequently, there is a growing focus on exploring the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) problem in the context of graphs. Most existing efforts have primarily concentrated on improving graph OOD generalization from two model-agnostic perspectives: data-driven methods and strategy-based learning. However, there has been limited attention dedicated to investigating the impact of well-known GNN model architectures on graph OOD generalization, which is orthogonal to existing research. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of OOD generalization on graphs from an architecture perspective, by examining the common building blocks of modern GNNs. Through extensive experiments, we reveal that both the graph self-attention mechanism and the decoupled architecture contribute positively to graph OOD generalization. In contrast, we observe that the linear classification layer tends to compromise graph OOD generalization capability. Furthermore, we provide in-depth theoretical insights and discussions to underpin these discoveries. These insights have empowered us to develop a novel GNN backbone model, DGat, designed to harness the robust properties of both graph self-attention mechanism and the decoupled architecture. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model under graph OOD, exhibiting substantial and consistent enhancements across various training strategies.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
