However, integrating this technology into the curriculum for computer science students who lack prior exposure to quantum mechanics and advanced mathematics remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a scaffolded learning approach aimed at equipping computer science students with essential quantum principles. By introducing foundational quantum concepts through relatable analogies and a layered learning approach based on classical computation, this approach seeks to bridge the gap between classical and quantum computing. This differs from previous approaches which build quantum computing fundamentals from the prerequisite of linear algebra and mathematics. The paper offers a considered set of intuitive analogies for foundation quantum concepts including entanglement, superposition, quantum data structures and quantum algorithms. These analogies coupled with a computing-based layered learning approach, lay the groundwork for a comprehensive teaching methodology tailored for undergraduate third level computer science students.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
