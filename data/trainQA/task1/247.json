Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Lyapunov Model Predictive Control: Learning Safe Global Controllers from Sub-optimal Examples\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract With a growing interest in data-driven control techniques, Model Predictive Control (MPC) provides an opportunity to exploit the surplus of data reliably, particularly while taking safety and stability into account. In many real-world and industrial applications, it is typical to have an existing control strategy, for instance, execution from a human operator. The objective of this work is to improve upon this unknown, safe but suboptimal policy by learning a new controller that retains safety and stability. Learning how to be safe is achieved directly from data and from a knowledge of the system constraints. The proposed algorithm alternatively learns the terminal cost and updates the MPC parameters according to a stability metric. The terminal cost is constructed as a Lyapunov function neural network with the aim of recovering or extending the stable region of the initial demonstrator using a short prediction horizon. Theorems that characterize the stability and performance of the learned MPC in the bearing of model uncertainties and sub-optimality due to function approximation are presented. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on non-linear continuous control tasks with soft constraints. The proposed approach can improve upon the initial demonstrator also in practice and achieve better stability than popular reinforcement learning baselines.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
