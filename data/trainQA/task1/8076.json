Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Federated Nearest Neighbor Machine Translation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract To protect user privacy and meet legal regulations, federated learning (FL) is attracting significant attention. Training neural machine translation (NMT) models with traditional FL algorithms (e.g., FedAvg) typically relies on multi-round model-based interactions. However, it is impractical and inefficient for translation tasks due to the vast communication overheads and heavy synchronization. In this paper, we propose a novel Federated Nearest Neighbor (FedNN) machine translation framework that, instead of multi-round model-based interactions, leverages one-round memorization-based interaction to share knowledge across different clients and build low-overhead privacy-preserving systems. The whole approach equips the public NMT model trained on large-scale accessible data with a kùëòk-nearest-neighbor (kùëòkNN) classifier and integrates the external datastore constructed by private text data from all clients to form the final FL model. A two-phase datastore encryption strategy is introduced to achieve privacy-preserving during this process. Extensive experiments show that FedNN significantly reduces computational and communication costs compared with FedAvg, while maintaining promising translation performance in different FL settings.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
