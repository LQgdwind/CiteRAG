Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Spectral Sparsification via Bounded-Independence Sampling\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We give a deterministic, nearly logarithmic-space algorithm for mild spectral sparsification of undirected graphs. Given a weighted, undirected graph G𝐺G on n𝑛n vertices described by a binary string of length N𝑁N, an integer k≤log⁡n𝑘𝑛k\\leq\\log n, and an error parameter ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, our algorithm runs in space O~​(k​log⁡(N⋅wmax/wmin))~𝑂𝑘⋅𝑁subscript𝑤maxsubscript𝑤min\\widetilde{O}(k\\log(N\\cdot w_{\\mathrm{max}}/w_{\\mathrm{min}})) where wmaxsubscript𝑤maxw_{\\mathrm{max}} and wminsubscript𝑤minw_{\\mathrm{min}} are the maximum and minimum edge weights in G𝐺G, and produces a weighted graph H𝐻H with O~​(n1+2/k/ε2)~𝑂superscript𝑛12𝑘superscript𝜀2\\widetilde{O}(n^{1+2/k}/\\varepsilon^{2}) edges that spectrally approximates G𝐺G, in the sense of Spielmen and Teng [ST04], up to an error of ε𝜀\\varepsilon. Our algorithm is based on a new bounded-independence analysis of Spielman and Srivastava’s effective resistance based edge sampling algorithm [SS11] and uses results from recent work on space-bounded Laplacian solvers [MRSV17]. In particular, we demonstrate an inherent tradeoff (via upper and lower bounds) between the amount of (bounded) independence used in the edge sampling algorithm, denoted by k𝑘k above, and the resulting sparsity that can be achieved.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
