Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Probabilistic Counters for Privacy Preserving Data Aggregation1footnote 11footnote 1\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Probabilistic counters are well-known tools often used for space-efficient set cardinality estimation. In this paper, we investigate probabilistic counters from the perspective of preserving privacy. We use the standard, rigid differential privacy notion. The intuition is that the probabilistic counters do not reveal too much information about individuals but provide only general information about the population. Therefore, they can be used safely without violating the privacy of individuals. However, it turned out, that providing a precise, formal analysis of the privacy parameters of probabilistic counters is surprisingly difficult and needs advanced techniques and a very careful approach. We demonstrate that probabilistic counters can be used as a privacy protection mechanism without extra randomization. Namely, the inherent randomization from the protocol is sufficient for protecting privacy, even if the probabilistic counter is used multiple times. In particular, we present a specific privacy-preserving data aggregation protocol based on Morris Counter and MaxGeo Counter. Some of the presented results are devoted to counters that have not been investigated so far from the perspective of privacy protection. Another part is an improvement of previous results. We show how our results can be used to perform distributed surveys and compare the properties of counter-based solutions and a standard Laplace method.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
