      "content": "Paper Title: Learning with Logical Constraints but without Shortcut Satisfaction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recent studies have explored the integration of logical knowledge into deep learning via encoding logical constraints as an additional loss function. However, existing approaches tend to vacuously satisfy logical constraints through shortcuts, failing to fully exploit the knowledge. In this paper, we present a new framework for learning with logical constraints. Specifically, we address the shortcut satisfaction issue by introducing dual variables for logical connectives, encoding how the constraint is satisfied. We further propose a variational framework where the encoded logical constraint is expressed as a distributional loss that is compatible with the model‚Äôs original training loss. The theoretical analysis shows that the proposed approach bears salient properties, and the experimental evaluations demonstrate its superior performance in both model generalizability and constraint satisfaction.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 65 most likely reference titles for this paper.
