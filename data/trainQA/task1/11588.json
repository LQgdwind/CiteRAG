Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Annotated Dependency Pairs for Full Almost-Sure Termination of Probabilistic Term Rewritingfunded by the DFG Research Training Group 2236 UnRAVeL\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Dependency pairs (DPs) are one of the most powerful techniques for automated termination analysis of term rewrite systems. Recently, we adapted the DP framework to the probabilistic setting to prove almost-sure termination (ùô∞ùöÇùöÉùô∞ùöÇùöÉ\\mathtt{AST}) via annotated DPs (ADPs). However, this adaption only handled ùô∞ùöÇùöÉùô∞ùöÇùöÉ\\mathtt{AST} w.r.t. the innermost evaluation strategy. In this paper, we improve the ADP framework to prove ùô∞ùöÇùöÉùô∞ùöÇùöÉ\\mathtt{AST} for full rewriting. Moreover, we refine the framework for rewrite sequences that start with basic terms containing a single defined function symbol. We implemented and evaluated the new framework in our tool AProVE.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
