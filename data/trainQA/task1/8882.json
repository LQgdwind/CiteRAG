Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Theoretically Principled Federated Learning for Balancing Privacy and Utility\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We propose a general learning framework for the protection mechanisms that protects privacy via distorting model parameters, which facilitates the trade-off between privacy and utility. The algorithm is applicable to arbitrary privacy measurements that maps from the distortion to a real value. It can achieve personalized utility-privacy trade-off for each model parameter, on each client, at each communication round in federated learning. Such adaptive and fine-grained protection can improve the effectiveness of privacy-preserved federated learning. Theoretically, we show that gap between the utility loss of the protection hyperparameter output by our algorithm and that of the optimal protection hyperparameter is sub-linear in the total number of iterations. The sublinearity of our algorithm indicates that the average gap between the performance of our algorithm and that of the optimal performance goes to zero when the number of iterations goes to infinity. Further, we provide the convergence rate of our proposed algorithm. We conduct empirical results on benchmark datasets to verify that our method achieves better utility than the baseline methods under the same privacy budget.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
