Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 59 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract An idealized 1:2 scale demonstrator and a numerical parameter optimization algorithm are proposed to closely reproduce the deformation shape and, thus, spatial strain directions of a real aerodynamically loaded civil aircraft spoiler using only four concentrated loads. Cost-efficient experimental studies on demonstrators of increasing complexity are required to transfer knowledge from coupons to full-scale structures and to build up confidence in novel structural health monitoring (SHM) technologies. Especially for testing novel sensor systems that depend on or are affected by mechanical strains, e.g., strain-based SHM methods, it is essential that the considered lab-scale structures reflect the strain states of the real structure at operational loading conditions. Finite element simulations with detailed models were performed for static strength analysis and for comparison to experimental measurements. The simulated and measured deformations and spatial strain directions of the idealized demonstrator correlated well with the numerical results of the real aircraft spoiler. Thus, using the developed idealized demonstrator, strain-based SHM systems can be tested under conditions that reflect operational aerodynamic pressure loads, while the test effort and costs are significantly reduced. Furthermore, the presented loading optimization algorithm can be easily adapted to mimic other pressure loads in plate-like structures to reproduce specific structural conditions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 59\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
