Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: A (2+ùúÄ)-Approximation Algorithm for Maximum Independent Set of Rectangles\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study the Maximum Independent Set of Rectangles (MISR) problem, where we are given a set of axis-parallel rectangles in the plane and the goal is to select a subset of non-overlapping rectangles of maximum cardinality. In a recent breakthrough, Mitchell [45] obtained the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for MISR. His algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of 10 and it is based on a dynamic program that intuitively recursively partitions the input plane into special polygons called corner-clipped rectangles (CCRs), without intersecting certain special horizontal line segments called fences. In this paper, we present a (2+Œµ)2ùúÄ(2+\\varepsilon)-approximation algorithm for MISR which is also based on a recursive partitioning scheme. First, we use a partition into a class of axis-parallel polygons with constant complexity each that are more general than CCRs. This allows us to provide an arguably simpler analysis and at the same time already improves the approximation ratio to 6. Then, using a more elaborate charging scheme and a recursive partitioning into general axis-parallel polygons with constant complexity, we improve our approximation ratio to 2+Œµ2ùúÄ2+\\varepsilon. In particular, we construct a recursive partitioning based on more general fences which can be sequences of up to O‚Äã(1/Œµ)ùëÇ1ùúÄO(1/\\varepsilon) line segments each. This partitioning routine and our other new ideas may be useful for future work towards a PTAS for MISR.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
