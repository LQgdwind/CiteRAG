Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: R-BI: Regularized Batched Inputs enhance Incremental Decoding Framework for Low-Latency Simultaneous Speech Translation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Incremental Decoding is an effective framework that enables the use of an offline model in a simultaneous setting without modifying the original model, making it suitable for Low-Latency Simultaneous Speech Translation. However, this framework may introduce errors when the system outputs from incomplete input. To reduce these output errors, several strategies such as Hold-nùëõn, LA-nùëõn, and SP-nùëõn can be employed, but the hyper-parameter nùëõn needs to be carefully selected for optimal performance. Moreover, these strategies are more suitable for end-to-end systems than cascade systems. In our paper, we propose a new adaptable and efficient policy named \"Regularized Batched Inputs\". Our method stands out by enhancing input diversity to mitigate output errors. We suggest particular regularization techniques for both end-to-end and cascade systems. We conducted experiments on IWSLT Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) tasks, which demonstrate that our approach achieves low latency while maintaining no more than 2 BLEU points loss compared to offline systems. Furthermore, our SimulST systems attained several new state-of-the-art results in various language directions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
