      "content": "Paper Title: A Lightweight FPGA-based IDS-ECU Architecture for Automotive CAN\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recent years have seen an exponential rise in complex software-driven functionality in vehicles, leading to a rising number of electronic control units (ECUs), network capabilities, and interfaces. These expanded capabilities also bring-in new planes of vulnerabilities making intrusion detection and management a critical capability; however, this can often result in more ECUs and network elements due to the high computational overheads. In this paper, we present a consolidated ECU architecture incorporating an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for Automotive Controller Area Network (CAN) along with traditional ECU functionality on an off-the-shelf hybrid FPGA device, with near-zero overhead for the ECU functionality. We propose two quantised multi-layer perceptrons (QMLP’s) as isolated IDSs for detecting a range of attack vectors including Denial-of-Service, Fuzzing and Spoofing, which are accelerated using off-the-shelf deep-learning processing unit (DPU) IP block from Xilinx, operating fully transparently to the software on the ECU. The proposed models achieve the state-of-the-art classification accuracy for all the attacks, while we observed a 15×\\times reduction in power consumption when compared against the GPU-based implementation of the same models quantised using Nvidia libraries. We also achieved a 2.3×\\times speed up in per-message processing latency (at 0.24 ms from the arrival of a CAN message) to meet the strict end-to-end latency on critical CAN nodes and a 2.6×\\times reduction in power consumption for inference when compared to the state-of-the-art IDS models on embedded IDS and loosely coupled IDS accelerators (GPUs) discussed in the literature.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
