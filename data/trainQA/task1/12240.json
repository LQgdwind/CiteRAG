Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Tracking the Persistence of Harmonic Chains: Barcode and Stability\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The persistence barcode is a topological descriptor of data that plays a fundamental role in topological data analysis. Given a filtration of data, the persistence barcode tracks the evolution of its homology groups. In this paper, we introduce a new type of barcode, called the harmonic chain barcode, which tracks the evolution of harmonic chains. In addition, we show that the harmonic chain barcode is stable. Given a filtration of a simplicial complex of size mùëöm, we present an algorithm to compute its harmonic chain barcode in O‚Äã(m3)ùëÇsuperscriptùëö3O(m^{3}) time. Consequently, the harmonic chain barcode can enrich the family of topological descriptors in applications where a persistence barcode is applicable, such as feature vectorization and machine learning.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
