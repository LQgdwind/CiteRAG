Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Average-Case Communication Complexity of Statistical Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study statistical problems, such as planted clique, its variants, and sparse principal component analysis in the context of average-case communication complexity. Our motivation is to understand the statistical-computational trade-offs in streaming, sketching, and query-based models. Communication complexity is the main tool for proving lower bounds in these models, yet many prior results do not hold in an average-case setting. We provide a general reduction method that preserves the input distribution for problems involving a random graph or matrix with planted structure. Then, we derive two-party and multi-party communication lower bounds for detecting or finding planted cliques, bipartite cliques, and related problems. As a consequence, we obtain new bounds on the query complexity in the edge-probe, vector-matrix-vector, matrix-vector, linear sketching, and ùîΩ2subscriptùîΩ2\\mathbb{F}_{2}-sketching models. Many of these results are nearly tight, and we use our techniques to provide simple proofs of some known lower bounds for the edge-probe model.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
