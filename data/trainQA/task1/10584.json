Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 58 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Fingerprinting New York City’s Scaffolding Problem with Longitudinal Dashcam Data\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Scaffolds, also called sidewalk sheds, are intended to be temporary structures to protect pedestrians from construction and repair hazards. However, some sidewalk sheds are left up for years. Long-term scaffolding become eyesores, creates accessibility issues on sidewalks, and gives cover to illicit activity. Today, there are over 8,000 active permits for scaffolds in NYC; the more problematic scaffolds are likely expired or unpermitted. This research uses computer vision on street-level imagery to develop a longitudinal map of scaffolding throughout the city. Using a dataset of 29,156,833 dashcam images taken between August 2023 and January 2024, we develop an algorithm to track the presence of scaffolding over time. We also design and implement methods to match detected scaffolds to reported locations of active scaffolding permits, enabling the identification of sidewalk sheds without corresponding permits. We identify 850,766 images of scaffolding, tagging 5,156 active sidewalk sheds and estimating 529 unpermitted sheds. We discuss the implications of an in-the-wild scaffolding classifier for urban tech, innovations to governmental inspection processes, and out-of-distribution evaluations outside of New York City.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 58\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
