Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Graph classification is an important learning task for graph-structured data. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently gained growing attention in graph learning and shown significant improvements on many important graph problems. Despite their state-of-the-art performances, existing GNNs only use local information from a very limited neighborhood around each node, suffering from loss of multi-modal information and overheads of excessive computation. To address these issues, we propose a novel Tensor-view Topological Graph Neural Network (TTG-NN), a class of simple yet effective topological deep learning built upon persistent homology, graph convolution, and tensor operations. This new method incorporates tensor learning to simultaneously capture Tensor-view Topological (TT), as well as Tensor-view Graph (TG) structural information on both local and global levels. Computationally, to fully exploit graph topology and structure, we propose two flexible TT and TG representation learning modules that disentangle feature tensor aggregation and transformation, and learn to preserve multi-modal structure with less computation. Theoretically, we derive high probability bounds on both the out-of-sample and in-sample mean squared approximation errors for our proposed Tensor Transformation Layer (TTL). Real data experiments show that the proposed TTG-NN outperforms 20 state-of-the-art methods on various graph benchmarks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
