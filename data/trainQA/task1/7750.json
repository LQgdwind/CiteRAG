Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 170 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Controls of Machine Learning Based Systems: A Survey and Taxonomy\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this article, we propose the Artificial Intelligence Security Taxonomy to systematize the knowledge of threats, vulnerabilities, and security controls of machine-learning-based (ML-based) systems. We first classify the damage caused by attacks against ML-based systems, define ML-specific security, and discuss its characteristics. Next, we enumerate all relevant assets and stakeholders and provide a general taxonomy for ML-specific threats. Then, we collect a wide range of security controls against ML-specific threats through an extensive review of recent literature. Finally, we classify the vulnerabilities and controls of an ML-based system in terms of each vulnerable asset in the system’s entire lifecycle.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 170 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 170\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
