Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 58 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Flexible and Inherently Comprehensible Knowledge Representation for Data-Efficient Learning and Trustworthy Human-Machine Teaming in Manufacturing Environments\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Trustworthiness of artificially intelligent agents is vital for the acceptance of human-machine teaming in industrial manufacturing environments. Predictable behaviours and explainable (and understandable) rationale allow humans collaborating with (and building) these agents to understand their motivations and therefore validate decisions that are made. To that aim, we make use of Gärdenfors’s cognitively inspired Conceptual Space framework to represent the agent’s knowledge using concepts as convex regions in a space spanned by inherently comprehensible quality dimensions. A simple typicality quantification model is built on top of it to determine fuzzy category membership and classify instances interpretably. We apply it on a use case from the manufacturing domain, using objects’ physical properties obtained from cobots’ onboard sensors and utilisation properties from crowdsourced commonsense knowledge available at public knowledge bases. Such flexible knowledge representation based on property decomposition allows for data-efficient representation learning of typically highly specialist or specific manufacturing artefacts. In such a setting, traditional data-driven (e.g., computer vision-based) classification approaches would struggle due to training data scarcity. This allows for comprehensibility of an AI agent’s acquired knowledge by the human collaborator thus contributing to trustworthiness. We situate our approach within an existing explainability framework specifying explanation desiderata. We provide arguments for our system’s applicability and appropriateness for different roles of human agents collaborating with the AI system throughout its design, validation, and operation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 58\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
