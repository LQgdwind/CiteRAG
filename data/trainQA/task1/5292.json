Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: An integrated heterogeneous computing framework for ensemble simulations of laser-induced ignition\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract An integrated computational framework is introduced to study complex engineering systems through physics-based ensemble simulations on heterogeneous supercomputers. The framework is primarily designed for the quantitative assessment of laser-induced ignition in rocket engines. We develop and combine an implicit programming system, a compressible reacting flow solver, and a data generation/management strategy on a robust and portable platform. We systematically present this framework using test problems on a hybrid CPU/GPU machine. Efficiency, scalability, and accuracy of the solver are comprehensively assessed with canonical unit problems. Ensemble data management and autoencoding are demonstrated using a canonical diffusion flame case. Sensitivity analysis of the ignition of a turbulent, gaseous fuel jet is performed using a simplified, three-dimensional model combustor. Our approach unifies computer science, physics and engineering, and data science to realize a cross-disciplinary workflow. The framework is exascale-oriented and can be considered a benchmark for future computational science studies of real-world systems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 48\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
