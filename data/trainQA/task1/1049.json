Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 63 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Self-Scaling Clusters and Reproducible Containers to Enable Scientific Computing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Container technologies such as Docker have become a crucial component of many software industry practices especially those pertaining to reproducibility and portability. The containerization philosophy has influenced the scientific computing community, which has begun to adopt – and even develop – container technologies (such as Singularity). Leveraging containers for scientific software often poses challenges distinct from those encountered in industry, and requires different methodologies. This is especially true for HPC. With an increasing number of options for HPC in the cloud (including NSF-funded cloud projects), there is strong motivation to seek solutions that provide flexibility to develop and deploy scientific software on a variety of computational infrastructures in a portable and reproducible way. The flexibility offered by cloud services enables virtual HPC clusters that scale on-demand, and the Cyberinfrastructure Resource Integration team in the XSEDE project has developed a set of tools which provides scalable infrastructure in the cloud. We now present a solution which uses the Nix package manager in an MPI-capable Docker container that is converted to Singularity. It provides consistent installations, dependencies, and environments in each image that are reproducible and portable across scientific computing infrastructures. We demonstrate the utility of these containers with cluster benchmark runs in a self-scaling virtual cluster using the Slurm scheduler deployed in the Jetstream and Aristotle Red Cloud OpenStack clouds. We conclude this technique is useful as a template for scientific software application containers to be used in the XSEDE compute environment, other Singularity HPC environments, and cloud computing environments.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 63 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 63\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
