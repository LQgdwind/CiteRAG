      "content": "Paper Title: Robust Ultra-wideband Range Error Mitigation with Deep Learning at the Edge\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Ultra-wideband (UWB) is the state-of-the-art and most popular technology for wireless localization. Nevertheless, precise ranging and localization in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions is still an open research topic. Indeed, multipath effects, reflections, refractions, and complexity of the indoor radio environment can easily introduce a positive bias in the ranging measurement, resulting in highly inaccurate and unsatisfactory position estimation. This article proposes an efficient representation learning methodology that exploits the latest advancement in deep learning and graph optimization techniques to achieve effective ranging error mitigation at the edge. Channel Impulse Response (CIR) signals are directly exploited to extract high semantic features to estimate corrections in either NLoS or LoS conditions. Extensive experimentation with different settings and configurations has proved the effectiveness of our methodology and demonstrated the feasibility of a robust and low computational power UWB range error mitigation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 55\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
