Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Domain Adaptation by Maximizing Population Correlation with Neural Architecture Search\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In Domain Adaptation (DA), where the feature distributions of the source and target domains are different, various distance-based methods have been proposed to minimize the discrepancy between the source and target domains to handle the domain shift. In this paper, we propose a new similarity function, which is called Population Correlation (PC), to measure the domain discrepancy for DA. Base on the PC function, we propose a new method called Domain Adaptation by Maximizing Population Correlation (DAMPC) to learn a domain-invariant feature representation for DA. Moreover, most existing DA methods use hand-crafted bottleneck networks, which may limit the capacity and flexibility of the corresponding model. Therefore, we further propose a method called DAMPC with Neural Architecture Search (DAMPC-NAS) to search the optimal network architecture for DAMPC. Experiments on several benchmark datasets, including Office-31, Office-Home, and VisDA-2017, show that the proposed DAMPC-NAS method achieves better results than state-of-the-art DA methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
