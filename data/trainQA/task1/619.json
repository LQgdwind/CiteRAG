Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: DSAC: Distributional Soft Actor Critic for Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we present a new reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm called Distributional Soft Actor Critic (DSAC), which exploits the distributional information of accumulated rewards to achieve better performance. Seamlessly integrating SAC (which uses entropy to encourage exploration) with a principled distributional view of the underlying objective, DSAC takes into consideration the randomness in both action and rewards, and beats the state-of-the-art baselines in several continuous control benchmarks. Moreover, with the distributional information of rewards, we propose a unified framework for risk-sensitive learning, one that goes beyond maximizing only expected accumulated rewards. Under this framework we discuss three specific risk-related metrics: percentile, mean-variance and distorted expectation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that with distribution modeling in RL, the agent performs better for both risk-averse and risk-seeking control tasks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
