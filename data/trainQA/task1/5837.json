Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Self-Supervised Text Erasing with Controllable Image Synthesis\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Recent efforts on scene text erasing have shown promising results. However, existing methods require rich yet costly label annotations to obtain robust models, which limits the use for practical applications. To this end, we study an unsupervised scenario by proposing a novel Self-supervised Text Erasing (STE) framework that jointly learns to synthesize training images with erasure ground-truth and accurately erase texts in the real world. We first design a style-aware image synthesis function to generate synthetic images with diverse styled texts based on two synthetic mechanisms. To bridge the text style gap between the synthetic and real-world data, a policy network is constructed to control the synthetic mechanisms by picking style parameters with the guidance of two specifically designed rewards. The synthetic training images with erasure ground-truth are then fed to train a coarse-to-fine erasing network. To produce better erasing outputs, a triplet erasure loss is designed to enforce the refinement stage to recover background textures. Moreover, we provide a new dataset (called PosterErase), which contains 60K high-resolution posters with texts and is more challenging for the text erasing task. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated with both PosterErase and the widely-used SCUT-Enstext dataset. Notably, on PosterErase, our unsupervised method achieves 5.07 in terms of FID, with a relative performance of 20.9% over existing supervised baselines.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
