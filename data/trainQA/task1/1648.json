Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Deterministic PRAM Approximate Shortest Paths in Polylogarithmic Time and Slightly Super-Linear Work\n\nPaper Abstract: We study a (1+ϵ)1italic-ϵ(1+\\epsilon)-approximate single-source shortest paths (henceforth, (1+ϵ)1italic-ϵ(1+\\epsilon)-SSSP) in n𝑛n-vertex undirected, weighted graphs in the parallel (PRAM) model of computation. A randomized algorithm with polylogarithmic time and slightly super-linear work O~​(|E|⋅nρ)~𝑂⋅𝐸superscript𝑛𝜌\\tilde{O}(|E|\\cdot n^{\\rho}), for an arbitrarily small ρ>0𝜌0\\rho>0, was given by Cohen [Coh94] more than 252525 years ago. Exciting progress on this problem was achieved in recent years [EN17b, EN19, Li19, ASZ19], culminating in randomized polylogarithmic time and O~​(|E|)~𝑂𝐸\\tilde{O}(|E|) work. However, the question of whether there exists a deterministic counterpart of Cohen’s algorithm remained wide open. In the current paper we devise the first deterministic polylogarithmic-time algorithm for this fundamental problem, with work O~​(|E|⋅nρ)~𝑂⋅𝐸superscript𝑛𝜌\\tilde{O}(|E|\\cdot n^{\\rho}), for an arbitrarily small ρ>0𝜌0\\rho>0. This result is based on the first efficient deterministic parallel algorithm for building hopsets, which we devise in this paper.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
