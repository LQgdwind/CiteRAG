Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Attention-based Multi-Reference Learning for Image Super-Resolution\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper proposes a novel Attention-based Multi-Reference Super-resolution network (AMRSR) that, given a low-resolution image, learns to adaptively transfer the most similar texture from multiple reference images to the super-resolution output whilst maintaining spatial coherence. The use of multiple reference images together with attention-based sampling is demonstrated to achieve significantly improved performance over state-of-the-art reference super-resolution approaches on multiple benchmark datasets. Reference super-resolution approaches have recently been proposed to overcome the ill-posed problem of image super-resolution by providing additional information from a high-resolution reference image. Multi-reference super-resolution extends this approach by providing a more diverse pool of image features to overcome the inherent information deficit whilst maintaining memory efficiency. A novel hierarchical attention-based sampling approach is introduced to learn the similarity between low-resolution image features and multiple reference images based on a perceptual loss. Ablation demonstrates the contribution of both multi-reference and hierarchical attention-based sampling to overall performance. Perceptual and quantitative ground-truth evaluation demonstrates significant improvement in performance even when the reference images deviate significantly from the target image. The project website can be found at https://marcopesavento.github.io/AMRSR/\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 48\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
