Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Novel Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Automated Stock Trading System Using Cascaded LSTM Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract More and more stock trading strategies are constructed using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, but DRL methods originally widely used in the gaming community are not directly adaptable to financial data with low signal-to-noise ratios and unevenness, and thus suffer from performance shortcomings. In this paper, to capture the hidden information, we propose a DRL based stock trading system using cascaded LSTM (CLSTM-PPO Model), which first uses LSTM to extract the time-series features from daily stock data, and then the features extracted are fed to the agent for training, while the strategy functions in reinforcement learning also use another LSTM for training. Experiments in 30 stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial index (DJI) in the US, 30 stocks from SSE50 on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in China, 30 stocks from SENSEX on the Bombay Stock Exchange in India and 30 stocks from FTSE 100 on London Stock Exchange in the UK show that our model outperforms previous baseline models in terms of cumulative returns by 5% to 52%, maximum earning rate by 8% to 52%, average profitability per trade by 6% to 14% and these advantages are more significant in the Chinese stock market, an emerging market, where cumulative returns have improved by 84.4% and the Sharpe ratio by 37.4% than ensemble strategy. It indicates that our proposed method is a promising way to build a automated stock trading system.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 49\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
