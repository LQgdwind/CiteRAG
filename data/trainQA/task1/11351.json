      "content": "Paper Title: Analyzing Multifiltering Functions Using Multiparameter Discrete Morse Theory\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. A multiparameter filtration, or a multifiltration, may in many cases be seen as the collection of sublevel sets of a vector function, which we call a multifiltering function. The main objective of this paper is to obtain a better understanding of such functions through multiparameter discrete Morse (mdm) theory, which is an extension of Morse-Forman theory to vector-valued functions. Notably, we prove algorithmically that any multifiltering function defined on a simplicial complex can always be approximated by a compatible mdm function. Moreover, we define the Pareto set of a discrete multifiltering function and show that the concept links directly to that of critical simplices of a mdm function. Finally, we experiment with these notions using triangular meshes.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 69 most likely reference titles for this paper.
