Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Knowledge-based model validation using a custom metric\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Vehicle models have a long history of research and as of today are able to model the involved physics in a reasonable manner. However, each new vehicle has its new characteristics or parameters. The identification of these is the main task of an engineer. To validate whether the correct parameter set has been chosen is a tedious task and often can only be performed by experts. Metrics known commonly used in literature are able to compare different results under certain aspects. However, they fail to answer the question: Are the models accurate enough? In this article, we propose the usage of a custom metric trained on the knowledge of experts to tackle this problem. Our approach involves three main steps: first, the formalized collection of subject matter experts’ opinion on the question: Having seen the measurement and simulation time series in comparison, is the model quality sufficient? From this step, we obtain a data set that is able to quantify the sufficiency of a simulation result based on a comparison to corresponding experimental data. In a second step, we compute common model metrics on the measurement and simulation time series and use these model metrics as features to a regression model. Third, we fit a regression model to the experts’ opinions. This regression model, i.e., our custom metric, can than predict the sufficiency of a new simulation result and gives a confidence on this prediction.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
