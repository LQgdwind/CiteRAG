      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-fidelity Gaussian Process for Biomanufacturing Process Modeling with Small Data\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In biomanufacturing, developing an accurate model to simulate the complex dynamics of bioprocesses is an important yet challenging task. This is partially due to the uncertainty associated with bioprocesses, high data acquisition cost, and lack of data availability to learn complex relations in bioprocesses. To deal with these challenges, we propose to use a statistical machine learning approach, multi-fidelity Gaussian process, for process modelling in biomanufacturing. Gaussian process regression is a well-established technique based on probability theory which can naturally consider uncertainty in a dataset via Gaussian noise, and multi-fidelity techniques can make use of multiple sources of information with different levels of fidelity, thus suitable for bioprocess modeling with small data. We apply the multi-fidelity Gaussian process to solve two significant problems in biomanufacturing, bioreactor scale-up and knowledge transfer across cell lines, and demonstrate its efficacy on real-world datasets.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
