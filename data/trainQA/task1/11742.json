      "content": "Paper Title: Flag-Proxy Networks: Overcoming the Architectural, Scheduling and Decoding Obstacles of Quantum LDPC Codes\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Quantum error correction is necessary for achieving exponential speedups on important applications. The planar surface code has remained the most studied error-correcting code for the last two decades because of its relative simplicity. However, encoding a singular logical qubit with the planar surface code requires physical qubits quadratic in the code distance (dùëëd), making it space-inefficient for the large-distance codes necessary for promising applications. Thus, Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (QLDPC) have emerged as an alternative to the planar surface code but require a higher degree of connectivity. Furthermore, the problems of fault-tolerant syndrome extraction and decoding are understudied for these codes and also remain obstacles to their usage. In this paper, we consider two under-studied families of QLDPC codes: hyperbolic surface codes and hyperbolic color codes. We tackle the three challenges mentioned above as follows. First, we propose Flag-Proxy Networks (FPNs), a generalizable architecture for quantum codes that achieves low connectivity through flag and proxy qubits. Second, we propose a greedy syndrome extraction scheduling algorithm for general quantum codes and further use this algorithm for fault-tolerant syndrome extraction on FPNs. Third, we present two decoders that leverage flag measurements to decode the hyperbolic codes accurately. Our work finds that degree-4 FPNs of the hyperbolic surface and color codes are respectively 2.9√ó2.9\\times and 5.5√ó5.5\\times more space-efficient than the d=5ùëë5d=5 planar surface code, and become even more space-efficient when considering higher distances. The hyperbolic codes also have error rates comparable to their planar counterparts.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
