Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Cycle Registration in Persistent Homology with Applications in Topological Bootstrap\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this article we propose a novel approach for comparing the persistent homology representations of two spaces (filtrations). Commonly used methods are based on numerical summaries such as persistence diagrams and persistence landscapes, along with suitable metrics (e.g. Wasserstein). These summaries are useful for computational purposes, but they are merely a marginal of the actual topological information that persistent homology can provide. Instead, our approach compares between two topological representations directly in the data space. We do so by defining a correspondence relation between individual persistent cycles of two different spaces, and devising a method for computing this correspondence. Our matching of cycles is based on both the persistence intervals and the spatial placement of each feature. We demonstrate our new framework in the context of topological inference, where we use statistical bootstrap methods in order to differentiate between real features and noise in point cloud data.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
