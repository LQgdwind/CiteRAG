      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Reinforcement Learning with Human Assistance: An Argument for Human Subject Studies with HIPPO GymThis work has taken place in the Intelligent Robot Learning Lab at the University of Alberta, which is supported in part by research grants from the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii), CIFAR, and NSERC.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Reinforcement learning (RL) is a popular machine learning paradigm for game playing, robotics control, and other sequential decision tasks. However, RL agents often have long learning times with high data requirements because they begin by acting randomly. In order to better learn in complex tasks, this article argues that an external teacher can often significantly help the RL agent learn. OpenAI Gym is a common framework for RL research, including a large number of standard environments and agents, making RL research significantly more accessible. This article introduces our new open-source RL framework, the Human Input Parsing Platform for Openai Gym (HIPPO Gym), and the design decisions that went into its creation. The goal of this platform is to facilitate human-RL research, again lowering the bar so that more researchers can quickly investigate different ways that human teachers could assist RL agents, including learning from demonstrations, learning from feedback, or curriculum learning.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 56\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
