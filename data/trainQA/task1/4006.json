Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Computational Complexity of Synchronization under Sparse Regular Constraints\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The constrained synchronization problem (CSP) asks for a synchronizing word of a given input automaton contained in a regular set of constraints. It could be viewed as a special case of synchronization of a discrete event system under supervisory control. Here, we study the computational complexity of this problem for the class of sparse regular constraint languages. We give a new characterization of sparse regular sets, which equal the bounded regular sets, and derive a full classification of the computational complexity of CSP for letter-bounded regular constraint languages, which properly contain the strictly bounded regular languages. Then, we introduce strongly self-synchronizing codes and investigate CSP for bounded languages induced by these codes. With our previous result, we deduce a full classification for these languages as well. In both cases, depending on the constraint language, our problem becomes NP-complete or polynomial time solvable.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
