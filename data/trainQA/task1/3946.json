Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 61 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Uncertainty-Aware Task Allocation for Distributed Autonomous Robots\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper addresses task-allocation problems with uncertainty in situational awareness for distributed autonomous robots (DARs). The uncertainty propagation over a task-allocation process is done by using the Unscented transform that uses the Sigma-Point sampling mechanism. It has great potential to be employed for generic task-allocation schemes, in the sense that there is no need to modify an existing task-allocation method that has been developed without considering the uncertainty in the situational awareness. The proposed framework was tested in a simulated environment where the decision-maker needs to determine an optimal allocation of multiple locations assigned to multiple mobile flying robots whose locations come as random variables of known mean and covariance. The simulation result shows that the proposed stochastic task allocation approach generates an assignment with 30% less overall cost than the one without considering the uncertainty.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper.
