Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2. Title: Glove: Global vectors for word representation\n   Abstract: We present a new global log-bilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature.\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"titles\": [\n    \"Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\",\n    \"Glove: Global vectors for word representation\",\n    \"Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks\",\n    \"A Comparative Study of Neural Network Models for Sentence Classification\",\n    \"Deep lstm based feature mapping for query classification\"\n  ],\n  \"reasoning\": \"Based on the paper's focus on question classification using neural networks, I predict these references because: 1) CNN paper is directly relevant to the convolutional approach used; 2) GloVe embeddings are mentioned as pre-trained features; 3) QRNN is one of the compared methods; 4) Comparative study papers are common in this field; 5) LSTM-based query classification is closely related to question classification. Additional references cover related neural network architectures, NLP applications, deep learning methodologies, optimization techniques, and advanced neural network methods that would be relevant for this research area.\"\n}\n\nReturn JSON object only."

      "content": "Paper Title: Network Anatomy and Real-Time Measurement of Nvidia GeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Cloud gaming, wherein game graphics is rendered in the cloud and streamed back to the user as real-time video, expands the gaming market to billions of users who do not have gaming consoles or high-power graphics PCs. Companies like Nvidia, Amazon, Sony and Microsoft are investing in building cloud gaming platforms to tap this large unserved market. However, cloud gaming requires the user to have high-bandwidth and stable network connectivity – whereas a typical console game needs about 100-200 kbps, a cloud game demands minimum 10-20 Mbps. This makes the Internet Service Provider (ISP) a key player in ensuring the end-user’s good gaming experience. In this paper we develop a method to detect Nvidia’s GeForce NOW cloud gaming sessions over their network infrastructure, and measure associated user experience. In particular, we envision ISPs taking advantage of our method to provision network capacity at the right time and in the right place to support growth in cloud gaming at the right experience level; as well as identify the role of contextual factors such as user setup (browser vs app) and connectivity type (wired vs wireless) in performance degradation. We first present a detailed anatomy of flow establishment and volumetric profiles of cloud gaming sessions over multiple platforms, followed by a method to detect gameplay and measure key experience aspects such as latency, frame rate and resolution via real-time analysis of network traffic. The insights and methods are also validated in the lab for XBox Cloud Gaming platform. We then implement and deploy our method in a campus network to capture gameplay behaviors and experience measures across various user setups and connectivity types which we believe are valuable for network operators.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
