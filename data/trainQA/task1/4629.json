Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: CausalAF: Causal Autoregressive Flow for Safety-Critical Driving Scenario Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Generating safety-critical scenarios, which are crucial yet difficult to collect, provides an effective way to evaluate the robustness of autonomous driving systems. However, the diversity of scenarios and efficiency of generation methods are heavily restricted by the rareness and structure of safety-critical scenarios. Therefore, existing generative models that only estimate distributions from observational data are not satisfying to solve this problem. In this paper, we integrate causality as a prior into the scenario generation and propose a flow-based generative framework, Causal Autoregressive Flow (CausalAF). CausalAF encourages the generative model to uncover and follow the causal relationship among generated objects via novel causal masking operations instead of searching the sample only from observational data. By learning the cause-and-effect mechanism of how the generated scenario causes risk situations rather than just learning correlations from data, CausalAF significantly improves learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous traffic scenarios illustrate that CausalAF requires much fewer optimization resources to effectively generate safety-critical scenarios. We also show that using generated scenarios as additional training samples empirically improves the robustness of autonomous driving algorithms.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
