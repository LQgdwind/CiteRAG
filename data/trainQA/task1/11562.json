Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Quantifying gendered citation imbalance in computer science conferences\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The number of citations received by papers often exhibits imbalances in terms of author attributes such as country of affiliation and gender. While recent studies have quantified citation imbalance in terms of the authorsâ€™ gender in journal papers, the computer science discipline, where researchers frequently present their work at conferences, may exhibit unique patterns in gendered citation imbalance. Additionally, understanding how network properties in citations influence citation imbalances remains challenging due to a lack of suitable reference models. In this paper, we develop a family of reference models for citation networks and investigate gender imbalance in citations between papers published in computer science conferences. By deploying these reference models, we found that homophily in citations is strongly associated with gendered citation imbalance in computer science, whereas heterogeneity in the number of citations received per paper has a relatively minor association with it. Furthermore, we found that the gendered citation imbalance is most pronounced in papers published in the highest-ranked conferences, is present across different subfields, and extends to citation-based rankings of papers. Our study provides a framework for investigating associations between network properties and citation imbalances, aiming to enhance our understanding of the structure and dynamics of citations between research publications.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
