Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: On the Role of Communications for Space Domain Awareness\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Space Domain Awareness (SDA) has become increasingly vital with the rapid growth of commercial space activities and the expansion of New Space. This paper stresses the necessity of transitioning from centralized to distributed SDA architectures. The current architecture predominantly relies on individual downhaul, which we propose to transition to on-orbit distribution. Our results demonstrate that the individual downhaul architecture does not scale efficiently with the increasing number of nodes, while on-orbit distribution offers significant improvements. By comparing the centralized architecture with the proposed distributed architecture, we highlight the advantages of enhanced coverage and resilience. Our findings show that on-orbit distribution greatly outperforms individual downhaul in terms of latency and scalability. Specifically, the latency results for on-orbit distribution are substantially lower and more consistent, even as the number of satellites increases. In addition, we address the inherent challenges associated with on-orbit distribution architecture, particularly cybersecurity concerns. We focus on link security to ensure the availability and integrity of data transmission in these advanced SDA systems. Future expectations include further refinement of on-orbit distribution strategies and the development of robust cybersecurity measures to support the scalability and resilience of SDA systems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
