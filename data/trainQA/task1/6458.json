      "content": "Paper Title: Quantitative Stock Investment by Routing Uncertainty-Aware Trading Experts: A Multi-Task Learning Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Quantitative investment is a fundamental financial task that highly relies on accurate stock prediction and profitable investment decision making. Despite recent advances in deep learning (DL) have shown stellar performance on capturing trading opportunities in the stochastic stock market, we observe that the performance of existing DL methods is sensitive to random seeds and network initialization. To design more profitable DL methods, we analyze this phenomenon and find two major limitations of existing works. First, there is a noticeable gap between accurate financial predictions and profitable investment strategies. Second, investment decisions are made based on only one individual predictor without consideration of model uncertainty, which is inconsistent with the workflow in real-world trading firms. To tackle these two limitations, we first reformulate quantitative investment as a multi-task learning problem. Later on, we propose AlphaMix, a novel two-stage mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for quantitative investment to mimic the efficient bottom-up trading strategy design workflow of successful trading firms. In Stage one, multiple independent trading experts are jointly optimized with an individual uncertainty-aware loss function. In Stage two, we train neural routers (corresponding to the role of a portfolio manager) to dynamically deploy these experts on an as-needed basis. AlphaMix is also a universal framework that is applicable to various backbone network architectures with consistent performance gains. Through extensive experiments on long-term real-world data spanning over five years on two of the most influential financial markets (US and China), we demonstrate that AlphaMix significantly outperforms many state-of-the-art baselines in terms of four financial criteria. Furthermore, we analyze the contributions of each component in AlphaMix with a series of exploratory and ablative studies. Our data and source code are publicly available 111https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AlphaMix-C767/.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
