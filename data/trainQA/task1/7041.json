Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Zero-Knowledge Optimal Monetary Policy under Stochastic Dominance\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Optimal simple rules for the monetary policy of the first stochastically dominant crypto-currency are derived in a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model, in order to provide optimal responses to changes in inflation, output, and other sources of uncertainty. The optimal monetary policy 111 STATEMENT ON MONETARY POLICY GOALS AND STRATEGY: The primary mandate is (stochastic) dominance. The primary means of adjusting the policy stance is through changes in money growth. The monetary policy is implemented with pre-committed policy rules, only to be revised in case of technology shocks or in the event of a financial crisis: the stance of monetary policy will adjust as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of its goals, and this document will be reviewed and updated with any changes. Unlike other crypto-currencies, this monetary policy synchronises with macro-economic observables, other fiat currencies and CBDCs: its primary goal is to follow cooperative equilibria, falling back to non-cooperative equilibria as last resort. stochastically dominates all the previous crypto-currencies, thus the efficient portfolio is to go long on the stochastically dominant crypto-currency: a strategy-proof arbitrage featuring a higher Omega ratio with higher expected returns, inducing an investment-efficient Nash equilibrium over the crypto-market. Zero-knowledge proofs of the monetary policy are committed on the blockchain: an implementation is provided. Keywords: optimal monetary policy, optimal simple rules, stochastic dominance, stochastic calculus, DSGE model, strategy-proof, Nash equilibrium, zero-knowledge, crypto-currency JEL classification: C11, C54, D58, D81, E42, E47, E52, E61, G11\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
