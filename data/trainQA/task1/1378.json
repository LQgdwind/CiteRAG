Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Differentially Private Multi-Agent Planning for Logistic-like Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Planning is one of the main approaches used to improve agentsâ€™ working efficiency by making plans beforehand. However, during planning, agents face the risk of having their private information leaked. This paper proposes a novel strong privacy-preserving planning approach for logistic-like problems. This approach outperforms existing approaches by addressing two challenges: 1) simultaneously achieving strong privacy, completeness and efficiency, and 2) addressing communication constraints. These two challenges are prevalent in many real-world applications including logistics in military environments and packet routing in networks. To tackle these two challenges, our approach adopts the differential privacy technique, which can both guarantee strong privacy and control communication overhead. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to apply differential privacy to the field of multi-agent planning as a means of preserving the privacy of agents for logistic-like problems. We theoretically prove the strong privacy and completeness of our approach and empirically demonstrate its efficiency. We also theoretically analyze the communication overhead of our approach and illustrate how differential privacy can be used to control it.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
