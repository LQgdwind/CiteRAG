Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Heterogeneous-Branch Collaborative Learning for Dialogue Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract With the development of deep learning, advanced dialogue generation methods usually require a greater amount of computational resources. One promising approach to obtaining a high-performance and lightweight model is knowledge distillation, which relies heavily on the pre-trained powerful teacher. Collaborative learning, also known as online knowledge distillation, is an effective way to conduct one-stage group distillation in the absence of a well-trained large teacher model. However, previous work has a severe branch homogeneity problem due to the same training objective and the independent identical training sets. To alleviate this problem, we consider the dialogue attributes in the training of network branches. Each branch learns the attribute-related features based on the selected subset. Furthermore, we propose a dual group-based knowledge distillation method, consisting of positive distillation and negative distillation, to further diversify the features of different branches in a steadily and interpretable way. The proposed approach significantly improves branch heterogeneity and outperforms state-of-the-art collaborative learning methods on two widely used open-domain dialogue datasets.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
