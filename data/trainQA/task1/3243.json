Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Multi-Agent Minimal-Capacity Planning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study the problem of minimizing the resource capacity of autonomous agents cooperating to achieve a shared task. More specifically, we consider high-level planning for a team of homogeneous agents that operate under resource constraints in stochastic environments and share a common goal: given a set of target locations, ensure that each location will be visited infinitely often by some agent almost surely. We formalize the dynamics of agents by consumption Markov decision processes. In a consumption Markov decision process, the agent has a resource of limited capacity. Each action of the agent may consume some amount of the resource. To avoid exhaustion, the agent can replenish its resource to full capacity in designated reload states. The resource capacity restricts the capabilities of the agent. The objective is to assign target locations to agents, and each agent is only responsible for visiting the assigned subset of target locations repeatedly. Moreover, the assignment must ensure that the agents can carry out their tasks with minimal resource capacity. We reduce the problem of finding target assignments for a team of agents with the lowest possible capacity to an equivalent graph-theoretical problem. We develop an algorithm that solves this graph problem in time that is polynomial in the number of agents, target locations, and size of the consumption Markov decision process. We demonstrate the applicability and scalability of the algorithm in a scenario where hundreds of unmanned underwater vehicles monitor hundreds of locations in environments with stochastic ocean currents.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
