Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Differentiable Geodesic Distance for Intrinsic Minimization on Triangle Meshes\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Computing intrinsic distances on discrete surfaces is at the heart of many minimization problems in geometry processing and beyond. Solving these problems is extremely challenging as it demands the computation of on-surface distances along with their derivatives. We present a novel approach for intrinsic minimization of distance-based objectives defined on triangle meshes. Using a variational formulation of shortest-path geodesics, we compute first and second-order distance derivatives based on the implicit function theorem, thus opening the door to efficient Newton-type minimization solvers. We demonstrate our differentiable geodesic distance framework on a wide range of examples, including geodesic networks and membranes on surfaces of arbitrary genus, two-way coupling between hosting surface and embedded system, differentiable geodesic Voronoi diagrams, and efficient computation of Karcher means on complex shapes. Our analysis shows that second-order descent methods based on our differentiable geodesics outperform existing first-order and quasi-Newton methods by large margins.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
