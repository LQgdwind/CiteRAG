Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Temporal Multiresolution Graph Neural Networks For Epidemic Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we introduce Temporal Multiresolution Graph Neural Networks (TMGNN), the first architecture that both learns to construct the multiscale and multiresolution graph structures and incorporates the time-series signals to capture the temporal changes of the dynamic graphs. We have applied our proposed model to the task of predicting future spreading of epidemic and pandemic based on the historical time-series data collected from the actual COVID-19 pandemic and chickenpox epidemic in several European countries, and have obtained competitive results in comparison to other previous state-of-the-art temporal architectures and graph learning algorithms. We have shown that capturing the multiscale and multiresolution structures of graphs is important to extract either local or global information that play a critical role in understanding the dynamic of a global pandemic such as COVID-19 which started from a local city and spread to the whole world. Our work brings a promising research direction in forecasting and mitigating future epidemics and pandemics.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
