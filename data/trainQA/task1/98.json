      "content": "Paper Title: Reservoir computing model of two-dimensional turbulent convection\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Reservoir computing is an efficient implementation of a recurrent neural network that can describe the evolution of a dynamical system by supervised machine learning without solving the underlying mathematical equations. In this work, reservoir computing is applied to model the large-scale evolution and the resulting low-order turbulence statistics of a two-dimensional turbulent Rayleigh-Bénard convection flow at a Rayleigh number Ra=107Rasuperscript107{\\rm Ra}=10^{7} and a Prandtl number Pr=7Pr7{\\rm Pr}=7 in an extended spatial domain with an aspect ratio of 6. Our data-driven approach which is based on a long-term direct numerical simulation of the convection flow comprises a two-step procedure. (1) Reduction of the original simulation data by a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) snapshot analysis and subsequent truncation to the first 150 POD modes which are associated with the largest total energy amplitudes. (2) Setup and optimization of a reservoir computing model to describe the dynamical evolution of these 150 degrees of freedom and thus the large-scale evolution of the convection flow. The quality of the prediction of the reservoir computing model is comprehensively tested by a direct comparison of the results of the original direct numerical simulations and the fields that are reconstructed by means of the POD modes. We find a good agreement of the vertical profiles of mean temperature, mean convective heat flux, and root mean square temperature fluctuations. In addition, we discuss temperature variance spectra and joint probability density functions of the turbulent vertical velocity component and temperature fluctuation the latter of which is essential for the turbulent heat transport across the layer. At the core of the model is the reservoir, a very large sparse random network characterized by the spectral radius of the corresponding adjacency matrix and a few further hyperparameters which are varied to investigate the quality of the prediction. Our work demonstrates that the reservoir computing model is capable to model the large-scale structure and low-order statistics of turbulent convection which can open new avenues for modeling mesoscale convection processes in larger circulation models.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
