Eickhoff, D. Duncan, “Unsupervised Multivariate Time-Series Transformers for Seizure Identification on EEG”, IEEE Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA) 2022, DOI 10.1109/ICMLA55696.2022.00208. Work was performed at University of Southern California and supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) grant R01NS111744. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/ilkyyldz95/EEG_MVTS.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, typically observed via seizure episodes. Epileptic seizures are commonly monitored through electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings due to their routine and low expense collection. The stochastic nature of EEG makes seizure identification via manual inspections performed by highly-trained experts a tedious endeavor, motivating the use of automated identification. The literature on automated identification focuses mostly on supervised learning methods requiring expert labels of EEG segments that contain seizures, which are difficult to obtain. Motivated by these observations, we pose seizure identification as an unsupervised anomaly detection problem. To this end, we employ the first unsupervised transformer-based model for seizure identification on raw EEG. We train an autoencoder involving a transformer encoder via an unsupervised loss function, incorporating a novel masking strategy uniquely designed for multivariate time-series data such as EEG. Training employs EEG recordings that do not contain any seizures, while seizures are identified with respect to reconstruction errors at inference time. We evaluate our method on three publicly available benchmark EEG datasets for distinguishing seizure vs. non-seizure windows. Our method leads to significantly better seizure identification performance than supervised learning counterparts, by up to 16%percent1616\\% recall, 9%percent99\\% accuracy, and 9%percent99\\% Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC), establishing particular benefits on highly imbalanced data. Through accurate seizure identification, our method could facilitate widely accessible and early detection of epilepsy development, without needing expensive label collection or manual feature extraction.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
