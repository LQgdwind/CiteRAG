      "content": "Paper Title: A Graph-Based Context-Aware Model to Understand Online Conversations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Online forums that allow for participatory engagement between users have been transformative for the public discussion of many important issues. However, such conversations can sometimes escalate into full-blown exchanges of hate and misinformation. Existing approaches in natural language processing (NLP), such as deep learning models for classification tasks, use as inputs only a single comment or a pair of comments depending upon whether the task concerns the inference of properties of the individual comments or the replies between pairs of comments, respectively. But in online conversations, comments and replies may be based on external context beyond the immediately relevant information that is input to the model. Therefore, being aware of the conversations‚Äô surrounding contexts should improve the model‚Äôs performance for the inference task at hand. We propose GraphNLI111This paper is an extended version of (Agarwal et al., 2022) published in The ACM Web Conference 2022., a novel graph-based deep learning architecture that uses graph walks to incorporate the wider context of a conversation in a principled manner. Specifically, a graph walk starts from a given comment and samples ‚Äúnearby‚Äù comments in the same or parallel conversation threads, which results in additional embeddings that are aggregated together with the initial comment‚Äôs embedding. We then use these enriched embeddings for downstream NLP prediction tasks that are important for online conversations. We evaluate GraphNLI on two such tasks - polarity prediction and misogynistic hate speech detection - and found that our model consistently outperforms all relevant baselines for both tasks. Specifically, GraphNLI with a biased root-seeking random walk performs with a macro-F1subscriptùêπ1F_{1} score of 333 and 666 percentage points better than the best-performing BERT-based baselines for the polarity prediction and hate speech detection tasks, respectively. We also perform extensive ablative experiments and hyperparameter searches to understand the efficacy of GraphNLI. This demonstrates the potential of context-aware models to capture the global context along with the local context of online conversations for these two tasks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
