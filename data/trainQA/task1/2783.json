Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Structured Scene Memory for Vision-Language Navigation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recently, numerous algorithms have been developed to tackle the problem of vision-language navigation (VLN), i.e., entailing an agent to navigate 3D environments through followingabsent{}_{\\!} linguisticabsent{}_{\\!} instructions.absent{}_{\\!} However,absent{}_{\\!} currentabsent{}_{\\!} VLNabsent{}_{\\!} agents simply store their past experiences/observations as latent states in recurrent networks, failing to capture environment layouts and make long-term planning. To address these limitations, we propose a crucial architecture, called Structured Scene Memory (SSM). It is compartmentalized enough to accurately memorize the percepts during navigation. It also serves as a structured scene representation, which captures and disentangles visual and geometric cues in the environment. SSM has a collect-read controller that adaptively collects information for supporting current decision making and mimics iterative algorithms for long-range reasoning. As SSM provides a complete action space, i.e., all the navigable places on the map, a frontier-exploration based navigation decision making strategy is introduced to enable efficient and global planning. Experiment results on two VLN datasets (i.e., R2R and R4R) show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several metrics.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
