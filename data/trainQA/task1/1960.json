Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Semi-supervised Federated Learning for Activity Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Training deep learning models on in-home IoT sensory data is commonly used to recognise human activities. Recently, federated learning systems that use edge devices as clients to support local human activity recognition have emerged as a new paradigm to combine local (individual-level) and global (group-level) models. This approach provides better scalability and generalisability and also offers better privacy compared with the traditional centralised analysis and learning models. The assumption behind federated learning, however, relies on supervised learning on clients. This requires a large volume of labelled data, which is difficult to collect in uncontrolled IoT environments such as remote in-home monitoring. In this paper, we propose an activity recognition system that uses semi-supervised federated learning, wherein clients conduct unsupervised learning on autoencoders with unlabelled local data to learn general representations, and a cloud server conducts supervised learning on an activity classifier with labelled data. Our experimental results show that using a long short-term memory autoencoder and a Softmax classifier, the accuracy of our proposed system is higher than that of both centralised systems and semi-supervised federated learning using data augmentation. The accuracy is also comparable to that of supervised federated learning systems. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that our system can reduce the number of needed labels and the size of local models, and has faster local activity recognition speed than supervised federated learning does.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
