      "content": "Paper Title: Rethinking Model-based, Policy-based, and Value-based Reinforcement Learning via the Lens of Representation Complexity\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Reinforcement Learning (RL) encompasses diverse paradigms, including model-based RL, policy-based RL, and value-based RL, each tailored to approximate the model, optimal policy, and optimal value function, respectively. This work investigates the potential hierarchy of representation complexity ‚Äî the complexity of functions to be represented ‚Äî among these RL paradigms. We first demonstrate that, for a broad class of Markov decision processes (MDPs), the model can be represented by constant-depth circuits with polynomial size or Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with constant layers and polynomial hidden dimension. However, the representation of the optimal policy and optimal value proves to be ùñ≠ùñØùñ≠ùñØ\\mathsf{NP}-complete and unattainable by constant-layer MLPs with polynomial size. This demonstrates a significant representation complexity gap between model-based RL and model-free RL, which includes policy-based RL and value-based RL. To further explore the representation complexity hierarchy between policy-based RL and value-based RL, we introduce another general class of MDPs where both the model and optimal policy can be represented by constant-depth circuits with polynomial size or constant-layer MLPs with polynomial size. In contrast, representing the optimal value is ùñØùñØ\\mathsf{P}-complete and intractable via a constant-layer MLP with polynomial hidden dimension. This accentuates the intricate representation complexity associated with value-based RL compared to policy-based RL. In summary, we unveil a potential representation complexity hierarchy within RL ‚Äî representing the model emerges as the easiest task, followed by the optimal policy, while representing the optimal value function presents the most intricate challenge.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
