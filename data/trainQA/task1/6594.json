Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: AdaCat: Adaptive Categorical Discretization for Autoregressive Models\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Autoregressive generative models can estimate complex continuous data distributions, like trajectory rollouts in an RL environment, image intensities, and audio. Most state-of-the-art models discretize continuous data into several bins and use categorical distributions over the bins to approximate the continuous data distribution. The advantage is that the categorical distribution can easily express multiple modes and are straightforward to optimize. However, such approximation cannot express sharp changes in density without using significantly more bins, making it parameter inefficient. We propose an efficient, expressive, multimodal parameterization called Adaptive Categorical Discretization (AdaCat). AdaCat discretizes each dimension of an autoregressive model adaptively, which allows the model to allocate density to fine intervals of interest, improving parameter efficiency. AdaCat generalizes both categoricals and quantile-based regression. AdaCat is a simple add-on to any discretization-based distribution estimator. In experiments, AdaCat improves density estimation for real-world tabular data, images, audio, and trajectories, and improves planning in model-based offline RL.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
