      "content": "Paper Title: Lower bound for the ùëá count via unitary stabilizer nullity\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We introduce magic measures to quantify the nonstabilizerness of multiqubit quantum gates and establish lower bounds on the TùëáT count for fault-tolerant quantum computation. First, we introduce the stabilizer nullity of multi-qubit unitary, which is based on the subgroup of the quotient Pauli group associated with the unitary. This unitary stabilizer nullity extends the state-stabilizer nullity by Beverland et al. to a dynamic version. In particular, we show this nonstabilizerness measure has desirable properties such as subadditivity under composition and additivity under tensor product. Second, we prove that a given unitary‚Äôs stabilizer nullity is a lower bound for the TùëáT count, utilizing the above properties in gate synthesis. Third, we compare the state- and the unitary-stabilizer nullity, proving that the lower bounds for the TùëáT count obtained by the unitary-stabilizer nullity are never less than the state-stabilizer nullity. Moreover, we show an explicit nùëõn-qubit unitary family of unitary-stabilizer nullity 2‚Äãn2ùëõ2n, which implies that its TùëáT count is at least 2‚Äãn2ùëõ2n. This gives an example where the bounds derived by the unitary-stabilizer nullity strictly outperform the state-stabilizer nullity by a factor of 222. We finally showcase the advantages of unitary-stabilizer nullity in estimating the TùëáT count of quantum gates with interests.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
