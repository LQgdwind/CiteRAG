      "content": "Paper Title: Optimal Assistance for Object-Rearrangement Tasks in Augmented Reality\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Augmented-reality (AR) glasses—which will have access to real-time, high-fidelity data regarding a user’s environment via onboard sensors, as well as an ability to seamlessly display real-time information to the user—present a unique opportunity to provide users with assistance in completing quotidian tasks. Many such tasks—such as house cleaning, packing for a trip, or organizing a living space—can be characterized as object-rearrangement tasks defined by users navigating through an environment, picking up objects, and placing them in different locations. We introduce a novel framework for computing and displaying AR assistance that consists of (1) associating an optimal action sequence with the policy of an embodied agent and (2) presenting this optimal action sequence to the user as suggestion notifications in the AR system’s heads-up display. The embodied agent comprises a ‘hybrid’ between the AR system and the user, in that it has the observation space (i.e., sensor measurements) of the AR system and the action space (i.e., task-execution actions) of the user; its policy is learned by minimizing the the time to complete the task. In this initial study, we assume that the AR system’s observations include a map of the environment and real-time localization of the objects and user within that map. These modeling choices allow us to formalize the problem of computing AR assistance for any object-rearrangement task as a planning problem that reduces to solving a capacitated vehicle-routing problem (CVRP), which is a variant of the classical traveling salesman problem (TSP) in combinatorial optimization. In addition, we introduce a novel AR simulator that can enable web-based evaluation of AR-like assistance and associated large-scale data collection; our approach is based on the Habitat (Savva et al., 2019) simulator for embodied artificial intelligence (AI). Finally, we perform a study that evaluates how users respond to the AR assistance generated by the proposed framework on a specific quotidian object-rearrangement task—house cleaning—using our proposed AR simulator. We perform the study at scale using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) (Amazon, [n.d.]) and collect data using psiTurk (Gureckis et al., 2016). In particular, we study the effect of our proposed AR assistance on users’ task performance and sense of agency over a range of task difficulties. Our results indicate that providing users with the proposed form of AR assistance improves the user’s overall performance. Additionally, we show that while users report a negative impact to their agency, that they may prefer this when presented with a system that aides them in task completion.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
