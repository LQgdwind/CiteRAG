Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Hardware-Aware Heuristic for the Qubit Mapping Problem in the NISQ Era\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Due to several physical limitations in the realisation of quantum hardware, today‚Äôs quantum computers are qualified as Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware. NISQ hardware is characterized by a small number of qubits (505050 to a few hundred) and noisy operations. Moreover, current realisations of superconducting quantum chips do not have the ideal all-to-all connectivity between qubits but rather at most a nearest-neighbour connectivity. All these hardware restrictions add supplementary low-level requirements. They need to be addressed before submitting the quantum circuit to an actual chip. Satisfying these requirements is a tedious task for the programmer. Instead, the task of adapting the quantum circuit to a given hardware is left to the compiler. In this paper, we propose a Hardware-Aware mapping transition algorithm (HA) that takes the calibration data into account with the aim to improve the overall fidelity of the circuit. Evaluation results on IBM quantum hardware show that our HA approach can outperform the state of the art both in terms of the number of additional gates and circuit fidelity.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
