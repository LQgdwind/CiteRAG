Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Bregman Divergence for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep Bregman divergence measures divergence of data points using neural networks which is beyond Euclidean distance and capable of capturing divergence over distributions. In this paper, we propose deep Bregman divergences for contrastive learning of visual representation where we aim to enhance contrastive loss used in self-supervised learning by training additional networks based on functional Bregman divergence. In contrast to the conventional contrastive learning methods which are solely based on divergences between single points, our framework can capture the divergence between distributions which improves the quality of learned representation. We show the combination of conventional contrastive loss and our proposed divergence loss outperforms baseline and most of the previous methods for self-supervised and semi-supervised learning on multiple classifications and object detection tasks and datasets. Moreover, the learned representations generalize well when transferred to the other datasets and tasks. The source code and our models are available in supplementary and will be released with paper.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
