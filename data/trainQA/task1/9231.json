      "content": "Paper Title: Knowledge Transfer-Driven Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to continually learn new classes using a few samples while not forgetting the old classes. The key of this task is effective knowledge transfer from the base session to the incremental sessions. Despite the advance of existing FSCIL methods, the proposed knowledge transfer learning schemes are sub-optimal due to the insufficient optimization for the model’s plasticity. To address this issue, we propose a Random Episode Sampling and Augmentation (RESA) strategy that relies on diverse pseudo incremental tasks as agents to achieve the knowledge transfer. Concretely, RESA mimics the real incremental setting and constructs pseudo incremental tasks globally and locally, where the global pseudo incremental tasks are designed to coincide with the learning objective of FSCIL and the local pseudo incremental tasks are designed to improve the model’s plasticity, respectively. Furthermore, to make convincing incremental predictions, we introduce a complementary model with a squared Euclidean-distance classifier as the auxiliary module, which couples with the widely used cosine classifier to form our whole architecture. By such a way, equipped with model decoupling strategy, we can maintain the model’s stability while enhancing the model’s plasticity. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on three popular FSCIL benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method, named Knowledge Transfer-driven Relation Complementation Network (KT-RCNet), outperforms almost all prior methods. More precisely, the average accuracy of our proposed KT-RCNet outperforms the second-best method by a margin of 5.26%percent\\%, 3.49%percent\\%, and 2.25%percent\\% on miniImageNet, CIFAR100, and CUB200, respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/YeZiLaiXi/KT-RCNet.git.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
