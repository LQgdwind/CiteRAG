Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: On-Device Learning with Cloud-Coordinated Data Augmentation for Extreme Model Personalization in Recommender Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Data heterogeneity is an intrinsic property of recommender systems, making models trained over the global data on the cloud, which is the mainstream in industry, non-optimal to each individual user’s local data distribution. To deal with data heterogeneity, model personalization with on-device learning is a potential solution. However, on-device training using a user’s small size of local samples will incur severe overfitting and undermine the model’s generalization ability. In this work, we propose a new device-cloud collaborative learning framework, called CoDA, to break the dilemmas of purely cloud-based learning and on-device learning. The key principle of CoDA is to retrieve similar samples from the cloud’s global pool to augment each user’s local dataset to train the recommendation model. Specifically, after a coarse-grained sample matching on the cloud, a personalized sample classifier is further trained on each device for a fine-grained sample filtering, which can learn the boundary between the local data distribution and the outside data distribution. We also build an end-to-end pipeline to support the flows of data, model, computation, and control between the cloud and each device. We have deployed CoDA in a recommendation scenario of Mobile Taobao. Online A/B testing results show the remarkable performance improvement of CoDA over both cloud-based learning without model personalization and on-device training without data augmentation. Overhead testing on a real device demonstrates the computation, storage, and communication efficiency of the on-device tasks in CoDA.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
