Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Rethinking Momentum Knowledge Distillation in Online Continual Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Online Continual Learning (OCL) addresses the problem of training neural networks on a continuous data stream where multiple classification tasks emerge in sequence. In contrast to offline Continual Learning, data can be seen only once in OCL. In this context, replay-based strategies have achieved impressive results and most state-of-the-art approaches are heavily depending on them. While Knowledge Distillation (KD) has been extensively used in offline Continual Learning, it remains under-exploited in OCL, despite its potential. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the challenges in applying KD to OCL. We introduce a direct yet effective methodology for applying Momentum Knowledge Distillation (MKD) to many flagship OCL methods and demonstrate its capabilities to enhance existing approaches. In addition to improving existing state-of-the-arts accuracy by more than 10%percent1010\\% points on ImageNet100, we shed light on MKD internal mechanics and impacts during training in OCL. We argue that similar to replay, MKD should be considered a central component of OCL.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
