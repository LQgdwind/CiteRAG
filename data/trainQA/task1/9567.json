      "content": "Paper Title: A Memory-Augmented Multi-Task Collaborative Framework for Unsupervised Traffic Accident Detection in Driving Videos\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Identifying traffic accidents in driving videos is crucial to ensuring the safety of autonomous driving and driver assistance systems. To address the potential danger caused by the long-tailed distribution of driving events, existing traffic accident detection (TAD) methods mainly rely on unsupervised learning. However, TAD is still challenging due to the rapid movement of cameras and dynamic scenes in driving scenarios. Existing unsupervised TAD methods mainly rely on a single pretext task, i.e., an appearance-based or future object localization task, to detect accidents. However, appearance-based approaches are easily disturbed by the rapid movement of the camera and changes in illumination, which significantly reduce the performance of traffic accident detection. Methods based on future object localization may fail to capture appearance changes in video frames, making it difficult to detect ego-involved accidents (e.g., out of control of the ego-vehicle). In this paper, we propose a novel memory-augmented multi-task collaborative framework (MAMTCF) for unsupervised traffic accident detection in driving videos. Different from previous approaches, our method can more accurately detect both ego-involved and non-ego accidents by simultaneously modeling appearance changes and object motions in video frames through the collaboration of optical flow reconstruction and future object localization tasks. Further, we introduce a memory-augmented motion representation mechanism to fully explore the interrelation between different types of motion representations and exploit the high-level features of normal traffic patterns stored in memory to augment motion representations, thus enlarging the difference from anomalies. Experimental results on recently published large-scale dataset demonstrate that our method achieves better performance compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
