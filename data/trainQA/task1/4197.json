Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

This work was supported by the Spanish MINECO under contract TEC2017-90034-C2-1-R (ALLIANCE), the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA) and the Secretariat for Universities and Research of the Ministry of Business and Knowledge of the Government of Catalonia as well as the European Social Fund.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Traffic Engineering (TE) is a basic building block of the Internet. In this paper, we analyze whether modern Machine Learning (ML) methods are ready to be used for TE optimization. We address this open question through a comparative analysis between the state of the art in ML and the state of the art in TE. To this end, we first present a novel distributed system for TE that leverages the latest advancements in ML. Our system implements a novel architecture that combines Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to minimize network congestion. In our evaluation, we compare our MARL+GNN system with DEFO, a network optimizer based on Constraint Programming that represents the state of the art in TE. Our experimental results show that the proposed MARL+GNN solution achieves equivalent performance to DEFO in a wide variety of network scenarios including three real-world network topologies. At the same time, we show that MARL+GNN can achieve significant reductions in execution time (from the scale of minutes with DEFO to a few seconds with our solution).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
