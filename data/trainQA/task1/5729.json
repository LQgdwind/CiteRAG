Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Transfer Attacks Revisited: A Large-Scale Empirical Study in Real Computer Vision Settings\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract One intriguing property of adversarial attacks is their ‚Äútransferability‚Äù ‚Äì an adversarial example crafted with respect to one deep neural network (DNN) model is often found effective against other DNNs as well. Intensive research has been conducted on this phenomenon under simplistic controlled conditions. Yet, thus far there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding about transferability-based attacks (‚Äútransfer attacks‚Äù) in real-world environments. To bridge this critical gap, we conduct the first large-scale systematic empirical study of transfer attacks against major cloud-based MLaaS platforms, taking the components of a real transfer attack into account. The study leads to a number of interesting findings which are inconsistent to the existing ones, including: (i) Simple surrogates do not necessarily improve real transfer attacks. (ii) No dominant surrogate architecture is found in real transfer attacks. (iii) It is the gap between posterior (output of the softmax layer) rather than the gap between logit (so-called Œ∫ùúÖ\\kappa value) that increases transferability. Moreover, by comparing with prior works, we demonstrate that transfer attacks possess many previously unknown properties in real-world environments, such as (i) Model similarity is not a well-defined concept. (ii) L2subscriptùêø2L_{2} norm of perturbation can generate high transferability without usage of gradient and is a more powerful source than L‚àûsubscriptùêøL_{\\infty} norm. We believe this work sheds light on the vulnerabilities of popular MLaaS platforms and points to a few promising research directions. 111Code & Results: https://github.com/AlgebraLoveme/Transfer-Attacks-Revisited-A-Large-Scale-Empirical-Study-in-Real-Computer-Vision-Settings\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
