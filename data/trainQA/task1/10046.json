      "content": "Paper Title: On the Pauli Spectrum of 𝖰𝖠𝖢⁰\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The circuit class 𝖰𝖠𝖢0superscript𝖰𝖠𝖢0\\mathsf{QAC}^{0} was introduced by Moore (1999) as a model for constant depth quantum circuits where the gate set includes many-qubit Toffoli gates. Proving lower bounds against such circuits is a longstanding challenge in quantum circuit complexity; in particular, showing that polynomial-size 𝖰𝖠𝖢0superscript𝖰𝖠𝖢0\\mathsf{QAC}^{0} cannot compute the parity function has remained an open question for over 20 years. In this work, we identify a notion of the Pauli spectrum of 𝖰𝖠𝖢0superscript𝖰𝖠𝖢0\\mathsf{QAC}^{0} circuits, which can be viewed as the quantum analogue of the Fourier spectrum of classical 𝖠𝖢0superscript𝖠𝖢0\\mathsf{AC}^{0} circuits. We conjecture that the Pauli spectrum of 𝖰𝖠𝖢0superscript𝖰𝖠𝖢0\\mathsf{QAC}^{0} circuits satisfies low-degree concentration, in analogy to the famous Linial, Nisan, Mansour theorem on the low-degree Fourier concentration of 𝖠𝖢0superscript𝖠𝖢0\\mathsf{AC}^{0} circuits. If true, this conjecture immediately implies that polynomial-size 𝖰𝖠𝖢0superscript𝖰𝖠𝖢0\\mathsf{QAC}^{0} circuits cannot compute parity. We prove this conjecture for the class of depth-d𝑑d, polynomial-size 𝖰𝖠𝖢0superscript𝖰𝖠𝖢0\\mathsf{QAC}^{0} circuits with at most nO​(1/d)superscript𝑛𝑂1𝑑n^{O(1/d)} auxiliary qubits. We obtain new circuit lower bounds and learning results as applications: this class of circuits cannot correctly compute • the n𝑛n-bit parity function on more than (12+2−Ω​(n1/d))12superscript2Ωsuperscript𝑛1𝑑(\\frac{1}{2}+2^{-\\Omega(n^{1/d})})-fraction of inputs, and • the n𝑛n-bit majority function on more than (12+O​(n−1/4))12𝑂superscript𝑛14(\\frac{1}{2}+O(n^{-1/4}))-fraction of inputs. Additionally we show that this class of 𝖰𝖠𝖢0superscript𝖰𝖠𝖢0\\mathsf{QAC}^{0} circuits with limited auxiliary qubits can be learned with quasipolynomial sample complexity, giving the first learning result for 𝖰𝖠𝖢0superscript𝖰𝖠𝖢0\\mathsf{QAC}^{0} circuits. More broadly, our results add evidence that “Pauli-analytic” techniques can be a powerful tool in studying quantum circuits.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper.
