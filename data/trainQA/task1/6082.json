      "content": "Paper Title: AdaProp: Learning Adaptive Propagation for Graph Neural Network based Knowledge Graph Reasoning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Due to the popularity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), various GNN-based methods have been designed to reason on knowledge graphs (KGs). An important design component of GNN-based KG reasoning methods is called the propagation path, which contains a set of involved entities in each propagation step. Existing methods use hand-designed propagation paths, ignoring the correlation between the entities and the query relation. In addition, the number of involved entities will explosively grow at larger propagation steps. In this work, we are motivated to learn an adaptive propagation path in order to filter out irrelevant entities while preserving promising targets. First, we design an incremental sampling mechanism where the nearby targets and layer-wise connections can be preserved with linear complexity. Second, we design a learning-based sampling distribution to identify the semantically related entities. Extensive experiments show that our method is powerful, efficient and semantic-aware. The code is available at https://github.com/LARS-research/AdaProp.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 56\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
