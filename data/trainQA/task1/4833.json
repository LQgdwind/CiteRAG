      "content": "Paper Title: MHFormer: Multi-Hypothesis Transformer for 3D Human Pose Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Estimating 3D human poses from monocular videos is a challenging task due to depth ambiguity and self-occlusion. Most existing works attempt to solve both issues by exploiting spatial and temporal relationships. However, those works ignore the fact that it is an inverse problem where multiple feasible solutions (i.e., hypotheses) exist. To relieve this limitation, we propose a Multi-Hypothesis Transformer (MHFormer) that learns spatio-temporal representations of multiple plausible pose hypotheses. In order to effectively model multi-hypothesis dependencies and build strong relationships across hypothesis features, the task is decomposed into three stages: (i) Generate multiple initial hypothesis representations; (ii) Model self-hypothesis communication, merge multiple hypotheses into a single converged representation and then partition it into several diverged hypotheses; (iii) Learn cross-hypothesis communication and aggregate the multi-hypothesis features to synthesize the final 3D pose. Through the above processes, the final representation is enhanced and the synthesized pose is much more accurate. Extensive experiments show that MHFormer achieves state-of-the-art results on two challenging datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Without bells and whistles, its performance surpasses the previous best result by a large margin of 3% on Human3.6M. Code and models are available at https://github.com/Vegetebird/MHFormer.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 50\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
