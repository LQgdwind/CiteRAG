Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Resource Allocation in Multicore Elastic Optical Networks: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A deep reinforcement learning approach is applied, for the first time, to solve the routing, modulation, spectrum and core allocation (RMSCA) problem in dynamic multicore fiber elastic optical networks (MCF-EONs). To do so, a new environment - compatible with OpenAI’s Gym - was designed and implemented to emulate the operation of MCF-EONs. The new environment processes the agent actions (selection of route, core and spectrum slot) by considering the network state and physical-layer-related aspects. The latter includes the available modulation formats and their reach and the inter-core crosstalk (XT), an MCF-related impairment. If the resulting quality of the signal is acceptable, the environment allocates the resources selected by the agent. After processing the agent’s action, the environment is configured to give the agent a numerical reward and information about the new network state. The blocking performance of four different agents was compared through simulation to 3 baseline heuristics used in MCF-EONs. Results obtained for the NSFNet and COST239 network topologies show that the best-performing agent achieves, on average, up to a four-times decrease in blocking probability concerning the best-performing baseline heuristic methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
