Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Graphon Estimation in bipartite graphs with observable edge labels and unobservable node labels\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Many real-world data sets can be presented in the form of a matrix whose entries correspond to the interaction between two entities of different natures (the choice of a product by a customer, the number of times a web user visits a web page, a student‚Äôs grade in a subject, a patient‚Äôs rating of a doctor, etc.). We assume in this paper that the mentioned interaction is determined by unobservable latent variables describing each entity. Our objective is to estimate the conditional expectation of the data matrix given the unobservable variables. This is presented as a problem of estimation of a bivariate function referred to as graphon. We study the cases of piecewise constant and H√∂lder-continuous graphons. We establish finite sample risk bounds for the least squares estimator and the exponentially weighted aggregate. These bounds highlight the dependence of the estimation error on the size of the data set, the maximum intensity of the interactions, and the level of noise. As the analyzed least-squares estimator is intractable, we propose an adaptation of Lloyd‚Äôs alternating minimization algorithm to compute an approximation of the least-squares estimator. Finally, we present numerical experiments in order to illustrate the empirical performance of the graphon estimator on synthetic data sets.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
