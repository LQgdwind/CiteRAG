Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 63 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer.

      "content": "Paper Title: Realizability of Subgroups by Subshifts of Finite Type\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study the problem of realizing families of subgroups as the set of stabilizers of configurations from a subshift of finite type (SFT). This problem generalizes both the existence of strongly and weakly aperiodic SFTs. We show that a finitely generated normal subgroup is realizable if and only if the quotient by the subgroup admits a strongly aperiodic SFT. We also show that if a subgroup is realizable, its subgroup membership problem must be decidable. The article also contains the introduction of periodically rigid groups, which are groups for which every weakly aperiodic subshift of finite type is strongly aperiodic. We conjecture that the only finitely generated periodically rigid groups are virtually ‚Ñ§‚Ñ§\\mathbb{Z} groups and torsion-free virtually ‚Ñ§2superscript‚Ñ§2\\mathbb{Z}^{2} groups. Finally, we show virtually nilpotent and polycyclic groups satisfy the conjecture. Keywords: Subshift of finite type, symbolic dynamics, realizability, aperiodic tilings.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 63 most likely reference titles for this paper.
