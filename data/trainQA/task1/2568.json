Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Bayesian Federated Learning Framework with Online Laplace Approximation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Federated learning (FL) allows multiple clients to collaboratively learn a globally shared model through cycles of model aggregation and local model training, without the need to share data. Most existing FL methods train local models separately on different clients, and then simply average their parameters to obtain a centralized model on the server side. However, these approaches generally suffer from large aggregation errors and severe local forgetting, which are particularly bad in heterogeneous data settings. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel FL framework that uses online Laplace approximation to approximate posteriors on both the client and server side. On the server side, a multivariate Gaussian product mechanism is employed to construct and maximize a global posterior, largely reducing the aggregation errors induced by large discrepancies between local models. On the client side, a prior loss that uses the global posterior probabilistic parameters delivered from the server is designed to guide the local training. Binding such learning constraints from other clients enables our method to mitigate local forgetting. Finally, we achieve state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks, clearly demonstrating the advantages of the proposed method.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
