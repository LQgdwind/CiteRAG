Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Real-time Cooperative Vehicle Coordination at Unsignalized Road Intersections\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Cooperative coordination at unsignalized road intersections, which aims to improve the driving safety and traffic throughput for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), has attracted increasing interests in recent years. However, most existing investigations either suffer from computational complexity or cannot harness the full potential of the road infrastructure. To this end, we first present a dedicated intersection coordination framework, where the involved vehicles hand over their control authorities and follow instructions from a centralized coordinator. Then a unified cooperative trajectory planning problem will be formulated to maximize the traffic throughput while ensuring driving safety. To address the key computational challenges in the real-world deployment, we reformulate this non-convex sequential decision-making problem into a model-free Markov Decision Process (MDP) and tackle it by devising a Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3)-based strategy in the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. Simulation and practical experiments show that the proposed strategy could achieve near-optimal performance in sub-static coordination scenarios and significantly improve the traffic throughput in the realistic continuous traffic flow. The most remarkable advantage is that our strategy could reduce the time complexity of computation to milliseconds, and is shown scalable when the road lanes increase.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
