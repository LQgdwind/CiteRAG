Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Perceptually Validated Precise Local Editing for Facial Action Units with StyleGAN\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The ability to edit facial expressions has a wide range of applications in computer graphics. The ideal facial expression editing algorithm needs to satisfy two important criteria. First, it should allow precise and targeted editing of individual facial actions. Second, it should generate high fidelity outputs without artifacts. We build a solution based on StyleGAN [18], which has been used extensively for semantic manipulation of faces. As we do so, we add to our understanding of how various semantic attributes are encoded in StyleGAN. In particular, we show that a naive strategy to perform editing in the latent space results in undesired coupling between certain action units, even if they are conceptually distinct. For example, although brow lowerer and lip tightener are distinct action units, they appear correlated in the training data. Hence, StyleGAN has difficulty in disentangling them. We allow disentangled editing of such action units by computing detached regions of influence for each action unit, and restrict editing to these regions. We validate the effectiveness of our local editing method through perception experiments conducted with 23 subjects. The results show that our method provides higher control over local editing and produces images with superior fidelity compared to the state-of-the-art methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
