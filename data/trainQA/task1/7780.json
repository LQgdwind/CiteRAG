      "content": "Paper Title: Solving Quantum-Inspired Perfect Matching Problems via Tutte’s Theorem-Based Hybrid Boolean Constraints The author list has been sorted alphabetically by last name; this should not be used to determine the extent of authors’ contributions.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Determining the satisfiability of Boolean constraint-satisfaction problems with different types of constraints, that is hybrid constraints, is a well-studied problem with important applications. We study a new application of hybrid Boolean constraints, which arises in quantum computing. The problem relates to constrained perfect matching in edge-colored graphs. While general-purpose hybrid constraint solvers can be powerful, we show that direct encodings of the constrained-matching problem as hybrid constraints scale poorly and special techniques are still needed. We propose a novel encoding based on Tutte’s Theorem in graph theory as well as optimization techniques. Empirical results demonstrate that our encoding, in suitable languages with advanced SAT solvers, scales significantly better than a number of competing approaches on constrained-matching benchmarks. Our study identifies the necessity of designing problem-specific encodings when applying powerful general-purpose constraint solvers.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
