Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: MAGIC: Learning Macro-Actions for Online POMDP Planning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is a principled general framework for robot decision making under uncertainty, but POMDP planning suffers from high computational complexity, when long-term planning is required. While temporally-extended macro-actions help to cut down the effective planning horizon and significantly improve computational efficiency, how do we acquire good macro-actions? This paper proposes Macro-Action Generator-Critic (MAGIC), which performs offline learning of macro-actions optimized for online POMDP planning. Specifically, MAGIC learns a macro-action generator end-to-end, using an online planner’s performance as the feedback. During online planning, the generator generates on the fly situation-aware macro-actions conditioned on the robot’s belief and the environment context. We evaluated MAGIC on several long-horizon planning tasks both in simulation and on a real robot. The experimental results show that the learned macro-actions offer significant benefits in online planning performance, compared with primitive actions and handcrafted macro-actions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
