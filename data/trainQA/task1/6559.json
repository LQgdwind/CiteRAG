      "content": "Paper Title: Multiscale nonlocal beam theory: An application of distributed-order fractional operators\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This study presents a comprehensive theoretical framework to simulate the response of multiscale nonlocal elastic beams. By employing distributed-order (DO) fractional operators with a fourth-order tensor as the strength-function, the framework can accurately capture anisotropic behavior of 2D heterogeneous beams with nonlocal effects localized across multiple scales. Building upon this general continuum theory and on the multiscale character of DO operators, a one-dimensional (1D) multiscale nonlocal Timoshenko model is also presented. This approach enables a significant model-order reduction without compromising the heterogeneous nonlocal description of the material, hence leading to an efficient and accurate multiscale nonlocal modeling approach. Both 1D and 2D approaches are applied to simulate the mechanical responses of nonlocal beams. The direct comparison of numerical simulations produced by either the DO or an integer-order fully-resolved model (used as ground truth) clearly illustrates the ability of the DO formulation to capture the effect of the microstructure on the macroscopic response. The assessment of the computational cost also indicates the superior efficiency of the proposed approach.
