      "content": "Paper Title: Adaptive structure evolution and biologically plausible synaptic plasticity for recurrent spiking neural networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The architecture design and multi-scale learning principles of the human brain that evolved over hundreds of millions of years are crucial to realizing human-like intelligence. Spiking Neural Network (SNN) based Liquid State Machine (LSM) serves as a suitable architecture to study brain-inspired intelligence because of its brain-inspired structure and the potential for integrating multiple biological principles. Existing researches on LSM focus on different certain perspectives, including high-dimensional encoding or optimization of the liquid layer, network architecture search, and application to hardware devices. There is still a lack of in-depth inspiration from the learning and structural evolution mechanism of the brain. Considering these limitations, this paper presents a novel LSM learning model that integrates adaptive structural evolution and multi-scale biological learning rules. For structural evolution, an adaptive evolvable LSM model is developed to optimize the neural architecture design of liquid layer with separation property. For brain-inspired learning of LSM, we propose a dopamine-modulated Bienenstock-Cooper-Munros (DA-BCM) method that incorporates global long-term dopamine regulation and local trace-based BCM synaptic plasticity. Comparative experimental results on different decision-making tasks show that introducing structural evolution of the liquid layer, and the DA-BCM regulation of the liquid layer and the readout layer could improve the decision-making ability of LSM and flexibly adapt to rule reversal. This work is committed to exploring how evolution can help to design more appropriate network architectures and how multi-scale neuroplasticity principles coordinated to enable the optimization and learning of LSMs for relatively complex decision-making tasks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
