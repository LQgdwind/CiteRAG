Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 65 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Frequently Co-cited Publications: Features and Kinetics\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Co-citation measurements can reveal the extent to which a concept representing a novel combination of existing ideas evolves towards a specialty. The strength of co-citation is represented by its frequency, which accumulates over time. Of interest is whether underlying features associated with the strength of co-citation can be identified. We use the proximal citation network for a given pair of articles (x,y)ùë•ùë¶(x,y) to compute Œ∏ùúÉ\\theta, an a priori estimate of the probability of co-citation between x and y, prior to their first co-citation.Thus, low values for Œ∏ùúÉ\\theta reflect pairs of articles for which co-citation is presumed less likely. We observe that co-citation frequencies are a composite of power-law and lognormal distributions, and that very high co-citation frequencies are more likely to be composed of pairs with low values of Œ∏ùúÉ\\theta, reflecting the impact of a novel combination of ideas. Furthermore, we note that the occurrence of a direct citation between two members of a co-cited pair increases with co-citation frequency. Finally, we identify cases of frequently co-cited publications that accumulate co-citations after an extended period of dormancy.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 65 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 65\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
