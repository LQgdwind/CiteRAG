Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: VeriDIP: Verifying Ownership of Deep Neural Networks through Privacy Leakage Fingerprints\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deploying Machine Learning as a Service gives rise to model plagiarism, leading to copyright infringement. Ownership testing techniques are designed to identify model fingerprints for verifying plagiarism. However, previous works often rely on overfitting or robustness features as fingerprints, lacking theoretical guarantees and exhibiting under-performance on generalized models. In this paper, we propose a novel ownership testing method called VeriDIP, which verifies a DNN model’s intellectual property. VeriDIP makes two major contributions. (1) It utilizes membership inference attacks to estimate the lower bound of privacy leakage, which reflects the fingerprint of a given model. The privacy leakage fingerprints highlight the unique patterns through which the models memorize sensitive training datasets. (2) We introduce a novel approach using less private samples to enhance the performance of ownership testing. Extensive experimental results confirm that VeriDIP is effective and efficient in validating the ownership of deep learning models trained on both image and tabular datasets. VeriDIP achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on image datasets while significantly reducing computation and communication costs. Enhanced VeriDIP demonstrates superior verification performance on generalized deep learning models, particularly on table-trained models. Additionally, VeriDIP exhibits similar effectiveness on utility-preserving differentially private models compared to non-differentially private baselines.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
