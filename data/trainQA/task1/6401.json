Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: An Additive Instance-Wise Approach to Multi-class Model Interpretation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Interpretable machine learning offers insights into what factors drive a certain prediction of a black-box system. A large number of interpreting methods focus on identifying explanatory input features, which generally fall into two main categories: attribution and selection. A popular attribution-based approach is to exploit local neighborhoods for learning instance-specific explainers in an additive manner. The process is thus inefficient and susceptible to poorly-conditioned samples. Meanwhile, many selection-based methods directly optimize local feature distributions in an instance-wise training framework, thereby being capable of leveraging global information from other inputs. However, they can only interpret single-class predictions and many suffer from inconsistency across different settings, due to a strict reliance on a pre-defined number of features selected. This work exploits the strengths of both methods and proposes a framework for learning local explanations simultaneously for multiple target classes. Our model explainer significantly outperforms additive and instance-wise counterparts on faithfulness with more compact and comprehensible explanations. We also demonstrate the capacity to select stable and important features through extensive experiments on various data sets and black-box model architectures.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
