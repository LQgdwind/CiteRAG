      "content": "Paper Title: Lower bounds for learning quantum states with single-copy measurements\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study the problems of quantum tomography and shadow tomography using measurements performed on individual, identical copies of an unknown dùëëd-dimensional state. We first revisit known lower bounds [HHJ+17] on quantum tomography with accuracy œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon in trace distance, when the measurement choices are independent of previously observed outcomes, i.e., they are nonadaptive. We give a succinct proof of these results through the œá2superscriptùúí2\\chi^{2}-divergence between suitable distributions. Unlike prior work, we do not require that the measurements be given by rank-one operators. This leads to stronger lower bounds when the learner uses measurements with a constant number of outcomes (e.g., two-outcome measurements). In particular, this rigorously establishes the optimality of the folklore ‚ÄúPauli tomography‚Äù algorithm in terms of its sample complexity. We also derive novel bounds of (r2‚Äãd/œµ2)superscriptùëü2ùëësuperscriptitalic-œµ2\\Omega(r^{2}d/\\epsilon^{2}) and (r2‚Äãd2/œµ2)superscriptùëü2superscriptùëë2superscriptitalic-œµ2\\Omega(r^{2}d^{2}/\\epsilon^{2}) for learning rank rùëür states using arbitrary and constant-outcome measurements, respectively, in the nonadaptive case. In addition to the sample complexity, a resource of practical significance for learning quantum states is the number of unique measurement settings required (i.e., the number of different measurements used by an algorithm, each possibly with an arbitrary number of outcomes). Motivated by this consideration, we employ concentration of measure of œá2superscriptùúí2\\chi^{2}-divergence of suitable distributions to extend our lower bounds to the case where the learner performs possibly adaptive measurements from a fixed set of exp‚Å°(O‚Äã(d))ùëÇùëë\\exp(O(d)) possible measurements. This implies in particular that adaptivity does not give us any advantage using single-copy measurements that are efficiently implementable. We also obtain a similar bound in the case where the goal is to predict the expectation values of a given sequence of observables, a task known as shadow tomography. Finally, in the case of adaptive, single-copy measurements implementable with polynomial-size circuits, we prove that a straightforward strategy based on computing sample means of the given observables is optimal.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 43 most likely reference titles for this paper.
