Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Locally Linear Region Knowledge Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective technique to transfer knowledge from one neural network (teacher) to another (student), thus improving the performance of the student. To make the student better mimic the behavior of the teacher, the existing work focuses on designing different criteria to align their logits or representations. Different from these efforts, we address knowledge distillation from a novel data perspective. We argue that transferring knowledge at sparse training data points cannot enable the student to well capture the local shape of the teacher function. To address this issue, we propose locally linear region knowledge distillation (L2superscriptL2\\rm L^{2}RKD) which transfers the knowledge in local, linear regions from a teacher to a student. This is achieved by enforcing the student to mimic the outputs of the teacher function in local, linear regions. To the end, the student is able to better capture the local shape of the teacher function and thus achieves a better performance. Despite its simplicity, extensive experiments demonstrate that L2superscriptL2\\rm L^{2}RKD is superior to the original KD in many aspects as it outperforms KD and the other state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin, shows robustness and superiority under few-shot settings, and is more compatible with the existing distillation approaches to further improve their performances significantly.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
