Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: SGCE-Font: Skeleton Guided Channel Expansion for Chinese Font Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The automatic generation of Chinese fonts is an important problem involved in many applications. The predominated methods for the Chinese font generation are based on the deep generative models, especially the generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, existing GAN-based methods (say, CycleGAN) for the Chinese font generation usually suffer from the mode collapse issue, mainly due to the lack of effective guidance information. This paper proposes a novel information guidance module called the skeleton guided channel expansion (SGCE) module for the Chinese font generation through integrating the skeleton information into the generator with the channel expansion way, motivated by the observation that the skeleton embodies both local and global structure information of Chinese characters. We conduct extensive experiments to show the effectiveness of the proposed module. Numerical results show that the mode collapse issue suffered by the known CycleGAN can be effectively alleviated by equipping with the proposed SGCE module, and the CycleGAN equipped with SGCE outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of four important evaluation metrics and visualization quality. Besides CycleGAN, we also show that the suggested SGCE module can be adapted to other models for Chinese font generation as a plug-and-play module to further improve their performance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
