Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

In addition to being asynchronous these algorithms run in rounds, tolerate up to one third of faulty nodes, use O‚Äã(n2)ùëÇsuperscriptùëõ2O(n^{2}) messages, and use randomized common coins to terminate in an expected constant number of rounds. Each of the four algorithms have different requirements for the random coin, for the number of messages needed per round, whether or not cryptographic signatures are needed, among other details. Two different non-interactive threshold common coin implementations are tested, one using threshold signatures, and one based on the Diffe-Hellman problem using validity proofs [11]. Experiments are run in single data center and geo-distributed configurations with between 444 and 484848 nodes. Various simple faulty behaviors are tested. As no algorithm performs best in all experimental conditions, two new algorithms introduced that simply combine properties of the existing algorithms with the goal of having good performance in the majority of experimental settings.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
