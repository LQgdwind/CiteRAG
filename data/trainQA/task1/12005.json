      "content": "Paper Title: Latent Space Disentanglement in Diffusion Transformers Enables Precise Zero-shot Semantic Editing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently achieved remarkable success in text-guided image generation. In image editing, DiTs project text and image inputs to a joint latent space, from which they decode and synthesize new images. However, it remains largely unexplored how multimodal information collectively forms this joint space and how they guide the semantics of the synthesized images. In this paper, we investigate the latent space of DiT models and uncover two key properties: First, DiT’s latent space is inherently semantically disentangled, where different semantic attributes can be controlled by specific editing directions. Second, consistent semantic editing requires utilizing the entire joint latent space, as neither encoded image nor text alone contains enough semantic information. We show that these editing directions can be obtained directly from text prompts, enabling precise semantic control without additional training or mask annotations. Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective Encode-Identify-Manipulate (EIM) framework for zero-shot fine-grained image editing. Specifically, we first encode both the given source image and the text prompt that describes the image, to obtain the joint latent embedding. Then, using our proposed Hessian Score Distillation Sampling (HSDS) method, we identify editing directions that control specific target attributes while preserving other image features. These directions are guided by text prompts and used to manipulate the latent embeddings. Moreover, we propose a new metric to quantify the disentanglement degree of the latent space of diffusion models. Extensive experiment results on our new curated benchmark dataset and analysis demonstrate DiT’s disentanglement properties and effectiveness of the EIM framework. 111Our annotated benchmark dataset is publicly available at https://anonymous.com/anonymous/EIM-Benchmark.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
