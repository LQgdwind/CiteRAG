      "content": "Paper Title: HASNAS: A Hardware-Aware Spiking Neural Architecture Search Framework for Neuromorphic Compute-in-Memory Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have shown capabilities for solving diverse machine learning tasks with ultra-low-power/energy computation. To further improve the performance and efficiency of SNN inference, the Compute-in-Memory (CIM) paradigm with emerging device technologies such as resistive random access memory is employed. However, most of SNN architectures are developed without considering constraints from the application and the underlying CIM hardware (e.g., memory, area, latency, and energy consumption). Moreover, most of SNN designs are derived from the Artificial Neural Networks, whose network operations are different from SNNs. These limitations hinder SNNs from reaching their full potential in accuracy and efficiency. Toward this, we propose HASNAS, a novel hardware-aware spiking neural architecture search (NAS) framework for neuromorphic CIM systems that finds an SNN that offers high accuracy under the given memory, area, latency, and energy constraints. To achieve this, HASNAS employs the following key steps: (1) optimizing SNN operations to achieve high accuracy, (2) developing an SNN architecture that facilitates an effective learning process, and (3) devising a systematic hardware-aware search algorithm to meet the constraints. The experimental results show that our HASNAS quickly finds an SNN that maintains high accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art by up to 11x speed-up, and meets the given constraints: 4x106 parameters of memory, 100m‚Äãm2ùëösuperscriptùëö2mm^{2} of area, 400m‚Äãsùëöùë†ms of latency, and 120Œº‚ÄãJùúáùêΩ\\mu J energy consumption for CIFAR10 and CIFAR100; while the state-of-the-art fails to meet the constraints. In this manner, our HASNAS can enable efficient design automation for providing high-performance and energy-efficient neuromorphic CIM systems for diverse applications.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
