      "content": "Paper Title: Spectral Propagation Graph Network for Few-shot Time Series Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Few-shot Time Series Classification (few-shot TSC) is a challenging problem in time series analysis. It is more difficult to classify when time series of the same class are not completely consistent in spectral domain or time series of different classes are partly consistent in spectral domain. To address this problem, we propose a novel method named Spectral Propagation Graph Network (SPGN) to explicitly model and propagate the spectrum-wise relations between different time series with graph network. To the best of our knowledge, SPGN is the first to utilize spectral comparisons in different intervals and involve spectral propagation across all time series with graph networks for few-shot TSC. SPGN first uses bandpass filter to expand time series in spectral domain for calculating spectrum-wise relations between time series. Equipped with graph networks, SPGN then integrates spectral relations with label information to make spectral propagation. The further study conveys the bi-directional effect between spectral relations acquisition and spectral propagation. We conduct extensive experiments on few-shot TSC benchmarks. SPGN outperforms state-of-the-art results by a large margin in 4%∼13%similar-topercent4percent134\\%\\sim 13\\%. Moreover, SPGN surpasses them by around 12%percent1212\\% and 9%percent99\\% under cross-domain and cross-way settings respectively.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
