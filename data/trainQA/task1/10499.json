Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Salient Patch Selection for Data-Efficient Reinforcement LearningPartially supported by the program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 62176154).\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract To improve the sample efficiency of vision-based deep reinforcement learning (RL), we propose a novel method, called SPIRL, to automatically extract important patches from input images. Following Masked Auto-Encoders, SPIRL is based on Vision Transformer models pre-trained in a self-supervised fashion to reconstruct images from randomly-sampled patches. These pre-trained models can then be exploited to detect and select salient patches, defined as hard to reconstruct from neighboring patches. In RL, the SPIRL agent processes selected salient patches via an attention module. We empirically validate SPIRL on Atari games to test its data-efficiency against relevant state-of-the-art methods, including some traditional model-based methods and keypoint-based models. In addition, we analyze our modelâ€™s interpretability capabilities.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
