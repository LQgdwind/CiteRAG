      "content": "Paper Title: A General Numerical Method to Model Anisotropy in Discretized Bond-Based Peridynamics\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This work presents a novel and general method of determining bond micromoduli for anisotropic linear elastic bond-based peridynamics. The problem of finding a discrete distribution of bond micromoduli that reproduces an anisotropic peridynamic stiffness tensor is cast as a least-squares problem. The proposed numerical method is able to find a distribution of bond micromoduli that is able to exactly reproduce a desired anisotropic stiffness tensor provided conditions of Cauchyâ€™s relations are met. Examples of all eight possible elastic material symmetries, from triclinic to isotropic are given and discussed in depth. Parametric studies are conducted to demonstrate that the numerical method is robust enough to handle a variety of horizon sizes, neighborhood shapes, influence functions and lattice rotation effects. The proposed method has great potential for modeling of deformation and fracture in anisotropic materials with bond-based peridynamics.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper.
