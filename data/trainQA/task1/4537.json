      "content": "Paper Title: Role Similarity Metric Based on Spanning Rooted Forest\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. As a fundamental issue in network analysis, structural node similarity has received much attention in academia and is adopted in a wide range of applications. Among these proposed structural node similarity measures, role similarity stands out because of satisfying several axiomatic properties including automorphism conformation. Existing role similarity metrics cannot handle top-k queries on large real-world networks due to the high time and space cost. In this paper, we propose a new role similarity metric, namely ForestSim. We prove that ForestSim is an admissible role similarity metric and devise the corresponding top-k similarity search algorithm, namely ForestSimSearch, which is able to process a top-k query in O‚Äã(k)ùëÇùëòO(k) time once the precomputation is finished. Moreover, we speed up the precomputation by using a fast approximate algorithm to compute the diagonal entries of the forest matrix, which reduces the time and space complexity of the precomputation to O‚Äã(œµ‚àí2‚Äãm‚Äãlog5‚Å°n‚Äãlog‚Å°1œµ)ùëÇsuperscriptitalic-œµ2ùëösuperscript5ùëõ1italic-œµO(\\epsilon^{-2}m\\log^{5}{n}\\log{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}}) and O‚Äã(m‚Äãlog3‚Å°n)ùëÇùëösuperscript3ùëõO(m\\log^{3}{n}), respectively. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 26 real-world networks. The results show that ForestSim works efficiently on million-scale networks and achieves comparable performance to the state-of-art methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
