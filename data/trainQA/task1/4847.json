Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Clustering Geometrically-Modeled Points in the Aggregated Uncertainty Model\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The k𝑘k-center problem is to choose a subset of size k𝑘k from a set of n𝑛n points such that the maximum distance from each point to its nearest center is minimized. Let Q={Q1,…,Qn}𝑄subscript𝑄1…subscript𝑄𝑛Q=\\{Q_{1},\\ldots,Q_{n}\\} be a set of polygons or segments in the region-based uncertainty model, in which each Qisubscript𝑄𝑖Q_{i} is an uncertain point, where the exact locations of the points in Qisubscript𝑄𝑖Q_{i} are unknown. The geometric objects such as segments and polygons can be models of a point set. We define the uncertain version of the k𝑘k-center problem as a generalization in which the objective is to find k𝑘k points from Q𝑄Q to cover the remaining regions of Q𝑄Q with minimum or maximum radius of the cluster to cover at least one or all exact instances of each Qisubscript𝑄𝑖Q_{i}, respectively. We modify the region-based model to allow multiple points to be chosen from a region, and call the resulting model the aggregated uncertainty model. All these problems contain the point version as a special case, so they are all NP-hard with a lower bound 1.822 for the approximation factor. We give approximation algorithms for uncertain k𝑘k-center of a set of segments and polygons. We also have implemented some of our algorithms on a data-set to show our theoretical performance guarantees can be achieved in practice. Keywords: k𝑘k-center Uncertain data Approximation algorithms\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
