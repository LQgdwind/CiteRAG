      "content": "Paper Title: Learn-Morph-Infer: a new way of solving the inverse problem for brain tumor modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Current treatment planning of patients diagnosed with a brain tumor, such as glioma, could significantly benefit by accessing the spatial distribution of tumor cell concentration. Existing diagnostic modalities, e.g. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrast sufficiently well areas of high cell density. In gliomas, however, they do not portray areas of low cell concentration, which can often serve as a source for the secondary appearance of the tumor after treatment. To estimate tumor cell densities beyond the visible boundaries of the lesion, numerical simulations of tumor growth could complement imaging information by providing estimates of full spatial distributions of tumor cells. Over recent years a corpus of literature on medical image-based tumor modeling was published. It includes different mathematical formalisms describing the forward tumor growth model. Alongside, various parametric inference schemes were developed to perform an efficient tumor model personalization, i.e. solving the inverse problem. However, the unifying drawback of all existing approaches is the time complexity of the model personalization which prohibits a potential integration of the modeling into clinical settings. In this work, we introduce a deep learning based methodology for inferring the patient-specific spatial distribution of brain tumors from T1Gd and FLAIR MRI medical scans. Coined as Learn-Morph-Infer, the method achieves real-time performance in the order of minutes on widely available hardware and the compute time is stable across tumor models of different complexity, such as reaction-diffusion and reaction-advection-diffusion models. We believe the proposed inverse solution approach not only bridges the way for clinical translation of brain tumor personalization but can also be adopted to other scientific and engineering domains.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
