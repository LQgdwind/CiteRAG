      "content": "Paper Title: An Asynchronous Multi-core Accelerator for SNN inference\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are extensively utilized in brain-inspired computing and neuroscience research. To enhance the speed and energy efficiency of SNNs, several many-core accelerators have been developed. However, maintaining the accuracy of SNNs often necessitates frequent explicit synchronization among all cores, which presents a challenge to overall efficiency. In this paper, we introduce an asynchronous architecture that eliminates inter-core synchronization, thereby enabling fast and energy-efficient SNN inference with commendable scalability. The core concept is to leverage the dependency of neuromorphic cores predetermined at compile time. We design a scheduler for each core to monitor the running state of its dependencies and control the core to safely proceed to the next timestep without waiting for other cores to complete their tasks. This approach eliminates the need for global synchronization, allowing our architecture to minimize core waiting time in the face of inherent core and time imbalances in SNN workloads. Comprehensive evaluations using five SNN workloads demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves a 1.86x speedup and 1.55x energy efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art synchronization architectures.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
