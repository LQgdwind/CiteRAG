      "content": "Paper Title: EASRec: Elastic Architecture Search for Efficient Long-term Sequential Recommender Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this age where data is abundant, the ability to distill meaningful insights from the sea of information is essential. Our research addresses the computational and resource inefficiencies that current Sequential Recommender Systems (SRSs) suffer from. especially those employing attention-based models like SASRec, These systems are designed for next-item recommendations in various applications, from e-commerce to social networks. However, such systems suffer from substantial computational costs and resource consumption during the inference stage. To tackle these issues, our research proposes a novel method that combines automatic pruning techniques with advanced model architectures. We also explore the potential of resource-constrained Neural Architecture Search (NAS), a technique prevalent in the realm of recommendation systems, to fine-tune models for reduced FLOPs, latency, and energy usage while retaining or even enhancing accuracy. The main contribution of our work is developing the Elastic Architecture Search for Efficient Long-term Sequential Recommender Systems (EASRec). This approach aims to find optimal compact architectures for attention-based SRSs, ensuring accuracy retention. EASRec introduces data-aware gates that leverage historical information from input data batch to improve the performance of the recommendation network. Additionally, it utilizes a dynamic resource constraint approach, which standardizes the search process and results in more appropriate architectures. The effectiveness of our methodology is validated through exhaustive experiments on three benchmark datasets, which demonstrates EASRec‚Äôs superiority in SRSs. Our research set a new standard for future exploration into efficient and accurate recommender systems, signifying a substantial advancement within this swiftly advancing field.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
