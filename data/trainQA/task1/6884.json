      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we present several new results on minimizing a nonsmooth and nonconvex function under a Lipschitz condition. Recent work shows that while the classical notion of Clarke stationarity is computationally intractable up to some sufficiently small constant tolerance, the randomized first-order algorithms find a (Œ¥,œµ)ùõøitalic-œµ(\\delta,\\epsilon)-Goldstein stationary point with the complexity bound of O~‚Äã(Œ¥‚àí1‚Äãœµ‚àí3)~ùëÇsuperscriptùõø1superscriptitalic-œµ3\\tilde{O}(\\delta^{-1}\\epsilon^{-3}), which is independent of dimension d‚â•1ùëë1d\\geq 1 (Zhang et al., 2020; Davis et al., 2022; Tian et al., 2022). However, the deterministic algorithms have not been fully explored, leaving open several problems in nonsmooth nonconvex optimization. Our first contribution is to demonstrate that the randomization is necessary to obtain a dimension-independent guarantee, by proving a lower bound of Œ©‚Äã(d)Œ©ùëë\\Omega(d) for any deterministic algorithm that has access to both 1stsuperscript1st1^{\\textnormal{st}} and 0thsuperscript0th0^{\\textnormal{th}} oracles. Furthermore, we show that the 0thsuperscript0th0^{\\textnormal{th}} oracle is essential to obtain a finite-time convergence guarantee, by showing that any deterministic algorithm with only the 1stsuperscript1st1^{\\textnormal{st}} oracle is not able to find an approximate Goldstein stationary point within a finite number of iterations up to sufficiently small constant parameter and tolerance. Finally, we propose a deterministic smoothing approach under the arithmetic circuit model where the resulting smoothness parameter is exponential in a certain parameter M>0ùëÄ0M>0 (e.g., the number of nodes in the representation of the function), and design a new deterministic first-order algorithm that achieves a dimension-independent complexity bound of O~‚Äã(M‚ÄãŒ¥‚àí1‚Äãœµ‚àí3)~ùëÇùëÄsuperscriptùõø1superscriptitalic-œµ3\\tilde{O}(M\\delta^{-1}\\epsilon^{-3}).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper.
