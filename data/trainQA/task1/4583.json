Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: EBJR: Energy-Based Joint Reasoning for Adaptive Inference\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract State-of-the-art deep learning models have achieved significant performance levels on various benchmarks. However, the excellent performance comes at a cost of inefficient computational cost. Light-weight architectures, on the other hand, achieve moderate accuracies, but at a much more desirable latency. This paper presents a new method of jointly using the large accurate models together with the small fast ones. To this end, we propose an Energy-Based Joint Reasoning (EBJR) framework that adaptively distributes the samples between shallow and deep models to achieve an accuracy close to the deep model, but latency close to the shallow one. Our method is applicable to out-of-the-box pre-trained models as it does not require an architecture change nor re-training. Moreover, it is easy to use and deploy, especially for cloud services. Through a comprehensive set of experiments on different down-stream tasks, we show that our method outperforms strong state-of-the-art approaches with a considerable margin. In addition, we propose specialized EBJR, an extension of our method where we create a smaller specialized side model that performs the target task only partially, but yields an even higher accuracy and faster inference. We verify the strengths of our methods with both theoretical and experimental evaluations.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
