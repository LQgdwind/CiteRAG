Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Meso-scale Finite Element Modeling of Alkali-Silica-Reaction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The alkali-silica reaction (ASR) in concrete is a chemical reaction, which produces an expansive product, generally called “ASR gel”, and causes cracking and damage in concrete over time. Affecting numerous infrastructures all around the world, ASR has been the topic of much research over the past decades. In spite of that, many aspects of this reaction are still unknown. In this numerical-investigation paper, a three-dimensional concrete meso-structure model is simulated using the finite-element method. Coarse aggregates, cement paste, and ASR gel are explicitly represented. A temperature dependent eigen-strain is applied on the simulated ASR gel pockets to capture their expansive behavior. This applies pressure on the surrounding aggregates and the cement paste, leading to cracks initiation and propagation. Free expansion of concrete specimens due to ASR is modeled and validated using experimental data. Influence of different key factors on damage generation in aggregates and paste and macroscopic expansion are discussed.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 57\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
