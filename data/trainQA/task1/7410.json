      "content": "Paper Title: Lattice Problems Beyond Polynomial Time\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study the complexity of lattice problems in a world where algorithms, reductions, and protocols can run in superpolynomial time. Specifically, we revisit four foundational results in this context—two protocols and two worst-case to average-case reductions. We show how to improve the approximation factor in each result by a factor of roughly n/log⁡n𝑛𝑛\\sqrt{n/\\log n} when running the protocol or reduction in 2ε​nsuperscript2𝜀𝑛2^{\\varepsilon n} time instead of polynomial time, and we show a novel protocol with no polynomial-time analog. Our results are as follows. 1. We show a worst-case to average-case reduction proving that secret-key cryptography (specifically, collision-resistant hash functions) exists if the (decision version of the) Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) cannot be approximated to within a factor of O~​(n)~𝑂𝑛\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{n}) in 2ε​nsuperscript2𝜀𝑛2^{\\varepsilon n} time for any constant ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0. This extends to our setting Ajtai’s celebrated polynomial-time reduction for the Short Integer Solutions problem (SIS) [STOC, 1996], which showed (after improvements by Micciancio and Regev [FOCS, 2004; and SIAM J. Computing, 2007]) that secret-key cryptography exists if SVP cannot be approximated to within a factor of O~​(n)~𝑂𝑛\\widetilde{O}(n) in polynomial time. 2. We show another worst-case to average-case reduction proving that public-key cryptography exists if SVP cannot be approximated to within a factor of O~​(n)~𝑂𝑛\\widetilde{O}(n) in 2ε​nsuperscript2𝜀𝑛2^{\\varepsilon n} time. This extends Regev’s celebrated polynomial-time reduction for the Learning with Errors problem (LWE) [STOC, 2005; and J. ACM, 2009], which achieved an approximation factor of O~​(n1.5)~𝑂superscript𝑛1.5\\widetilde{O}(n^{1.5}). In fact, Regev’s reduction is quantum, but we prove our result under a classical reduction, generalizing Peikert’s polynomial-time classical reduction [STOC, 2009], which achieved an approximation factor of O~​(n2)~𝑂superscript𝑛2\\widetilde{O}(n^{2}). 3. We show that the (decision version of the) Closest Vector Problem (CVP) with a constant approximation factor has a 𝖼𝗈𝖠𝖬𝖼𝗈𝖠𝖬\\mathsf{coAM} protocol with a 2ε​nsuperscript2𝜀𝑛2^{\\varepsilon n}-time verifier. This generalizes the celebrated polynomial-time protocol due to Goldreich and Goldwasser [STOC 1998; and J. Comp. Syst. Sci., 2000]. It follows that the recent series of 2ε​nsuperscript2𝜀𝑛2^{\\varepsilon n}-time and even 2(1−ε)​nsuperscript21𝜀𝑛2^{(1-\\varepsilon)n}-time hardness results for CVP cannot be extended to large constant approximation factors γ𝛾\\gamma unless AMETH is false. We also rule out 2(1−ε)​nsuperscript21𝜀𝑛2^{(1-\\varepsilon)n}-time lower bounds for any constant approximation factor γ>2𝛾2\\gamma>\\sqrt{2}, under plausible complexity-theoretic assumptions. (These results also extend to arbitrary norms, with different constants.) 4. We show that O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\sqrt{\\log n})-approximate SVP has a 𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤\\mathsf{coNTIME} protocol with a 2ε​nsuperscript2𝜀𝑛2^{\\varepsilon n}-time verifier. Here, the analogous (also celebrated!) polynomial-time result is due to Aharonov and Regev [FOCS, 2005; and J. ACM, 2005], who showed a polynomial-time protocol achieving an approximation factor of n𝑛\\sqrt{n}. This result implies similar barriers to hardness, with a larger approximation factor under a weaker complexity-theoretic conjectures (as does the next result). 5. Finally, we give a novel 𝖼𝗈𝖬𝖠𝖼𝗈𝖬𝖠\\mathsf{coMA} protocol for constant-factor-approximate CVP with a 2ε​nsuperscript2𝜀𝑛2^{\\varepsilon n}-time verifier. Unlike our other results, this protocol has no known analog in the polynomial-time regime. All of the results described above are special cases of more general theorems that achieve time-approximation factor tradeoffs. In particular, the tradeoffs for the first four results smoothly interpolate from the polynomial-time results in prior work to our new results in the exponential-time world.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
