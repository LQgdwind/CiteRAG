Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2. Title: Glove: Global vectors for word representation\n   Abstract: We present a new global log-bilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature.\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"titles\": [\n    \"Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\",\n    \"Glove: Global vectors for word representation\",\n    \"Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks\",\n    \"A Comparative Study of Neural Network Models for Sentence Classification\",\n    \"Deep lstm based feature mapping for query classification\"\n  ],\n  \"reasoning\": \"Based on the paper's focus on question classification using neural networks, I predict these references because: 1) CNN paper is directly relevant to the convolutional approach used; 2) GloVe embeddings are mentioned as pre-trained features; 3) QRNN is one of the compared methods; 4) Comparative study papers are common in this field; 5) LSTM-based query classification is closely related to question classification. Additional references cover related neural network architectures, NLP applications, deep learning methodologies, optimization techniques, and advanced neural network methods that would be relevant for this research area.\"\n}\n\nReturn JSON object only."

      "content": "Paper Title: Denoised Smoothing: A Provable Defense for Pretrained Classifiers\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present a method for provably defending any pretrained image classifier against ‚Ñìpsubscript‚Ñìùëù\\ell_{p} adversarial attacks. This method, for instance, allows public vision API providers and users to seamlessly convert pretrained non-robust classification services into provably robust ones. By prepending a custom-trained denoiser to any off-the-shelf image classifier and using randomized smoothing, we effectively create a new classifier that is guaranteed to be ‚Ñìpsubscript‚Ñìùëù\\ell_{p}-robust to adversarial examples, without modifying the pretrained classifier. Our approach applies to both the white-box and the black-box settings of the pretrained classifier. We refer to this defense as denoised smoothing, and we demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experimentation on ImageNet and CIFAR-10. Finally, we use our approach to provably defend the Azure, Google, AWS, and ClarifAI image classification APIs. Our code replicating all the experiments in the paper can be found at: https://github.com/microsoft/denoised-smoothing.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 55\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
