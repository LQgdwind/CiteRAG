      "content": "Paper Title: Speeding Up the NSGA-II With a Simple Tie-Breaking Rule\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA/ÃÑII) is the most popular multi-objective optimization heuristic. Recent mathematical runtime analyses have detected two shortcomings in discrete search spaces, namely, that the NSGA-II has difficulties with more than two objectives and that it is very sensitive to the choice of the population size. To overcome these difficulties, we analyze a simple tie-breaking rule in the selection of the next population. Similar rules have been proposed before, but have found only little acceptance. We prove the effectiveness of our tie-breaking rule via mathematical runtime analyses on the classic OneMinMax, LeadingOnesTrailingZeros, and OneJumpZeroJump benchmarks. We prove that this modified NSGA-II can optimize the three benchmarks efficiently also for many objectives, in contrast to the exponential lower runtime bound previously shown for OneMinMax with three or more objectives. For the bi-objective problems, we show runtime guarantees that do not increase when moderately increasing the population size over the minimum admissible size. For example, for the OneJumpZeroJump problem with representation length nùëõn and gap parameter kùëòk, we show a runtime guarantee of O‚Äã(max‚Å°{nk+1,N‚Äãn})ùëÇsuperscriptùëõùëò1ùëÅùëõO(\\max\\{n^{k+1},Nn\\}) function evaluations when the population size is at least four times the size of the Pareto front. For population sizes larger than the minimal choice N=Œò‚Äã(n)ùëÅŒòùëõN=\\Theta(n), this result improves considerably over the Œò‚Äã(N‚Äãnk)ŒòùëÅsuperscriptùëõùëò\\Theta(Nn^{k}) runtime of the classic NSGA/ÃÑII.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
