      "content": "Paper Title: Entangled Polynomial Codes for Secure, Private, and Batch Distributed Matrix Multiplication: Breaking the ‚ÄúCubic‚Äù Barrier\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In distributed matrix multiplication, a common scenario is to assign each worker a fraction of the multiplication task, by partitioning the input matrices into smaller submatrices. In particular, by dividing two input matrices into mùëöm-by-pùëùp and pùëùp-by-nùëõn subblocks, a single multiplication task can be viewed as computing linear combinations of p‚Äãm‚Äãnùëùùëöùëõpmn submatrix products, which can be assigned to p‚Äãm‚Äãnùëùùëöùëõpmn workers. Such block-partitioning based designs have been widely studied under the topics of secure, private, and batch computation, where the state of the arts all require computing at least ‚Äúcubic‚Äù (p‚Äãm‚Äãnùëùùëöùëõpmn) number of submatrix multiplications. Entangled polynomial codes, first presented for straggler mitigation, provides a powerful method for breaking the cubic barrier. It achieves a subcubic recovery threshold, meaning that the final product can be recovered from any subset of multiplication results with a size order-wise smaller than p‚Äãm‚Äãnùëùùëöùëõpmn. In this work, we show that entangled polynomial codes can be further extended to also include these three important settings, and provide a unified framework that order-wise reduces the total computational costs upon the state of the arts by achieving subcubic recovery thresholds.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper.
