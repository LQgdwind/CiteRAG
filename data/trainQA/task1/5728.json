Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2. Title: Glove: Global vectors for word representation\n   Abstract: We present a new global log-bilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature.\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"titles\": [\n    \"Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\",\n    \"Glove: Global vectors for word representation\",\n    \"Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks\",\n    \"A Comparative Study of Neural Network Models for Sentence Classification\",\n    \"Deep lstm based feature mapping for query classification\"\n  ],\n  \"reasoning\": \"Based on the paper's focus on question classification using neural networks, I predict these references because: 1) CNN paper is directly relevant to the convolutional approach used; 2) GloVe embeddings are mentioned as pre-trained features; 3) QRNN is one of the compared methods; 4) Comparative study papers are common in this field; 5) LSTM-based query classification is closely related to question classification. Additional references cover related neural network architectures, NLP applications, deep learning methodologies, optimization techniques, and advanced neural network methods that would be relevant for this research area.\"\n}\n\nReturn JSON object only."

      "content": "Paper Title: Deterministic, Near-Linear 𝜀-Approximation Algorithm for Geometric Bipartite Matching\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Given point sets A𝐴A and B𝐵B in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} where A𝐴A and B𝐵B have equal size n𝑛n for some constant dimension d𝑑d and a parameter ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, we present the first deterministic algorithm that computes, in n⋅(ε−1​log⁡n)O​(d)⋅𝑛superscriptsuperscript𝜀1𝑛𝑂𝑑n\\cdot(\\varepsilon^{-1}\\log n)^{O(d)} time, a perfect matching between A𝐴A and B𝐵B whose cost is within a (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon) factor of the optimal under any ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\\smash{\\ell_{p}}-norm. Although a Monte-Carlo algorithm with a similar running time is proposed by Raghvendra and Agarwal [J. ACM 2020], the best-known deterministic ε𝜀\\varepsilon-approximation algorithm takes Ω​(n3/2)Ωsuperscript𝑛32\\Omega(n^{3/2}) time. Our algorithm constructs a (refinement of a) tree cover of ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}, and we develop several new tools to apply a tree-cover based approach to compute an ε𝜀\\varepsilon-approximate perfect matching.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
