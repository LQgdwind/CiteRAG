Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: IUP: An Intelligent Utility Prediction Scheme for Solid-State Fermentation in 5G IoT\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract At present, SOILD-STATE Fermentation (SSF) is mainly controlled by artificial experience, and the product quality and yield are not stable. Accurately predicting the quality and yield of SSF is of great significance for improving human food security and supply. In this paper, we propose an Intelligent Utility Prediction (IUP) scheme for SSF in 5G Industrial Internet of Things (IoT), including parameter collection and utility prediction of SSF process. This IUP scheme is based on the environmental perception and intelligent learning algorithms of the 5G Industrial IoT. We build a workflow model based on rewritable petri net to verify the correctness of the system model function and process. In addition, we design a utility prediction model for SSF based on the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN). We design a GAN with constraint of mean square error (MSE-GAN) to solve the problem of few-shot learning of SSF, and then combine with the FCNN to realize the utility prediction (usually use the alcohol) of SSF. Based on the production of liquor in laboratory, the experiments show that the proposed method is more accurate than the other prediction methods in the utility prediction of SSF, and provide the basis for the numerical analysis of the proportion of preconfigured raw materials and the appropriate setting of cellar temperature.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 49\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
