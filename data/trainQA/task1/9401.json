Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Knowledge Graph Self-Supervised Rationalization for Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. In this paper, we introduce a new self-supervised rationalization method, called KGRec, for knowledge-aware recommender systems. To effectively identify informative knowledge connections, we propose an attentive knowledge rationalization mechanism that generates rational scores for knowledge triplets. With these scores, KGRec integrates generative and contrastive self-supervised tasks for recommendation through rational masking. To highlight rationales in the knowledge graph, we design a novel generative task in the form of masking-reconstructing. By masking important knowledge with high rational scores, KGRec is trained to rebuild and highlight useful knowledge connections that serve as rationales. To further rationalize the effect of collaborative interactions on knowledge graph learning, we introduce a contrastive learning task that aligns signals from knowledge and user-item interaction views. To ensure noise-resistant contrasting, potential noisy edges in both graphs judged by the rational scores are masked. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that KGRec outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We also provide the implementation codes for our approach at https://github.com/HKUDS/KGRec.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
