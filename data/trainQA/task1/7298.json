Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Robust Manifold Nonnegative Tucker Factorization for Tensor Data Representation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Nonnegative Tucker Factorization (NTF) minimizes the euclidean distance or Kullback-Leibler divergence between the original data and its low-rank approximation which often suffers from grossly corruptions or outliers and the neglect of manifold structures of data. In particular, NTF suffers from rotational ambiguity, whose solutions with and without rotation transformations are equally in the sense of yielding the maximum likelihood. In this paper, we propose three Robust Manifold NTF algorithms to handle outliers by incorporating structural knowledge about the outliers. They first applies a half-quadratic optimization algorithm to transform the problem into a general weighted NTF where the weights are influenced by the outliers. Then, we introduce the correntropy induced metric, Huber function and Cauchy function for weights respectively, to handle the outliers. Finally, we introduce a manifold regularization to overcome the rotational ambiguity of NTF. We have compared the proposed method with a number of representative references covering major branches of NTF on a variety of real-world image databases. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method under two evaluation metrics (accuracy and nmi).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
