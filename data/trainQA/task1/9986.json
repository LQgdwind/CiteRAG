Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 202 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Investigating Online Financial Misinformation and Its Consequences: A Computational Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. The rapid dissemination of information through digital platforms has revolutionized the way we access and consume news and information, particularly in the realm of finance. However, this digital age has also given rise to an alarming proliferation of financial misinformation, which can have detrimental effects on individuals, markets, and the overall economy. This research paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey of online financial misinformation, including its types, sources, and impacts. We first discuss the characteristics and manifestations of financial misinformation, encompassing false claims and misleading content. We explore various case studies that illustrate the detrimental consequences of financial misinformation on the economy. These real-world examples demonstrate the extent to which misinformation can disrupt markets, harm investors, and create economic instability. Examples range from fraudulent investment schemes to misleading news articles or social media posts aimed at manipulating stock prices or influencing market sentiment. Such misinformation poses serious risks, including market volatility, investor losses, and erosion of trust in financial institutions. Finally, we highlight the potential impact and implications of detecting financial misinformation. Early detection and mitigation strategies can help protect investors, enhance market transparency, and preserve financial stability. We emphasize the importance of greater awareness, education, and regulation to address the issue of online financial misinformation and safeguard individuals and businesses from its harmful effects. In conclusion, this research paper sheds light on the pervasive issue of online financial misinformation and its wide-ranging consequences. By understanding the types, sources, and impacts of misinformation, stakeholders can work towards implementing effective detection and prevention measures to foster a more informed and resilient financial ecosystem.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 202 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 202\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
