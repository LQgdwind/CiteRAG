Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Guided-GAN: Adversarial Representation Learning for Activity Recognition with Wearables\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Human activity recognition (HAR) is an important research field in ubiquitous computing where the acquisition of large-scale labeled sensor data is tedious, labor-intensive and time consuming. State-of-the-art unsupervised remedies investigated to alleviate the burdens of data annotations in HAR mainly explore training autoencoder frameworks. In this paper: we explore generative adversarial network (GAN) paradigms to learn unsupervised feature representations from wearable sensor data; and design a new GAN framework—Geometrically-Guided GAN or Guided-GAN—for the task. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our formulation, we evaluate the features learned by Guided-GAN in an unsupervised manner on three downstream classification benchmarks. Our results demonstrate Guided-GAN to outperform existing unsupervised approaches whilst closely approaching the performance with fully supervised learned representations. The proposed approach paves the way to bridge the gap between unsupervised and supervised human activity recognition whilst helping to reduce the cost of human data annotation tasks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
