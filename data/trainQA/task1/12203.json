Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: The Relational Quotient Completion\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Taking a quotient roughly means changing the notion of equality on a given object, set or type. In a quantitative setting, equality naturally generalises to a distance, measuring how much elements are similar instead of just stating their equivalence. Hence, quotients can be understood quantitatively as a change of distance. In this paper, we show how, combining Lawvere’s doctrines and the calculus of relations, one can unify quantitative and usual quotients in a common picture. More in detail, we introduce relational doctrines as a functorial description of (the core of) the calculus of relations. Then, we define quotients and a universal construction adding them to any relational doctrine, generalising the quotient completion of existential elementary doctrine and also recovering many quantitative examples. This construction deals with an intensional notion of quotient and breaks extensional equality of morphisms. Then, we describe another construction forcing extensionality, showing how it abstracts several notions of separation in metric and topological structures. Combining these two constructions, we get the extensional quotient completion, whose essential image is characterized through the notion of projective cover. As an application, we show that, under suitable conditions, relational doctrines of algebras arise as the extensional quotient completion of free algebras. Finally, we compare relational doctrines to other categorical structures where one can model the calculus of relations.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
