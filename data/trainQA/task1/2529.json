Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring multi-task multi-lingual learning of transformer models for hate speech and offensive speech identification in social media\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Hate Speech has become a major content moderation issue for online social media platforms. Given the volume and velocity of online content production, it is impossible to manually moderate hate speech related content on any platform. In this paper we utilize a multi-task and multi-lingual approach based on recently proposed Transformer Neural Networks to solve three sub-tasks for hate speech. These sub-tasks were part of the 2019 shared task on hate speech and offensive content (HASOC) identification in Indo-European languages. We expand on our submission to that competition by utilizing multi-task models which are trained using three approaches, a) multi-task learning with separate task heads, b) back-translation, and c) multi-lingual training. Finally, we investigate the performance of various models and identify instances where the Transformer based models perform differently and better. We show that it is possible to to utilize different combined approaches to obtain models that can generalize easily on different languages and tasks, while trading off slight accuracy (in some cases) for a much reduced inference time compute cost. We open source an updated version of our HASOC 2019 code with the new improvements at https://github.com/socialmediaie/MTML_HateSpeech.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 54\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
