Hernández-Tello, M.A. Martínez-del-Amor, D. Orellana-Martín, F.G.C. Cabarle, Sparse Spiking Neural-Like Membrane Systems on Graphics Processing Unit. International Journal of Neural Systems 34, 07 (2024), 2450038. https://doi.org/10.1142/S0129065724500382\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The parallel simulation of Spiking Neural P systems is mainly based on a matrix representation, where the graph inherent to the neural model is encoded in an adjacency matrix. The simulation algorithm is based on a matrix-vector multiplication, which is an operation efficiently implemented on parallel devices. However, when the graph of a Spiking Neural P system is not fully connected, the adjacency matrix is sparse and hence, lots of computing resources are wasted in both time and memory domains. For this reason, two compression methods for the matrix representation were proposed in a previous work, but they were not implemented nor parallelized on a simulator. In this paper, they are implemented and parallelized on GPUs as part of a new Spiking Neural P system with delays simulator. Extensive experiments are conducted on high-end GPUs (RTX2080 and A100 80GB), and it is concluded that they outperform other solutions based on state-of-the-art GPU libraries when simulating Spiking Neural P systems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
