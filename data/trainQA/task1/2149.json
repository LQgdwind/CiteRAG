Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Adaptive Neural Architectures for Recommender Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep learning has proved an effective means to capture the non-linear associations of user preferences. However, the main drawback of existing deep learning architectures is that they follow a fixed recommendation strategy, ignoring users’ real time-feedback. Recent advances of deep reinforcement strategies showed that recommendation policies can be continuously updated while users interact with the system. In doing so, we can learn the optimal policy that fits to users’ preferences over the recommendation sessions. The main drawback of deep reinforcement strategies is that are based on predefined and fixed neural architectures. To shed light on how to handle this issue, in this study we first present deep reinforcement learning strategies for recommendation and discuss the main limitations due to the fixed neural architectures. Then, we detail how recent advances on progressive neural architectures are used for consecutive tasks in other research domains. Finally, we present the key challenges to fill the gap between deep reinforcement learning and adaptive neural architectures. We provide guidelines for searching for the best neural architecture based on each user feedback via reinforcement learning, while considering the prediction performance on real-time recommendations and the model complexity.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
