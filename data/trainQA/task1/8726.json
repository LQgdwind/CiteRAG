Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Two is Better Than One: Digital Siblings to Improve Autonomous Driving Testing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Simulation-based testing represents an important step to ensure the reliability of autonomous driving software. In practice, when companies rely on third-party general-purpose simulators, either for in-house or outsourced testing, the generalizability of testing results to real autonomous vehicles is at stake. In this paper, we strengthen simulation-based testing by introducing the notion of digital siblings, a novel framework in which the AV is tested on multiple general-purpose simulators, built with different technologies. First, test cases are automatically generated for each individual simulator. Then, tests are migrated between simulators, using feature maps to characterize of the exercised driving conditions. Finally, the joint predicted failure probability is computed and a failure is reported only in cases of agreement among the siblings. We implemented our framework using two open-source simulators and we empirically compared it against a digital twin of a physical scaled autonomous vehicle on a large set of test cases. Our study shows that the ensemble failure predictor by the digital siblings is superior to each individual simulator at predicting the failures of the digital twin. We discuss several ways in which our framework can help researchers interested in automated testing of autonomous driving software.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 67 most likely reference titles for this paper.
