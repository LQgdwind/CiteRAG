      "content": "Paper Title: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback: Learning Dynamic Choices via Pessimism\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we study offline Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) where we aim to learn the human’s underlying reward and the MDP’s optimal policy from a set of trajectories induced by human choices. RLHF is challenging for multiple reasons: large state space but limited human feedback, the bounded rationality of human decisions, and the off-policy distribution shift. In this paper, we focus on the Dynamic Discrete Choice (DDC) model for modeling and understanding human choices. DCC, rooted in econometrics and decision theory, is widely used to model a human decision-making process with forward-looking and bounded rationality. We propose a Dynamic-Choice-Pessimistic-Policy-Optimization (DCPPO) method. The method involves a three-stage process: The first step is to estimate the human behavior policy and the state-action value function via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE); the second step recovers the human reward function via minimizing Bellman mean squared error using the learned value functions; the third step is to plug in the learned reward and invoke pessimistic value iteration for finding a near-optimal policy. With only single-policy coverage (i.e., optimal policy) of the dataset, we prove that the suboptimality of DCPPO almost matches the classical pessimistic offline RL algorithm in terms of suboptimality’s dependency on distribution shift and dimension. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first theoretical guarantees for off-policy offline RLHF with dynamic discrete choice model.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
