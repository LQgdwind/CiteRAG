Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Gathering Information about a Graph by Counting Walks from a Single Vertex\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We say that a vertex vùë£v in a connected graph Gùê∫G is decisive if the numbers of walks from vùë£v of each length determine the graph Gùê∫G rooted at vùë£v up to isomorphism among all connected rooted graphs with the same number of vertices. On the other hand, vùë£v is called ambivalent if it has the same walk counts as a vertex in a non-isomorphic connected graph with the same number of vertices as Gùê∫G. Using the classical constructions of cospectral trees, we first observe that ambivalent vertices exist in almost all trees. If a graph Gùê∫G is determined by spectrum and its characteristic polynomial is irreducible, then we prove that all vertices of Gùê∫G are decisive. Note that both assumptions are conjectured to be true for almost all graphs. Without using any assumption, we are able to prove that the vertices of a random graph are with high probability distinguishable from each other by the numbers of closed walks of length at most 4. As a consequence, the closed walk counts for lengths 2, 3, and 4 provide a canonical labeling of a random graph. Answering a question posed in chemical graph theory, we finally show that all walk counts for a vertex in an nùëõn-vertex graph are determined by the counts for the 2‚Äãn2ùëõ2n shortest lengths, and the bound 2‚Äãn2ùëõ2n is here asymptotically tight.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
