      "content": "Paper Title: Adaptive B√©zier Degree Reduction and Splitting for Computationally Efficient Motion Planning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract As a parametric polynomial curve family, B√©zier curves are widely used in safe and smooth motion design of intelligent robotic systems from flying drones to autonomous vehicles to robotic manipulators. In such motion planning settings, the critical features of high-order B√©zier curves such as curve length, distance-to-collision, maximum curvature/velocity/acceleration are either numerically computed at a high computational cost or inexactly approximated by discrete samples. To address these issues, in this paper we present a novel computationally efficient approach for adaptive approximation of high-order B√©zier curves by multiple low-order B√©zier segments at any desired level of accuracy that is specified in terms of a B√©zier metric. Accordingly, we introduce a new B√©zier degree reduction method, called parameterwise matching reduction, that approximates B√©zier curves more accurately compared to the standard least squares and Taylor reduction methods. We also propose a new B√©zier metric, called the maximum control-point distance, that can be computed analytically, has a strong equivalence relation with other existing B√©zier metrics, and defines a geometric relative bound between B√©zier curves. We provide extensive numerical evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed B√©zier approximation approach. As a rule of thumb, based on the degree-one matching reduction error, we conclude that an nthsuperscriptùëõthn^{\\text{th}}-order B√©zier curve can be accurately approximated by 3‚Äã(n‚àí1)3ùëõ13(n-1) quadratic and 6‚Äã(n‚àí1)6ùëõ16(n-1) linear B√©zier segments, which is fundamental for B√©zier discretization.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper.
