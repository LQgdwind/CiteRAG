Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: TUM-FAÇADE: Reviewing and enriching point cloud benchmarks for façade segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Point clouds are widely regarded as one of the best dataset types for urban mapping purposes. Hence, point cloud datasets are commonly investigated as benchmark types for various urban interpretation methods. Yet, few researchers have addressed the use of point cloud benchmarks for façade segmentation. Robust façade segmentation is becoming a key factor in various applications ranging from simulating autonomous driving functions to preserving cultural heritage. In this work, we present a method of enriching existing point cloud datasets with façade-related classes that have been designed to facilitate façade segmentation testing. We propose how to efficiently extend existing datasets and comprehensively assess their potential for façade segmentation. We use the method to create the TUM-FAÇADE dataset, which extends the capabilities of TUM-MLS-2016. Not only can TUM-FAÇADE facilitate the development of point-cloud-based façade segmentation tasks, but our procedure can also be applied to enrich further datasets.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 51\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
