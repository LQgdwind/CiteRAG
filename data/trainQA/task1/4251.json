      "content": "Paper Title: An Unsupervised Deep-Learning Method for Fingerprint Classification: the CCAE Network and the Hybrid Clustering Strategy\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The fingerprint classification is an important and effective method to quicken the process and improve the accuracy in the fingerprint matching process. Conventional supervised methods need a large amount of pre-labeled data and thus consume immense human resources. In this paper, we propose a new and efficient unsupervised deep learning method that can extract fingerprint features and classify fingerprint patterns automatically. In this approach, a new model named constraint convolutional auto-encoder (CCAE) is used to extract fingerprint features and a hybrid clustering strategy is applied to obtain the final clusters. A set of experiments in the NIST-DB4 dataset shows that the proposed unsupervised method exhibits the efficient performance on fingerprint classification. For example, the C‚ÄãC‚ÄãA‚ÄãEùê∂ùê∂ùê¥ùê∏CCAE achieves an accuracy of 97.3%percent97.397.3\\% on only 100010001000 unlabeled fingerprints in the NIST-DB4. The code is available at Github.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper.
