      "content": "Paper Title: On the average-case complexity of learning output distributions of quantum circuits\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this work, we show that learning the output distributions of brickwork random quantum circuits is average-case hard in the statistical query model. This learning model is widely used as an abstract computational model for most generic learning algorithms. In particular, for brickwork random quantum circuits on n𝑛n qubits of depth d𝑑d, we show three main results: • At super logarithmic circuit depth d=ω​(log⁡(n))𝑑𝜔𝑛d=\\omega(\\log(n)), any learning algorithm requires super polynomially many queries to achieve a constant probability of success over the randomly drawn instance. • There exists a d=O​(n)𝑑𝑂𝑛d=O(n), such that any learning algorithm requires Ω​(2n)Ωsuperscript2𝑛\\Omega(2^{n}) queries to achieve a O​(2−n)𝑂superscript2𝑛O(2^{-n}) probability of success over the randomly drawn instance. • At infinite circuit depth d→∞→𝑑d\\to\\infty, any learning algorithm requires 22Ω​(n)superscript2superscript2Ω𝑛2^{2^{\\Omega(n)}} many queries to achieve a 2−2Ω​(n)superscript2superscript2Ω𝑛2^{-2^{\\Omega(n)}} probability of success over the randomly drawn instance. As an auxiliary result of independent interest, we show that the output distribution of a brickwork random quantum circuit is constantly far from any fixed distribution in total variation distance with probability 1−O​(2−n)1𝑂superscript2𝑛1-O(2^{-n}), which confirms a variant of a conjecture by Aaronson and Chen.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 69 most likely reference titles for this paper.
