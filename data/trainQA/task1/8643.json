Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: A framework for the emergence and analysis of language in social learning agents\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are increasingly used as research models, but questions remain about their generalizability and representational invariance. Biological neural networks under social constraints evolved to enable communicable representations, demonstrating generalization capabilities. This study proposes a communication protocol between cooperative agents to analyze the formation of individual and shared abstractions and their impact on task performance. This communication protocol aims to mimic language features by encoding high-dimensional information through low-dimensional representation. Using grid-world mazes and reinforcement learning, teacher ANNs pass a compressed message to a student ANN for better task completion. Through this, the student achieves a higher goal-finding rate and generalizes the goal location across task worlds. Further optimizing message content to maximize student reward improves information encoding, suggesting that an accurate representation in the space of messages requires bi-directional input. This highlights the role of language as a common representation between agents and its implications on generalization capabilities.
