Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Explicit Interaction Network for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) aims to recognize targets, their sentiment polarities and opinions explaining the sentiment from a sentence. ASTE could be naturally divided into 3 atom subtasks, namely target detection, opinion detection and sentiment classification. We argue that the proper subtask combination, compositional feature extraction for target-opinion pairs, and interaction between subtasks would be the key to success. Prior work, however, may fail on ‘one-to-many’ or ‘many-to-one’ situations, or derive non-existent sentiment triplets due to defective subtask formulation, sub-optimal feature representation or the lack of subtask interaction. In this paper, we divide ASTE into target-opinion joint detection and sentiment classification subtasks, which is in line with human cognition, and correspondingly utilize sequence encoder and table encoder to handle them. Table encoder extracts sentiment at token-pair level, so that the compositional feature between targets and opinions can be easily captured. To establish explicit interaction between subtasks, we utilize the table representation to guide the sequence encoding, and inject the sequence features back into the table encoder. Experiments show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on six popular ASTE datasets.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
