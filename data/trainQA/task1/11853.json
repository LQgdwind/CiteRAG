Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Equivalence Checking of Quantum Circuits via Intermediary Matrix Product Operator\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract As quantum computing advances, the complexity of quantum circuits is rapidly increasing, driving the need for robust methods to aid in their design. Equivalence checking plays a vital role in identifying errors that may arise during compilation and optimization of these circuits and is a critical step in quantum circuit verification. In this work, we introduce a novel method based on Matrix Product Operators (MPOs) for determining the equivalence of quantum circuits. Our approach contracts tensorized quantum gates from two circuits into an intermediary MPO, exploiting their reversibility to determine their equivalence or non-equivalence. Our results show that this method offers significant scalability improvements over existing methods, with polynomial scaling in circuit width and depth for the practical use cases we explore. We expect that this work sets the new standard for scalable equivalence checking of quantum circuits and will become a crucial tool for the validation of increasingly complex quantum systems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
