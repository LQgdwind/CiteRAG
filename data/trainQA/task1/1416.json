Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Cross-lingual Semantic Role Labeling with Model Transfer\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Prior studies show that cross-lingual semantic role labeling (SRL) can be achieved by model transfer under the help of universal features. In this paper, we fill the gap of cross-lingual SRL by proposing an end-to-end SRL model that incorporates a variety of universal features and transfer methods. We study both the bilingual transfer and multi-source transfer, under gold or machine-generated syntactic inputs, pre-trained high-order abstract features, and contextualized multilingual word representations. Experimental results on the Universal Proposition Bank corpus indicate that performances of the cross-lingual SRL can vary by leveraging different cross-lingual features. In addition, whether the features are gold-standard also has an impact on performances. Precisely, we find that gold syntax features are much more crucial for cross-lingual SRL, compared with the automatically-generated ones. Moreover, universal dependency structure features are able to give the best help, and both pre-trained high-order features and contextualized word representations can further bring significant improvements.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
