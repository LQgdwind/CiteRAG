Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Hierarchical Graph Transformer with Adaptive Node Sampling\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The Transformer architecture has achieved remarkable success in a number of domains including natural language processing and computer vision. However, when it comes to graph-structured data, transformers have not achieved competitive performance, especially on large graphs. In this paper, we identify the main deficiencies of current graph transformers: (1) Existing node sampling strategies in Graph Transformers are agnostic to the graph characteristics and the training process. (2) Most sampling strategies only focus on local neighbors and neglect the long-range dependencies in the graph. We conduct experimental investigations on synthetic datasets to show that existing sampling strategies are sub-optimal. To tackle the aforementioned problems, we formulate the optimization strategies of node sampling in Graph Transformer as an adversary bandit problem, where the rewards are related to the attention weights and can vary in the training procedure. Meanwhile, we propose a hierarchical attention scheme with graph coarsening to capture the long-range interactions while reducing computational complexity. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing graph transformers and popular GNNs. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/zaixizhang/ANS-GT.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 47\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
