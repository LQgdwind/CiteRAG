Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Quantum Speedup for Spectral Approximation of Kronecker Products\n\nPaper Abstract: Given its widespread application in machine learning and optimization, the Kronecker product emerges as a pivotal linear algebra operator. However, its computational demands render it an expensive operation, leading to heightened costs in spectral approximation of it through traditional computation algorithms. Existing classical methods for spectral approximation exhibit a linear dependency on the matrix dimension denoted by nùëõn, considering matrices of size A1‚àà‚Ñùn√ódsubscriptùê¥1superscript‚ÑùùëõùëëA_{1}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d} and A2‚àà‚Ñùn√ódsubscriptùê¥2superscript‚ÑùùëõùëëA_{2}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}. Our work introduces an innovative approach to efficiently address the spectral approximation of the Kronecker product A1‚äóA2tensor-productsubscriptùê¥1subscriptùê¥2A_{1}\\otimes A_{2} using quantum methods. By treating matrices as quantum states, our proposed method significantly reduces the time complexity of spectral approximation to Od,œµ‚Äã(n)subscriptùëÇùëëitalic-œµùëõO_{d,\\epsilon}(\\sqrt{n}).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
