Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 71 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Modern Hopfield Networks for Few- and Zero-Shot Reaction Template Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Finding synthesis routes for molecules of interest is an essential step in the discovery of new drugs and materials. To find such routes, computer-assisted synthesis planning (CASP) methods are employed, which rely on a model of chemical reactivity. In this study, we model single-step retrosynthesis in a template-based approach using modern Hopfield networks (MHNs). We adapt MHNs to associate different modalities, reaction templates and molecules, which allows the model to leverage structural information about reaction templates. This approach significantly improves the performance of template relevance prediction, especially for templates with few or zero training examples. With inference speed several times faster than baseline methods, we improve predictive performance for top-kk\\mathrm{k} exact match accuracy for k≥5k5\\mathrm{k}\\geq 5 in the retrosynthesis benchmark USPTO-50k. Code to reproduce the results will be available at github.com/ml-jku/mhn-react.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 71 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 71\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
