      "content": "Paper Title: Metric Learning Compensating for Projection Bias of Generalized Zero-shot Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Generalized zero-shot learning models (GZSL) aim to recognize samples from seen or unseen classes using only samples from seen classes as training data. During inference, GZSL methods are often biased towards seen classes due to the visibility of seen class samples during training. Most current GZSL methods try to learn an accurate projection function (from visual space to semantic space) to avoid bias and ensure the effectiveness of GZSL methods. However, during inference, the computation of distance will be important when we classify the projection of any sample into its nearest class since we may learn a biased projection function in the model. In our work, we attempt to learn a parameterized Mahalanobis distance within the framework of VAEGAN (Variational Autoencoder & Generative Adversarial Networks), where the weight matrix depends on the network’s output. In particular, we improved the network structure of VAEGAN to leverage the discriminative models of two branches to separately predict the seen samples and the unseen samples generated by this seen one. We proposed a new loss function with two branches to help us learn the optimized Mahalanobis distance representation. Comprehensive evaluation benchmarks on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art counterparts. Our codes are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/111hxr.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
