Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Encoder-decoder multimodal speaker change detection\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The task of speaker change detection (SCD), which detects points where speakers change in an input, is essential for several applications. Several studies solved the SCD task using audio inputs only and have shown limited performance. Recently, multimodal SCD (MMSCD) models, which utilise text modality in addition to audio, have shown improved performance. In this study, the proposed model are built upon two main proposals, a novel mechanism for modality fusion and the adoption of a encoder-decoder architecture. Different to previous MMSCD works that extract speaker embeddings from extremely short audio segments, aligned to a single word, we use a speaker embedding extracted from 1.5s. A transformer decoder layer further improves the performance of an encoder-only MMSCD model. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results among studies that report SCD performance and is also on par with recent work that combines SCD with automatic speech recognition via human transcription.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
