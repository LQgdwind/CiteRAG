      "content": "Paper Title: Nearly Tight Lower Bounds for Succinct Range Minimum Query\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Given an array of distinct integers A​[1​…​n]𝐴delimited-[]1…𝑛A[1\\ldots n], the Range Minimum Query (RMQ) problem requires us to construct a data structure from A𝐴A, supporting the RMQ query: given an interval [a,b]⊆[1,n]𝑎𝑏1𝑛[a,b]\\subseteq[1,n], return the index of the minimum element in subarray A​[a​…​b]𝐴delimited-[]𝑎…𝑏A[a\\ldots b], i.e. return arg​mini∈[a,b]⁡A​[i]subscriptargmin𝑖𝑎𝑏𝐴delimited-[]𝑖\\operatorname*{arg\\,min}_{i\\in[a,b]}A[i]. The fundamental problem has a long history. The textbook solution which uses O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) words of space and O​(1)𝑂1O(1) time by Gabow, Bentley, Tarjan (STOC 1984) and Harel, Tarjan (SICOMP 1984) dates back to 1980s. The state-of-the-art solution is presented by Fischer, Heun (SICOMP 2011) and Navarro, Sadakane (TALG 2014). The solution uses 2​n−1.5​log⁡n+n/(log⁡nt)t+O~​(n3/4)2𝑛1.5𝑛𝑛superscript𝑛𝑡𝑡~𝑂superscript𝑛342n-1.5\\log n+n/\\left(\\frac{\\log n}{t}\\right)^{t}+\\tilde{O}(n^{3/4}) bits of space and O​(t)𝑂𝑡O(t) query time, where the additive O~​(n3/4)~𝑂superscript𝑛34\\tilde{O}(n^{3/4}) is a pre-computed lookup table used in the RAM model, assuming the word-size is Θ​(log⁡n)Θ𝑛\\Theta(\\log n) bits. On the other hand, the only known lower bound is proved by Liu and Yu (STOC 2020). They show that any data structure which solves RMQ in t𝑡t query time must use 2​n−1.5​log⁡n+n/(log⁡n)O​(t2​log2⁡t)2𝑛1.5𝑛𝑛superscript𝑛𝑂superscript𝑡2superscript2𝑡2n-1.5\\log n+n/(\\log n)^{O(t^{2}\\log^{2}t)} bits of space, assuming the word-size is Θ​(log⁡n)Θ𝑛\\Theta(\\log n) bits. In this paper, we prove nearly tight lower bound for this problem. We show that, for any data structure which solves RMQ in t𝑡t query time, 2​n−1.5​log⁡n+n/(log⁡n)O​(t​log2⁡t)2𝑛1.5𝑛𝑛superscript𝑛𝑂𝑡superscript2𝑡2n-1.5\\log n+n/(\\log n)^{O(t\\log^{2}t)} bits of space is necessary in the cell-probe model with word-size Θ​(log⁡n)Θ𝑛\\Theta(\\log n) bits. We emphasize that, in terms of time complexity, our lower bound is tight up to a polylogarithmic factor. From the perspective of data structure lower bound, our proof is a new approach to proving higher worst-case lower bound for succinct data structure problem whose datapoints are “non-evenly” spread over the universe like the RMQ problem, beating the state-of-the-art proofs by compression-based information-theoretical contradiction introduced by Pǎtraşcu, Viola (SODA 2010) and refined by Liu, Yu (STOC 2020).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
