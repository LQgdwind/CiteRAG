Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: A novel Multi to Single Module for small object detection\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Small object detection presents a significant challenge in computer vision and object detection. The performance of small object detectors is often compromised by a lack of pixels and less significant features. This issue stems from information misalignment caused by variations in feature scale and information loss during feature processing. In response to this challenge, this paper proposes a novel the Multi to Single Module (M2S), which enhances a specific layer through improving feature extraction and refining features. Specifically, M2S includes the proposed Cross-scale Aggregation Module (CAM) and explored Dual Relationship Module (DRM) to improve information extraction capabilities and feature refinement effects. Moreover, this paper enhances the accuracy of small object detection by utilizing M2S to generate an additional detection head. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on two datasets, VisDrone2021-DET and SeaDronesSeeV2. The experimental results demonstrate its improved performance compared with existing methods. Compared to the baseline model (YOLOv5s), M2S improves the accuracy by about 1.1% on the VisDrone2021-DET testing dataset and 15.68% on the SeaDronesSeeV2 validation set.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
