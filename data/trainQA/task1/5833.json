Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 60 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Meta Word Embeddings by Unsupervised Weighted Concatenation of Source Embeddings\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Given multiple source word embeddings learnt using diverse algorithms and lexical resources, meta word embedding learning methods attempt to learn more accurate and wide-coverage word embeddings. Prior work on meta-embedding has repeatedly discovered that simple vector concatenation of the source embeddings to be a competitive baseline. However, it remains unclear as to why and when simple vector concatenation can produce accurate meta-embeddings. We show that weighted concatenation can be seen as a spectrum matching operation between each source embedding and the meta-embedding, minimising the pairwise inner-product loss. Following this theoretical analysis, we propose two unsupervised methods to learn the optimal concatenation weights for creating meta-embeddings from a given set of source embeddings. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets show that the proposed weighted concatenated meta-embedding methods outperform previously proposed meta-embedding learning methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper.
