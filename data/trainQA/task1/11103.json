      "content": "Paper Title: A New Information Complexity Measure for Multi-pass Streaming with Applications\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We introduce a new notion of information complexity for multi-pass streaming problems and use it to resolve several important questions in data streams: 1. In the coin problem, one sees a stream of nùëõn i.i.d. uniform bits and one would like to compute the majority with constant advantage. We show that any constant pass algorithm must use Œ©‚Äã(log‚Å°n)Œ©ùëõ\\Omega(\\log n) bits of memory, significantly extending an earlier Œ©‚Äã(log‚Å°n)Œ©ùëõ\\Omega(\\log n) bit lower bound for single-pass algorithms of Braverman-Garg-Woodruff (FOCS, 2020). This also gives the first Œ©‚Äã(log‚Å°n)Œ©ùëõ\\Omega(\\log n) bit lower bound for the problem of approximating a counter up to a constant factor in worst-case turnstile streams for more than one pass. 2. In the needle problem, one either sees a stream of nùëõn i.i.d. uniform samples from a domain [t]delimited-[]ùë°[t], or there is a randomly chosen ‚Äúneedle\" Œ±‚àà[t]ùõºdelimited-[]ùë°\\alpha\\in[t] for which each item independently is chosen to equal Œ±ùõº\\alpha with probability pùëùp, and is otherwise uniformly random in [t]delimited-[]ùë°[t]. The problem of distinguishing these two cases is central to understanding the space complexity of the frequency moment estimation problem in random order streams. We show tight multi-pass space bounds for this problem for every p<1/n‚Äãlog3‚Å°nùëù1ùëõsuperscript3ùëõp<1/\\sqrt{n\\log^{3}n}, resolving an open question of Lovett and Zhang (FOCS, 2023); even for 111-pass our bounds are new. To show optimality, we improve both lower and upper bounds from existing results. Our information complexity framework significantly extends the toolkit for proving multi-pass streaming lower bounds, and we give a wide number of additional streaming applications of our lower bound techniques, including multi-pass lower bounds for ‚Ñìpsubscript‚Ñìùëù\\ell_{p}-norm estimation, ‚Ñìpsubscript‚Ñìùëù\\ell_{p}-point query and heavy hitters, and compressed sensing problems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper.
