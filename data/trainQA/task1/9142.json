      "content": "Paper Title: Mitigating Prior Errors in Causal Structure Learning: Towards LLM driven Prior Knowledge\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Causal structure learning, a prominent technique for encoding cause and effect relationships among variables, through Bayesian Networks (BNs). Merely recovering causal structures from real-world observed data lacks precision, while the development of Large Language Models (LLM) is opening a new frontier of causality. LLM presents strong capability in discovering causal relationships between variables with the \"text\" inputs defining the investigated variables, leading to a potential new hierarchy and new ladder of causality. We aim an critical issue in the emerging topic of LLM based causal structure learning, to tackle erroneous prior causal statements from LLM, which is seldom considered in the current context of expert dominating prior resources. As a pioneer attempt, we propose a BN learning strategy resilient to prior errors without need of human intervention. Focusing on the edge-level prior, we classify the possible prior errors into three types: order-consistent, order-reversed, and irrelevant, and provide their theoretical impact on the Structural Hamming Distance (SHD) under the presumption of sufficient data. Intriguingly, we discover and prove that only the order-reversed error contributes to an increase in a unique acyclic closed structure, defined as a \"quasi-circle\". Leveraging this insight, a post-hoc strategy is employed to identify the order-reversed prior error by its impact on the increment of \"quasi-circles\". Through empirical evaluation on both real and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate our strategy’s robustness against prior errors. Specifically, we highlight its substantial ability to resist order-reversed errors while maintaining the majority of correct prior knowledge.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
