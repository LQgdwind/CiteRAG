Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer.

      "content": "Paper Title: Fine-Grained Complexity of Earth Mover’s Distance under TranslationThis work was initiated at the Workshop on New Directions in Geometric Algorithms, May 14-19 2023, Utrecht, The Netherlands.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The Earth Mover’s Distance is a popular similarity measure in several branches of computer science. It measures the minimum total edge length of a perfect matching between two point sets. The Earth Mover’s Distance under Translation (EMDuTEMDuT\\mathrm{EMDuT}) is a translation-invariant version thereof. It minimizes the Earth Mover’s Distance over all translations of one point set. For EMDuTEMDuT\\mathrm{EMDuT} in ℝ1superscriptℝ1\\mathbb{R}^{1}, we present an 𝒪~​(n2)~𝒪superscript𝑛2\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^{2})-time algorithm. We also show that this algorithm is nearly optimal by presenting a matching conditional lower bound based on the Orthogonal Vectors Hypothesis. For EMDuTEMDuT\\mathrm{EMDuT} in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}, we present an 𝒪~​(n2​d+2)~𝒪superscript𝑛2𝑑2\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^{2d+2})-time algorithm for the L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} and L∞subscript𝐿L_{\\infty} metric. We show that this dependence on d𝑑d is asymptotically tight, as an no​(d)superscript𝑛𝑜𝑑n^{o(d)}-time algorithm for L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} or L∞subscript𝐿L_{\\infty} would contradict the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). Prior to our work, only approximation algorithms were known for these problems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 44\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
