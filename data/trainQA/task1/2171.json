      "content": "Paper Title: Quantum learning algorithms imply circuit lower bounds\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We establish the first general connection between the design of quantum algorithms and circuit lower bounds. Specifically, let ℭℭ\\mathfrak{C} be a class of polynomial-size concepts, and suppose that ℭℭ\\mathfrak{C} can be PAC-learned with membership queries under the uniform distribution with error 1/2−γ12𝛾1/2-\\gamma by a time T𝑇T quantum algorithm. We prove that if γ2⋅T≪2n/nmuch-less-than⋅superscript𝛾2𝑇superscript2𝑛𝑛\\gamma^{2}\\cdot T\\ll 2^{n}/n, then 𝖡𝖰𝖤⊈ℭnot-subset-of-nor-equals𝖡𝖰𝖤ℭ\\mathsf{BQE}\\nsubseteq\\mathfrak{C}, where 𝖡𝖰𝖤=𝖡𝖰𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤​[2O​(n)]𝖡𝖰𝖤𝖡𝖰𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤delimited-[]superscript2𝑂𝑛\\mathsf{BQE}=\\mathsf{BQTIME}[2^{O(n)}] is an exponential-time analogue of 𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖡𝖰𝖯\\mathsf{BQP}. This result is optimal in both γ𝛾\\gamma and T𝑇T, since it is not hard to learn any class ℭℭ\\mathfrak{C} of functions in (classical) time T=2n𝑇superscript2𝑛T=2^{n} (with no error), or in quantum time T=𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​(n)𝑇𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝑛T=\\mathsf{poly}(n) with error at most 1/2−Ω​(2−n/2)12Ωsuperscript2𝑛21/2-\\Omega(2^{-n/2}) via Fourier sampling. In other words, even a marginal quantum speedup over these generic learning algorithms would lead to major consequences in complexity lower bounds. As a consequence, our result shows that the study of quantum learning speedups is intimately connected to fundamental open problems about algorithms, quantum computing, and complexity theory. Our proof builds on several works in learning theory, pseudorandomness, and computational complexity, and on a connection between non-trivial classical learning algorithms and circuit lower bounds established by Oliveira and Santhanam (CCC 2017). Extending their approach to quantum learning algorithms turns out to create significant challenges, since extracting computational hardness from a quantum computation is inherently more complicated. To achieve that, we show among other results how pseudorandom generators imply learning-to-lower-bound connections in a generic fashion, construct the first conditional pseudorandom generator secure against uniform quantum computations, and extend the local list-decoding algorithm of Impagliazzo, Jaiswal, Kabanets and Wigderson (SICOMP 2010) to quantum circuits via a delicate analysis. We believe that these contributions are of independent interest and might find other applications.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper.
