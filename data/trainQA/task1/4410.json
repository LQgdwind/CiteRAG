Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Gaps, Ambiguity, and Establishing Complexity-Class Containments via Iterative Constant-SettingWork supported in part by NSF grant CCF-2006496. Work done in part while Mandar Juvekar, Arian Nadjimzadah, and Patrick A. Phillips were at the University of Rochester‚Äôs Department of Computer Science. A preliminary version of this paper appeared in the proceedings of the 47th International Symposium on Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science (MFCS 2022) [HJNP22].\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Cai and Hemachandra used iterative constant-setting to prove that Few‚äÜ‚äïPFewdirect-sumP{\\rm Few}\\subseteq{\\rm\\oplus P} (and thus that FewP‚äÜ‚äïPFewPdirect-sumP{\\rm FewP}\\subseteq{\\rm\\oplus P}). In this paper, we note that there is a tension between the nondeterministic ambiguity of the class one is seeking to capture, and the density (or, to be more precise, the needed ‚Äúnongappy‚Äù-ness) of the easy-to-find ‚Äútargets‚Äù used in iterative constant-setting. In particular, we show that even less restrictive gap-size upper bounds regarding the targets allow one to capture ambiguity-limited classes. Through a flexible, metatheorem-based approach, we do so for a wide range of classes including the logarithmic-ambiguity version of Valiant‚Äôs unambiguous nondeterminism class UPUP{\\rm UP}. Our work lowers the bar for what advances regarding the existence of infinite, P-printable sets of primes would suffice to show that restricted counting classes based on the primes have the power to accept superconstant-ambiguity analogues of UPUP{\\rm UP}. As an application of our work, we prove that the Lenstra‚ÄìPomerance‚ÄìWagstaff Conjecture implies that all (ùí™‚Äã(1)+log‚Å°log‚Å°n)ùí™1ùëõ({\\cal O}(1)+\\log\\log n)-ambiguity NP sets are in the restricted counting class RCPRIMESsubscriptRCPRIMES{{\\rm RC}_{{{\\rm PRIMES}}}}. Keywords: Structural complexity theory, computational complexity theory, ambiguity-limited NP, restricted counting classes, P-printable sets.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
