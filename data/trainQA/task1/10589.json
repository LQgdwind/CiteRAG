Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: OSSAR: Towards Open-Set Surgical Activity Recognition in Robot-assisted Surgery\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In the realm of automated robotic surgery and computer-assisted interventions, understanding robotic surgical activities stands paramount. Existing algorithms dedicated to surgical activity recognition predominantly cater to pre-defined closed-set paradigms, ignoring the challenges of real-world open-set scenarios. Such algorithms often falter in the presence of test samples originating from classes unseen during training phases. To tackle this problem, we introduce an innovative Open-Set Surgical Activity Recognition (OSSAR) framework. Our solution leverages the hyperspherical reciprocal point strategy to enhance the distinction between known and unknown classes in the feature space. Additionally, we address the issue of over-confidence in the closed set by refining model calibration, avoiding misclassification of unknown classes as known ones. To support our assertions, we establish an open-set surgical activity benchmark utilizing the public JIGSAWS dataset. Besides, we also collect a novel dataset on endoscopic submucosal dissection for surgical activity tasks. Extensive comparisons and ablation experiments on these datasets demonstrate the significant outperformance of our method over existing state-of-the-art approaches. Our proposed solution can effectively address the challenges of real-world surgical scenarios. Our code is publicly accessible at github.com/longbai1006/OSSAR.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
