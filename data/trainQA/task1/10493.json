Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Boosting Long-Delayed Reinforcement Learning with Auxiliary Short-Delayed Task\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Reinforcement learning is challenging in delayed scenarios, a common real-world situation where observations and interactions occur with delays. State-of-the-art (SOTA) state-augmentation techniques either suffer from the state-space explosion along with the delayed steps, or performance degeneration in stochastic environments. To address these challenges, our novel Auxiliary-Delayed Reinforcement Learning (AD-RL) leverages an auxiliary short-delayed task to accelerate the learning on a long-delayed task without compromising the performance in stochastic environments. Specifically, AD-RL learns the value function in the short-delayed task and then employs it with the bootstrapping and policy improvement techniques in the long-delayed task. We theoretically show that this can greatly reduce the sample complexity compared to directly learning on the original long-delayed task. On deterministic and stochastic benchmarks, our method remarkably outperforms the SOTAs in both sample efficiency and policy performance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
