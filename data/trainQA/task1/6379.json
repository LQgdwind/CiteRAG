Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Robust Reinforcement Learning in Continuous Control Tasks with Uncertainty Set Regularization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Reinforcement learning (RL) is recognized as lacking generalization and robustness under environmental perturbations, which excessively restricts its application for real-world robotics. Prior work claimed that adding regularization to the value function is equivalent to learning a robust policy under uncertain transitions. Although the regularization-robustness transformation is appealing for its simplicity and efficiency, it is still lacking in continuous control tasks. In this paper, we propose a new regularizer named Uncertainty Set Regularizer (USR), to formulate the uncertainty set on the parametric space of a transition function. To deal with unknown uncertainty sets, we further propose a novel adversarial approach to generate them based on the value function. We evaluate USR on the Real-world Reinforcement Learning (RWRL) benchmark and the Unitree A1 Robot, demonstrating improvements in the robust performance of perturbed testing environments and sim-to-real scenarios.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
