Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Random Walk on Multiple Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Random Walk is a basic algorithm to explore the structure of networks, which can be used in many tasks, such as local community detection and network embedding. Existing random walk methods are based on single networks that contain limited information. In contrast, real data often contain entities with different types or/and from different sources, which are comprehensive and can be better modeled by multiple networks. To take the advantage of rich information in multiple networks and make better inferences on entities, in this study, we propose random walk on multiple networks, ùñ±ùñ∂ùñ¨ùñ±ùñ∂ùñ¨\\mathsf{RWM}. ùñ±ùñ∂ùñ¨ùñ±ùñ∂ùñ¨\\mathsf{RWM} is flexible and supports both multiplex networks and general multiple networks, which may form many-to-many node mappings between networks. ùñ±ùñ∂ùñ¨ùñ±ùñ∂ùñ¨\\mathsf{RWM} sends a random walker on each network to obtain the local proximity (i.e., node visiting probabilities) w.r.t. the starting nodes. Walkers with similar visiting probabilities reinforce each other. We theoretically analyze the convergence properties of ùñ±ùñ∂ùñ¨ùñ±ùñ∂ùñ¨\\mathsf{RWM}. Two approximation methods with theoretical performance guarantees are proposed for efficient computation. We apply ùñ±ùñ∂ùñ¨ùñ±ùñ∂ùñ¨\\mathsf{RWM} in link prediction, network embedding, and local community detection. Comprehensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ùñ±ùñ∂ùñ¨ùñ±ùñ∂ùñ¨\\mathsf{RWM}.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 60\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
