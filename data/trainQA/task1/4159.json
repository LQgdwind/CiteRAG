Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Lipschitz Continuity Guided Knowledge Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Knowledge distillation has become one of the most important model compression techniques by distilling knowledge from larger teacher networks to smaller student ones. Although great success has been achieved by prior distillation methods via delicately designing various types of knowledge, they overlook the functional properties of neural networks, which makes the process of applying those techniques to new tasks unreliable and non-trivial. To alleviate such problem, in this paper, we initially leverage Lipschitz continuity to better represent the functional characteristic of neural networks and guide the knowledge distillation process. In particular, we propose a novel Lipschitz Continuity Guided Knowledge Distillation framework to faithfully distill knowledge by minimizing the distance between two neural networksâ€™ Lipschitz constants, which enables teacher networks to better regularize student networks and improve the corresponding performance. We derive an explainable approximation algorithm with an explicit theoretical derivation to address the NP-hard problem of calculating the Lipschitz constant. Experimental results have shown that our method outperforms other benchmarks over several knowledge distillation tasks (e.g., classification, segmentation and object detection) on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and PASCAL VOC datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/42Shawn/LONDON/tree/master.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
