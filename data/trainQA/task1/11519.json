Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: MapTune: Advancing ASIC Technology Mapping via Reinforcement Learning Guided Library Tuning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Technology mapping involves mapping logical circuits to a library of cells. Traditionally, the full technology library is used, leading to a large search space and potential overhead. Motivated by randomly sampled technology mapping case studies, we propose MapTune framework that addresses this challenge by utilizing reinforcement learning to make design-specific choices during cell selection. By learning from the environment, MapTune refines the cell selection process, resulting in a reduced search space and potentially improved mapping quality. The effectiveness of MapTune is evaluated on a wide range of benchmarks, different technology libraries and technology mappers. The experimental results demonstrate that MapTune achieves higher mapping accuracy and reducing delay/area across diverse circuit designs, technology libraries and mappers. The paper also discusses the Pareto-Optimal exploration and confirms the perpetual delay-area trade-off. Conducted on benchmark suites ISCAS 85/89, ITC/ISCAS 99, VTR8.0 and EPFL benchmarks, the post-technology mapping and post-sizing quality-of-results (QoR) have been significantly improved, with average Area-Delay Product (ADP) improvement of 22.54% among all different exploration settings in MapTune. The improvements are consistently remained for four different technologies (7nm, 45nm, 130nm, and 180 nm) and two different mappers.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
