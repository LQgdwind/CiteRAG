Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Reliable Evaluations for Natural Language Inference based on a Unified Cross-dataset Benchmark\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recent studies show that crowd-sourced Natural Language Inference (NLI) datasets may suffer from significant biases like annotation artifacts. Models utilizing these superficial clues gain mirage advantages on the in-domain testing set, which makes the evaluation results over-estimated. The lack of trustworthy evaluation settings and benchmarks stalls the progress of NLI research. In this paper, we propose to assess a model’s trustworthy generalization performance with cross-datasets evaluation. We present a new unified cross-datasets benchmark with 14 NLI datasets, and re-evaluate 9 widely-used neural network-based NLI models as well as 5 recently proposed debiasing methods for annotation artifacts. Our proposed evaluation scheme and experimental baselines could provide a basis to inspire future reliable NLI research.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
