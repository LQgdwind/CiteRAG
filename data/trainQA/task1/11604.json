Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: PREMAP: A Unifying PREiMage APproximation Framework for Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Most methods for neural network verification focus on bounding the image, i.e., set of outputs for a given input set. This can be used to, for example, check the robustness of neural network predictions to bounded perturbations of an input. However, verifying properties concerning the preimage, i.e., the set of inputs satisfying an output property, requires abstractions in the input space. We present a general framework for preimage abstraction that produces under- and over-approximations of any polyhedral output set. Our framework employs cheap parameterised linear relaxations of the neural network, together with an anytime refinement procedure that iteratively partitions the input region by splitting on input features and neurons. The effectiveness of our approach relies on carefully designed heuristics and optimization objectives to achieve rapid improvements in the approximation volume. We evaluate our method on a range of tasks, demonstrating significant improvement in efficiency and scalability to high-input-dimensional image classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Further, we showcase the application to quantitative verification and robustness analysis, presenting a sound and complete algorithm for the former and providing sound quantitative results for the latter.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
