Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Strict width for Constraint Satisfaction Problems over homogeneous strucures of finite duality\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. We investigate the ‚Äòlocal consistency implies global consistency‚Äô principle of strict width among structures within the scope of the Bodirsky-Pinsker dichotomy conjecture for infinite-domain Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). Our main result implies that for certain CSP templates within the scope of that conjecture, having bounded strict width has a concrete consequence on the expressive power of the template called implicational simplicity. This in turn yields an explicit bound on the relational width of the CSP, i.e., the amount of local consistency needed to ensure the satisfiability of any instance. Our result applies to first-order expansions of any homogeneous kùëòk-uniform hypergraph, but more generally to any CSP template under the assumption of finite duality and general abstract conditions mainly on its automorphism group. In particular, it overcomes the restriction to binary signatures in the pioneering work [42].\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
