      "content": "Paper Title: Cumulative Distribution Function based General Temporal Point Processes\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Temporal Point Processes (TPPs) hold a pivotal role in modeling event sequences across diverse domains, including social networking and e-commerce, and have significantly contributed to the advancement of recommendation systems and information retrieval strategies. Through the analysis of events such as user interactions and transactions, TPPs offer valuable insights into behavioral patterns, facilitating the prediction of future trends. However, accurately forecasting future events remains a formidable challenge due to the intricate nature of these patterns. The integration of Neural Networks with TPPs has ushered in the development of advanced deep TPP models. While these models excel at processing complex and nonlinear temporal data, they encounter limitations in modeling intensity functions, grapple with computational complexities in integral computations, and struggle to capture long-range temporal dependencies effectively. In this study, we introduce the CuFun model, representing a novel approach to TPPs that revolves around the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF). CuFun stands out by uniquely employing a monotonic neural network for CDF representation, utilizing past events as a scaling factor. This innovation significantly bolsters the model’s adaptability and precision across a wide range of data scenarios. Our approach addresses several critical issues inherent in traditional TPP modeling: it simplifies log-likelihood calculations, extends applicability beyond predefined density function forms, and adeptly captures long-range temporal patterns. Our contributions encompass the introduction of a pioneering CDF-based TPP model, the development of a methodology for incorporating past event information into future event prediction, and empirical validation of CuFun’s effectiveness through extensive experimentation on synthetic and real-world datasets. The CuFun model, with its profound focus on CDFs, marks a paradigm shift in TPP modeling, offering enhanced adaptability, computational efficiency, and versatile applicability. This positions CuFun as a robust choice for real-world applications where the understanding and forecasting of extended temporal sequences hold paramount importance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
