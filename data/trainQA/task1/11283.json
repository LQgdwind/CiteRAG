Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Model-Driven Engineering for Quantum Programming: A Case Study on Ground State Energy Calculation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework that brings together two main Quantum Programming methodologies, gate-based Quantum Computing and Quantum Annealing, by applying the Model-Driven Engineering principles. This aims to enhance the adaptability, design, and scalability of quantum programs, facilitating their design and operation across diverse computing platforms. A notable achievement of this research is the development of a mapping method for programs between gate-based quantum computers and quantum annealers, which can lead to the automatic transformation of these programs. Specifically, this method is applied to the Variational Quantum Eigensolver Algorithm and Quantum Annealing Ising Model, targeting ground state solutions. Finding ground-state solutions is crucial for a wide range of scientific applications, ranging from simulating chemistry lab experiments to medical applications, such as vaccine development. The success of this application demonstrates Model-Driven Engineering for Quantum Programming frameworks’ practical viability and sets a clear path for Quantum Computing’s broader use in solving intricate problems.
