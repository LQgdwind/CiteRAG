Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: ScalableViT: Rethinking the Context-oriented Generalization of Vision Transformer\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The vanilla self-attention mechanism inherently relies on pre-defined and steadfast computational dimensions. Such inflexibility restricts it from possessing context-oriented generalization that can bring more contextual cues and global representations. To mitigate this issue, we propose a Scalable Self-Attention (SSA) mechanism that leverages two scaling factors to release dimensions of q‚Äãu‚Äãe‚Äãr‚Äãyùëûùë¢ùëíùëüùë¶query, k‚Äãe‚Äãyùëòùëíùë¶key, and v‚Äãa‚Äãl‚Äãu‚Äãeùë£ùëéùëôùë¢ùëívalue matrices while unbinding them with the input. This scalability fetches context-oriented generalization and enhances object sensitivity, which pushes the whole network into a more effective trade-off state between accuracy and cost. Furthermore, we propose an Interactive Window-based Self-Attention (IWSA), which establishes interaction between non-overlapping regions by re-merging independent v‚Äãa‚Äãl‚Äãu‚Äãeùë£ùëéùëôùë¢ùëívalue tokens and aggregating spatial information from adjacent windows. By stacking the SSA and IWSA alternately, the Scalable Vision Transformer (ScalableViT) achieves state-of-the-art performance on general-purpose vision tasks. For example, ScalableViT-S outperforms Twins-SVT-S by 1.4% and Swin-T by 1.8% on ImageNet-1K classification.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 54\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
