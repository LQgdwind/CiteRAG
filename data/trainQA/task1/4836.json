Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: 3D Pose Estimation and Future Motion Prediction from 2D Images\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper considers to jointly tackle the highly correlated tasks of estimating 3D human body poses and predicting future 3D motions from RGB image sequences. Based on Lie algebra pose representation, a novel self-projection mechanism is proposed that naturally preserves human motion kinematics. This is further facilitated by a sequence-to-sequence multi-task architecture based on an encoder-decoder topology, which enables us to tap into the common ground shared by both tasks. Finally, a global refinement module is proposed to boost the performance of our framework. The effectiveness of our approach, called PoseMoNet, is demonstrated by ablation tests and empirical evaluations on Human3.6M and HumanEva-I benchmark, where competitive performance is obtained comparing to the state-of-the-arts.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
