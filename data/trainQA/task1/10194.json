      "content": "Paper Title: A Change Point Detection Integrated Remaining Useful Life Estimation Model under Variable Operating Conditions\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract By informing the onset of the degradation process, health status evaluation serves as a significant preliminary step for reliable remaining useful life (RUL) estimation of complex equipment. However, existing works rely on a priori knowledge to roughly identify the starting time of degradation, termed the change point, which overlooks individual degradation characteristics of devices working in variable operating conditions. Consequently, reliable RUL estimation for devices under variable operating conditions is challenging as different devices exhibit heterogeneous and frequently changing degradation dynamics. This paper proposes a novel temporal dynamics learning-based model for detecting change points of individual devices, even under variable operating conditions, and utilises the learnt change points to improve the RUL estimation accuracy. During offline model development, the multivariate sensor data are decomposed to learn fused temporal correlation features that are generalisable and representative of normal operation dynamics across multiple operating conditions. Monitoring statistics and control limit thresholds for normal behaviour are dynamically constructed from these learnt temporal features for the unsupervised detection of device-level change points. The detected change points then inform the degradation data labelling for training a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based RUL estimation model. During online monitoring, the temporal correlation dynamics of a query device is monitored for breach of the control limit derived in offline training. If a change point is detected, the device’s RUL is estimated with the well-trained offline model for early preventive action. Using C-MAPSS turbofan engines as the case study, the proposed method improved the accuracy by 5.6% and 7.5% for two scenarios with six operating conditions, when compared to existing LSTM-based RUL estimation models that do not consider heterogeneous change points.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
