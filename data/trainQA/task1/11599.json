Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 58 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Federated Fairness Analytics: Quantifying Fairness in Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Federated Learning (FL) is a privacy-enhancing technology for distributed ML. By training models locally and aggregating updates - a federation learns together, while bypassing centralised data collection. FL is increasingly popular in healthcare, finance and personal computing. However, it inherits fairness challenges from classical ML and introduces new ones, resulting from differences in data quality, client participation, communication constraints, aggregation methods and underlying hardware. Fairness remains an unresolved issue in FL and the community has identified an absence of succinct definitions and metrics to quantify fairness; to address this, we propose Federated Fairness Analytics - a methodology for measuring fairness. Our definition of fairness comprises four notions with novel, corresponding metrics. They are symptomatically defined and leverage techniques originating from XAI, cooperative game-theory and networking engineering. We tested a range of experimental settings, varying the FL approach, ML task and data settings. The results show that statistical heterogeneity and client participation affect fairness and fairness conscious approaches such as Ditto and q-FedAvg marginally improve fairness-performance trade-offs. Using our techniques, FL practitioners can uncover previously unobtainable insights into their system’s fairness, at differing levels of granularity in order to address fairness challenges in FL. We have open-sourced our work at: https://github.com/oscardilley/federated-fairness. Keywords - Federated Learning, Fairness, XAI, Federated Analytics, Distributed Machine Learning\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 58\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
