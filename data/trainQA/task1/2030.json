Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: An Exploratory Analysis on Users’ Contributions in Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Federated Learning is an emerging distributed collaborative learning paradigm adopted by many of today’s applications, e.g., keyboard prediction and object recognition. Its core principle is to learn from large amount of users data while preserving data privacy by design as collaborative users only need to share the machine learning models and keep data locally. The main challenge for such systems is to provide incentives to users to contribute high-quality models trained from their local data. In this paper, we aim to answer how well incentives recognize (in)accurate local models from honest and malicious users, and perceive their impacts on the model accuracy of federated learning systems. We first present a thorough survey on two contrasting perspectives: incentive mechanisms to measure the contribution of local models by honest users, and malicious users to deliberately degrade the overall model. We conduct simulation experiments to empirically demonstrate if existing contribution measurement schemes can disclose low-quality models from malicious users. Our results show there exists a clear tradeoff among measurement schemes in terms of the computational efficiency and effectiveness to distill the impact of malicious participants. We conclude this paper by discussing the research directions to design resilient contribution incentives.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
