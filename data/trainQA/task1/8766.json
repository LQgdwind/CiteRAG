Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer.

      "content": "Paper Title: Variational Classification: A Probabilistic Generalization of the Softmax Classifier\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present a latent variable model for classification that provides a novel probabilistic interpretation of neural network softmax classifiers. We derive a variational training objective, analogous to the evidence lower bound (ELBO) used to train variational auto-encoders, that generalises the cross-entropy loss used to train classification models. Treating inputs to the softmax layer as samples of a latent variable, our abstracted perspective reveals a potential inconsistency between their anticipated distribution, required for accurate label predictions to be output, and their empirical distribution found in practice. We augment the variational objective to mitigate such inconsistency and encourage a chosen latent distribution, instead of the implicit assumption found in a standard softmax layer. Overall, we provide new theoretical insight into the inner workings of widely-used softmax classifiers. Empirical evaluation on image and text classification datasets demonstrates that our proposed approach, variational classification111Code: www.github.com/shehzaadzd/variational-classification. Review: www.openreview.net/forum?id=EWv9XGOpB3, maintains classification accuracy while the reshaped latent space improves other desirable properties of a classifier, such as calibration, adversarial robustness, robustness to distribution shift and sample efficiency useful in low data settings.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
