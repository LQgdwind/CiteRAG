Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 138 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Systematic Review of Data-to-Text NLG.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This systematic review undertakes a comprehensive analysis of current research on data-to-text generation, identifying gaps, challenges, and future directions within the field. Relevant literature in this field on datasets, evaluation metrics, application areas, multilingualism, language models, and hallucination mitigation methods is reviewed. Various methods for producing high-quality text are explored, addressing the challenge of hallucinations in data-to-text generation. These methods include re-ranking, traditional and neural pipeline architecture, planning architectures, data cleaning, controlled generation, and modification of models and training techniques. Their effectiveness and limitations are assessed, highlighting the need for universally applicable strategies to mitigate hallucinations. The review also examines the usage, popularity, and impact of datasets, alongside evaluation metrics, with an emphasis on both automatic and human assessment. Additionally, the evolution of data-to-text models, particularly the widespread adoption of transformer models, is discussed. Despite advancements in text quality, the review emphasizes the importance of research in low-resourced languages and the engineering of datasets in these languages to promote inclusivity. Finally, several application domains of data-to-text are highlighted, emphasizing their relevance in such domains. Overall, this review serves as a guiding framework for fostering innovation and advancing data-to-text generation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 138 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 138\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
