      "content": "Paper Title: Enhanced Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Models with Progressive Self-supervised Attention Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), many neural models are equipped with an attention mechanism to quantify the contribution of each context word to sentiment prediction. However, such a mechanism suffers from one drawback: a few frequent words with sentiment polarities are tended to be considered while abundant infrequent sentiment words are ignored by the models. To deal with this issue, we propose a progressive self-supervised attention learning approach for attentional ABSA models. We iteratively perform sentiment prediction on all training instances, and continually extract useful attention supervision information in the meantime. Specifically, at each iteration, the context word with the greatest effect on the sentiment prediction, which is identified based on its attention weights or gradient, is extracted as a word with active/misleading influence on the correct/incorrect prediction of every instance. Words extracted in this way are masked for subsequent iterations. To exploit these extracted words for refining ABSA models, we augment the conventional training objective with a regularization term that encourages the models to not only take full advantage of the extracted active context words but also decrease the weights of those misleading words. We integrate the proposed approach into three state-of-the-art neural ABSA models. Experiment results and in-depth analyses show that our approach yields better attention results and significantly enhances the performance of the models. We release the source code and trained models at https://github.com/DeepLearnXMU/PSSAttention.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
