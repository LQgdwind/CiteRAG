Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Assured Learning-enabled Autonomy: A Metacognitive Reinforcement Learning Framework\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Reinforcement learning (RL) agents with pre-specified reward functions cannot provide guaranteed safety across variety of circumstances that an uncertain system might encounter. To guarantee performance while assuring satisfaction of safety constraints across variety of circumstances, an assured autonomous control framework is presented in this paper by empowering RL algorithms with metacognitive learning capabilities. More specifically, adapting the reward function parameters of the RL agent is performed in a metacognitive decision-making layer to assure the feasibility of RL agent. That is, to assure that the learned policy by the RL agent satisfies safety constraints specified by signal temporal logic while achieving as much performance as possible. The metacognitive layer monitors any possible future safety violation under the actions of the RL agent and employs a higher-layer Bayesian RL algorithm to proactively adapt the reward function for the lower-layer RL agent. To minimize the higher-layer Bayesian RL intervention, a fitness function is leveraged by the metacognitive layer as a metric to evaluate success of the lower-layer RL agent in satisfaction of safety and liveness specifications, and the higher-layer Bayesian RL intervenes only if there is a risk of lower-layer RL failure. Finally, a simulation example is provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
