Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Producing 3D Friction Loads by Tracking the Motion of the Contact Point on Bodies in Mutual Contact\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We outline a phenomenological model to assess friction at the interface between two bodies in mutual contact. Although the approach is general, the application inspiring the approach is the Discrete Element Method. The kinematics of the friction process is expressed in terms of the relative 3D motion of the contact point on the two surfaces in mutual contact. The model produces expressions for three friction loads: slide force, roll torque, and spin torque. The cornerstone of the methodology is the process of tracking the evolution/path of the contact point on the surface of the two bodies in mutual contact. The salient attribute of the model lies with its ability to simultaneously compute, in a 3D setup, the slide, roll, and spin friction loads for smooth bodies of arbitrary geometry while accounting for both static and kinematic friction coefficients. Keywords slide friction, roll friction, spin friction, contact history\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
