Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Global Convergence Analysis of Deep Linear Networks with A One-neuron Layer\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we follow Eftekhari [12]â€™s work to give a non-local convergence analysis of deep linear networks. Specifically, we consider optimizing deep linear networks which have a layer with one neuron under quadratic loss. We describe the convergent point of trajectories with arbitrary starting point under gradient flow, including the paths which converge to one of the saddle points or the original point. We also show specific convergence rates of trajectories that converge to the global minimizer by stages. To achieve these results, this paper mainly extends the machinery in [12] to provably identify the rank-stable set and the global minimizer convergent set. We also give specific examples to show the necessity of our definitions. Crucially, as far as we know, our results appear to be the first to give a non-local global analysis of linear neural networks from arbitrary initialized points, rather than the lazy training regime which has dominated the literature of neural networks, and restricted benign initialization in [12]. We also note that extending our results to general linear networks without one hidden neuron assumption remains a challenging open problem.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
