We design a new technique showing that separations of query complexity can be lifted, via communication complexity, to separations of time-space complexity of two-way finite automata. As an application, one of our main results exhibits the first example of a language LùêøL such that the time-space complexity of two-way probabilistic finite automata with a bounded error (2PFA) is Œ©~‚Äã(n2)~Œ©superscriptùëõ2\\widetilde{\\Omega}(n^{2}), while of exact two-way quantum finite automata with classical states (2QCFA) is O~‚Äã(n5/3)~ùëÇsuperscriptùëõ53\\widetilde{O}(n^{5/3}), that is, we demonstrate for the first time that exact quantum computing has an advantage in time-space complexity comparing to classical computing.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
