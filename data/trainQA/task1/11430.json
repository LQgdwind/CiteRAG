Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Low-latency machine learning FPGA accelerator for multi-qubit state discrimination\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Measuring a qubit is a fundamental yet error prone operation in quantum computing. These errors can stem from various sources such as crosstalk, spontaneous state-transitions, and excitation caused by the readout pulse. In this work, we utilize an integrated approach to deploy neural networks (NN) on to field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). We demonstrate that it is practical to design and implement a fully connected neural network accelerator for frequency-multiplexed readout balancing computational complexity with low latency requirements without significant loss in accuracy. The neural network is implemented by quantization of weights, activation functions, and inputs. The hardware accelerator performs frequency-multiplexed readout of 555 superconducting qubits in less than 505050 ns on RFSoC ZCU111 FPGA which is first of its kind in the literature. These modules can be implemented and integrated in existing Quantum control and readout platforms using a RFSoC ZCU111 ready for experimental deployment.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
