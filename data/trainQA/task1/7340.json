Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Explainer Divergence Scores (EDS): Some Post-Hoc Explanations May be Effective for Detecting Unknown Spurious Correlations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recent work has suggested post-hoc explainers might be ineffective for detecting spurious correlations in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, we show there are serious weaknesses with the existing evaluation frameworks for this setting. Previously proposed metrics are extremely difficult to interpret and are not directly comparable between explainer methods. To alleviate these constraints, we propose a new evaluation methodology, Explainer Divergence Scores (EDS), grounded in an information theory approach to evaluate explainers. EDS is easy to interpret and naturally comparable across explainers. We use our methodology to compare the detection performance of three different explainers - feature attribution methods, influential examples and concept extraction, on two different image datasets. We discover post-hoc explainers often contain substantial information about a DNN’s dependence on spurious artifacts, but in ways often imperceptible to human users. This suggests the need for new techniques that can use this information to better detect a DNN’s reliance on spurious correlations.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
