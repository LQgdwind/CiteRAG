Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Knowledge Acquisition Disentanglement for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering with Large Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KVQA) requires both image and world knowledge to answer questions. Current methods first retrieve knowledge from the image and external knowledge base with the original complex question, then generate answers with Large Language Models (LLMs). However, since the original question contains complex elements that require knowledge from different sources, acquiring different kinds of knowledge in a coupled manner may confuse models and hinder them from retrieving precise knowledge. Furthermore, the “forward-only” answering process fails to explicitly capture the knowledge needs of LLMs, which can further hurt answering quality. To cope with the above limitations, we propose DKA: Disentangled Knowledge Acquisition from LLM feedback, a training-free framework that disentangles knowledge acquisition to avoid confusion and uses LLM’s feedback to specify the required knowledge. Specifically, DKA requires LLMs to specify what knowledge they need to answer the question and decompose the original complex question into two simple sub-questions: Image-based sub-question and Knowledge-based sub-question. Then we use the two sub-questions to retrieve knowledge from the image and knowledge base, respectively. In this way, two knowledge acquisition models can focus on the content that corresponds to them and avoid disturbance of irrelevant elements in the original complex question, which can help to provide more precise knowledge and better align the knowledge needs of LLMs to yield correct answers. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that DKA significantly outperforms SOTA models. To facilitate future research, our data and code are available at https://github.com/Lackel/DKA.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
