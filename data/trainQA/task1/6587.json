      "content": "Paper Title: On Good 2-Query Locally Testable Codes from Sheaves on High Dimensional Expanders\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We expose a strong connection between good 222-query locally testable codes (LTCs) and high dimensional expanders. Here, an LTC is called good if it has constant rate and linear distance. Our emphasis in this work is on LTCs testable with only 222 queries. These are are harder to construct than general LTCs, and are of particular interest to theoretical computer science. The connection we make between 222-query LTCs and high dimensional expanders is done by introducing a new object called a sheaf that is put on top of a high dimensional expander. Sheaves are vastly studied in topology. Here, we introduce sheaves on simplicial complexes. Moreover, we define a notion of an expanding sheaf that has not been studied before. We present a framework to get good infinite families of 222-query LTCs from expanding sheaves on high dimensional expanders, utilizing towers of coverings of these high dimensional expanders. Starting with a high dimensional expander and an expanding sheaf, our framework produces an infinite family of codes admitting a 222-query tester. If the initial sheaved high dimensional expander satisfies some conditions, which can be checked in constant time, then these codes form a family of good 222-query LTCs. We give candidates for sheaved high dimensional expanders which can be fed into our framework, in the form of an iterative process which (conjecturally) produces such candidates given a high dimensional expander and a special auxiliary sheaf. (We could not verify the prerequisites of our framework for these candidates directly because of computational limitations.) We analyze this process experimentally and heuristically, and identify some properties of the fundamental group of the high dimensional expander at hand which are sufficient (but not necessary) to get the desired sheaf, and consequently an infinite family of good 222-query LTCs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 62 most likely reference titles for this paper.
