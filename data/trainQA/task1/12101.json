Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Faster Deterministic Algorithm for Mader’s 𝒮-Path Packing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Given an undirected graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) with a set of terminals T⊆V𝑇𝑉T\\subseteq V partitioned into a family 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} of disjoint blocks, find the maximum number of vertex-disjoint paths whose endpoints belong to two distinct blocks while no other internal vertex is a terminal. This problem is called Mader’s 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S}-path packing. It has been of remarkable interest as a common generalization of the non-bipartite matching and vertex-disjoint s​-​t𝑠-𝑡s\\text{-}t paths problem. This paper presents a new deterministic algorithm for this problem via known reduction to linear matroid parity. The algorithm utilizes the augmenting-path algorithm of Gabow and Stallmann (1986), while replacing costly matrix operations between augmentation steps with a faster algorithm that exploits the original 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S}-path packing instance. The proposed algorithm runs in O​(m​n​k)𝑂𝑚𝑛𝑘O(mnk) time, where n=|V|𝑛𝑉n=|V|, m=|E|𝑚𝐸m=|E|, and k=|T|≤n𝑘𝑇𝑛k=|T|\\leq n. This improves on the previous best bound O​(m​nω)𝑂𝑚superscript𝑛𝜔O(mn^{\\omega}) for deterministic algorithms, where ω≥2𝜔2\\omega\\geq 2 denotes the matrix multiplication exponent.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
