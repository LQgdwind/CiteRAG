Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: QuadConv: Quadrature-Based Convolutions with Applications to Non-Uniform PDE Data Compression\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present a new convolution layer for deep learning architectures which we call QuadConv ‚Äî an approximation to continuous convolution via quadrature. Our operator is developed explicitly for use on non-uniform, mesh-based data, and accomplishes this by learning a continuous kernel that can be sampled at arbitrary locations. Moreover, the construction of our operator admits an efficient implementation which we detail and construct. As an experimental validation of our operator, we consider the task of compressing partial differential equation (PDE) simulation data from fixed meshes. We show that QuadConv can match the performance of standard discrete convolutions on uniform grid data by comparing a QuadConv autoencoder (QCAE) to a standard convolutional autoencoder (CAE). Further, we show that the QCAE can maintain this accuracy even on non-uniform data. In both cases, QuadConv also outperforms alternative unstructured convolution methods such as graph convolution.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
