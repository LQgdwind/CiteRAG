Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Threshold Breaker: Can Counter-Based RowHammer Prevention Mechanisms Truly Safeguard DRAM?\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. This paper challenges the existing victim-focused counter-based RowHammer detection mechanisms by experimentally demonstrating a novel multi-sided fault injection attack technique called Threshold Breaker. This mechanism can effectively bypass the most advanced counter-based defense mechanisms by soft-attacking the rows at a farther physical distance from the target rows. While no prior work has demonstrated the effect of such an attack, our work closes this gap by systematically testing 128 real commercial DDR4 DRAM products and reveals that the Threshold Breaker affects various chips from major DRAM manufacturers. As a case study, we compare the performance efficiency between our mechanism and a well-known double-sided attack by performing adversarial weight attacks on a modern Deep Neural Network (DNN). The results demonstrate that the Threshold Breaker can deliberately deplete the intelligence of the targeted DNN system while DRAM is fully protected.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
