      "content": "Paper Title: Euclidean-Norm-Induced Schatten-p Quasi-Norm Regularization for Low-Rank Tensor Completion and Tensor Robust Principal Component Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The nuclear norm and Schatten-pùëùp quasi-norm are popular rank proxies in low-rank matrix recovery. However, computing the nuclear norm or Schatten-pùëùp quasi-norm of a tensor is hard in both theory and practice, hindering their application to low-rank tensor completion (LRTC) and tensor robust principal component analysis (TRPCA). In this paper, we propose a new class of tensor rank regularizers based on the Euclidean norms of the CP component vectors of a tensor and show that these regularizers are monotonic transformations of tensor Schatten-pùëùp quasi-norm. This connection enables us to minimize the Schatten-pùëùp quasi-norm in LRTC and TRPCA implicitly via the component vectors. The method scales to big tensors and provides an arbitrarily sharper rank proxy for low-rank tensor recovery compared to the nuclear norm. On the other hand, we study the generalization abilities of LRTC with the Schatten-pùëùp quasi-norm regularizer and LRTC with the proposed regularizers. The theorems show that a relatively sharper regularizer leads to a tighter error bound, which is consistent with our numerical results. Particularly, we prove that for LRTC with Schatten-pùëùp quasi-norm regularizer on dùëëd-order tensors, p=1/dùëù1ùëëp=1/d is always better than any p>1/dùëù1ùëëp>1/d in terms of the generalization ability. We also provide a recovery error bound to verify the usefulness of small pùëùp in the Schatten-pùëùp quasi-norm for TRPCA. Numerical results on synthetic data and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the regularization methods and theorems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper.
