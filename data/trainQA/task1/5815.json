Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Policy regret is a well established notion of measuring the performance of an online learning algorithm against an adaptive adversary. We study restrictions on the adversary that enable efficient minimization of the complete policy regret, which is the strongest possible version of policy regret. We identify a gap in the current theoretical understanding of what sorts of restrictions permit tractability in this challenging setting. To resolve this gap, we consider a generalization of the stochastic multi armed bandit, which we call the tallying bandit. This is an online learning setting with an mùëöm-memory bounded adversary, where the average loss for playing an action is an unknown function of the number (or tally) of times that the action was played in the last mùëöm timesteps. For tallying bandit problems with KùêæK actions and time horizon TùëáT, we provide an algorithm that w.h.p achieves a complete policy regret guarantee of ùí™~‚Äã(m‚ÄãK‚ÄãT)~ùí™ùëöùêæùëá\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(mK\\sqrt{T}), where the ùí™~~ùí™\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}} notation hides only logarithmic factors. We additionally prove an Œ©~‚Äã(m‚ÄãK‚ÄãT)~Œ©ùëöùêæùëá\\widetilde{\\Omega}(\\sqrt{mKT}) lower bound on the expected complete policy regret of any tallying bandit algorithm, demonstrating the near optimality of our method.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
