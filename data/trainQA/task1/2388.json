Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: To do or not to do: cost-sensitive causal decision-making\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Causal classification models are adopted across a variety of operational business processes to predict the effect of a treatment on a categorical business outcome of interest depending on the process instance characteristics. This allows optimizing operational decision-making and selecting the optimal treatment to apply in each specific instance, with the aim of maximizing the positive outcome rate. While various powerful approaches have been presented in the literature for learning causal classification models, no formal framework has been elaborated for optimal decision-making based on the estimated individual treatment effects, given the cost of the various treatments and the benefit of the potential outcomes. In this article, we therefore extend upon the expected value framework and formally introduce a cost-sensitive decision boundary for double binary causal classification, which is a linear function of the estimated individual treatment effect, the positive outcome probability and the cost and benefit parameters of the problem setting. The boundary allows causally classifying instances in the positive and negative treatment class to maximize the expected causal profit, which is introduced as the objective at hand in cost-sensitive causal classification. We introduce the expected causal profit ranker which ranks instances for maximizing the expected causal profit at each possible threshold for causally classifying instances and differs from the conventional ranking approach based on the individual treatment effect. The proposed ranking approach is experimentally evaluated on synthetic and marketing campaign data sets. The results indicate that the presented ranking method effectively outperforms the cost-insensitive ranking approach and allows boosting profitability.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
