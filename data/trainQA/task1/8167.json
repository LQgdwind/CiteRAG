      "content": "Paper Title: Rotation Invariant Quantization for Model Compression\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Post-training Neural Network (NN) model compression is an attractive approach for deploying large, memory-consuming models on devices with limited memory resources. In this study, we investigate the rate-distortion tradeoff for NN model compression. First, we suggest a Rotation-Invariant Quantization (RIQ) technique that utilizes a single parameter to quantize the entire NN model, yielding a different rate at each layer, i.e., mixed-precision quantization. Then, we prove that our rotation-invariant approach is optimal in terms of compression. We rigorously evaluate RIQ and demonstrate its capabilities on various models and tasks. For example, RIQ facilitates ×19.4absent19.4\\times 19.4 and ×52.9absent52.9\\times 52.9 compression ratios on pre-trained VGG dense and pruned models, respectively, with <0.4%absentpercent0.4<0.4\\% accuracy degradation. Code is available in github.com/ehaleva/RIQ.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
