      "content": "Paper Title: Credit Assignment: Challenges and Opportunities in Developing Human-like AI Agents\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Temporal credit assignment is the process by which a delayed outcome is associated with each of the actions in a sequence. This process is essential for learning and skill development, and it is a learning challenge for natural and artificial intelligence. Computational approaches propose mechanisms to address delayed feedback; a prominent example is the temporal difference (TD) method in reinforcement learning (e.g., Q-learning). However, it is unclear whether these mechanisms are accurate representations of the way humans handle feedback delays. Cognitive models intend to represent the mental steps by which humans solve problems and perform a number of tasks, but limited research in cognitive science has addressed the credit assignment problem in humans and cognitive models. Our research presents results from various credit assignment mechanisms implemented into a cognitive model based on a theory of decisions from experience, Instance-Based Learning Theory (IBLT). We use a goal-seeking navigation task with feedback delays to represent different levels of decision complexity. Instance-Based Learning (IBL) models simulate the process of making sequential choices with different credit assignment mechanisms, including a new IBL-TD model that combines the IBL decision mechanism with the TD approach. Results from these models are compared to the outcomes and process measures of human decisions in two experiments. From these comparisons, we conclude that: (1) An IBL model that gives equal credit assignment to all decisions is able to match human performance better than other models, including IBL-TD and Q-learning; (2) IBL-TD and Q-learning models underperform compared to humans initially, but eventually, they outperform humans; (3) humans are influenced by decision complexity, while models are not. Detailed analyses of human and model behavior provide insights into the challenges ahead for capturing human behavior, and the potential opportunities to use these models for supporting human activities in future AI systems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
