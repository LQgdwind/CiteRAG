Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Lipschitzian Global Optimization of H√∂lder Continuous Multivariate Functions\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This study presents an effective global optimization technique designed for multivariate functions that are H√∂lder continuous. Unlike traditional methods that construct lower bounding proxy functions, this algorithm employs a predetermined query creation rule that makes it computationally superior. The algorithm‚Äôs performance is assessed using the average or cumulative regret, which also implies a bound for the simple regret and reflects the overall effectiveness of the approach. The results show that with appropriate parameters the algorithm attains an average regret bound of O‚Äã(T‚àíŒ±n)ùëÇsuperscriptùëáùõºùëõO(T^{-\\frac{\\alpha}{n}}) for optimizing a H√∂lder continuous target function with H√∂lder exponent Œ±ùõº\\alpha in an nùëõn-dimensional space within a given time horizon TùëáT. We demonstrate that this bound is minimax optimal.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
