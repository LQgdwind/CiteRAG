      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Constrained Field Development Optimization in Subsurface Two-phase Flow\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Oil and gas field development optimization, which involves the determination of the optimal number of wells, their drilling sequence and locations while satisfying operational and economic constraints, represents a challenging computational problem. In this work, we present a deep reinforcement learning-based artificial intelligence agent that could provide optimized development plans given a basic description of the reservoir and rock/fluid properties with minimal computational cost. This artificial intelligence agent, comprising of a convolutional neural network, provides a mapping from a given state of the reservoir model, constraints, and economic condition to the optimal decision (drill/do not drill and well location) to be taken in the next stage of the defined sequential field development planning process. The state of the reservoir model is defined using parameters that appear in the governing equations of the two-phase flow (such as well index, transmissibility, fluid mobility, and accumulation, etc.). A feedback loop training process referred to as deep reinforcement learning is used to train an artificial intelligence agent with such a capability. The training entails millions of flow simulations with varying reservoir model descriptions (structural, rock and fluid properties), operational constraints (maximum liquid production, drilling duration, and water-cut limit), and economic conditions. The parameters that define the reservoir model, operational constraints, and economic conditions are randomly sampled from a defined range of applicability. Several algorithmic treatments are introduced to enhance the training of the artificial intelligence agent. After appropriate training, the artificial intelligence agent provides an optimized field development plan instantly for new scenarios within the defined range of applicability. This approach has advantages over traditional optimization algorithms (e.g., particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm) that are generally used to find a solution for a specific field development scenario and typically not generalizable to different scenarios. The performance of the artificial intelligence agents for two- and three-dimensional subsurface flow are compared to well-pattern agents. Optimization results using the new procedure are shown to significantly outperform those from the well pattern agents. Compared to prior work on this topic such as He et al. (2021), the novelties in this work include: • Extended the problem description from single-phase flow to two-phase flow, and thus allowing for handling of reservoirs with strong aquifers and waterflooding problems. • Redesigned deep network neural network architecture for better performance. • Extended to handle operational constraints such as maximum liquid production, drilling duration and water-cut limit. • Extended to three-dimensional reservoir model.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
