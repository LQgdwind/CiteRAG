Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: VILAS: EXPLORING THE EFFECTS OF VISION AND LANGUAGE CONTEXT IN AUTOMATIC SPEECH RECOGNITION\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Enhancing automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance by leveraging additional multimodal information has shown promising results in previous studies. However, most of these works have primarily focused on utilizing visual cues derived from human lip motions. In fact, context-dependent visual and linguistic cues can also benefit in many scenarios. In this paper, we first propose ViLaS (Vision and Language into Automatic Speech Recognition), a novel multimodal ASR model based on the continuous integrate-and-fire (CIF) mechanism, which can integrate visual and textual context simultaneously or separately, to facilitate speech recognition. Next, we introduce an effective training strategy that improves performance in modal-incomplete test scenarios. Then, to explore the effects of integrating vision and language, we create VSDial, a multimodal ASR dataset with multimodal context cues in both Chinese and English versions. Finally, empirical results are reported on the public Flickr8K and self-constructed VSDial datasets. We explore various cross-modal fusion schemes, analyze fine-grained cross-modal alignment on VSDial, and provide insights into the effects of integrating multimodal information on speech recognition.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
