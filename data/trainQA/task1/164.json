Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study the fixed-support Wasserstein barycenter problem (FS-WBP), which consists in computing the Wasserstein barycenter of m𝑚m discrete probability measures supported on a finite metric space of size n𝑛n. We show first that the constraint matrix arising from the standard linear programming (LP) representation of the FS-WBP is not totally unimodular when m≥3𝑚3m\\geq 3 and n≥3𝑛3n\\geq 3. This result resolves an open question pertaining to the relationship between the FS-WBP and the minimum-cost flow (MCF) problem since it proves that the FS-WBP in the standard LP form is not an MCF problem when m≥3𝑚3m\\geq 3 and n≥3𝑛3n\\geq 3. We also develop a provably fast deterministic variant of the celebrated iterative Bregman projection (IBP) algorithm, named FastIBP, with a complexity bound of O~​(m​n7/3​ε−4/3)~𝑂𝑚superscript𝑛73superscript𝜀43\\widetilde{O}(mn^{7/3}\\varepsilon^{-4/3}), where ε∈(0,1)𝜀01\\varepsilon\\in(0,1) is the desired tolerance. This complexity bound is better than the best known complexity bound of O~​(m​n2​ε−2)~𝑂𝑚superscript𝑛2superscript𝜀2\\widetilde{O}(mn^{2}\\varepsilon^{-2}) for the IBP algorithm in terms of ε𝜀\\varepsilon, and that of O~​(m​n5/2​ε−1)~𝑂𝑚superscript𝑛52superscript𝜀1\\widetilde{O}(mn^{5/2}\\varepsilon^{-1}) from accelerated alternating minimization algorithm or accelerated primal-dual adaptive gradient algorithm in terms of n𝑛n. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments with both synthetic data and real images and demonstrate the favorable performance of the FastIBP algorithm in practice.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
