      "content": "Paper Title: Unique Games hardness of Quantum Max-Cut, and a conjectured vector-valued Borell’s inequality\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The Gaussian noise stability of a function f:ℝn→{−1,1}:𝑓→superscriptℝ𝑛11f:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\{-1,1\\} is the expected value of f​(𝒙)⋅f​(𝒚)⋅𝑓𝒙𝑓𝒚f({\\boldsymbol{x}})\\cdot f(\\boldsymbol{y}) over ρ𝜌\\rho-correlated Gaussian random variables 𝒙𝒙{\\boldsymbol{x}} and 𝒚𝒚\\boldsymbol{y}. Borell’s inequality states that for −1≤ρ≤01𝜌0-1\\leq\\rho\\leq 0, this is minimized by the mean-zero halfspace f​(x)=sign​(x1)𝑓𝑥signsubscript𝑥1f(x)=\\mathrm{sign}(x_{1}). In this work, we conjecture that a natural generalization of this result holds for functions f:ℝn→Sk−1:𝑓→superscriptℝ𝑛superscript𝑆𝑘1f:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow S^{k-1} which output k𝑘k-dimensional unit vectors. Our main conjecture, which we call the vector-valued Borell’s inequality, asserts that the expectation 𝐄𝒙∼ρ𝒚⟨f​(𝒙),f​(𝒚)⟩subscript𝐄subscriptsimilar-to𝜌𝒙𝒚𝑓𝒙𝑓𝒚\\mathop{\\bf E\\/}_{{\\boldsymbol{x}}\\sim_{\\rho}\\boldsymbol{y}}\\langle f({\\boldsymbol{x}}),f(\\boldsymbol{y})\\rangle is minimized by the function f​(x)=x≤k/‖x≤k‖𝑓𝑥subscript𝑥absent𝑘normsubscript𝑥absent𝑘f(x)=x_{\\leq k}/\\|x_{\\leq k}\\|, where x≤k=(x1,…,xk)subscript𝑥absent𝑘subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑘x_{\\leq k}=(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{k}). We give several pieces of evidence in favor of this conjecture, including a proof that it does indeed hold in the special case of n=k𝑛𝑘n=k. As an application of this conjecture, we show that it implies several hardness of approximation results for a special case of the local Hamiltonian problem related to the anti-ferromagnetic Heisenberg model known as Quantum Max-Cut. This can be viewed as a natural quantum analogue of the classical Max-Cut problem and has been proposed as a useful testbed for developing algorithms. We show the following, assuming the vector-valued Borell’s inequality: 1. There exists an integrality gap of 0.4980.4980.498 for the basic SDP, matching the rounding algorithm of Gharibian and Parekh [GP19]. Combined with the work of Anshu, Gosset, and Morenz [AGM20], this shows that the basic SDP does not achieve the optimal approximation ratio. 2. It is Unique Games-hard (UG-hard) to compute a (0.956+ϵ)0.956italic-ϵ(0.956+\\epsilon)-approximation to the value of the best product state, matching an approximation algorithm due to Briët, Oliveira, and Vallentin [BdOFV10]. 3. It is UG-hard to compute a (0.956+ϵ)0.956italic-ϵ(0.956+\\epsilon)-approximation to the value of the best (possibly entangled) state. Our results also apply to the problem of Rank-k𝑘k Max-Cut considered by Briët, Oliveira, and Vallentin [BdOFV10] and show that it is UG-hard to outperform their approximation algorithm for any fixed k𝑘k, again assuming our conjecture.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper.
