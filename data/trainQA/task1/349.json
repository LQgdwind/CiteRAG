Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

When t=1ùë°1t=1, this corresponds to the œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-net problem. We prove that any sufficiently large hypergraph with VC-dimension dùëëd admits an œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-tùë°t-net of size O‚Äã((1+log‚Å°t)‚Äãdœµ‚Äãlog‚Å°1œµ)ùëÇ1ùë°ùëëitalic-œµ1italic-œµO(\\frac{(1+\\log t)d}{\\epsilon}\\log\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}). For some families of geometrically-defined hypergraphs (such as the dual hypergraph of regions with linear union complexity), we prove the existence of O‚Äã(1œµ)ùëÇ1italic-œµO(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})-sized œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-tùë°t-nets. We also present an explicit construction of œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-tùë°t-nets (including œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-nets) for hypergraphs with bounded VC-dimension. In comparison to previous constructions for the special case of œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-nets (i.e., for t=1ùë°1t=1), it does not rely on advanced derandomization techniques. To this end we introduce a variant of the notion of VC-dimension which is of independent interest.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
