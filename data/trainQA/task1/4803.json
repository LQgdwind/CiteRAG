      "content": "Paper Title: ACR-Pose: Adversarial Canonical Representation Reconstruction Network for Category Level 6D Object Pose Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recently, category-level 6D object pose estimation has achieved significant improvements with the development of reconstructing canonical 3D representations. However, the reconstruction quality of existing methods is still far from excellent. In this paper, we propose a novel Adversarial Canonical Representation Reconstruction Network named ACR-Pose. ACR-Pose consists of a Reconstructor and a Discriminator. The Reconstructor is primarily composed of two novel sub-modules: Pose-Irrelevant Module (PIM) and Relational Reconstruction Module (RRM). PIM tends to learn canonical-related features to make the Reconstructor insensitive to rotation and translation, while RRM explores essential relational information between different input modalities to generate high-quality features. Subsequently, a Discriminator is employed to guide the Reconstructor to generate realistic canonical representations. The Reconstructor and the Discriminator learn to optimize through adversarial training. Experimental results on the prevalent NOCS-CAMERA and NOCS-REAL datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 56\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
