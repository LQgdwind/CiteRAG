Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data.

      "content": "Paper Title: Near-Optimal Quantum Coreset Construction Algorithms for Clustering\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract k𝑘k-Clustering in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} (e.g., k𝑘k-median and k𝑘k-means) is a fundamental machine learning problem. While near-linear time approximation algorithms were known in the classical setting for a dataset with cardinality n𝑛n, it remains open to find sublinear-time quantum algorithms. We give quantum algorithms that find coresets for k𝑘k-clustering in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} with O~​(n​k​d3/2)~𝑂𝑛𝑘superscript𝑑32\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{nk}d^{3/2}) query complexity. Our coreset reduces the input size from n𝑛n to poly​(k​ε−1​d)poly𝑘superscript𝜀1𝑑\\mathrm{poly}(k\\varepsilon^{-1}d), so that existing α𝛼\\alpha-approximation algorithms for clustering can run on top of it and yield (1+ε)​α1𝜀𝛼(1+\\varepsilon)\\alpha-approximation. This eventually yields a quadratic speedup for various k𝑘k-clustering approximation algorithms. We complement our algorithm with a nearly matching lower bound, that any quantum algorithm must make Ω​(n​k)Ω𝑛𝑘\\Omega(\\sqrt{nk}) queries in order to achieve even O​(1)𝑂1O(1)-approximation for k𝑘k-clustering.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
