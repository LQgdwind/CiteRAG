Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Video Domain Adaptation for Action Recognition: A Disentanglement Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Unsupervised video domain adaptation is a practical yet challenging task. In this work, for the first time, we tackle it from a disentanglement view. Our key idea is to handle the spatial and temporal domain divergence separately through disentanglement. Specifically, we consider the generation of cross-domain videos from two sets of latent factors, one encoding the static information and another encoding the dynamic information. A Transfer Sequential VAE (TranSVAE) framework is then developed to model such generation. To better serve for adaptation, we propose several objectives to constrain the latent factors. With these constraints, the spatial divergence can be readily removed by disentangling the static domain-specific information out, and the temporal divergence is further reduced from both frame- and video-levels through adversarial learning. Extensive experiments on the UCF-HMDB, Jester, and Epic-Kitchens datasets verify the effectiveness and superiority of TranSVAE compared with several state-of-the-art approaches.111Code is publicly available at: https://github.com/ldkong1205/TranSVAE\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
