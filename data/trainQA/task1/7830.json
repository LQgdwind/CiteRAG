Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: An order out of nowhere: a new algorithm for infinite-domain CSPs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. We consider the problem of satisfiability of sets of constraints in a given set of finite uniform hypergraphs. While the problem under consideration is similar in nature to the problem of satisfiability of constraints in graphs, the classical complexity reduction to finite-domain CSPs that was used in the proof of the complexity dichotomy for such problems cannot be used as a black box in our case. We therefore introduce an algorithmic technique inspired by classical notions from the theory of finite-domain CSPs, and prove its correctness based on symmetries that depend on a linear order that is external to the structures under consideration. Our second main result is a P/NP-complete complexity dichotomy for such problems over many sets of uniform hypergraphs. The proof is based on the translation of the problem into the framework of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) over infinite uniform hypergraphs. Our result confirms in particular the Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture for CSPs of first-order reducts of some homogeneous hypergraphs. This forms a vast generalization of previous work by Bodirsky-Pinsker (STOC‚Äô11) and Bodirsky-Martin-Pinsker-Pongr√°cz (ICALP‚Äô16) on graph satisfiability.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
