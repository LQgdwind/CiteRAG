Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: NeuralMatrix: Compute the Entire Neural Networks with Linear Matrix Operations for Efficient Inference\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The inherent diversity of computation types within individual Deep Neural Network (DNN) models imposes a corresponding need for a varied set of computation units within hardware processors. This diversity poses a significant constraint on computation efficiency during the execution of different neural networks. In this study, we present NeuralMatrix, a framework that transforms the computation of entire DNNs into linear matrix operations. This transformation seamlessly enables the execution of various DNN models using a single General-Purpose Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) accelerator. Extensive experimental results spanning different DNN models demonstrate that our approach preserves network accuracy while providing both generality and application-specific levels of computation efficiency. This allows a broad spectrum of DNN models to be executed using a single GEMM accelerator, eliminating the need for additional special function units.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
