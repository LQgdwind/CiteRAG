Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: An Interpretive Constrained Linear Model for ResNet and MgNet\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We propose a constrained linear data-feature-mapping model as an interpretable mathematical model for image classification using a convolutional neural network (CNN). From this viewpoint, we establish detailed connections between the traditional iterative schemes for linear systems and the architectures of the basic blocks of ResNet- and MgNet-type models. Using these connections, we present some modified ResNet models that compared with the original models have fewer parameters and yet can produce more accurate results, thereby demonstrating the validity of this constrained learning data-feature-mapping assumption. Based on this assumption, we further propose a general data-feature iterative scheme to show the rationality of MgNet. We also provide a systematic numerical study on MgNet to show its success and advantages in image classification problems and demonstrate its advantages in comparison with established networks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
