      "content": "Paper Title: Synthetic-to-Real Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Scene Text Detection in the Wild\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep learning-based scene text detection can achieve preferable performance, powered with sufficient labeled training data. However, manual labeling is time consuming and laborious. At the extreme, the corresponding annotated data are unavailable. Exploiting synthetic data is a very promising solution except for domain distribution mismatches between synthetic datasets and real datasets. To address the severe domain distribution mismatch, we propose a synthetic-to-real domain adaptation method for scene text detection, which transfers knowledge from synthetic data (source domain) to real data (target domain). In this paper, a text self-training (TST) method and adversarial text instance alignment (ATA) for domain adaptive scene text detection are introduced. ATA helps the network learn domain-invariant features by training a domain classifier in an adversarial manner. TST diminishes the adverse effects of false positives (FPs) and false negatives (FNs) from inaccurate pseudo-labels. Two components have positive effects on improving the performance of scene text detectors when adapting from synthetic-to-real scenes. We evaluate the proposed method by transferring from SynthText, VISD to ICDAR2015, ICDAR2013. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with up to 10%percent1010\\% improvement, which has important exploration significance for domain adaptive scene text detection.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 48\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
