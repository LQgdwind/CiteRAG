      "content": "Paper Title: One-Shot Action Recognition via Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Skeleton Matching\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract One-shot skeleton action recognition, which aims to learn a skeleton action recognition model with a single training sample, has attracted increasing interest due to the challenge of collecting and annotating large-scale skeleton action data. However, most existing studies match skeleton sequences by comparing their feature vectors directly which neglects spatial structures and temporal orders of skeleton data. This paper presents a novel one-shot skeleton action recognition technique that handles skeleton action recognition via multi-scale spatial-temporal feature matching. We represent skeleton data at multiple spatial and temporal scales and achieve optimal feature matching from two perspectives. The first is multi-scale matching which captures the scale-wise semantic relevance of skeleton data at multiple spatial and temporal scales simultaneously. The second is cross-scale matching which handles different motion magnitudes and speeds by capturing sample-wise relevance across multiple scales. Extensive experiments over three large-scale datasets (NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD) show that our method achieves superior one-shot skeleton action recognition, and outperforms SOTA consistently by large margins.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
