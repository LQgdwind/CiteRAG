      "content": "Paper Title: FollowNet: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Car-Following Behavior Modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Car-following is a control process in which a following vehicle (FV) adjusts its acceleration to keep a safe distance from the lead vehicle (LV). Recently, there has been a booming of data-driven models that enable more accurate modeling of car-following through real-world driving datasets. Although there are several public datasets available, their formats are not always consistent, making it challenging to determine the state-of-the-art models and how well a new model performs compared to existing ones. In contrast, research fields such as image recognition and object detection have benchmark datasets like ImageNet, Microsoft COCO, and KITTI. To address this gap and promote the development of microscopic traffic flow modeling, we establish a public benchmark dataset for car-following behavior modeling. The benchmark consists of more than 80K car-following events extracted from five public driving datasets using the same criteria. These events cover diverse situations including different road types, various weather conditions, and mixed traffic flows with autonomous vehicles. Moreover, to give an overview of current progress in car-following modeling, we implemented and tested representative baseline models with the benchmark. Results show that the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based model performs competitively with a lower MSE for spacing compared to traditional intelligent driver model (IDM) and Gazis-Herman-Rothery (GHR) models, and a smaller collision rate compared to fully connected neural network (NN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models in most datasets. The established benchmark will provide researchers with consistent data formats and metrics for cross-comparing different car-following models, promoting the development of more accurate models. We open-source our dataset and implementation code in https://github.com/HKUST-DRIVE-AI-LAB/FollowNet.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 52\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
