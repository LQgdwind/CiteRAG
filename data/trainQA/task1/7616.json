      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Latent Representations to Co-Adapt to Humans\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract When robots interact with humans in homes, roads, or factories the human’s behavior often changes in response to the robot. Non-stationary humans are challenging for robot learners: actions the robot has learned to coordinate with the original human may fail after the human adapts to the robot. In this paper we introduce an algorithmic formalism that enables robots (i.e., ego agents) to co-adapt alongside dynamic humans (i.e., other agents) using only the robot’s low-level states, actions, and rewards. A core challenge is that humans not only react to the robot’s behavior, but the way in which humans react inevitably changes both over time and between users. To deal with this challenge, our insight is that — instead of building an exact model of the human — robots can learn and reason over high-level representations of the human’s policy and policy dynamics. Applying this insight we develop RILI: Robustly Influencing Latent Intent. RILI first embeds low-level robot observations into predictions of the human’s latent strategy and strategy dynamics. Next, RILI harnesses these predictions to select actions that influence the adaptive human towards advantageous, high reward behaviors over repeated interactions. We demonstrate that — given RILI’s measured performance with users sampled from an underlying distribution — we can probabilistically bound RILI’s expected performance across new humans sampled from the same distribution. Our simulated experiments compare RILI to state-of-the-art representation and reinforcement learning baselines, and show that RILI better learns to coordinate with imperfect, noisy, and time-varying agents. Finally, we conduct two user studies where RILI co-adapts alongside actual humans in a game of tag and a tower-building task.
