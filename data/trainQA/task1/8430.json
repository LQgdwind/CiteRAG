      "content": "Paper Title: Can we learn better with hard samples?\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In deep learning, mini-batch training is commonly used to optimize network parameters. However, the traditional mini-batch method may not learn the under-represented samples and complex patterns in the data, leading to a longer time for generalization. To address this problem, a variant of the traditional algorithm has been proposed, which trains the network focusing on mini-batches with high loss. The study evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed training using various deep neural networks trained on three benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10). The deep neural networks used in the study are ResNet-18, ResNet-50, Efficient Net B4, EfficientNetV2-S, and MobilenetV3-S. The experimental results showed that the proposed method can significantly improve the test accuracy and speed up the convergence compared to the traditional mini-batch training method. Furthermore, we introduce a hyper-parameter delta (Œ¥ùõø\\delta) that decides how many mini-batches are considered for training. Experiments on various values of Œ¥ùõø\\delta found that the performance of the proposed method for smaller Œ¥ùõø\\delta values generally results in similar test accuracy and faster generalization. We show that the proposed method generalizes in 26.47% less number of epochs than the traditional mini-batch method in EfficientNet-B4 on STL-10. The proposed method also improves the test top-1 accuracy by 7.26% in ResNet-18 on CIFAR-100.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
