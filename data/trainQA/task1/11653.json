Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Statistical Analysis of the Impact of Quaternion Components in Convolutional Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In recent years, several models using Quaternion-Valued Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) for different problems have been proposed. Although the definition of the quaternion convolution layer is the same, there are different adaptations of other atomic components to the quaternion domain, e.g., pooling layers, activation functions, fully connected layers, etc. However, the effect of selecting a specific type of these components and the way in which their interactions affect the performance of the model still unclear. Understanding the impact of these choices on model performance is vital for effectively utilizing QCNNs. This paper presents a statistical analysis carried out on experimental data to compare the performance of existing components for the image classification problem. In addition, we introduce a novel Fully Quaternion ReLU activation function, which exploits the unique properties of quaternion algebra to improve model performance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
