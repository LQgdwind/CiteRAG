      "content": "Paper Title: Active Inference-Based Optimization of Discriminative Neural Network Classifiers\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Commonly used objective functions (losses) for a supervised optimization of discriminative neural network classifiers were either distribution-based or metric-based. The distribution-based losses were mostly based on the cross entropy and fitted the network model to the distribution of the training samples. This could compromise the generalization (predictive performance on unseen samples) or cause classification biases towards the dominant classes of an imbalanced class-sample distribution. The metric-based losses could make the network model independent of any distribution and thus improve its generalization. However, the metrics involved in them were binary classification metrics. This implied to decompose a multiclass classification into a series of one-vs-all classifications and then form the overall loss from an average of the one-vs-all losses. This averaging could naturally lead to a bias towards the dominant classes. Moreover, the metric-based losses could suffer from discrepancies when a class was absent in both the reference (ground truth) labels and the predicted labels. To tackle these issues, recent works have used a combination of the distribution-based and metric-based losses. In this paper, we formulated the optimization of a discriminative neural network classifier within the framework of active inference and showed that the cross entropy-based losses were indeed the variational free energy of a retrospective active inference. Then, we proposed a novel optimization process which not only tackled the unbalancedness of the class-sample distribution of the training samples but also provided a mechanism to tackle errors in the reference (ground truth) labels of the training samples. This was achieved by proposing a novel algorithm to find candidate classification labels of the training samples during the network optimization and a novel objective function for the optimizations. The algorithm could find the candidate labels of the training samples from their prior probabilities and the currently estimated posteriors on the network. The proposed objective function incorporated these candidate labels along with the original reference labels and the priors of the training samples while still being distribution-based. The proposed algorithm was the result of casting the generalized Kelly criterion for optimal betting into a multiclass classification problem. To this end, we showed that the objective function of the generalized Kelly criterion was a tight upper bound of the expected complexity of the expected free energy of a prospective active inference. This in turn allowed us to derive our proposed objective function from such an expected free energy. The incorporation of the priors into the optimization not only helped to tackle errors in the reference labels but also allowed to reduce classification biases towards the dominant classes by focusing the attention of the neural network on important but minority foreground classes.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
