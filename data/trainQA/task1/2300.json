Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Compiler Design for Distributed Quantum Computing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In distributed quantum computing architectures, with the network and communications functionalities provided by the Quantum Internet, remote quantum processing units (QPUs) can communicate and cooperate for executing computational tasks that single NISQ devices cannot handle by themselves. To this aim, distributed quantum computing requires a new generation of quantum compilers, for mapping any quantum algorithm to any distributed quantum computing architecture. With this perspective, in this paper, we first discuss the main challenges arising with compiler design for distributed quantum computing. Then, we analytically derive an upper bound of the overhead induced by quantum compilation for distributed quantum computing. The derived bound accounts for the overhead induced by the underlying computing architecture as well as the additional overhead induced by the sub-optimal quantum compiler – expressly designed through the paper to achieve three key features, namely, general-purpose, efficient and effective. Finally, we validate the analytical results and we confirm the validity of the compiler design through an extensive performance analysis.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
