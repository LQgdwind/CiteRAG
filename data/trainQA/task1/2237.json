Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: R-AGNO-RPN: A LIDAR-Camera Region Proposal Deep Network for Resolution-Agnostic Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Current neural networks-based object detection approaches processing LiDAR point clouds are generally trained from one kind of LiDAR sensors. However, their performances decrease when they are tested with data coming from a different LiDAR sensor than the one used for training, i.e., with a different point cloud resolution. In this paper, R-AGNO-RPN, a region proposal network built on fusion of 3D point clouds and RGB images is proposed for 3D object detection regardless of point cloud resolution. As our approach is designed to be also applied on low point cloud resolutions, the proposed method focuses on object localization instead of estimating refined boxes on reduced data. The resilience to low-resolution point cloud is obtained through image features accurately mapped to Bird‚Äôs Eye View and a specific data augmentation procedure that improves the contribution of the RGB images. To show the proposed network‚Äôs ability to deal with different point clouds resolutions, experiments are conducted on both data coming from the KITTI 3D Object Detection and the nuScenes datasets. In addition, to assess its performances, our method is compared to PointPillars, a well-known 3D detection network. Experimental results show that even on point cloud data reduced by 80%percent8080\\% of its original points, our method is still able to deliver relevant proposals localization.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
