      "content": "Paper Title: Deep active learning for nonlinear system identification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The exploding research interest for neural networks in modeling nonlinear dynamical systems is largely explained by the networks’ capacity to model complex input-output relations directly from data. However, they typically need vast training data before they can be put to any good use. The data generation process for dynamical systems can be an expensive endeavor both in terms of time and resources. Active learning addresses this shortcoming by acquiring the most informative data, thereby reducing the need to collect enormous datasets. What makes the current work unique is integrating the deep active learning framework into nonlinear system identification. We formulate a general static deep active learning acquisition problem for nonlinear system identification. This is enabled by exploring system dynamics locally in different regions of the input space to obtain a simulated dataset covering the broader input space. This simulated dataset can be used in a static deep active learning acquisition scheme referred to as global explorations. The global exploration acquires a batch of initial states corresponding to the most informative state-action trajectories according to a batch acquisition function. The local exploration solves an optimal control problem, finding the control trajectory that maximizes some measure of information. After a batch of informative initial states is acquired, a new round of local explorations from the initial states in the batch is conducted to obtain a set of corresponding control trajectories that are to be applied on the system dynamics to get data from the system. Information measures used in the acquisition scheme are derived from the predictive variance of an ensemble of neural networks. The novel method outperforms standard data acquisition methods used for system identification of nonlinear dynamical systems in the case study performed on simulated data.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
