Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Our Deep CNN Face Matchers Have Developed Achromatopsia\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Modern deep CNN face matchers are trained on datasets containing color images. We show that such matchers achieve essentially the same accuracy on the grayscale or the color version of a set of test images. We then consider possible causes for deep CNN face matchers “not seeing color”. Popular web-scraped face datasets actually have 30 to 60% of their identities with one or more grayscale images. We analyze whether this grayscale element in the training set impacts the accuracy achieved, and conclude that it does not. Further, we show that even with a 100% grayscale training set, comparable accuracy is achieved on color or grayscale test images. Then we show that the skin region of an individual’s images in a web-scraped training set exhibit significant variation in their mapping to color space. This suggests that color, at least for web-scraped, in-the-wild face datasets, carries limited identity-related information for training state-of-the-art matchers. Finally, we verify that comparable accuracy is achieved from training using single-channel grayscale images, implying that a larger dataset can be used within the same memory limit, with a less computationally intensive early layer.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
