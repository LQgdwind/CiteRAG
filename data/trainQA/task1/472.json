      "content": "Paper Title: Bounding the Mim-Width of Hereditary Graph Classes\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A large number of NP-hard graph problems are solvable in XP time when parameterized by some width parameter. Hence, when solving problems on special graph classes, it is helpful to know if the graph class under consideration has bounded width. In this paper we consider mim-width, a particularly general width parameter that has a number of algorithmic applications whenever a decomposition is “quickly computable” for the graph class under consideration. We start by extending the toolkit for proving (un)boundedness of mim-width of graph classes. By combining our new techniques with known ones we then initiate a systematic study into bounding mim-width from the perspective of hereditary graph classes, and make a comparison with clique-width, a more restrictive width parameter that has been well studied. We prove that for a given graph H𝐻H, the class of H𝐻H-free graphs has bounded mim-width if and only if it has bounded clique-width. We show that the same is not true for (H1,H2)subscript𝐻1subscript𝐻2(H_{1},H_{2})-free graphs. We identify several general classes of (H1,H2)subscript𝐻1subscript𝐻2(H_{1},H_{2})-free graphs having unbounded clique-width, but bounded mim-width; moreover, we show that a branch decomposition of constant mim-width can be found in polynomial time for these classes. Hence, these results have algorithmic implications: when the input is restricted to such a class of (H1,H2)subscript𝐻1subscript𝐻2(H_{1},H_{2})-free graphs, many problems become polynomial-time solvable, including classical problems such as k𝑘k-Colouring and Independent Set, domination-type problems known as LC-VSVP problems, and distance versions of LC-VSVP problems, to name just a few. We also prove a number of new results showing that, for certain H1subscript𝐻1H_{1} and H2subscript𝐻2H_{2}, the class of (H1,H2)subscript𝐻1subscript𝐻2(H_{1},H_{2})-free graphs has unbounded mim-width. Boundedness of clique-width implies boundedness of mim-width. By combining our results with the known bounded cases for clique-width, we present summary theorems of the current state of the art for the boundedness of mim-width for (H1,H2)subscript𝐻1subscript𝐻2(H_{1},H_{2})-free graphs. In particular, we classify the mim-width of (H1,H2)subscript𝐻1subscript𝐻2(H_{1},H_{2})-free graphs for all pairs (H1,H2)subscript𝐻1subscript𝐻2(H_{1},H_{2}) with |V​(H1)|+|V​(H2)|≤8𝑉subscript𝐻1𝑉subscript𝐻28|V(H_{1})|+|V(H_{2})|\\leq 8. When H1subscript𝐻1H_{1} and H2subscript𝐻2H_{2} are connected graphs, we classify all pairs (H1,H2)subscript𝐻1subscript𝐻2(H_{1},H_{2}) except for one remaining infinite family and a few isolated cases.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
