Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Data Topology-Dependent Upper Bounds of Neural Network Widths\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper investigates the relationship between the universal approximation property of deep neural networks and topological characteristics of datasets. Our primary contribution is to introduce data topology-dependent upper bounds on the network width. Specifically, we first show that a three-layer neural network, applying a ReLU activation function and max pooling, can be designed to approximate an indicator function over a compact set, one that is encompassed by a tight convex polytope. This is then extended to a simplicial complex, deriving width upper bounds based on its topological structure. Further, we calculate upper bounds in relation to the Betti numbers of select topological spaces. Finally, we prove the universal approximation property of three-layer ReLU networks using our topological approach. We also verify that gradient descent converges to the network structure proposed in our study.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
