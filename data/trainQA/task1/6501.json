      "content": "Paper Title: EASNet: Searching Elastic and Accurate Network Architecture for Stereo Matching\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recent advanced studies have spent considerable human efforts on optimizing network architectures for stereo matching but hardly achieved both high accuracy and fast inference speed. To ease the workload in network design, neural architecture search (NAS) has been applied with great success to various sparse prediction tasks, such as image classification and object detection. However, existing NAS studies on the dense prediction task, especially stereo matching, still cannot be efficiently and effectively deployed on devices of different computing capability. To this end, we propose to train an elastic and accurate network for stereo matching (EASNet) that supports various 3D architectural settings on devices with different compute capability. Given the deployment latency constraint on the target device, we can quickly extract a sub-network from the full EASNet without additional training while the accuracy of the sub-network can still be maintained. Extensive experiments show that our EASNet outperforms both state-of-the-art human-designed and NAS-based architectures on Scene Flow and MPI Sintel datasets in terms of model accuracy and inference speed. Particularly, deployed on an inference GPU, EASNet achieves a new SOTA 0.73 EPE on the Scene Flow dataset with 100 ms, which is 4.5Ã—\\times faster than LEAStereo with a better quality model. The codes of EASNet are available at: https://github.com/HKBU-HPML/EASNet.git\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 48\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
