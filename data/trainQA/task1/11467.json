Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: On Equivalence of Parameterized Inapproximability of 𝑘-Median, 𝑘-Max-Coverage, and 2-CSP\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Parameterized Inapproximability Hypothesis (𝖯𝖨𝖧𝖯𝖨𝖧\\mathsf{PIH}) is a central question in the field of parameterized complexity. 𝖯𝖨𝖧𝖯𝖨𝖧\\mathsf{PIH} asserts that given as input a 2-𝖢𝖲𝖯𝖢𝖲𝖯\\mathsf{CSP} on k𝑘k variables and alphabet size n𝑛n, it is 𝖶𝖶\\mathsf{W}[1]delimited-[]1[1]-hard parameterized by k𝑘k to distinguish if the input is perfectly satisfiable or if every assignment to the input violates 1% of the constraints. An important implication of 𝖯𝖨𝖧𝖯𝖨𝖧\\mathsf{PIH} is that it yields the tight parameterized inapproximability of the k𝑘k-𝗆𝖺𝗑𝖼𝗈𝗏𝖾𝗋𝖺𝗀𝖾𝗆𝖺𝗑𝖼𝗈𝗏𝖾𝗋𝖺𝗀𝖾\\mathsf{maxcoverage} problem. In the k𝑘k-𝗆𝖺𝗑𝖼𝗈𝗏𝖾𝗋𝖺𝗀𝖾𝗆𝖺𝗑𝖼𝗈𝗏𝖾𝗋𝖺𝗀𝖾\\mathsf{maxcoverage} problem, we are given as input a set system, a threshold τ>0𝜏0\\tau>0, and a parameter k𝑘k and the goal is to determine if there exist k𝑘k sets in the input whose union is at least τ𝜏\\tau fraction of the entire universe. 𝖯𝖨𝖧𝖯𝖨𝖧\\mathsf{PIH} is known to imply that it is 𝖶𝖶\\mathsf{W}[1]delimited-[]1[1]-hard parameterized by k𝑘k to distinguish if there are k𝑘k input sets whose union is at least τ𝜏\\tau fraction of the universe or if the union of every k𝑘k input sets is not much larger than τ⋅(1−1e)⋅𝜏11𝑒\\tau\\cdot(1-\\frac{1}{e}) fraction of the universe. In this work we present a gap preserving 𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖥𝖯𝖳\\mathsf{FPT} reduction (in the reverse direction) from the k𝑘k-𝗆𝖺𝗑𝖼𝗈𝗏𝖾𝗋𝖺𝗀𝖾𝗆𝖺𝗑𝖼𝗈𝗏𝖾𝗋𝖺𝗀𝖾\\mathsf{maxcoverage} problem to the aforementioned 2-𝖢𝖲𝖯𝖢𝖲𝖯\\mathsf{CSP} problem, thus showing that the assertion that approximating the k𝑘k-𝗆𝖺𝗑𝖼𝗈𝗏𝖾𝗋𝖺𝗀𝖾𝗆𝖺𝗑𝖼𝗈𝗏𝖾𝗋𝖺𝗀𝖾\\mathsf{maxcoverage} problem to some constant factor is 𝖶𝖶\\mathsf{W}[1]delimited-[]1[1]-hard implies 𝖯𝖨𝖧𝖯𝖨𝖧\\mathsf{PIH}. In addition, we present a gap preserving 𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖥𝖯𝖳\\mathsf{FPT} reduction from the k𝑘k-median problem (in general metrics) to the k𝑘k-𝗆𝖺𝗑𝖼𝗈𝗏𝖾𝗋𝖺𝗀𝖾𝗆𝖺𝗑𝖼𝗈𝗏𝖾𝗋𝖺𝗀𝖾\\mathsf{maxcoverage} problem, further highlighting the power of gap preserving 𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖥𝖯𝖳\\mathsf{FPT} reductions over classical gap preserving polynomial time reductions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
