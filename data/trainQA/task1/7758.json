      "content": "Paper Title: A Unified Architecture for Dynamic Role Allocation and Collaborative Task Planning in Mixed Human-Robot Teams\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The growing deployment of human-robot collaborative processes in several industrial applications, such as handling, welding, and assembly, unfolds the pursuit of systems that are able to manage large heterogeneous teams and, at the same time, monitor the execution of complex tasks. In this paper, we present a novel architecture for dynamic role allocation and collaborative task planning in a mixed human-robot team of arbitrary size. The architecture capitalizes on a centralized reactive and modular task-agnostic planning method based on Behavior Trees (BTs), in charge of action scheduling, while the allocation problem is formulated through a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP), which dynamically assigns individual roles or collaborations to the agents of the team. Different metrics used as MILP cost allow the architecture to favor various aspects of the collaboration (e.g. makespan, ergonomics, human preferences). Human preferences are identified through a negotiation phase, in which a human agent can accept or refuse to execute the assigned task. In addition, bilateral communication between humans and the system is achieved through an Augmented Reality (AR) custom user interface that provides intuitive functionalities to assist and coordinate workers in different action phases. The computational complexity of the proposed methodology outperforms literature approaches in industrial-sized jobs and teams (problems up to 50 actions and 20 agents in the team with collaborations are solved within 1 s). The different roles allocated as the cost functions change, highlight the flexibility of the architecture to meet several production requirements. Finally, the subjective evaluation demonstrates the high usability level and suitability for the targeted scenario.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
