Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search for Line Segments\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Approximate nearest-neighbor search is a fundamental algorithmic problem that continues to inspire study due its essential role in numerous contexts. In contrast to most prior work, which has focused on point sets, we consider nearest-neighbor queries against a set of line segments in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}, for constant dimension d𝑑d. Given a set S𝑆S of n𝑛n disjoint line segments in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} and an error parameter ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, the objective is to build a data structure such that for any query point q𝑞q, it is possible to return a line segment whose Euclidean distance from q𝑞q is at most (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon) times the distance from q𝑞q to its nearest line segment. We present a data structure for this problem with storage O​((n2/εd)​log⁡(Δ/ε))𝑂superscript𝑛2superscript𝜀𝑑Δ𝜀O((n^{2}/\\varepsilon^{d})\\log(\\Delta/\\varepsilon)) and query time O​(log⁡(max⁡(n,Δ)/ε))𝑂𝑛Δ𝜀O(\\log(\\max(n,\\Delta)/\\varepsilon)), where ΔΔ\\Delta is the spread of the set of segments S𝑆S. Our approach is based on a covering of space by anisotropic elements, which align themselves according to the orientations of nearby segments.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 53\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
