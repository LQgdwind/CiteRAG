Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Light-weight Deep Human Activity Recognition Algorithm Using Multi-knowledge Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Inertial sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) is the base of many human-centered mobile applications. Deep learning-based fine-grained HAR models enable accurate classification in various complex application scenarios. Nevertheless, the large storage and computational overhead of the existing fine-grained deep HAR models hinder their widespread deployment on resource-limited platforms. Inspired by the knowledge distillation’s reasonable model compression and potential performance improvement capability, we design a multi-level HAR modeling pipeline called Stage-Logits-Memory Distillation (SMLDist) based on the widely-used MobileNet. By paying more attention to the frequency-related features during the distillation process, the SMLDist improves the HAR classification robustness of the students. We also propose an auto-search mechanism in the heterogeneous classifiers to improve classification performance. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that SMLDist outperforms various state-of-the-art HAR frameworks in accuracy and F1 macro score. The practical evaluation of the Jetson Xavier AGX platform shows that the SMLDist model is both energy-efficient and computation-efficient. These experiments validate the reasonable balance between the robustness and efficiency of the proposed model. The comparative experiments of knowledge distillation on six public datasets also demonstrate that the SMLDist outperforms other advanced knowledge distillation methods of students’ performance, which verifies the good generalization of the SMLDist on other classification tasks, including but not limited to HAR.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
