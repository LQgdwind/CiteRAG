Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Lower Bound for Succinct Range Minimum Query\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Given an integer array A[1..n]A[1..n], the Range Minimum Query problem (RMQ) asks to preprocess A𝐴A into a data structure, supporting RMQ queries: given a,b∈[1,n]𝑎𝑏1𝑛a,b\\in[1,n], return the index i∈[a,b]𝑖𝑎𝑏i\\in[a,b] that minimizes A​[i]𝐴delimited-[]𝑖A[i], i.e., arg​mini∈[a,b]⁡A​[i]subscriptargmin𝑖𝑎𝑏𝐴delimited-[]𝑖\\operatorname*{arg\\,min}_{i\\in[a,b]}A[i]. This problem has a classic solution using O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) space and O​(1)𝑂1O(1) query time by Gabow, Bentley, Tarjan [GBT84] and Harel, Tarjan [HT84]. The best known data structure by Fischer, Heun [FH11] and Navarro, Sadakane [NS14] uses 2​n+n/(log⁡nt)t+O~​(n3/4)2𝑛𝑛superscript𝑛𝑡𝑡~𝑂superscript𝑛342n+n/(\\frac{\\log n}{t})^{t}+\\tilde{O}(n^{3/4}) bits and answers queries in O​(t)𝑂𝑡O(t) time, assuming the word-size is w=Θ​(log⁡n)𝑤Θ𝑛w=\\Theta(\\log n). In particular, it uses 2​n+n/poly​log⁡n2𝑛𝑛poly𝑛2n+n/\\mathrm{poly}\\log n bits of space when the query time is a constant. In this paper, we prove the first lower bound for this problem, showing that 2​n+n/poly​log⁡n2𝑛𝑛poly𝑛2n+n/\\mathrm{poly}\\log n space is necessary for constant query time. In general, we show that if the data structure has query time O​(t)𝑂𝑡O(t), then it must use at least 2​n+n/(log⁡n)O~​(t2)2𝑛𝑛superscript𝑛~𝑂superscript𝑡22n+n/(\\log n)^{\\tilde{O}(t^{2})} space, in the cell-probe model with word-size w=Θ​(log⁡n)𝑤Θ𝑛w=\\Theta(\\log n).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
