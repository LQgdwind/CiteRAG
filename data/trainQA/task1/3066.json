Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: A multiagent based framework secured with layered SVM-based IDS for remote healthcare systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Since the number of elderly and patients who are in hospitals and healthcare centers are growing, providing efficient remote healthcare services seems very important. Currently, most such systems benefit from the distribution and autonomy features of multiagent systems and the structure of wireless sensor networks. On the one hand, securing the data of remote healthcare systems is one of the most significant concerns; particularly recent types of research about the security of remote healthcare systems keep them secure from eavesdropping and data modification. On the other hand, existing remote healthcare systems are still vulnerable against other common attacks of healthcare networks such as Denial of Service (DoS) and User to Root (U2R) attacks, because they are managed remotely and based on the Internet. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a secure framework for remote healthcare systems that consists of two phases. First, we design a healthcare system base on multiagent technology to collect data from a sensor network. Then, in the second phase, a layered architecture of intrusion detection systems that uses Support Vector Machine to learn the behavior of network traffic is applied. Based on our framework, we implement a secure remote healthcare system and evaluate this system against the frequent attacks of healthcare networks such as Smurf, Buffer overflow, Neptune, and Pod attacks. In the end, evaluation parameters of the layered architecture of intrusion detection systems prove the efficiency and correctness of our proposed framework.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
