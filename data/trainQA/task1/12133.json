      "content": "Paper Title: Modeling Eye Gaze Velocity Trajectories using GANs with Spectral Loss for Enhanced Fidelity\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Accurate modeling of eye gaze dynamics is essential for advancement in human-computer interaction, neurological diagnostics, and cognitive research. Traditional generative models like Markov models often fail to capture the complex temporal dependencies and distributional nuance inherent in eye gaze trajectories data. This study introduces a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) generators and discriminators to generate high-fidelity synthetic eye gaze velocity trajectories. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of four GAN architectures: CNN-CNN, LSTM-CNN, CNN-LSTM, and LSTM-LSTM—trained under two conditions: using only adversarial loss (LGL_{G}) and using a weighted combination of adversarial and spectral losses. Our findings reveal that the LSTM-CNN architecture trained with this new loss function exhibits the closest alignment to the real data distribution, effectively capturing both the distribution tails and the intricate temporal dependencies. The inclusion of spectral regularization significantly enhances the GANs’ ability to replicate the spectral characteristics of eye gaze movements, leading to a more stable learning process and improved data fidelity. Comparative analysis with an HMM optimized to four hidden states further highlights the advantages of the LSTM-CNN GAN. Statistical metrics show that the HMM-generated data significantly diverges from the real data in terms of mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. In contrast, the LSTM-CNN model closely matches the real data across these statistics, affirming its capacity to model the complexity of eye gaze dynamics effectively. These results position the spectrally regularized LSTM-CNN GAN as a robust tool for generating synthetic eye gaze velocity data with high fidelity. Its ability to accurately replicate both the distributional and temporal properties of real data holds significant potential for applications in simulation environments, training systems, and the development of advanced eye-tracking technologies, ultimately contributing to more naturalistic and responsive human-computer interactions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
