Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: GAC: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Model Toward User Incentivization in Unknown Social Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In recent years, many applications have deployed incentive mechanisms to promote users’ attention and engagement. Most incentive mechanisms determine specific incentive values based on users’ attributes (e.g., preferences), while such information is unavailable in many real-world applications. Meanwhile, due to budget restrictions, realizing successful incentivization for all users can be challenging to complete. In this light, we consider leveraging social influence to maximize the incentivization result. We can directly incentivize influential users to affect more users, so the cost of incentivizing these users can be decreased. However, identifying influential users in a social network requires complete information about influence strength among users, which is impractical to acquire in real-world situations. In this research, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning-based framework, called Geometric Actor-Critic (GAC), to tackle the abovementioned problem. The proposed approach can realize effective incentive allocation without having prior knowledge about users’ attributes. Three real-world social network datasets have been adopted in the experiments to evaluate the performance of GAC. The experimental results indicate that GAC can learn and apply effective incentive allocation policies in unknown social networks and outperform existing incentive allocation approaches.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
