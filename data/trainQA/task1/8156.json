Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Graph-based Global Robot Localization Informing Situational Graphs with Architectural Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we propose a solution for legged robot localization using architectural plans. Our specific contributions towards this goal are several. Firstly, we develop a method for converting the plan of a building into what we denote as an architectural graph (A-Graph). When the robot starts moving in an environment, we assume it has no knowledge about it, and it estimates an online situational graph representation (S-Graph) of its surroundings. We develop a novel graph-to-graph matching method, in order to relate the S-Graph estimated online from the robot sensors and the A-Graph extracted from the building plans. Note the challenge in this, as the S-Graph may show a partial view of the full A-Graph, their nodes are heterogeneous and their reference frames are different. After the matching, both graphs are aligned and merged, resulting in what we denote as an informed Situational Graph (iS-Graph), with which we achieve global robot localization and exploitation of prior knowledge from the building plans. Our experiments show that our pipeline shows a higher robustness and a significantly lower pose error than several LiDAR localization baselines.
