Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Ramifications of Approximate Posterior Inference for Bayesian Deep Learning in Adversarial and Out-of-Distribution Settings\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep neural networks have been successful in diverse discriminative classification tasks, although, they are poorly calibrated often assigning high probability to misclassified predictions. Potential consequences could lead to trustworthiness and accountability of the models when deployed in real applications, where predictions are evaluated based on their confidence scores. Existing solutions suggest the benefits attained by combining deep neural networks and Bayesian inference to quantify uncertainty over the modelsâ€™ predictions for ambiguous data points. In this work we propose to validate and test the efficacy of likelihood based models in the task of out of distribution detection (OoD). Across different datasets and metrics we show that Bayesian deep learning models indeed outperform conventional neural networks but in the event of minimal overlap between in/out distribution classes, even the best models exhibit a reduction in AUC scores in detecting OoD data. We hypothesise that the sensitivity of neural networks to unseen inputs could be a multi-factor phenomenon arising from the different architectural design choices often amplified by the curse of dimensionality. Preliminary investigations indicate the potential inherent role of bias due to choices of initialisation, architecture or activation functions. Furthermore, we perform an analysis on the effect of adversarial noise resistance methods regarding in and out-of-distribution performance when combined with Bayesian deep learners.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
