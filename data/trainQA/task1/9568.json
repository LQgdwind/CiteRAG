Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Source Domain Adaptation through Dataset Dictionary Learning in Wasserstein Space\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper seeks to solve Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), which aims to mitigate data distribution shifts when transferring knowledge from multiple labeled source domains to an unlabeled target domain. We propose a novel MSDA framework based on dictionary learning and optimal transport. We interpret each domain in MSDA as an empirical distribution. As such, we express each domain as a Wasserstein barycenter of dictionary atoms, which are empirical distributions. We propose a novel algorithm, DaDiL, for learning via mini-batches: (i) atom distributions; (ii) a matrix of barycentric coordinates. Based on our dictionary, we propose two novel methods for MSDA: DaDil-R, based on the reconstruction of labeled samples in the target domain, and DaDiL-E, based on the ensembling of classifiers learned on atom distributions. We evaluate our methods in 3 benchmarks: Caltech-Office, Office 31, and CRWU, where we improved previous state-of-the-art by 3.15%, 2.29%, and 7.71% in classification performance. Finally, we show that interpolations in the Wasserstein hull of learned atoms provide data that can generalize to the target domain111Accepted as a conference paper at the 26th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence. \\faGithub https://github.com/eddardd/demo-dadil/\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
