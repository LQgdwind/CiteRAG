Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

The present version improves the main result to a tight bound.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study the problem of representing all distances between nùëõn points in ‚Ñùdsuperscript‚Ñùùëë\\mathbb{R}^{d}, with arbitrarily small distortion, using as few bits as possible. We give asymptotically tight bounds for this problem, for Euclidean metrics, for ‚Ñì1subscript‚Ñì1\\ell_{1} (a.k.a. Manhattan) metrics, and for general metrics. Our bounds for Euclidean metrics mark the first improvement over compression schemes based on discretizing the classical dimensionality reduction theorem of Johnson and Lindenstrauss (Contemp. Math. 1984). Since it is known that no better dimension reduction is possible, our results establish that Euclidean metric compression is possible beyond dimension reduction.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
