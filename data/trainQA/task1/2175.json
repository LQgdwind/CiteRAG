Using this result, he gave an Œ©~‚Äã(n3)~Œ©superscriptùëõ3\\widetilde{\\Omega}(n^{3}) formula size lower bound for the Andreev function, which, up to lower order improvements, remains the state-of-the-art lower bound for any explicit function. In this work, we extend the shrinkage result of H√•stad to hold under a far wider family of random restrictions and their generalization ‚Äî random projections. Based on our shrinkage results, we obtain an Œ©~‚Äã(n3)~Œ©superscriptùëõ3\\widetilde{\\Omega}(n^{3}) formula size lower bound for an explicit function computed in ùêÄùêÇ0superscriptùêÄùêÇ0\\mathbf{AC}^{0}. This improves upon the best known formula size lower bounds for ùêÄùêÇ0superscriptùêÄùêÇ0\\mathbf{AC}^{0}, that were only quadratic prior to our work. In addition, we prove that the KRW conjecture [Karchmer et al., Computational Complexity 5(3/4), 1995] holds for inner functions for which the unweighted quantum adversary bound is tight. In particular, this holds for inner functions with a tight Khrapchenko bound. Our random projections are tailor-made to the function‚Äôs structure so that the function maintains structure even under projection ‚Äî using such projections is necessary, as standard random restrictions simplify ùêÄùêÇ0superscriptùêÄùêÇ0\\mathbf{AC}^{0} circuits. In contrast, we show that any De Morgan formula shrinks by a quadratic factor under our random projections, allowing us to prove the cubic lower bound. Our proof techniques build on the proof of H√•stad for the simpler case of balanced formulas. This allows for a significantly simpler proof at the cost of slightly worse parameters. As such, when specialized to the case of pùëùp-random restrictions, our proof can be used as an exposition of H√•stad‚Äôs result.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper.
