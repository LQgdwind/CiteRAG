      "content": "Paper Title: Simultaneous Locomotion Mode Classification and Continuous Gait Phase Estimation for Transtibial Prostheses\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recognizing and identifying human locomotion is a critical step to ensuring fluent control of wearable robots, such as transtibial prostheses. In particular, classifying the intended locomotion mode and estimating the gait phase are key. In this work, a novel, interpretable, and computationally efficient algorithm is presented for simultaneously predicting locomotion mode and gait phase. Using able-bodied (AB) and transtibial prosthesis (PR) data, seven locomotion modes are tested including slow, medium, and fast level walking (0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 m/s), ramp ascent/descent (5 degrees), and stair ascent/descent (20 cm height). Overall classification accuracy was 99.1%percent\\% and 99.3%percent\\% for the AB and PR conditions, respectively. The average gait phase error across all data was less than 4%percent\\%. Exploiting the structure of the data, computational efficiency reached 2.91 Œºùúá\\mus per time step. The time complexity of this algorithm scales as O‚Äã(N‚ãÖM)ùëÇ‚ãÖùëÅùëÄO(N\\cdot M) with the number of locomotion modes MùëÄM and samples per gait cycle NùëÅN. This efficiency and high accuracy could accommodate a much larger set of locomotion modes (‚àºsimilar-to\\sim 700 on Open-Source Leg Prosthesis) to handle the wide range of activities pursued by individuals during daily living.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
