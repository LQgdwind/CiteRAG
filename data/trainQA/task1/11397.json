Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Dependence Analysis and Structured Construction for Batched Sparse Code\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In coding theory, codes are usually designed with a certain level of randomness to facilitate analysis and accommodate different channel conditions. However, the resulting random code constructed can be suboptimal in practical implementations. Represented by a bipartite graph, the Batched Sparse Code (BATS Code) is a randomly constructed erasure code that utilizes network coding to achieve near-optimal performance in wireless multi-hop networks. In the performance analysis in the previous research, it is implicitly assumed that the coded batches in the BATS code are independent. This assumption holds only asymptotically when the number of input symbols is infinite, but it does not generally hold in a practical setting where the number of input symbols is finite, especially when the code is constructed randomly. We show that dependence among the batches significantly degrades the codeâ€™s performance. In order to control the batch dependence through graphical design, we propose constructing the BATS code in a structured manner. A hardware-friendly structured BATS code called the Cyclic-Shift BATS (CS-BATS) code is proposed, which constructs the code from a small base graph using light-weight cyclic-shift operations. We demonstrate that when the base graph is properly designed, a higher decoding rate and a smaller complexity can be achieved compared with the random BATS code.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
