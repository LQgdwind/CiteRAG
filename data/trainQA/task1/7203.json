Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 6 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Hierarchical quantum circuit representations for neural architecture search\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Machine learning with hierarchical quantum circuits, usually referred to as Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs), is a promising prospect for near-term quantum computing. The QCNN is a circuit model inspired by the architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are successful because they do not need manual feature design and can learn high-level features from raw data. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) builds on this success by learning network architecture and achieves state-of-the-art performance. However, applying NAS to QCNNs presents unique challenges due to the lack of a well-defined search space. In this work, we propose a novel framework for representing QCNN architectures using techniques from NAS, which enables search space design and architecture search. Using this framework, we generate a family of popular QCNNs, those resembling reverse binary trees. We then evaluate this family of models on a music genre classification dataset, GTZAN, to justify the importance of circuit architecture. Furthermore, we employ a genetic algorithm to perform Quantum Phase Recognition (QPR) as an example of architecture search with our representation. This work provides a way to improve model performance without increasing complexity and to jump around the cost landscape to avoid barren plateaus. Finally, we implement the framework as an open-source Python package to enable dynamic QCNN creation and facilitate QCNN search space design for NAS.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 6 most likely reference titles for this paper.
