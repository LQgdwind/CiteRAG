      "content": "Paper Title: Surface Warping Incorporating Machine Learning Assisted Domain Likelihood Estimation: A New Paradigm in Mine Geology Modelling and Automation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This work demonstrates an application of machine learning to domain likelihood estimation within an orebody modelling system. In this application area, demarcation of boundaries is a key determinant of success in 3D geologic modelling. The placement of these boundaries is critical and when they are specified by mesh surfaces, a wide variety of topological features and geological structures can be represented, including stratigraphic boundaries that delineate different domains. In surface mining, assay measurements taken from production drilling often provide useful information that allows initially inaccurate surfaces (for example, mineralization boundaries) created using sparse exploration data to be revised and subsequently improved. Recently, a Bayesian warping technique has been proposed to reshape modelled surfaces using geochemical observations and spatial constraints imposed by newly acquired blasthole data. This paper focuses on incorporating machine learning into this warping framework to make the likelihood computation generalizable. The technique works by adjusting the position of vertices on the surface to maximize the integrity of modelled geological boundaries with respect to sparse geochemical observations. Its foundation is laid by a Bayesian derivation in which the geological domain likelihood given the chemistry, p‚Äã(g‚à£ùêú)ùëùconditionalùëîùêúp(g\\!\\mid\\!\\mathbf{c}), plays a similar role to p‚Äã(y‚Äã(ùêú)‚à£g)ùëùconditionalùë¶ùêúùëîp(y(\\mathbf{c})\\!\\mid\\!g) for certain categorical mappings y:‚ÑùK‚Üí‚Ñ§:ùë¶‚Üísuperscript‚Ñùùêæ‚Ñ§y:\\mathbb{R}^{K}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{Z}. This observation allows a manually calibrated process centred around the latter to be automated since machine learning (ML) techniques may be used to estimate the former in a data-driven way. Machine learning performance is evaluated for gradient boosting, neural network, random forest and other classifiers in a binary and multi-class context using precision and recall rates. Once ML likelihood estimators are integrated in the surface warping framework, surface shaping performance is evaluated using unseen data by examining the categorical distribution of test samples located above and below the warped surface. Extended analysis provides further insight on the utility of isometric log-ratio transform and incorporating spatial information as part of the feature vectors with respect to domain classification and surface warping. Large-scale validation experiments are performed to assess the overall efficacy of ML assisted surface warping as a fully integrated component within an ore grade estimation system, where the posterior mean is obtained via Gaussian Process (GP) inference with a Mat√©rn 3/2 kernel.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
