Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 43 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: On the Comparison of Popular End-to-End Models for Large Scale Speech Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recently, there has been a strong push to transition from hybrid models to end-to-end (E2E) models for automatic speech recognition. Currently, there are three promising E2E methods: recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T), RNN attention-based encoder-decoder (AED), and Transformer-AED. In this study, we conduct an empirical comparison of RNN-T, RNN-AED, and Transformer-AED models, in both non-streaming and streaming modes. We use 65 thousand hours of Microsoft anonymized training data to train these models. As E2E models are more data hungry, it is better to compare their effectiveness with large amount of training data. To the best of our knowledge, no such comprehensive study has been conducted yet. We show that although AED models are stronger than RNN-T in the non-streaming mode, RNN-T is very competitive in streaming mode if its encoder can be properly initialized. Among all three E2E models, transformer-AED achieved the best accuracy in both streaming and non-streaming mode. We show that both streaming RNN-T and transformer-AED models can obtain better accuracy than a highly-optimized hybrid model.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 43 most likely reference titles for this paper.
