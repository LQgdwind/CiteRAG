Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Social Value Orientation and Integral Emotions in Multi-Agent Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Human social behavior is influenced by individual differences in social preferences. Social value orientation (SVO) is a measurable personality trait which indicates the relative importance an individual places on their own and on others’ welfare when making decisions. SVO and other individual difference variables are strong predictors of human behavior and social outcomes. However, there are transient changes human behavior associated with emotions that are not captured by individual differences alone. Integral emotions, the emotions which arise in direct response to a decision-making scenario, have been linked to temporary shifts in decision-making preferences. In this work, we investigated the effects of moderating social preferences with integral emotions in multi-agent societies. We developed Svoie, a method for designing agents which make decisions based on established SVO policies, as well as alternative integral emotion policies in response to task outcomes. We conducted simulation experiments in a resource-sharing task environment, and compared societies of Svoie agent with societies of agents with fixed SVO policies. We find that societies of agents which adapt their behavior through integral emotions achieved similar collective welfare to societies of agents with fixed SVO policies, but with significantly reduced inequality between the welfare of agents with different SVO traits. We observed that by allowing agents to change their policy in response to task outcomes, agents can moderate their behavior to achieve greater social equality.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
