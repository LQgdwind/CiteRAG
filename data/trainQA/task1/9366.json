      "content": "Paper Title: Reliable AI: Does the Next Generation Require Quantum Computing?\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this survey, we aim to explore the fundamental question of whether the next generation of artificial intelligence requires quantum computing. Artificial intelligence is increasingly playing a crucial role in many aspects of our daily lives and is central to the fourth industrial revolution. It is therefore imperative that artificial intelligence is reliable and trustworthy. However, there are still many issues with reliability of artificial intelligence, such as privacy, responsibility, safety, and security, in areas such as autonomous driving, healthcare, robotics, and others. These problems can have various causes, including insufficient data, biases, and robustness problems, as well as fundamental issues such as computability problems on digital hardware. The cause of these computability problems is rooted in the fact that digital hardware is based on the computing model of the Turing machine, which is inherently discrete. Notably, our findings demonstrate that digital hardware is inherently constrained in solving problems about optimization, deep learning, or differential equations. Therefore, these limitations carry substantial implications for the field of artificial intelligence, in particular for machine learning. Furthermore, although it is well known that the quantum computer shows a quantum advantage for certain classes of problems, our findings establish that some of these limitations persist when employing quantum computing models based on the quantum circuit or the quantum Turing machine paradigm. In contrast, analog computing models, such as the Blum-Shub-Smale machine, exhibit the potential to surmount these limitations.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
