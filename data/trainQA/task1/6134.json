Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Programming molecular systems to emulate a learning spiking neuron\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Hebbian theory seeks to explain how the neurons in the brain adapt to stimuli, to enable learning. An interesting feature of Hebbian learning is that it is an unsupervised method and as such, does not require feedback, making it suitable in contexts where systems have to learn autonomously. This paper explores how molecular systems can be designed to show such proto-intelligent behaviours, and proposes the first chemical reaction network (CRN) that can exhibit autonomous Hebbian learning across arbitrarily many input channels. The system emulates a spiking neuron, and we demonstrate that it can learn statistical biases of incoming inputs. The basic CRN is a minimal, thermodynamically plausible set of micro-reversible chemical equations that can be analysed with respect to their energy requirements. However, to explore how such chemical systems might be engineered de novo, we also propose an extended version based on enzyme-driven compartmentalised reactions. Finally, we also show how a purely DNA system, built upon the paradigm of DNA strand displacement, can realise neuronal dynamics. Our analysis provides a compelling blueprint for exploring autonomous learning in biological settings, bringing us closer to realising real synthetic biological intelligence.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
