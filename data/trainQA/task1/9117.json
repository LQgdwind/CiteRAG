Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Combining a Meta-Policy and Monte-Carlo Planning for Scalable Type-Based Reasoning in Partially Observable Environments\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The design of autonomous agents that can interact effectively with other agents without prior coordination is a core problem in multi-agent systems. Type-based reasoning methods achieve this by maintaining a belief over a set of potential behaviours for the other agents. However, current methods are limited in that they assume full observability of the state and actions of the other agent or do not scale efficiently to larger problems with longer planning horizons. Addressing these limitations, we propose Partially Observable Type-based Meta Monte-Carlo Planning (POTMMCP) â€”an online Monte-Carlo Tree Search based planning method for type-based reasoning in large partially observable environments. POTMMCP incorporates a novel meta-policy for guiding search and evaluating beliefs, allowing it to search more effectively to longer horizons using less planning time. We show that our method converges to the optimal solution in the limit and empirically demonstrate that it effectively adapts online to diverse sets of other agents across a range of environments. Comparisons with the state-of-the art method on problems with up to 1014superscript101410^{14} states and 108superscript10810^{8} observations indicate that POTMMCP is able to compute better solutions significantly faster111This is an updated and expanded version of the paper that appeared in the proceeding of the AAMAS 2023 conference Schwartz and Kurniawati [2023].\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
