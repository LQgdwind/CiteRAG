Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Relaxing the Constraints on Predictive Coding Models\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Predictive coding is an influential theory of cortical function which posits that the principal computation the brain performs, which underlies both perception and learning, is the minimization of prediction errors. While motivated by high-level notions of variational inference, detailed neurophysiological models of cortical microcircuits which can implements its computations have been developed. Moreover, under certain conditions, predictive coding has been shown to approximate the backpropagation of error algorithm, and thus provides a relatively biologically plausible credit-assignment mechanism for training deep networks. However, standard implementations of the algorithm still involve potentially neurally implausible features such as identical forward and backward weights, backward nonlinear derivatives, and 1-1 error unit connectivity. In this paper, we show that these features are not integral to the algorithm and can be removed either directly or through learning additional sets of parameters with Hebbian update rules without noticeable harm to learning performance. Our work thus relaxes current constraints on potential microcircuit designs and hopefully opens up new regions of the design-space for neuromorphic implementations of predictive coding.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
