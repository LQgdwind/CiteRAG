      "content": "Paper Title: Dual VC Dimension Obstructs Sample Compression by Embeddings\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This work studies embedding of arbitrary VC classes in well-behaved VC classes, focusing particularly on extremal classes. Our main result expresses an impossibility: such embeddings necessarily require a significant increase in dimension. In particular, we prove that for every dùëëd there is a class with VC dimension dùëëd that cannot be embedded in any extremal class of VC dimension smaller than exponential in dùëëd. In addition to its independent interest, this result has an important implication in learning theory, as it reveals a fundamental limitation of one of the most extensively studied approaches to tackling the long-standing sample compression conjecture (Warmuth, 2003). Concretely, the approach proposed by Floyd and Warmuth (1995) entails embedding any given VC class into an extremal class of a comparable dimension, and then applying an optimal sample compression scheme for extremal classes. However, our results imply that this strategy would in some cases result in a sample compression scheme at least exponentially larger than what is predicted by the sample compression conjecture. The above implications follow from a general result we prove: any extremal class with VC dimension dùëëd has dual VC dimension at most 2‚Äãd+12ùëë12d+1. This bound is exponentially smaller than the classical bound 2d+1‚àí1superscript2ùëë112^{d+1}-1 of Assouad (1983), which applies to general concept classes (and is known to be unimprovable for some classes). We in fact prove a stronger result, establishing that 2‚Äãd+12ùëë12d+1 upper bounds the dual Radon number of extremal classes. This theorem represents an abstraction of the classical Radon theorem for convex sets, extending its applicability to a wider combinatorial framework, without relying on the specifics of Euclidean convexity. The proof utilizes the topological method and is primarily based on variants of the Topological Radon Theorem (Bajm√≥czy and B√°r√°ny, 1979).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
