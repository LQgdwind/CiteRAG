Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Guided Unsupervised Learning by Subaperture Decomposition for Ocean SAR Image Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can provide accurate images of the ocean surface roughness day-or-night in nearly all weather conditions, being an unique asset for many geophysical applications. Considering the huge amount of data daily acquired by satellites, automated techniques for physical features extraction are needed. Even if supervised deep learning methods attain state-of-the-art results, they require great amount of labeled data, which are difficult and excessively expensive to acquire for ocean SAR imagery. To this end, we use the subaperture decomposition (SD) algorithm to enhance the unsupervised learning retrieval on the ocean surface, empowering ocean researchers to search into large ocean databases. We empirically prove that SD improve the retrieval precision with over 20% for an unsupervised transformer auto-encoder network. Moreover, we show that SD brings important performance boost when Doppler centroid images are used as input data, leading the way to new unsupervised physics guided retrieval algorithms.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
