Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Graph Out-of-Distribution Generalization with Controllable Data Augmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Graph Neural Network (GNN) has demonstrated extraordinary performance in classifying graph properties. However, due to the selection bias of training and testing data (e.g., training on small graphs and testing on large graphs, or training on dense graphs and testing on sparse graphs), distribution deviation is widespread. More importantly, we often observe hybrid structure distribution shift of both scale and density, despite of one-sided biased data partition. The spurious correlations over hybrid distribution deviation degrade the performance of previous GNN methods and show large instability among different datasets. To alleviate this problem, we propose OOD-GMixup to jointly manipulate the training distribution with controllable data augmentation in metric space. Specifically, we first extract the graph rationales to eliminate the spurious correlations due to irrelevant information. Secondly, we generate virtual samples with perturbation on graph rationale representation domain to obtain potential OOD training samples. Finally, we propose OOD calibration to measure the distribution deviation of virtual samples by leveraging Extreme Value Theory, and further actively control the training distribution by emphasizing the impact of virtual OOD samples. Extensive studies on several real-world datasets on graph classification demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
