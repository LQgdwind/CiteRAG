Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data.

      "content": "Paper Title: Knowledge-augmented Few-shot Visual Relation Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Visual Relation Detection (VRD) aims to detect relationships between objects for image understanding. Most existing VRD methods rely on thousands of training samples of each relationship to achieve satisfactory performance. Some recent papers tackle this problem by few-shot learning with elaborately designed pipelines and pre-trained word vectors. However, the performance of existing few-shot VRD models is severely hampered by the poor generalization capability, as they struggle to handle the vast semantic diversity of visual relationships. Nonetheless, humans have the ability to learn new relationships with just few examples based on their knowledge. Inspired by this, we devise a knowledge-augmented, few-shot VRD framework leveraging both textual knowledge and visual relation knowledge to improve the generalization ability of few-shot VRD. The textual knowledge and visual relation knowledge are acquired from a pre-trained language model and an automatically constructed visual relation knowledge graph, respectively. We extensively validate the effectiveness of our framework. Experiments conducted on three benchmarks from the commonly used Visual Genome dataset show that our performance surpasses existing state-of-the-art models with a large improvement.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 49\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
