      "content": "Paper Title: A Comparative Study on Movement Feature in Different Directions for Micro-Expression Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Micro-expression can reflect peopleâ€™s real emotions. Recognizing micro-expressions is difficult because they are small motions and have a short duration. As the research is deepening into micro-expression recognition, many effective features and methods have been proposed. To determine which direction of movement feature is easier for distinguishing micro-expressions, this paper selects 18 directions (including three types of horizontal, vertical and oblique movements) and proposes a new low-dimensional feature called the Histogram of Single Direction Gradient (HSDG) to study this topic. In this paper, HSDG in every direction is concatenated with LBP-TOP to obtain the LBP with Single Direction Gradient (LBP-SDG) and analyze which direction of movement feature is more discriminative for micro-expression recognition. As with some existing work, Euler Video Magnification (EVM) is employed as a preprocessing step. The experiments on the CASME II and SMIC-HS databases summarize the effective and optimal directions and demonstrate that HSDG in an optimal direction is discriminative, and the corresponding LBP-SDG achieves state-of-the-art performance using EVM.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
