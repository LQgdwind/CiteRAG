Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Extractors for Images of Varieties\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We construct explicit deterministic extractors for polynomial images of varieties, that is, distributions sampled by applying a low-degree polynomial map f:ùîΩqr‚ÜíùîΩqn:ùëì‚ÜísuperscriptsubscriptùîΩùëûùëüsuperscriptsubscriptùîΩùëûùëõf:\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{r}\\to\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n} to an element sampled uniformly at random from a kùëòk-dimensional variety V‚äÜùîΩqrùëâsuperscriptsubscriptùîΩùëûùëüV\\subseteq\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{r}. This class of sources generalizes both polynomial sources, studied by Dvir, Gabizon and Wigderson (FOCS 2007, Comput. Complex. 2009), and variety sources, studied by Dvir (CCC 2009, Comput. Complex. 2012). Assuming certain natural non-degeneracy conditions on the map fùëìf and the variety VùëâV, which in particular ensure that the source has enough min-entropy, we extract almost all the min-entropy of the distribution. Unlike the Dvir‚ÄìGabizon‚ÄìWigderson and Dvir results, our construction works over large enough finite fields of arbitrary characteristic. One key part of our construction is an improved deterministic rank extractor for varieties. As a by-product, we obtain explicit Noether normalization lemmas for affine varieties and affine algebras. Additionally, we generalize a construction of affine extractors with exponentially small error due to Bourgain, Dvir and Leeman (Comput. Complex. 2016) by extending it to all finite prime fields of quasipolynomial size.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
