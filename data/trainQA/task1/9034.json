      "content": "Paper Title: On Approximability of Steiner Tree in ℓ_𝑝-metrics\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In the Continuous Steiner Tree problem (𝖢𝖲𝖳𝖢𝖲𝖳\\mathsf{CST}), we are given as input a set of points (called terminals) in a metric space and ask for the minimum-cost tree connecting them. Additional points (called Steiner points) from the metric space can be introduced as nodes in the solution. In the Discrete Steiner Tree problem (𝖣𝖲𝖳𝖣𝖲𝖳\\mathsf{DST}), we are given in addition to the terminals, a set of facilities, and any solution tree connecting the terminals can only contain the Steiner points from this set of facilities. Trevisan [SICOMP’00] showed that 𝖢𝖲𝖳𝖢𝖲𝖳\\mathsf{CST} and 𝖣𝖲𝖳𝖣𝖲𝖳\\mathsf{DST} are 𝖠𝖯𝖷𝖠𝖯𝖷\\mathsf{APX}-hard when the input lies in the ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-metric (and Hamming metric). Chlebík and Chlebíková [TCS’08] showed that 𝖣𝖲𝖳𝖣𝖲𝖳\\mathsf{DST} is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hard to approximate to factor of 96/95≈1.0196951.0196/95\\approx 1.01 in the graph metric (and consequently ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty}-metric). Prior to this work, it was unclear if 𝖢𝖲𝖳𝖢𝖲𝖳\\mathsf{CST} and 𝖣𝖲𝖳𝖣𝖲𝖳\\mathsf{DST} are 𝖠𝖯𝖷𝖠𝖯𝖷\\mathsf{APX}-hard in essentially every other popular metric! In this work, we prove that 𝖣𝖲𝖳𝖣𝖲𝖳\\mathsf{DST} is 𝖠𝖯𝖷𝖠𝖯𝖷\\mathsf{APX}-hard in every ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\\ell_{p}-metric. We also prove that 𝖢𝖲𝖳𝖢𝖲𝖳\\mathsf{CST} is 𝖠𝖯𝖷𝖠𝖯𝖷\\mathsf{APX}-hard in the ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty}-metric. Finally, we relate 𝖢𝖲𝖳𝖢𝖲𝖳\\mathsf{CST} and 𝖣𝖲𝖳𝖣𝖲𝖳\\mathsf{DST}, by observing a gap preserving reduction from 𝖢𝖲𝖳𝖢𝖲𝖳\\mathsf{CST} to 𝖣𝖲𝖳𝖣𝖲𝖳\\mathsf{DST} in ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\\ell_{p}-metrics. It is known that the 𝖠𝖯𝖷𝖠𝖯𝖷\\mathsf{APX}-hardness of 𝖣𝖲𝖳𝖣𝖲𝖳\\mathsf{DST} in ℓ0,ℓ1subscriptℓ0subscriptℓ1\\ell_{0},\\ell_{1}, and ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty}-metrics can be obtained from the 𝖠𝖯𝖷𝖠𝖯𝖷\\mathsf{APX}-hardness of covering problems (with additional structure). Our main conceptual insight is that for certain ranges of p𝑝p (such as p=2𝑝2p=2), the soundness guarantees of covering problems might be insufficient to show that 𝖣𝖲𝖳𝖣𝖲𝖳\\mathsf{DST} in the ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\\ell_{p}-metric is 𝖠𝖯𝖷𝖠𝖯𝖷\\mathsf{APX}-hard, but the soundness guarantees of a packing problem (with requisite additional structure) is enough. Equipped with this insight, we are then able to embed set systems into every ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\\ell_{p}-metric, and, depending on the value of p𝑝p, our soundness analysis of the corresponding 𝖣𝖲𝖳𝖣𝖲𝖳\\mathsf{DST} instance in the ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\\ell_{p}-metric will use either the packing property or the covering property (or both) of the set system in the soundness case. Due to the discrete structure of the Hamming space, the 𝖠𝖯𝖷𝖠𝖯𝖷\\mathsf{APX}-hardness of 𝖢𝖲𝖳𝖢𝖲𝖳\\mathsf{CST} in the ℓ0subscriptℓ0\\ell_{0} and ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} metrics follow from similar methods. However, these techniques do not extend to 𝖢𝖲𝖳𝖢𝖲𝖳\\mathsf{CST} in other ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\\ell_{p}-metrics. To show 𝖠𝖯𝖷𝖠𝖯𝖷\\mathsf{APX}-hardness of 𝖢𝖲𝖳𝖢𝖲𝖳\\mathsf{CST} in the ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty}-metric, we instead rely on the robust hardness guarantees of graph coloring problems. Concretely, we present a reduction from a graph G𝐺G on n𝑛n vertices to a point-set P𝑃P in the ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty}-metric space, where the cost of the optimal Steiner tree of P𝑃P is exactly n+χ​(G)2𝑛𝜒𝐺2\\frac{n+\\chi(G)}{2}, where χ​(G)𝜒𝐺\\chi(G) is the chromatic number of G𝐺G.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
