Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Dual ResGCN for Balanced Scene Graph Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Visual scene graph generation is a challenging task. Previous works have achieved great progress, but most of them do not explicitly consider the class imbalance issue in scene graph generation. Models learned without considering the class imbalance tend to predict the majority classes, which leads to a good performance on trivial frequent predicates, but poor performance on informative infrequent predicates. However, predicates of minority classes often carry more semantic and precise information (e.g., ‘on’ v.s ‘parked on’). To alleviate the influence of the class imbalance, we propose a novel model, dubbed dual ResGCN, which consists of an object residual graph convolutional network and a relation residual graph convolutional network. The two networks are complementary to each other. The former captures object-level context information, i.e., the connections among objects. We propose a novel ResGCN that enhances object features in a cross attention manner. Besides, we stack multiple contextual coefficients to alleviate the imbalance issue and enrich the prediction diversity. The latter is carefully designed to explicitly capture relation-level context information i.e., the connections among relations. We propose to incorporate the prior about the co-occurrence of relation pairs into the graph to further help alleviate the class imbalance issue. Extensive evaluations of three tasks are performed on the large-scale database VG to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
