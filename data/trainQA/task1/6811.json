      "content": "Paper Title: Unifying Causal Inference and Reinforcement Learning using Higher-Order Category Theory Draft under revision. Comments welcome.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present a unified formalism for structure discovery of causal models and predictive state representation (PSR) models in reinforcement learning (RL) using higher-order category theory. Specifically, we model structure discovery in both settings using simplicial objects, contravariant functors from the category of ordinal numbers into any category. Fragments of causal models that are equivalent under conditional independence ‚Äì defined as causal horns ‚Äì as well as subsequences of potential tests in a predictive state representation ‚Äì defined as predictive horns ‚Äì are both special cases of horns of a simplicial object, subsets resulting from the removal of the interior and the face opposite a particular vertex. Latent structure discovery in both settings involve the same fundamental mathematical problem of finding extensions of horns of simplicial objects through solving lifting problems in commutative diagrams, and exploiting weak homotopies that define higher-order symmetries. Solutions to the problem of filling ‚Äúinner\" vs ‚Äúouter\" horns leads to various notions of higher-order categories, from Kan complexes to quasicategories and ‚àû\\infty-category theory. We define the abstract problem of structure discovery in both settings in terms of adjoint functors between the category of universal causal models or universal decision models and its simplicial object representation. In general, the left adjoint functor from a simplicial object XùëãX to a category ùíûùíû{\\cal C} is lossy, preserving only relationships up to a certain order defined by homotopical equivalences. In contrast, the right adjoint defining the nerve of a category constructs a lossless encoding of a category as a simplicial object.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
