Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract There is growing interest in engineering unconventional computing devices that leverage the intrinsic dynamics of physical substrates to perform fast and energy-efficient computations. Granular metamaterials are one such substrate that has emerged as a promising platform for building wave-based information processing devices with the potential to integrate sensing, actuation, and computation. Their high-dimensional and nonlinear dynamics result in nontrivial and sometimes counter-intuitive wave responses that can be shaped by the material properties, geometry, and configuration of individual grains. Such highly tunable rich dynamics can be utilized for mechanical computing in special-purpose applications. However, there are currently no general frameworks for the inverse design of large-scale granular materials. Here, we build upon the similarity between the spatiotemporal dynamics of wave propagation in material and the computational dynamics of Recurrent Neural Networks to develop a gradient-based optimization framework for harmonically driven granular crystals. We showcase how our framework can be utilized to design basic logic gates where mechanical vibrations carry the information at predetermined frequencies. We compare our design methodology with classic gradient-free methods and find that our approach discovers higher-performing configurations with less computational effort. Our findings show that a gradient-based optimization method can greatly expand the design space of metamaterials and provide the opportunity to systematically traverse the parameter space to find materials with the desired functionalities.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
