Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Disciplined Geodesically Convex Programming\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Convex programming plays a fundamental role in machine learning, data science, and engineering. Testing convexity structure in nonlinear programs relies on verifying the convexity of objectives and constraints. Grant et al. (2006) introduced a framework, Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP), for automating this verification task for a wide range of convex functions that can be decomposed into basic convex functions (atoms) using convexity-preserving compositions and transformations (rules). However, the restriction to Euclidean convexity concepts can limit the applicability of the framework. For instance, many notable instances of statistical estimators and matrix-valued (sub)routines in machine learning applications are Euclidean non-convex, but exhibit geodesic convexity through a more general Riemannian lens. In this work, we extend disciplined programming to this setting by introducing Disciplined Geodesically Convex Programming (DGCP). We determine convexity-preserving compositions and transformations for geodesically convex functions on general Cartan-Hadamard manifolds, as well as for the special case of symmetric positive definite matrices, a common setting in matrix-valued optimization. For the latter, we also define a basic set of atoms. Our paper is accompanied by a Julia package SymbolicAnalysis.jl, which provides functionality for testing and certifying DGCP-compliant expressions. Our library interfaces with manifold optimization software, which allows for directly solving verified geodesically convex programs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper.
