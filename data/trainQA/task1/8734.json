Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Quantum Neural Network for Quantum Neural Computing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Neural networks have achieved impressive breakthroughs in both industry and academia. How to effectively develop neural networks on quantum computing devices is a challenging open problem. Here, we propose a new quantum neural network model for quantum neural computing using (classically-controlled) single-qubit operations and measurements on real-world quantum systems with naturally occurring environment-induced decoherence, which greatly reduces the difficulties of physical implementations. Our model circumvents the problem that the state-space size grows exponentially with the number of neurons, thereby greatly reducing memory requirements and allowing for fast optimization with traditional optimization algorithms. We benchmark our model for handwritten digit recognition and other nonlinear classification tasks. The results show that our model has an amazing nonlinear classification ability and robustness to noise. Furthermore, our model allows quantum computing to be applied in a wider context and inspires the earlier development of a quantum neural computer than standard quantum computers.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
