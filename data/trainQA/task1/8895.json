Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Rethink Diversity in Deep Learning Testing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated extraordinary capabilities and are an integral part of modern software systems. However, they also suffer from various vulnerabilities such as adversarial attacks and unfairness. Testing deep learning (DL) systems is therefore an important task, to detect and mitigate those vulnerabilities. Motivated by the success of traditional software testing, which often employs diversity heuristics, various diversity measures on DNNs have been proposed to help efficiently expose the buggy behavior of DNNs. In this work, we argue that many DNN testing tasks should be treated as directed testing problems rather than general-purpose testing tasks, because these tasks are specific and well-defined. Hence, the diversity-based approach is less effective. Following our argument based on the semantics of DNNs and the testing goal, we derive 666 metrics that can be used for DNN testing and carefully analyze their application scopes. We empirically show their efficacy in exposing bugs in DNNs compared to recent diversity-based metrics. Moreover, we also notice discrepancies between the practices of the software engineering (SE) community and the DL community. We point out some of these gaps, and hopefully, this can lead to bridging the SE practice and DL findings.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
