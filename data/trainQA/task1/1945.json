      "content": "Paper Title: Approximability results for the ùëù-centdian and the converse centdian problemsAn extended abstract of this paper was presented in the 18th International Conference Information and Knowledge Engineering (IKE 2019). This work was supported in part by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan under Contract MOST 105-2221-E-845-002, 107-2115-M-845-001 and 110-2221-E-845-001.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Given an undirected graph G=(V,E)ùê∫ùëâùê∏G=(V,E) with a nonnegative edge length function and an integer pùëùp, 0<p<|V|0ùëùùëâ0<p<|V|, the pùëùp-centdian problem is to find pùëùp vertices (called the centdian set) of VùëâV such that the eccentricity plus median-distance is minimized, in which the eccentricity is the maximum (length) distance of all vertices to their nearest centdian set and the median-distance is the total (length) distance of all vertices to their nearest centdian set. The eccentricity plus median-distance is called the centdian-distance. The purpose of the pùëùp-centdian problem is to find pùëùp open facilities (servers) which satisfy the quality-of-service of the minimum total distance (median-distance) and the maximum distance (eccentricity) to their service customers, simultaneously. If we converse the two criteria, that is given the bound of the centdian-distance and the objective function is to minimize the cardinality of the centdian set, this problem is called the converse centdian problem. In this paper, we prove the pùëùp-centdian problem is NP-Complete. Then we design the first non-trivial brute force exact algorithms for the pùëùp-centdian problem and the converse centdian problem, respectively. Finally, we design two approximation algorithms for both problems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
