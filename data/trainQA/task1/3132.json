Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Unsupervised Semantic Role Labeling\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. The task of semantic role labeling (SRL) is dedicated to finding the predicate-argument structure. Previous works on SRL are mostly supervised and do not consider the difficulty in labeling each example which can be very expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we present the first neural unsupervised model for SRL. To decompose the task as two argument related subtasks, identification and clustering, we propose a pipeline that correspondingly consists of two neural modules. First, we train a neural model on two syntax-aware statistically developed rules. The neural model gets the relevance signal for each token in a sentence, to feed into a BiLSTM, and then an adversarial layer for noise-adding and classifying simultaneously, thus enabling the model to learn the semantic structure of a sentence. Then we propose another neural model for argument role clustering, which is done through clustering the learned argument embeddings biased towards their dependency relations. Experiments on CoNLL-2009 English dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline in terms of non-neural models for argument identification and classification.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
