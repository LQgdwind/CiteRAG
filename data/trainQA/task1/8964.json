Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Robust Reinforcement Learning Objectives for Sequential Recommender Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Attention-based sequential recommendation methods have demonstrated promising results by accurately capturing users’ dynamic interests from historical interactions. In addition to generating superior user representations, recent studies have begun integrating reinforcement learning (RL) into these models. Framing sequential recommendation as an RL problem with reward signals, unlocks developing recommender systems (RS) that consider a vital aspect—incorporating direct user feedback in the form of rewards to deliver a more personalized experience. Nonetheless, employing RL algorithms presents challenges, including off-policy training, expansive combinatorial action spaces, and the scarcity of datasets with sufficient reward signals. Contemporary approaches have attempted to combine RL and sequential modeling, incorporating contrastive-based objectives and negative sampling strategies for training the RL component. In this study, we further emphasize the efficacy of contrastive-based objectives paired with augmentation to address datasets with extended horizons. Additionally, we recognize the potential instability issues that may arise during the application of negative sampling. These challenges primarily stem from the data imbalance prevalent in real-world datasets, which is a common issue in offline RL contexts. While our established baselines attempt to mitigate this through various techniques, instability remains an issue. Therefore, we introduce an enhanced methodology aimed at providing a more effective solution to these challenges.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
