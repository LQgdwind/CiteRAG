Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Approximating shortest paths in weighted square and hexagonal meshes\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Continuous 2-dimensional space is often discretized by considering a mesh of weighted cells. In this work we study how well a weighted mesh approximates the space, with respect to shortest paths. We consider a shortest path 𝑆𝑃w​(s,t)subscript𝑆𝑃𝑤𝑠𝑡\\mathit{SP_{w}}(s,t) from s𝑠s to t𝑡t in the continuous 2-dimensional space, a shortest vertex path 𝑆𝑉𝑃w​(s,t)subscript𝑆𝑉𝑃𝑤𝑠𝑡\\mathit{SVP_{w}}(s,t) (or any-angle path), which is a shortest path where the vertices of the path are vertices of the mesh, and a shortest grid path 𝑆𝐺𝑃w​(s,t)subscript𝑆𝐺𝑃𝑤𝑠𝑡\\mathit{SGP_{w}}(s,t), which is a shortest path in a graph associated to the weighted mesh. We provide upper and lower bounds on the ratios ∥𝑆𝐺𝑃w​(s,t)∥∥𝑆𝑃w​(s,t)∥delimited-∥∥subscript𝑆𝐺𝑃𝑤𝑠𝑡delimited-∥∥subscript𝑆𝑃𝑤𝑠𝑡\\frac{\\lVert\\mathit{SGP_{w}}(s,t)\\rVert}{\\lVert\\mathit{SP_{w}}(s,t)\\rVert}, ∥𝑆𝑉𝑃w​(s,t)∥∥𝑆𝑃w​(s,t)∥delimited-∥∥subscript𝑆𝑉𝑃𝑤𝑠𝑡delimited-∥∥subscript𝑆𝑃𝑤𝑠𝑡\\frac{\\lVert\\mathit{SVP_{w}}(s,t)\\rVert}{\\lVert\\mathit{SP_{w}}(s,t)\\rVert}, ∥𝑆𝐺𝑃w​(s,t)∥∥𝑆𝑉𝑃w​(s,t)∥delimited-∥∥subscript𝑆𝐺𝑃𝑤𝑠𝑡delimited-∥∥subscript𝑆𝑉𝑃𝑤𝑠𝑡\\frac{\\lVert\\mathit{SGP_{w}}(s,t)\\rVert}{\\lVert\\mathit{SVP_{w}}(s,t)\\rVert} in square and hexagonal meshes, extending previous results for triangular grids. These ratios determine the effectiveness of existing algorithms that compute shortest paths on the graphs obtained from the grids. Our main results are that the ratio ∥𝑆𝐺𝑃w​(s,t)∥∥𝑆𝑃w​(s,t)∥delimited-∥∥subscript𝑆𝐺𝑃𝑤𝑠𝑡delimited-∥∥subscript𝑆𝑃𝑤𝑠𝑡\\frac{\\lVert\\mathit{SGP_{w}}(s,t)\\rVert}{\\lVert\\mathit{SP_{w}}(s,t)\\rVert} is at most 22+2≈1.082221.08\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}}}\\approx 1.08 and 22+3≈1.042231.04\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{3}}}\\approx 1.04 in a square and a hexagonal mesh, respectively.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
