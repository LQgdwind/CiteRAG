Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Enhancing Contrastive Learning with Efficient Combinatorial Positive Pairing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In the past few years, contrastive learning has played a central role for the success of visual unsupervised representation learning. Around the same time, high-performance non-contrastive learning methods have been developed as well. While most of the works utilize only two views, we carefully review the existing multi-view methods and propose a general multi-view strategy that can improve learning speed and performance of any contrastive or non-contrastive method. We first analyze CMC‚Äôs full-graph paradigm and empirically show that the learning speed of KùêæK-views can be increased by C2KsubscriptsubscriptC2ùêæ{}_{K}\\mathrm{C}_{2} times for small learning rate and early training. Then, we upgrade CMC‚Äôs full-graph by mixing views created by a crop-only augmentation, adopting small-size views as in SwAV multi-crop, and modifying the negative sampling. The resulting multi-view strategy is called ECPP (Efficient Combinatorial Positive Pairing). We investigate the effectiveness of ECPP by applying it to SimCLR and assessing the linear evaluation performance for CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100. For each benchmark, we achieve a state-of-the-art performance. In case of ImageNet-100, ECPP boosted SimCLR outperforms supervised learning.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
