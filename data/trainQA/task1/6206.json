Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring Structure-aware Transformer over Interaction Proposals for Human-Object Interaction DetectionThis work was performed at JD Explore Academy.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recent high-performing Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection techniques have been highly influenced by Transformer-based object detector (i.e., DETR). Nevertheless, most of them directly map parametric interaction queries into a set of HOI predictions through vanilla Transformer in a one-stage manner. This leaves rich inter- or intra-interaction structure under-exploited. In this work, we design a novel Transformer-style HOI detector, i.e., Structure-aware Transformer over Interaction Proposals (STIP), for HOI detection. Such design decomposes the process of HOI set prediction into two subsequent phases, i.e., an interaction proposal generation is first performed, and then followed by transforming the non-parametric interaction proposals into HOI predictions via a structure-aware Transformer. The structure-aware Transformer upgrades vanilla Transformer by encoding additionally the holistically semantic structure among interaction proposals as well as the locally spatial structure of human/object within each interaction proposal, so as to strengthen HOI predictions. Extensive experiments conducted on V-COCO and HICO-DET benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness of STIP, and superior results are reported when comparing with the state-of-the-art HOI detectors. Source code is available at https://github.com/zyong812/STIP.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
