Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 10 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Persistent Homology of Fractional Gaussian Noise\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we employ the persistent homology (PH) technique to examine the topological properties of fractional Gaussian noise (fGn). We develop the weighted natural visibility graph algorithm, and the associated simplicial complexes through the filtration process are quantified by PH. The evolution of the homology group dimension represented by Betti numbers demonstrates a strong dependency on the Hurst exponent (HùêªH). The coefficients of the birth and death curve of the kùëòk-dimensional topological holes (kùëòk-holes) at a given threshold depend on HùêªH which is almost not affected by finite sample size. We show that the distribution function of a lifetime for kùëòk-holes decays exponentially and the corresponding slope is an increasing function versus HùêªH, and more interestingly, the sample size effect completely disappears in this quantity. The persistence entropy logarithmically grows with the size of the visibility graph of a system with almost HùêªH-dependent prefactors. On the contrary, the local statistical features are not able to determine the corresponding Hurst exponent of fGn data, while the moments of eigenvalue distribution (MnsubscriptùëÄùëõM_{n}) for n‚â•1ùëõ1n\\geq 1 reveal a dependency on HùêªH, containing the sample size effect. Finally, the PH shows the correlated behavior of electroencephalography for both healthy and schizophrenic samples.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 10 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 10\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
