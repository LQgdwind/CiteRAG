Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Exact Algorithms for Clustered Planarity with Linear Saturators\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study Clustered Planarity with Linear Saturators, which is the problem of augmenting an nùëõn-vertex planar graph whose vertices are partitioned into independent sets (called clusters) with paths‚Äîone for each cluster‚Äîthat connect all the vertices in each cluster while maintaining planarity. We show that the problem can be solved in time 2ùí™‚Äã(n)superscript2ùí™ùëõ2^{\\mathcal{O}(n)} for both the variable and fixed embedding case. Moreover, we show that it can be solved in subexponential time 2ùí™‚Äã(n‚Äãlog‚Å°n)superscript2ùí™ùëõùëõ2^{\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n}\\log n)} in the fixed embedding case if additionally the input graph is connected. The latter time complexity is tight under the Exponential-Time Hypothesis. We also show that nùëõn can be replaced with the vertex cover number of the input graph by providing a linear (resp. polynomial) kernel for the variable-embedding (resp. fixed-embedding) case; these results contrast the \\NP-hardness of the problem on graphs of bounded treewidth (and even on trees). Finally, we complement known lower bounds for the problem by showing that Clustered Planarity with Linear Saturators is \\NP-hard even when the number of clusters is at most 333, thus excluding the algorithmic use of the number of clusters as a parameter.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
