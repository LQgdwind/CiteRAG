Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Deep Graph Reinforcement Learning Model for Improving User Experience in Live Video Streaming\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. In this paper we present a deep graph reinforcement learning model to predict and improve the user experience during a live video streaming event, orchestrated by an agent/tracker. We first formulate the user experience prediction problem as a classification task, accounting for the fact that most of the viewers at the beginning of an event have poor quality of experience due to low-bandwidth connections and limited interactions with the tracker. In our model we consider different factors that influence the quality of user experience and train the proposed model on diverse state-action transitions when viewers interact with the tracker. In addition, provided that past events have various user experience characteristics we follow a gradient boosting strategy to compute a global model that learns from different events. Our experiments with three real-world datasets of live video streaming events demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model against several baseline strategies. Moreover, as the majority of the viewers at the beginning of an event has poor experience, we show that our model can significantly increase the number of viewers with high quality experience by at least 75% over the first streaming minutes. Our evaluation datasets and implementation are publicly available at https://publicresearch.z13.web.core.windows.net\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
