Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Parallel Genetic Algorithm for Perturbed Substructure Optimization in Complex Network\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Evolutionary computing, particularly genetic algorithm (GA), is a combinatorial optimization method inspired by natural selection and the transmission of genetic information, which is widely used to identify optimal solutions to complex problems through simulated programming and iteration. Due to its strong adaptability, flexibility, and robustness, GA has shown significant performance and potentiality on perturbed substructure optimization (PSSO), an important graph mining problem that achieves its goals by modifying network structures. However, the efficiency and practicality of GA-based PSSO face enormous challenges due to the complexity and diversity of application scenarios. While some research has explored acceleration frameworks in evolutionary computing, their performance on PSSO remains limited due to a lack of scenario generalizability. Based on these, this paper is the first to present the GA-based PSSO Acceleration framework (GAPA), which simplifies the GA development process and supports distributed acceleration. Specifically, it reconstructs the genetic operation and designs a development framework for efficient parallel acceleration. Meanwhile, GAPA includes an extensible library that optimizes and accelerates 10 PSSO algorithms, covering 4 crucial tasks for graph mining. Comprehensive experiments on 18 datasets across 4 tasks and 10 algorithms effectively demonstrate the superiority of GAPA, achieving an average of 4x the acceleration of Evox. The repository is in https://github.com/NetAlsGroup/GAPA.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
