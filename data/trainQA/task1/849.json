Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Fair Classification via Unconstrained Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Achieving the Bayes optimal binary classification rule subject to group fairness constraints is known to be reducible, in some cases, to learning a group-wise thresholding rule over the Bayes regressor. In this paper, we extend this result by proving that, in a broader setting, the Bayes optimal fair learning rule remains a group-wise thresholding rule over the Bayes regressor but with a (possible) randomization at the thresholds. This provides a stronger justification to the post-processing approach in fair classification, in which (1) a predictor is learned first, after which (2) its output is adjusted to remove bias. We show how the post-processing rule in this two-stage approach can be learned quite efficiently by solving an unconstrained optimization problem. The proposed algorithm can be applied to any black-box machine learning model, such as deep neural networks, random forests and support vector machines. In addition, it can accommodate many fairness criteria that have been previously proposed in the literature, such as equalized odds and statistical parity. We prove that the algorithm is Bayes consistent and motivate it, furthermore, via an impossibility result that quantifies the tradeoff between accuracy and fairness across multiple demographic groups. Finally, we conclude by validating the algorithm on the Adult benchmark dataset.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
