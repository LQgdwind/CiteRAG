      "content": "Paper Title: Geometric Graph Representation Learning via Maximizing Rate Reduction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Learning discriminative node representations benefits various downstream tasks in graph analysis such as community detection and node classification. Existing graph representation learning methods (e.g., based on random walk and contrastive learning) are limited to maximizing the local similarity of connected nodes. Such pair-wise learning schemes could fail to capture the global distribution of representations, since it has no explicit constraints on the global geometric properties of representation space. To this end, we propose Geometric Graph Representation Learning (G2​RsuperscriptG2R\\mathrm{G}^{2}\\mathrm{R}) to learn node representations in an unsupervised manner via maximizing rate reduction. In this way, G2​RsuperscriptG2R\\mathrm{G}^{2}\\mathrm{R} maps nodes in distinct groups (implicitly stored in the adjacency matrix) into different subspaces, while each subspace is compact and different subspaces are dispersedly distributed. G2​RsuperscriptG2R\\mathrm{G}^{2}\\mathrm{R} adopts a graph neural network as the encoder and maximizes the rate reduction with the adjacency matrix. Furthermore, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that rate reduction maximization is equivalent to maximizing the principal angles between different subspaces. Experiments on real-world datasets show that G2​RsuperscriptG2R\\mathrm{G}^{2}\\mathrm{R} outperforms various baselines on node classification and community detection tasks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
