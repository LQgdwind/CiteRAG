      "content": "Paper Title: On the average-case hardness of BosonSampling\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract BosonSampling is a popular candidate for near-term quantum advantage, which has now been experimentally implemented several times. The original proposal of Aaronson and Arkhipov from 2011 showed that classical hardness of BosonSampling is implied by a proof of the ‚ÄúGaussian Permanent Estimation‚Äù conjecture. This conjecture states that e‚àín‚Äãlog‚Å°n‚àín‚àíO‚Äã(log‚Å°n)superscriptùëíùëõùëõùëõùëÇùëõe^{-n\\log{n}-n-O(\\log n)} additive error estimates to the output probability of most random BosonSampling experiments are #P-hard. Proving this conjecture has since become the central question in the theory of quantum advantage. In this work we make progress by proving that e‚àín‚Äãlog‚Å°n‚àín‚àíO‚Äã(nŒ¥)superscriptùëíùëõùëõùëõùëÇsuperscriptùëõùõøe^{-n\\log n-n-O(n^{\\delta})} additive error estimates to output probabilities of most random BosonSampling experiments are #P-hard, for any Œ¥>0ùõø0\\delta>0. In the process, we circumvent all known barrier results for proving the hardness of BosonSampling experiments. This is nearly the robustness needed to prove hardness of BosonSampling‚Äîthe remaining hurdle is now ‚Äúmerely‚Äù to show that the nŒ¥superscriptùëõùõøn^{\\delta} in the exponent can be improved to O‚Äã(log‚Å°n).ùëÇùëõO(\\log n). We also obtain an analogous result for Random Circuit Sampling. Our result allows us to show, for the first time, a hardness of classical sampling result for random BosonSampling experiments, under an anticoncentration conjecture. Specifically, we prove the impossibility of multiplicative-error sampling from random BosonSampling experiments with probability 1‚àíe‚àíO‚Äã(n)1superscriptùëíùëÇùëõ1-e^{-O(n)}, unless the Polynomial Hierarchy collapses.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
