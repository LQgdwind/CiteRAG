      "content": "Paper Title: ExKMC: Expanding Explainable ùëò-Means Clustering\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Despite the popularity of explainable AI, there is limited work on effective methods for unsupervised learning. We study algorithms for kùëòk-means clustering, focusing on a trade-off between explainability and accuracy. Following prior work, we use a small decision tree to partition a dataset into kùëòk clusters. This enables us to explain each cluster assignment by a short sequence of single-feature thresholds. While larger trees produce more accurate clusterings, they also require more complex explanations. To allow flexibility, we develop a new explainable kùëòk-means clustering algorithm, ExKMC, that takes an additional parameter k‚Ä≤‚â•ksuperscriptùëò‚Ä≤ùëòk^{\\prime}\\geq k and outputs a decision tree with k‚Ä≤superscriptùëò‚Ä≤k^{\\prime} leaves. We use a new surrogate cost to efficiently expand the tree and to label the leaves with one of kùëòk clusters. We prove that as k‚Ä≤superscriptùëò‚Ä≤k^{\\prime} increases, the surrogate cost is non-increasing, and hence, we trade explainability for accuracy. Empirically, we validate that ExKMC produces a low cost clustering, outperforming both standard decision tree methods and other algorithms for explainable clustering. Implementation of ExKMC available at https://github.com/navefr/ExKMC.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
