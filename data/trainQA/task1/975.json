Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Explaining Local, Global, And Higher-Order Interactions In Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present a simple yet highly generalizable method for explaining interacting parts within a neural network’s reasoning process. First, we design an algorithm based on cross derivatives for computing statistical interaction effects between individual features, which is generalized to both 2-way and higher-order (3-way or more) interactions. We present results side by side with a weight-based attribution technique, corroborating that cross derivatives are a superior metric for both 2-way and higher-order interaction detection. Moreover, we extend the use of cross derivatives as an explanatory device in neural networks to the computer vision setting by expanding Grad-CAM, a popular gradient-based explanatory tool for CNNs, to the higher order. While Grad-CAM can only explain the importance of individual objects in images, our method, which we call Taylor-CAM, can explain a neural network’s relational reasoning across multiple objects. We show the success of our explanations both qualitatively and quantitatively, including with a user study. We will release all code as a tool package to facilitate explainable deep learning.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
