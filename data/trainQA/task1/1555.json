Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Approximating the packedness of polygonal curves\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In 2012 Driemel et al. [18] introduced the concept of cùëêc-packed curves as a realistic input model. In the case when cùëêc is a constant they gave a near linear time (1+Œµ)1ùúÄ(1+\\varepsilon)-approximation algorithm for computing the Fr√©chet distance between two cùëêc-packed polygonal curves. Since then a number of papers have used the model. In this paper we consider the problem of computing the smallest cùëêc for which a given polygonal curve in ‚Ñùdsuperscript‚Ñùùëë\\mathbb{R}^{d} is cùëêc-packed. We present two approximation algorithms. The first algorithm is a 222-approximation algorithm and runs in O‚Äã(d‚Äãn2‚Äãlog‚Å°n)ùëÇùëësuperscriptùëõ2ùëõO(dn^{2}\\log n) time. In the case d=2ùëë2d=2 we develop a faster algorithm that returns a (6+Œµ)6ùúÄ(6+\\varepsilon)-approximation and runs in O((n/Œµ3)4/3polylog(n/Œµ)))O((n/\\varepsilon^{3})^{4/3}\\operatorname{polylog}(n/\\varepsilon))) time. We also implemented the first algorithm and computed the approximate packedness-value for 16 sets of real-world trajectories. The experiments indicate that the notion of cùëêc-packedness is a useful realistic input model for many curves and trajectories.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
