Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Source-level reasoning for quantitative information flow\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present a novel formal system for proving quantitative-leakage properties of programs. Based on a theory of Quantitative Information Flow (QIF) that models information leakage as a noisy communication channel, it uses ‚Äúgain-functions‚Äù for the description and measurement of expected leaks. We use a small imperative programming language, augmented with leakage features, and with it express adversaries‚Äô activities in the style of, but more generally than, the Hoare triples or expectation transformers that traditionally express deterministic or probabilistic correctness but without information flow. The programs are annotated with ‚Äúgain-expressions‚Äù that capture simple adversarial settings such as ‚ÄúGuess the secret in one try.‚Äù but also much more general ones; and our formal syntax++logic -based framework enables us to transform such gain-expressions that apply after a program has finished to ones that equivalently apply before the program has begun. In that way we enable a formal proof-based reasoning system for QIF at the source level. We apply it to the language we have chosen, and demonstrate its effectiveness in a number of small but sometimes intricate situations.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
