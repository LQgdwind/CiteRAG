      "content": "Paper Title: FormerTime: Hierarchical Multi-Scale Representations for Multivariate Time Series Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Deep learning-based algorithms, e.g., convolutional networks, have significantly facilitated multivariate time series classification (MTSC) task. Nevertheless, they suffer from the limitation in modeling long-range dependence due to the nature of convolution operations. Recent advancements have shown the potential of transformers to capture long-range dependence. However, it would incur severe issues, such as fixed scale representations, temporal-invariant and quadratic time complexity, with transformers directly applicable to the MTSC task because of the distinct properties of time series data. To tackle these issues, we propose FormerTime, an hierarchical representation model for improving the classification capacity for the MTSC task. In the proposed FormerTime, we employ a hierarchical network architecture to perform multi-scale feature maps. Besides, a novel transformer encoder is further designed, in which an efficient temporal reduction attention layer and a well-informed contextual positional encoding generating strategy are developed. To sum up, FormerTime exhibits three aspects of merits: (1) learning hierarchical multi-scale representations from time series data, (2) inheriting the strength of both transformers and convolutional networks, and (3) tacking the efficiency challenges incurred by the self-attention mechanism. Extensive experiments performed on 101010 publicly available datasets from UEA archive verify the superiorities of the FormerTime compared to previous competitive baselines.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
