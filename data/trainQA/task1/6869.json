Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: CCR: Facial Image Editing with Continuity, Consistency and Reversibility\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Three problems exist in sequential facial image editing: incontinuous editing, inconsistent editing, and irreversible editing. Incontinuous editing is that the current editing can not retain the previously edited attributes. Inconsistent editing is that swapping the attribute editing orders can not yield the same results. Irreversible editing means that operating on a facial image is irreversible, especially in sequential facial image editing. In this work, we put forward three concepts and corresponding definitions: editing continuity, consistency, and reversibility. Then, we propose a novel model to achieve the goal of editing continuity, consistency, and reversibility. A sufficient criterion is defined to determine whether a model is continuous, consistent, and reversible. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental results validate our proposed model, and show that a continuous, consistent and reversible editing model has a more flexible editing function while preserving facial identity. Furthermore, we think that our proposed definitions and model will have wide and promising applications in multimedia processing. Code and data are available at https://github.com/mickoluan/CCR.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 55\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
