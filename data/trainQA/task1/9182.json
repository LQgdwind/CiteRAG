Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Theoretical Hardness and Tractability of POMDPs in RL with Partial Online State Information\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) have been widely applied to capture many real-world applications. However, existing theoretical results have shown that learning in general POMDPs could be intractable, where the main challenge lies in the lack of latent state information. A key fundamental question here is how much online state information (OSI) is sufficient to achieve tractability. In this paper, we establish a lower bound that reveals a surprising hardness result: unless we have full OSI, we need an exponentially scaling sample complexity to obtain an ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-optimal policy solution for POMDPs. Nonetheless, inspired by the key insights in our lower bound design, we find that there exist important tractable classes of POMDPs even with only partial OSI. In particular, for two novel classes of POMDPs with partial OSI, we provide new algorithms that are proved to be near-optimal by establishing new regret upper and lower bounds.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
