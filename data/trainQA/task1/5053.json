Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Generative Kernel Continual learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Kernel continual learning by Derakhshani et al. (2021) has recently emerged as a strong continual learner due to its non-parametric ability to tackle task interference and catastrophic forgetting. Unfortunately its success comes at the expense of an explicit memory to store samples from past tasks, which hampers scalability to continual learning settings with a large number of tasks. In this paper, we introduce generative kernel continual learning, which explores and exploits the synergies between generative models and kernels for continual learning. The generative model is able to produce representative samples for kernel learning, which removes the dependence on memory in kernel continual learning. Moreover, as we replay only on the generative model, we avoid task interference while being computationally more efficient compared to previous methods that need replay on the entire model. We further introduce a supervised contrastive regularization, which enables our model to generate even more discriminative samples for better kernel-based classification performance. We conduct extensive experiments on three widely-used continual learning benchmarks that demonstrate the abilities and benefits of our contributions. Most notably, on the challenging SplitCIFAR100 benchmark, with just a simple linear kernel we obtain the same accuracy as kernel continual learning with variational random features for one tenth of the memory, or a 10.1% accuracy gain for the same memory budget.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
