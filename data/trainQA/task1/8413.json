Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: InfluencerRank: Discovering Effective Influencers via Graph Convolutional Attentive Recurrent Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract As influencers play considerable roles in social media marketing, companies increase the budget for influencer marketing. Hiring effective influencers is crucial in social influencer marketing, but it is challenging to find the right influencers among hundreds of millions of social media users. In this paper, we propose InfluencerRank that ranks influencers by their effectiveness based on their posting behaviors and social relations over time. To represent the posting behaviors and social relations, the graph convolutional neural networks are applied to model influencers with heterogeneous networks during different historical periods. By learning the network structure with the embedded node features, InfluencerRank can derive informative representations for influencers at each period. An attentive recurrent neural network finally distinguishes highly effective influencers from other influencers by capturing the knowledge of the dynamics of influencer representations over time. Extensive experiments have been conducted on an Instagram dataset that consists of 18,397 influencers with their 2,952,075 posts published within 12 months. The experimental results demonstrate that InfluencerRank outperforms existing baseline methods. An in-depth analysis further reveals that all of our proposed features and model components are beneficial to discover effective influencers.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 50\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
