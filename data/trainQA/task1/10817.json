Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: The Complexity of Diameter on ùêª-free graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The intensively studied Diameter problem is to find the diameter of a given connected graph. We investigate, for the first time in a structured manner, the complexity of Diameter for HùêªH-free graphs, that is, graphs that do not contain a fixed graph HùêªH as an induced subgraph. We first show that if HùêªH is not a linear forest with small components, then Diameter cannot be solved in subquadratic time for HùêªH-free graphs under SETH. For some small linear forests, we do show linear-time algorithms for solving Diameter. For other linear forests HùêªH, we make progress towards linear-time algorithms by considering specific diameter values. If HùêªH is a linear forest, the maximum value of the diameter of any graph in a connected HùêªH-free graph class is some constant dmaxsubscriptùëëd_{\\max} dependent only on HùêªH. We give linear-time algorithms for deciding if a connected HùêªH-free graph has diameter dmaxsubscriptùëëd_{\\max}, for several linear forests HùêªH. In contrast, for one such linear forest HùêªH, Diameter cannot be solved in subquadratic time for HùêªH-free graphs under SETH. Moreover, we even show that, for several other linear forests HùêªH, one cannot decide in subquadratic time if a connected HùêªH-free graph has diameter dmaxsubscriptùëëd_{\\max} under SETH.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
