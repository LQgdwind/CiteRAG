Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: BADDr: Bayes-Adaptive Deep Dropout RL for POMDPs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. While reinforcement learning (RL) has made great advances in scalability, exploration and partial observability are still active research topics. In contrast, Bayesian RL (BRL) provides a principled answer to both state estimation and the exploration-exploitation trade-off, but struggles to scale. To tackle this challenge, BRL frameworks with various prior assumptions have been proposed, with varied success. This work presents a representation-agnostic formulation of BRL under partially observability, unifying the previous models under one theoretical umbrella. To demonstrate its practical significance we also propose a novel derivation, Bayes-Adaptive Deep Dropout rl (BADDr), based on dropout networks. Under this parameterization, in contrast to previous work, the belief over the state and dynamics is a more scalable inference problem. We choose actions through Monte-Carlo tree search and empirically show that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art BRL methods on small domains while being able to solve much larger ones.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
