      "content": "Paper Title: First-order Policy Optimization for Robust Markov Decision Process This research was partially supported by NSF DMS-2134037 and AFOSR FA9550-22-1-0447.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We consider the problem of solving robust Markov decision process (MDP), which involves a set of discounted, finite state, finite action space MDPs with uncertain transition kernels. The goal of planning is to find a robust policy that optimizes the worst-case values against the transition uncertainties, and thus encompasses the standard MDP planning as a special case. For (ùê¨,ùêö)ùê¨ùêö(\\mathbf{s},\\mathbf{a})-rectangular uncertainty sets, we establish several structural observations on the robust objective, which facilitates the development of a policy-based first-order method, namely the robust policy mirror descent (RPMD). An ùí™‚Äã(log‚Å°(1/œµ))ùí™1italic-œµ\\mathcal{O}(\\log(1/\\epsilon)) iteration complexity for finding an œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-optimal policy is established with linearly increasing stepsizes. We further develop a stochastic variant of the robust policy mirror descent method, named SRPMD, when the first-order information is only available through online interactions with the nominal environment. We show that the optimality gap converges linearly up to the noise level, and consequently establish an ùí™~‚Äã(1/œµ2)~ùí™1superscriptitalic-œµ2\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\epsilon^{2}) sample complexity by developing a temporal difference learning method for policy evaluation. Both iteration and sample complexities are also discussed for RPMD with a constant stepsize. To the best of our knowledge, all the aforementioned results appear to be new for policy-based first-order methods applied to the robust MDP problem.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
