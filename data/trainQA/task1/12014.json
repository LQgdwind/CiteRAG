      "content": "Paper Title: How Good is ChatGPT at Audiovisual Deepfake Detection: A Comparative Study of ChatGPT, AI Models and Human Perception\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Multimodal deepfakes involving audiovisual manipulations are a growing threat because they are difficult to detect with the naked eye or using unimodal deep learning-based forgery detection methods. Audiovisual forensic models, while more capable than unimodal models, require large training datasets and are computationally expensive for training and inference. Furthermore, these models lack interpretability and often do not generalize well to unseen manipulations. In this study, we examine the detection capabilities of a large language model (LLM) (i.e., ChatGPT) to identify and account for any possible visual and auditory artifacts and manipulations in audiovisual deepfake content. Extensive experiments are conducted on videos from a benchmark multimodal deepfake dataset to evaluate the detection performance of ChatGPT and compare it with the detection capabilities of state-of-the-art multimodal forensic models and humans. Experimental results demonstrate the importance of domain knowledge and prompt engineering for video forgery detection tasks using LLMs. Unlike approaches based on end-to-end learning, ChatGPT can account for spatial and spatiotemporal artifacts and inconsistencies that may exist within or across modalities. Additionally, we discuss the limitations of ChatGPT for multimedia forensic tasks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
