Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Video Compressive Sensing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We apply reinforcement learning to video compressive sensing to adapt the compression ratio. Specifically, video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI), which captures high-speed video using a low-speed camera is considered in this work, in which multiple (BùêµB) video frames can be reconstructed from a snapshot measurement. One research gap in previous studies is how to adapt BùêµB in the video SCI system for different scenes. In this paper, we fill this gap utilizing reinforcement learning (RL). An RL model, as well as various convolutional neural networks for reconstruction, are learned to achieve adaptive sensing of video SCI systems. Furthermore, the performance of an object detection network using directly the video SCI measurements without reconstruction is also used to perform RL-based adaptive video compressive sensing. Our proposed adaptive SCI method can thus be implemented in low cost and real time. Our work takes the technology one step further towards real applications of video SCI.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
