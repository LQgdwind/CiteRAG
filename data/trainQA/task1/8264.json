Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: SPSysML: A meta-model for quantitative evaluation of Simulation-Physical Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Robotic systems are cyber-physical systems (CPS) equipped with multiple sensors and effectors, making them aware of dynamic environments, e.g. surrounding humans. A multi-component structure and potential environmental harm make robotic systems development challenging. The Digital Twin (DT) concept has recently been applied to model and test CPS. However, it is unclear how to employ DT in robotic system development, e.g. in-development testing and how to design systems featuring various simulated and physical parts. Goal: We aim to improve the integration between simulated and physical parts of CPS in various system setups, resulting in controlling the simulated and real hardware with a shared controller. The goal for tightening the integration is to allow parallel and safer system development and faster and safer machine learning using simulation/DTs. We propose integrity evaluation with quantitative factors and requirement-based system structure design, allowing DT to perceive exogenous actions in the simulated world. Method: We propose a Domain-Specific Language based on Systems Modeling Language (SysML) called SPSysML. SPSysML defines the taxonomy of a CPS consisting of at least a physical or simulated part. The simulated parts can be DTs. We propose a development procedure called SPSysDP that manages the considered systems development by evaluating the system designs with the proposed quantitative factors. Result: SPSysDP is used to develop a robotic system for the INCARE project. In subsequent iterations of SPSysDP, the simulation-physical integrity of the system is improved, and a more significant fraction of the system components is shared between various system setups. The designed system was deployed on the physical robot and two simulators. System setups are based either on Robot Operating System (ROS) or ROS2. Therefore, we argue that SPSysDP and SPSysML are neither specific for a control system framework nor a robot simulator. Conclusion: SPSysML with SPSysDP enables the design of SPSys (including DT and CPS), multi-setup system development featuring improved integrity between simulation and physical parts in its setups.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
