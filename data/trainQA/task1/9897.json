Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer.

      "content": "Paper Title: Compositional Learning of Visually-Grounded Concepts Using Reinforcement\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep reinforcement learning agents need to be trained over millions of episodes to decently solve navigation tasks grounded to instructions. Furthermore, their ability to generalize to novel combinations of instructions is unclear. Interestingly however, children can decompose language-based instructions and navigate to the referred object, even if they have not seen the combination of queries prior. Hence, we created three 3D environments to investigate how deep RL agents learn and compose color-shape based combinatorial instructions to solve novel combinations in a spatial navigation task111https://github.com/haidiazaman/RL-concept-learning-project contains the environments and codes. First, we explore if agents can perform compositional learning, and whether they can leverage on frozen text encoders (e.g. CLIP, BERT) to learn word combinations in fewer episodes. Next, we demonstrate that when agents are pretrained on the shape or color concepts separately, they show a 20×\\times decrease in training episodes needed to solve unseen combinations of instructions. Lastly, we show that agents pretrained on concept and compositional learning achieve significantly higher reward when evaluated zero-shot on novel color-shape1-shape2 visual object combinations. Overall, our results highlight the foundations needed to increase an agent’s proficiency in composing word groups through reinforcement learning and its ability for zero-shot generalization to new combinations.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
