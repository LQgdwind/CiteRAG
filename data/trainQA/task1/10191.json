      "content": "Paper Title: BD-MSA: Body decouple VHR Remote Sensing Image Change Detection method guided by multi-scale feature information aggregation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The purpose of remote sensing image change detection (RSCD) is to detect differences between bi-temporal images taken at the same place. Deep learning has been extensively used to RSCD tasks, yielding significant results in terms of result recognition. However, due to the shooting angle of the satellite, the impacts of thin clouds, and certain lighting conditions, the problem of fuzzy edges in the change region in some remote sensing photographs cannot be properly handled using current RSCD algorithms. To solve this issue, we proposed a Body Decouple Multi-Scale by fearure Aggregation change detection (BD-MSA), a novel model that collects both global and local feature map information in the channel and space dimensions of the feature map during the training and prediction phases. This approach allows us to successfully extract the change region’s boundary information while also divorcing the change region’s main body from its boundary. Numerous studies have shown that the assessment metrics and evaluation effects of the model described in this paper on the publicly available datasets DSIFN-CD and S2Looking are the best when compared to other models.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
