Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Meta-DETR: Image-Level Few-Shot Detection with Inter-Class Correlation Exploitation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Few-shot object detection has been extensively investigated by incorporating meta-learning into region-based detection frameworks. Despite its success, the said paradigm is still constrained by several factors, such as (i) low-quality region proposals for novel classes and (ii) negligence of the inter-class correlation among different classes. Such limitations hinder the generalization of base-class knowledge for the detection of novel-class objects. In this work, we design Meta-DETR, which (i) is the first image-level few-shot detector, and (ii) introduces a novel inter-class correlational meta-learning strategy to capture and leverage the correlation among different classes for robust and accurate few-shot object detection. Meta-DETR works entirely at image level without any region proposals, which circumvents the constraint of inaccurate proposals in prevalent few-shot detection frameworks. In addition, the introduced correlational meta-learning enables Meta-DETR to simultaneously attend to multiple support classes within a single feedforward, which allows to capture the inter-class correlation among different classes, thus significantly reducing the misclassification over similar classes and enhancing knowledge generalization to novel classes. Experiments over multiple few-shot object detection benchmarks show that the proposed Meta-DETR outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins. The implementation codes are available at https://github.com/ZhangGongjie/Meta-DETR.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
