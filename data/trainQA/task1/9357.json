      "content": "Paper Title: GA-DRL: Graph Neural Network-Augmented Deep Reinforcement Learning for DAG Task Scheduling over Dynamic Vehicular Clouds\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Vehicular clouds (VCs) are modern platforms for processing of computation-intensive tasks over vehicles. Such tasks are often represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) consisting of interdependent vertices/subtasks and directed edges. In this paper, we propose a graph neural network-augmented deep reinforcement learning scheme (GA-DRL) for scheduling DAG tasks over dynamic VCs. In doing so, we first model the VC-assisted DAG task scheduling as a Markov decision process. We then adopt a multi-head graph attention network (GAT) to extract the features of DAG subtasks. Our developed GAT enables a two-way aggregation of the topological information in a DAG task by simultaneously considering predecessors and successors of each subtask. We further introduce non-uniform DAG neighborhood sampling through codifying the scheduling priority of different subtasks, which makes our developed GAT generalizable to completely unseen DAG task topologies. Finally, we augment GAT into a double deep Q-network learning module to conduct subtask-to-vehicle assignment according to the extracted features of subtasks, while considering the dynamics and heterogeneity of the vehicles in VCs. Through simulating various DAG tasks under real-world movement traces of vehicles, we demonstrate that GA-DRL outperforms existing benchmarks in terms of DAG task completion time.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
