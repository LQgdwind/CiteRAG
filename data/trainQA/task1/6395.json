      "content": "Paper Title: On The Universality of Diagrams for Causal Inference and The Causal Reproducing Property\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Humans have sought to understand causality since ancient times. 2500 years ago, Plato remarked that \"Everything that becomes or changes must do so owing to some cause; for nothing can come to be without a cause\". In more modern times, Judea Pearl developed a seminal theory of causality based on directed acyclic graph (DAG) models, where a variable XùëãX has a causal influence on variable YùëåY if a directed path exists between XùëãX and YùëåY. We propose Universal Causality, a mathematical framework based on category theory, that generalizes both Plato and Pearl‚Äôs conceptions of causality. In our framework, objects are defined by the set of causal influences exerted upon them. More formally, universal causal models are defined as categories consisting of objects and morphisms between them representing causal influences, as well as structures for carrying out interventions (experiments) and evaluating their outcomes (observations). Functors map between categories, and natural transformations map between a pair of functors across the same two categories. Abstract causal diagrams in our framework are built using universal constructions from category theory, including the limit or co-limit of an abstract causal diagram, or more generally, the Kan extension. We present two foundational results in universal causal inference. The first result, called the Universal Causality Theorem (UCT), pertains to the universality of diagrams, which are viewed as functors mapping both objects and relationships from an indexing category of abstract causal diagrams to an actual causal model whose nodes are labeled by random variables, and edges represent functional or probabilistic relationships. UCT states that any causal inference can be represented in a canonical way as the co-limit of an abstract causal diagram of representable objects. UCT follows from a basic result in the theory of sheaves. The second result, the Causal Reproducing Property (CRP), states that any causal influence of a object XùëãX on another object YùëåY is representable as a natural transformation between two abstract causal diagrams. CRP follows from the Yoneda Lemma, one of the deepest results in category theory. The CRP property is analogous to the reproducing property in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces that served as the foundation for kernel methods in machine learning. UC enables the study of causal inference over a much richer class of models by exploiting a powerful set of construction tools from category theory, including adjunctions, braiding, decorated cospans and operads that capture more sophisticated forms of interaction than the popular graph-based paradigm.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 68 most likely reference titles for this paper.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
