Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Dissecting the software-based measurement of CPU energy consumption: a comparative analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Every day, we experience the effects of the global warming: extreme weather events, major forest fires, storms, global warming, etc. The scientific community acknowledges that this crisis is a consequence of human activities where Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) are an increasingly important contributor. Computer scientists need tools for measuring the footprint of the code they produce. Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) is a low-level interface designed by Intel that provides a measure of the energy consumption of a CPU (and more) without the need for additional hardware. Since 2017, it is available on most computing devices, including non-Intel devices such as AMD processors. More and more people are using RAPL for energy measurement, mostly like a black box without deep knowledge of its behaviour. In this paper, we propose to come back to the basic mechanisms that allow to use RAPL measurements and present a critical analysis of their operations. For each mechanism, we release a reference implementation in Rust that avoids the pitfalls we detected in existing tools, improving correctness, timing accuracy and performance. In addition to long-established methods, we explore the suitability of the recent eBPF technology for working with RAPL. We also provide an experimental study with multiple benchmarks and processor models in order to evaluate the efficiency of the various mechanisms and their impact on parallel software. Our experiments show that no mechanism provides a significant performance advantage over the others. However, they differ significantly in terms of ease-of-use and resiliency. We believe that this work will help the community to develop correct, resilient and lightweight measurement tools, based on the mechanism that suits their needs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
