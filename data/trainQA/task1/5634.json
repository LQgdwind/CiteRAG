Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 65 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Behavior Trees in Robot Control Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper we will give a control theoretic perspective on the research area of behavior trees in robotics. The key idea underlying behavior trees is to make use of modularity, hierarchies and feedback, in order to handle the complexity of a versatile robot control system. Modularity is a well-known tool to handle software complexity by enabling development, debugging and extension of separate modules without having detailed knowledge of the entire system. A hierarchy of such modules is natural, since robot tasks can often be decomposed into a hierarchy of sub-tasks. Finally, feedback control is a fundamental tool for handling uncertainties and disturbances in any low level control system, but in order to enable feedback control on the higher level, where one module decides what submodule to execute, information regarding progress and applicability of each submodule needs to be shared in the module interfaces. We will describe how these three concepts come to use in theoretical analysis, practical design, as well as extensions and combinations with other ideas from control theory and robotics.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 65 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 65\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
