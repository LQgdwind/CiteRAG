Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: GEM: Group Enhanced Model for Learning Dynamical Control Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Learning the dynamics of a physical system wherein an autonomous agent operates is an important task. Often these systems present apparent geometric structures. For instance, the trajectories of a robotic manipulator can be broken down into a collection of its transitional and rotational motions, fully characterized by the corresponding Lie groups and Lie algebras. In this work, we take advantage of these structures to build effective dynamical models that are amenable to sample-based learning. We hypothesize that learning the dynamics on a Lie algebra vector space is more effective than learning a direct state transition model. To verify this hypothesis, we introduce the Group Enhanced Model (GEM). GEMs significantly outperform conventional transition models on tasks of long-term prediction, planning, and model-based reinforcement learning across a diverse suite of standard continuous-control environments, including Walker, Hopper, Reacher, Half-Cheetah, Inverted Pendulums, Ant, and Humanoid. Furthermore, plugging GEM into existing state of the art systems enhances their performance, which we demonstrate on the PETS system. This work sheds light on a connection between learning of dynamics and Lie group properties, which opens doors for new research directions and practical applications along this direction.
