      "content": "Paper Title: Fast Sequence Generation with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Autoregressive sequence Generation models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in areas like machine translation and image captioning. These models are autoregressive in that they generate each word by conditioning on previously generated words, which leads to heavy latency during inference. Recently, non-autoregressive decoding has been proposed in machine translation to speed up the inference time by generating all words in parallel. Typically, these models use the word-level cross-entropy loss to optimize each word independently. However, such a learning process fails to consider the sentence-level consistency, thus resulting in inferior generation quality of these non-autoregressive models. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient model for Non-Autoregressive sequence Generation (NAG) with a novel training paradigm: Counterfactuals-critical Multi-Agent Learning (CMAL). CMAL formulates NAG as a multi-agent reinforcement learning system where element positions in the target sequence are viewed as agents that learn to cooperatively maximize a sentence-level reward. On MSCOCO image captioning benchmark, our NAG method achieves a performance comparable to state-of-the-art autoregressive models, while brings 13.9×\\times decoding speedup. On WMT14 EN-DE machine translation dataset, our method outperforms cross-entropy trained baseline by 6.06.06.0 BLEU points while achieves the greatest decoding speedup of 17.46×\\times.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
