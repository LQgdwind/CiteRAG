Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 66 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: The Computational Complexity of Equilibria with Strategic Constraints\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Computational aspects of solution notions such as Nash equilibrium have been extensively studied, including settings where the ultimate goal is to find an equilibrium that possesses some additional properties. Furthermore, in order to address issues of tractability, attention has been given to approximate versions of these problems. Our work extends this direction by considering games with constraints in which players are subject to some form of restrictions on their strategic choices. We also consider the relationship between Nash equilibria and so-called constrained or social equilibria in this context, with particular attention to how they are related with respect to totality and complexity. Our results demonstrate that the computational complexity of finding an equilibrium varies significantly between games with slightly different strategic constraints. In addition to examining the computational aspects of such strategic constraints, we also demonstrate that these constraints are useful for modeling problems involving strategic resource allocation and also are of interest from the perspective of behavioral game theory.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 66 most likely reference titles for this paper.
