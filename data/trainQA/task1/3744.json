Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Distributed Construction of Lightweight Spanners for Unit Ball Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Resolving an open question from 2006 [15], we prove the existence of light-weight bounded-degree spanners for unit ball graphs in the metrics of bounded doubling dimension, and we design a simple ùí™‚Äã(log‚àó‚Å°n)ùí™superscriptùëõ\\mathcal{O}(\\log^{*}n)-round distributed algorithm in the LOCAL model of computation, that given a unit ball graph Gùê∫G with nùëõn vertices and a positive constant œµ<1italic-œµ1\\epsilon<1 finds a (1+œµ)1italic-œµ(1+\\epsilon)-spanner with constant bounds on its maximum degree and its lightness using only 2-hop neighborhood information. This immediately improves the best prior lightness bound, the algorithm of Damian, Pandit, and Pemmaraju [14], which runs in ùí™‚Äã(log‚àó‚Å°n)ùí™superscriptùëõ\\mathcal{O}(\\log^{*}n) rounds in the LOCAL model, but has a ùí™‚Äã(log‚Å°Œî)ùí™Œî\\mathcal{O}(\\log\\Delta) bound on its lightness, where ŒîŒî\\Delta is the ratio of the length of the longest edge to the length of the shortest edge in the unit ball graph. Next, we adjust our algorithm to work in the CONGEST model, without changing its round complexity, hence proposing the first spanner construction for unit ball graphs in the CONGEST model of computation. We further study the problem in the two dimensional Euclidean plane and we provide a construction with similar properties that has a constant average number of edge intersections per node. Lastly, we provide experimental results that confirm our theoretical bounds, and show an efficient performance from our distributed algorithm compared to the best known centralized construction.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
