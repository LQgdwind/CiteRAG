Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: John praised Mary because he? Implicit Causality Bias and Its Interaction with Explicit Cues in LMs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Some interpersonal verbs can implicitly attribute causality to either their subject or their object and are therefore said to carry an implicit causality (IC) bias. Through this bias, causal links can be inferred from a narrative, aiding language comprehension. We investigate whether pre-trained language models (PLMs) encode IC bias and use it at inference time. We find that to be the case, albeit to different degrees, for three distinct PLM architectures. However, causes do not always need to be implicit—when a cause is explicitly stated in a subordinate clause, an incongruent IC bias associated with the verb in the main clause leads to a delay in human processing. We hypothesize that the temporary challenge humans face in integrating the two contradicting signals, one from the lexical semantics of the verb, one from the sentence-level semantics, would be reflected in higher error rates for models on tasks dependent on causal links. The results of our study lend support to this hypothesis, suggesting that PLMs tend to prioritize lexical patterns over higher-order signals.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
