Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 59 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Nonobtuse triangulations of PSLGs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. We show that any planar straight line graph with nùëõn vertices has a conforming triangulation by O‚Äã(n2.5)ùëÇsuperscriptùëõ2.5O(n^{2.5}) nonobtuse triangles (all angles ‚â§90‚àòabsentsuperscript90\\leq 90^{\\circ}), answering the question of whether any polynomial bound exists. A nonobtuse triangulation is Delaunay, so this result also improves a previous O‚Äã(n3)ùëÇsuperscriptùëõ3O(n^{3}) bound of Eldesbrunner and Tan for conforming Delaunay triangulations of PSLGs. In the special case that the PSLG is the triangulation of a simple polygon, we will show that only O‚Äã(n2)ùëÇsuperscriptùëõ2O(n^{2}) triangles are needed, improving an O‚Äã(n4)ùëÇsuperscriptùëõ4O(n^{4}) bound of Bern and Eppstein. We also show that for any œµ>0italic-œµ0\\epsilon>0, every PSLG has a conforming triangulation with O‚Äã(n2/œµ2)ùëÇsuperscriptùëõ2superscriptitalic-œµ2O(n^{2}/\\epsilon^{2}) elements and with all angles bounded above by 90‚àò+œµsuperscript90italic-œµ90^{\\circ}+\\epsilon. This improves a result of S. Mitchell when œµ=38‚ÄãœÄ=67.5‚àòitalic-œµ38ùúãsuperscript67.5\\epsilon=\\frac{3}{8}\\pi=67.5^{\\circ} and Tan when œµ=730‚ÄãœÄ=42‚àòitalic-œµ730ùúãsuperscript42\\epsilon=\\frac{7}{30}\\pi=42^{\\circ}.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper.
