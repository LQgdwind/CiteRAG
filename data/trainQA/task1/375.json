Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: The Power of a Single Qubit: Two-way Quantum Finite Automata and the Word Problem\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The two-way finite automaton with quantum and classical states (2QCFA), defined by Ambainis and Watrous, is a model of quantum computation whose quantum part is extremely limited; however, as they showed, 2QCFA are surprisingly powerful: a 2QCFA, with a single qubit, can recognize, with bounded error, the language Le‚Äãq={am‚Äãbm:m‚àà‚Ñï}subscriptùêøùëíùëûconditional-setsuperscriptùëéùëösuperscriptùëèùëöùëö‚ÑïL_{eq}=\\{a^{m}b^{m}:m\\in\\mathbb{N}\\} in expected polynomial time and the language Lp‚Äãa‚Äãl={w‚àà{a,b}‚àó:w‚Äã is a palindrome}subscriptùêøùëùùëéùëôconditional-setùë§superscriptùëéùëèùë§ is a palindromeL_{pal}=\\{w\\in\\{a,b\\}^{*}:w\\text{ is a palindrome}\\} in expected exponential time. We further demonstrate the power of 2QCFA by showing that they can recognize the word problems of many groups. In particular 2QCFA, with a single qubit and algebraic number transition amplitudes, can recognize, with bounded error, the word problem of any finitely generated virtually abelian group in expected polynomial time, as well as the word problems of a large class of linear groups in expected exponential time. This latter class (properly) includes all groups with context-free word problem. We also exhibit results for 2QCFA with any constant number of qubits. As a corollary, we obtain a direct improvement on the original Ambainis and Watrous result by showing that Le‚ÄãqsubscriptùêøùëíùëûL_{eq} can be recognized by a 2QCFA with better parameters. As a further corollary, we show that 2QCFA can recognize certain non-context-free languages in expected polynomial time. In a companion paper, we prove matching lower bounds, thereby showing that the class of languages recognizable with bounded error by a 2QCFA in expected subexponential time is properly contained in the class of languages recognizable with bounded error by a 2QCFA in expected exponential time.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
