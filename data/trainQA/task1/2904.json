Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Counterfactual Explanation with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Drug Target Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Motivation: Many high-performance DTA models have been proposed, but they are mostly black-box and thus lack human interpretability. Explainable AI (XAI) can make DTA models more trustworthy, and can also enable scientists to distill biological knowledge from the models. Counterfactual explanation is one popular approach to explaining the behaviour of a deep neural network, which works by systematically answering the question ‘‘How would the model output change if the inputs were changed in this way?’’. Most counterfactual explanation methods only operate on single input data. It remains an open problem how to extend counterfactual-based XAI methods to DTA models, which have two inputs, one for drug and one for target, that also happen to be discrete in nature. Methods We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, Multi-Agent Counterfactual Drug-target binding Affinity (MACDA), to generate counterfactual explanations for the drug-protein complex. Our proposed framework provides human-interpretable counterfactual instances while optimizing both the input drug and target for counterfactual generation at the same time. Results: We benchmark the proposed MACDA framework using the Davis dataset and find that our framework produces more parsimonious explanations with no loss in explanation validity, as measured by encoding similarity and QED. We then present a case study involving ABL1 and Nilotinib to demonstrate how MACDA can explain the behaviour of a DTA model in the underlying substructure interaction between inputs in its prediction, revealing mechanisms that align with prior domain knowledge. Availability: The Python implementation is available at https://github.com/ngminhtri0394/MACDA Contact: \\hrefhttp://minhtri@deakin.edu.auminhtri@deakin.edu.au\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
