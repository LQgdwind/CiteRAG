      "content": "Paper Title: Fine-grained complexity of the list homomorphism problem: feedback vertex set and cutwidthThis work is supported by Polish National Science Centre grant no. 2018/31/D/ST6/00062.\n\nPaper Abstract: For graphs G,H𝐺𝐻G,H, a homomorphism from G𝐺G to H𝐻H is an edge-preserving mapping from V​(G)𝑉𝐺V(G) to V​(H)𝑉𝐻V(H). In the list homomorphism problem, denoted by LHom(H𝐻H), we are given a graph G𝐺G, whose every vertex v𝑣v is equipped with a list L​(v)⊆V​(H)𝐿𝑣𝑉𝐻L(v)\\subseteq V(H), and we need to determine whether there exists a homomorphism from G𝐺G to H𝐻H which additionally respects the lists L𝐿L. List homomorphisms are a natural generalization of (list) colorings. Very recently Okrasa, Piecyk, and Rzążewski [ESA 2020] studied the fine-grained complexity of the problem, parameterized by the treewidth of the instance graph G𝐺G. They defined a new invariant i∗​(H)superscript𝑖𝐻i^{*}(H), and proved that for every relevant graph H𝐻H, this invariant is the correct base of the exponent in the running time of any algorithm solving the LHom(H𝐻H) problem. In this paper we continue this direction and study the complexity of the problem under different parameterizations. As the first result, we show that i∗​(H)superscript𝑖𝐻i^{*}(H) is also the right complexity base if the parameter is the size of a minimum feedback vertex set of G𝐺G, denoted by fvs​(G)fvs𝐺\\textrm{fvs}(G). In particular, for every relevant graph H𝐻H, the LHom(H𝐻H) problem • can be solved in time i∗​(H)fvs​(G)⋅|V​(G)|𝒪​(1)⋅superscript𝑖superscript𝐻fvs𝐺superscript𝑉𝐺𝒪1i^{*}(H)^{\\textrm{fvs}(G)}\\cdot|V(G)|^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}, if a minimum feedback vertex set of G𝐺G is given, • cannot be solved in time (i∗​(H)−ε)fvs​(G)⋅|V​(G)|𝒪​(1)⋅superscriptsuperscript𝑖𝐻𝜀fvs𝐺superscript𝑉𝐺𝒪1(i^{*}(H)-\\varepsilon)^{\\textrm{fvs}(G)}\\cdot|V(G)|^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}, for any ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, unless the SETH fails. Then we turn our attention to a parameterization by the cutwidth ctw​(G)ctw𝐺\\textrm{ctw}(G) of G𝐺G. Jansen and Nederlof [ESA 2018] showed that List k𝑘k-Coloring (i.e., LHom(Kksubscript𝐾𝑘K_{k})) can be solved in time 𝒪∗​(cctw​(G))superscript𝒪superscript𝑐ctw𝐺\\mathcal{O}^{*}\\left(c^{\\textrm{ctw}(G)}\\right) for an absolute constant c𝑐c, i.e., the base of the exponential function does not depend on the number of colors. Jansen asked whether this behavior extends to graph homomorphisms. As the main result of the paper, we answer the question in the negative. We define a new graph invariant m​i​m∗​(H)𝑚𝑖superscript𝑚𝐻mim^{*}(H), closely related to the size of a maximum induced matching in H𝐻H, and prove that for all relevant graphs H𝐻H, the LHom(H𝐻H) problem cannot be solved in time 𝒪∗​((m​i​m∗​(H)−ε)ctw​(G))superscript𝒪superscript𝑚𝑖superscript𝑚𝐻𝜀ctw𝐺\\mathcal{O}^{*}\\left((mim^{*}(H)-\\varepsilon)^{\\textrm{ctw}(G)}\\right) for any ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, unless the SETH fails. In particular, this implies that there is no constant c𝑐c, such that for every odd cycle the non-list version of the problem can be solved in time 𝒪∗​(cctw​(G))superscript𝒪superscript𝑐ctw𝐺\\mathcal{O}^{*}\\left(c^{\\textrm{ctw}(G)}\\right). Finally, we generalize the algorithm of Jansen and Nederlof, so that it can be used to solve LHom(H𝐻H) for every graph H𝐻H; its complexity depends on ctw​(G)ctw𝐺\\textrm{ctw}(G) and another invariant of H𝐻H, which is constant for cliques.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
