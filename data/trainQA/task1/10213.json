Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Correlated Quantization for Faster Nonconvex Distributed Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Quantization (Alistarh et al., 2017) is an important (stochastic) compression technique that reduces the volume of transmitted bits during each communication round in distributed model training. Suresh et al. (2022) introduce correlated quantizers and show their advantages over independent counterparts by analyzing distributed 𝖲𝖦𝖣𝖲𝖦𝖣\\mathsf{SGD} communication complexity. We analyze the forefront distributed non-convex optimization algorithm 𝖬𝖠𝖱𝖨𝖭𝖠𝖬𝖠𝖱𝖨𝖭𝖠\\mathsf{MARINA} (Gorbunov et al., 2022) utilizing the proposed correlated quantizers and show that it outperforms the original 𝖬𝖠𝖱𝖨𝖭𝖠𝖬𝖠𝖱𝖨𝖭𝖠\\mathsf{MARINA} and distributed 𝖲𝖦𝖣𝖲𝖦𝖣\\mathsf{SGD} of Suresh et al. (2022) with regard to the communication complexity. We significantly refine the original analysis of 𝖬𝖠𝖱𝖨𝖭𝖠𝖬𝖠𝖱𝖨𝖭𝖠\\mathsf{MARINA} without any additional assumptions using the weighted Hessian variance (Tyurin et al., 2022), and then we expand the theoretical framework of 𝖬𝖠𝖱𝖨𝖭𝖠𝖬𝖠𝖱𝖨𝖭𝖠\\mathsf{MARINA} to accommodate a substantially broader range of potentially correlated and biased compressors, thus dilating the applicability of the method beyond the conventional independent unbiased compressor setup. Extensive experimental results corroborate our theoretical findings.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
