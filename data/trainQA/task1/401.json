Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Predicting the Popularity of Micro-videos with Multimodal Variational Encoder-Decoder Framework\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract As an emerging type of user-generated content, micro-video drastically enriches people’s entertainment experiences and social interactions. However, the popularity pattern of an individual micro-video still remains elusive among the researchers. One of the major challenges is that the potential popularity of a micro-video tends to fluctuate under the impact of various external factors, which makes it full of uncertainties. In addition, since micro-videos are mainly uploaded by individuals that lack professional techniques, multiple types of noise could exist that obscure useful information. In this paper, we propose a multimodal variational encoder-decoder (MMVED) framework for micro-video popularity prediction tasks. MMVED learns a stochastic Gaussian embedding of a micro-video that is informative to its popularity level while preserves the inherent uncertainties simultaneously. Moreover, through the optimization of a deep variational information bottleneck lower-bound (IBLBO), the learned hidden representation is shown to be maximally expressive about the popularity target while maximally compressive to the noise in micro-video features. Furthermore, the Bayesian product-of-experts principle is applied to the multimodal encoder, where the decision for information keeping or discarding is made comprehensively with all available modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on a public dataset and a dataset we collect from Xigua demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MMVED framework.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
