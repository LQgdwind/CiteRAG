Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Reconstruction and Segmentation from sparse sequential X-Ray Measurements of Wood Logs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. In industrial applications, it is common to scan objects on a moving conveyor belt. If slice-wise 2D computed tomography (CT) measurements of the moving object are obtained we call it a sequential scanning geometry. In this case, each slice on its own does not carry sufficient information to reconstruct a useful tomographic image. Thus, here we propose the use of a Dimension reduced Kalman Filter to accumulate information between slices and allow for sufficiently accurate reconstructions for further assessment of the object. Additionally, we propose to use an unsupervised clustering approach known as Density Peak Advanced, to perform a segmentation and spot density anomalies in the internal structure of the reconstructed objects. We evaluate the method in a proof of concept study for the application of wood log scanning for the industrial sawing process, where the goal is to spot anomalies within the wood log to allow for optimal sawing patterns. Reconstruction and segmentation quality are evaluated from experimental measurement data for various scenarios of severely undersampled X-measurements. Results show clearly that an improvement in reconstruction quality can be obtained by employing the Dimension reduced Kalman Filter allowing to robustly obtain the segmented logs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
