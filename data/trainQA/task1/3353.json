Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: 27.5 - 29.5 GHz Switched Array Sounder for Dynamic Channel Characterization: Design, Implementation and Measurements\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A pre-requisite for the design of wireless systems is the understanding of the propagation channel. While a wealth of propagation knowledge exists for bands below 6 GHz, the same can not be said for bands approaching millimeter-wave frequencies. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and measurement-based verification of a re-configurable 27.5-29.5 GHz channel sounder for measuring dynamic directional channels. Based on the switched array principle, our design is capable of characterizing 128×\\times256 dual-polarized channels with snapshot times of around 600 ms. This is in sharp contrast to measurement times on the order of tens-of-minutes with rotating horn antenna sounders. Our design lends itself to high angular resolution at both link ends with calibrated antenna arrays sampled at 2∘ and 5∘ intervals in the azimuth and elevation domains. This is complemented with a bandwidth of up to 2 GHz, enabling nanosecond-level delay resolution. The short measurement times and stable radio frequency design facilitates real-time processing and averaging of the received wavefronts to gain measurement signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range. After disclosing the sounder design and implementation, we demonstrate its capabilities by presenting dynamic and static measurements at 28 GHz over a 1 GHz bandwidth in an office corridor environment.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
