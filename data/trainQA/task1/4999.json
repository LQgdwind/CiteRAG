Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: 3D-TSV: The 3D Trajectory-based Stress Visualizer\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present the 3D Trajectory-based Stress Visualizer (3D-TSV), a visual analysis tool for the exploration of the principal stress directions in 3D solids under load. 3D-TSV provides a modular and generic implementation of key algorithms required for a trajectory-based visual analysis of principal stress directions, including the automatic seeding of space-filling stress lines, their extraction using numerical schemes, their mapping to an effective renderable representation, and rendering options to convey structures with special mechanical properties. In the design of 3D-TSV, several perceptual challenges have been addressed when simultaneously visualizing three mutually orthogonal stress directions via lines. We present a novel algorithm for generating a space-filling and evenly spaced set of mutually orthogonal lines. The algorithm further considers the locations of lines to obtain a more regular appearance, and enables the extraction of a level-of-detail representation with adjustable sparseness of the trajectories along a certain stress direction. To convey ambiguities in the orientation of the principal stress directions, the user can select a combined visualization of two principal directions via oriented ribbons. Additional depth cues improve the perception of the spatial relationships between trajectories. 3D-TSV is accessible to end users via a C++- and OpenGL-based rendering frontend that is seamlessly connected to a MatLab-based extraction backend. The code (BSD license) of 3D-TSV as well as scripts to make ANSYS and ABAQUS simulation results accessible to the 3D-TSV backend are publicly available.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
