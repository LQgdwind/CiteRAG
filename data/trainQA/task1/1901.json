Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 62 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Degree vs. Approximate Degree and Quantum Implications of Huang‚Äôs Sensitivity Theorem1footnote 11footnote 1This subsumes an earlier preprint by a subset of the authors [ABKT20].\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Based on the recent breakthrough of Huang (2019), we show that for any total Boolean function fùëìf, 1. ùñΩùñæùóÄ(f)=O(ùñΩùñæùóÄ~(f)2)\\operatorname{\\mathsf{deg}}(f)=O(\\operatorname{\\mathsf{\\widetilde{deg}}}(f)^{2}): The degree of fùëìf is at most quadratic in the approximate degree of fùëìf. This is optimal as witnessed by the OR function. 2. ùñ£(f)=O(ùñ∞(f)4)\\operatorname{\\mathsf{D}}(f)=O(\\operatorname{\\mathsf{Q}}(f)^{4}): The deterministic query complexity of fùëìf is at most quartic in the quantum query complexity of fùëìf. This matches the known separation (up to log factors) due to Ambainis, Balodis, Belovs, Lee, Santha, and Smotrovs (2017). We apply these results to resolve the quantum analogue of the Aanderaa‚ÄìKarp‚ÄìRosenberg conjecture. We show that if fùëìf is a nontrivial monotone graph property of an nùëõn-vertex graph specified by its adjacency matrix, then ùñ∞‚Å°(f)=Œ©‚Äã(n)ùñ∞ùëìŒ©ùëõ\\operatorname{\\mathsf{Q}}(f)=\\Omega(n), which is also optimal. We also show that the approximate degree of any read-once formula on nùëõn variables is Œò‚Äã(n)Œòùëõ\\Theta(\\sqrt{n}).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 62 most likely reference titles for this paper.
