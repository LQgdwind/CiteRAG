Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Distributing Quantum Computations, Shot-wise\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era constraints, high sensitivity to noise and limited qubit count, impose significant barriers on the usability of QPUs (Quantum Process Units) capabilities. To overcome these challenges, researchers are exploring methods to maximize the utility of existing QPUs despite their limitations. Building upon the idea that the execution of a quantum circuit’s shots needs not to be treated as a singular monolithic unit, we propose a methodological framework, termed shot-wise, which enables the distribution of shots for a single circuit across multiple QPUs. Our framework features customizable policies to adapt to various scenarios. Additionally, it introduces a calibration method to pre-evaluate the accuracy and reliability of each QPU’s output before the actual distribution process and an incremental execution mechanism for dynamically managing the shot allocation and policy updates. Such an approach enables flexible and fine-grained management of the distribution process, taking into account various user-defined constraints and (contrasting) objectives. Experimental findings show that while these strategies generally do not exceed the best individual QPU results, they maintain robustness and align closely with average outcomes. Overall, the shot-wise methodology improves result stability and often outperforms single QPU runs, offering a flexible approach to managing variability in quantum computing.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 54\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
