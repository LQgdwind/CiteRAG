Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Compliant Constant Output/ Input Force Mechanisms — Topology Optimization with Contact\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We synthesize monolithic topologies of constant output (CoFM) and input (CiFM) force mechanisms. During synthesis, we capture all possible aspects of member deformation including finite displacements, buckling, interaction between members, their interaction with external surfaces, and importantly, interaction of the mechanism with flexible workpieces to capture force transfer in true sense. Features of constant force characteristics, e.g., magnitude(s) of the desired force(s), range of input displacement over which slope of the force-displacement curve is near zero, and distance between workpiece and the mechanism are controlled individually via novel objectives proposed herein. Two of the constant output and constant input force mechanisms each, are synthesized using stochastic optimization ensuring ready manufacturability. We observe that presence of external surfaces may not be required for singlepiece mechanisms to attain constant force characteristics. However, interesting solutions are possible if mutual contact is permitted. We also note that desired force characteristics may not remain the same with alteration in the workpieces’ shape and/or material properties. We finally fabricate and test the synthesized mechanisms and find that the desired constant force characteristics are by-and-large retained.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
