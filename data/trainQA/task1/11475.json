      "content": "Paper Title: Circuits and Backdoors: Five Shades of the SETH\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The SETH is a hypothesis of fundamental importance to (fine-grained) parameterized complexity theory and many important tight lower bounds are based on it. This situation is somewhat problematic, because the validity of the SETH is not universally believed and because in some senses the SETH seems to be ‚Äútoo strong‚Äù a hypothesis for the considered lower bounds. Motivated by this, we consider a number of reasonable weakenings of the SETH that render it more plausible, with sources ranging from circuit complexity, to backdoors for SAT-solving, to graph width parameters, to weighted satisfiability problems. Despite the diversity of the different formulations, we are able to uncover several non-obvious connections using tools from classical complexity theory. This leads us to a hierarchy of five main equivalence classes of hypotheses, with some of the highlights being the following: 1. We show that beating brute force search for SAT parameterized by a modulator to a graph of bounded pathwidth, or bounded treewidth, or logarithmic tree-depth, is actually the same question, despite the structural differences between these parameters. In fact, we show that beating brute force for any of these parameters is possible if and only if one can beat brute force for circuits of depth Œµ‚ÄãnùúÄùëõ\\varepsilon n (a weaker version of the so-called NC-SETH). We also show that all these questions are equivalent to the existence of an n(1‚àíŒµ)‚Äãksuperscriptùëõ1ùúÄùëòn^{(1-\\varepsilon)k} algorithm for the weighted satisfiability problem associated with W[SAT]. A main tool we use here is Barrington‚Äôs theorem. 2. On the other hand, modulators to logarithmic pathwidth seem to belong to a different class. We show that beating brute force for this parameter is equivalent to beating brute force for SAT when given a strong 2-SAT backdoor. To prove this we rely on ideas from the classical Immerman‚ÄìSzelepcs√©nyi theorem. 3. Identifying an even harder class of problems, we show that beating brute force for SAT given a strong Horn backdoor is equivalent to the SETH for general circuits (without depth restrictions) and to beating brute force for the weighted satisfiability problem of the class W[P]. 4. Going in the other direction, we revisit recent work of Esmer, Focke, Marx, and Rzazewski (ICALP ‚Äô24), and uncover some nuances in their lower bounds. In particular, we show that beating brute force for SAT parameterized by a modulator to constant tree-depth is equivalent to falsifying the standard form of the SETH. This allows us to show that their lower bound for qùëûq-Coloring (for parameter (œÉ,Œ¥)ùúéùõø(\\sigma,\\delta)-hub) is actually not just an implication, but a reformulation of the SETH. On the other hand, we show that their lower bound for Max-Cut for the same parameter is equivalent to the maximization version of the SETH, which at the moment appears to be a weaker hypothesis. For each of these classes we give at least one (non-SAT) problem which is equivalent to the class as a characteristic example application. Our work is a step towards a more nuanced meta-complexity theory where we advance from proving one-way implications of the SETH, to establishing a classification of interesting questions into equivalence classes. A somewhat unusual aspect is that our classification cuts across traditional time complexity classes, as we are often able to establish equivalences between lower bounds for FPT problems (of the form (c‚àíŒµ)k‚ÄãnO‚Äã(1)superscriptùëêùúÄùëòsuperscriptùëõùëÇ1(c-\\varepsilon)^{k}n^{O(1)}) and non-FPT problems (of the form n(1‚àíŒµ)‚Äãksuperscriptùëõ1ùúÄùëòn^{(1-\\varepsilon)k}).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
