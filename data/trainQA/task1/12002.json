Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Intelligent Green Efficiency for Intrusion Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged in popularity recently, recording great progress in various industries. However, the environmental impact of AI is a growing concern, in terms of the energy consumption and carbon footprint of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models, making essential investigate Green AI, an attempt to reduce the climate impact of AI systems. This paper presents an assessment of different programming languages and Feature Selection (FS) methods to improve computation performance of AI focusing on Network Intrusion Detection (NID) and cyber-attack classification tasks. Experiments were conducted using five ML models - Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Long Short-Term Memory - implemented in four programming languages - Python, Java, R, and Rust - along with three FS methods - Information Gain, Recursive Feature Elimination, and Chi-Square. The obtained results demonstrated that FS plays an important role enhancing the computational efficiency of AI models without compromising detection accuracy, highlighting languages like Python and R, that benefit from a rich AI libraries environment. These conclusions can be useful to design efficient and sustainable AI systems that still provide a good generalization and a reliable detection.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
