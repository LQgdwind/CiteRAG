      "content": "Paper Title: Donâ€™t Watch Me: A Spatio-Temporal Trojan Attack on Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Augment Autonomous Driving\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is one of the most popular algorithms to realize an autonomous driving (AD) system. The key success factor of DRL is that it embraces the perception capability of deep neural networks which, however, have been proved vulnerable to Trojan attacks. Trojan attacks have been widely explored in supervised learning (SL) tasks (e.g., image classification), but rarely in sequential decision-making tasks solved by DRL. Hence, in this paper, we explore Trojan attacks on DRL for AD tasks. First, we propose a spatio-temporal DRL algorithm based on the recurrent neural network and attention mechanism to prove that capturing spatio-temporal traffic features is the key factor to the effectiveness and safety of a DRL-augment AD system. We then design a spatial-temporal Trojan attack on DRL policies, where the trigger is hidden in a sequence of spatial and temporal traffic features, rather than a single instant state used in existing Trojan on SL and DRL tasks. With our Trojan, the adversary acts as a surrounding normal vehicle and can trigger attacks via specific spatial-temporal driving behaviors, rather than physical or wireless access. Through extensive experiments, we show that while capturing spatio-temporal traffic features can improve the performance of DRL for different AD tasks, they suffer from Trojan attacks since our designed Trojan shows high stealthy (various spatio-temporal trigger patterns), effective (less than 3.1% performance variance rate and more than 98.5% attack success rate), and sustainable to existing advanced defenses.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
