Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Object-fabrication Targeted Attack for Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recent researches show that the deep learning based object detection is vulnerable to adversarial examples. Generally, the adversarial attack for object detection contains targeted attack and untargeted attack. According to our detailed investigations, the research on the former is relatively fewer than the latter and all the existing methods for the targeted attack follow the same mode, i.e., the object-mislabeling mode that misleads detectors to mislabel the detected object as a specific wrong label. However, this mode has limited attack success rate, universal and generalization performances. In this paper, we propose a new object-fabrication targeted attack mode which can mislead detectors to ‘fabricate’ extra false objects with specific target labels. Furthermore, we design a dual attention based targeted feature space attack method to implement the proposed targeted attack mode. The attack performances of the proposed mode and method are evaluated on MS COCO and BDD100K datasets using FasterRCNN and YOLOv5. Evaluation results demonstrate that, the proposed object-fabrication targeted attack mode and the corresponding targeted feature space attack method show significant improvements in terms of image-specific attack, universal performance and generalization capability, compared with the previous targeted attack for object detection. Code will be made available.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
