Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Comparable Knowledge Distillation in Semantic Image Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Knowledge Distillation (KD) is one proposed solution to large model sizes and slow inference speed in semantic segmentation. In our research we identify 25 proposed distillation loss terms from 14 publications in the last 4 years. Unfortunately, a comparison of terms based on published results is often impossible, because of differences in training configurations. A good illustration of this problem is the comparison of two publications from 2022. Using the same models and dataset, Structural and Statistical Texture Distillation (SSTKD) [14] reports an increase of student mIoU of 4.54 and a final performance of 29.19, while Adaptive Perspective Distillation (APD) [30] only improves student performance by 2.06 percentage points, but achieves a final performance of 39.25. The reason for such extreme differences is often a suboptimal choice of hyperparameters and a resulting underperformance of the student model used as reference point. In our work, we reveal problems of insufficient hyperparameter tuning by showing that distillation improvements of two widely accepted frameworks, SKD and IFVD, vanish when hyperparameters are optimized sufficiently. To improve comparability of future research in the field, we establish a solid baseline for three datasets and two student models and provide extensive information on hyperparameter tuning. We find that only two out of eight techniques can compete with our simple baseline on the ADE20K dataset.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
