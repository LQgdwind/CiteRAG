Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: From Explicit Communication to Tacit Cooperation: A Novel Paradigm for Cooperative MARL\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) is a widely-used learning paradigm that has achieved significant success in complex tasks. However, partial observability issues and the absence of effectively shared signals between agents often limit its effectiveness in fostering cooperation. While communication can address this challenge, it simultaneously reduces the algorithm’s practicality. Drawing inspiration from human team cooperative learning, we propose a novel paradigm that facilitates a gradual shift from explicit communication to tacit cooperation. In the initial training stage, we promote cooperation by sharing relevant information among agents and concurrently reconstructing this information using each agent’s local trajectory. We then combine the explicitly communicated information with the reconstructed information to obtain mixed information. Throughout the training process, we progressively reduce the proportion of explicitly communicated information, facilitating a seamless transition to fully decentralized execution without communication. Experimental results in various scenarios demonstrate that the performance of our method without communication can approaches or even surpasses that of QMIX and communication-based methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
