      "content": "Paper Title: Hardness and Approximation of Submodular Minimum Linear Ordering Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The minimum linear ordering problem (MLOP) generalizes well-known combinatorial optimization problems such as minimum linear arrangement and minimum sum set cover. MLOP seeks to minimize an aggregated cost f​(⋅)𝑓⋅f(\\cdot) due to an ordering σ𝜎\\sigma of the items (say [n]delimited-[]𝑛[n]), i.e., minσ​∑i∈[n]f​(Ei,σ)subscript𝜎subscript𝑖delimited-[]𝑛𝑓subscript𝐸𝑖𝜎\\min_{\\sigma}\\sum_{i\\in[n]}f(E_{i,\\sigma}), where Ei,σsubscript𝐸𝑖𝜎E_{i,\\sigma} is the set of items mapped by σ𝜎\\sigma to indices [i]delimited-[]𝑖[i]. Despite an extensive literature on MLOP variants and approximations for these, it was unclear whether the graphic matroid MLOP was NP-hard. We settle this question through non-trivial reductions from mininimum latency vertex cover and minimum sum vertex cover problems. We further propose a new combinatorial algorithm for approximating monotone submodular MLOP, using the theory of principal partitions. This is in contrast to the rounding algorithm by Iwata, Tetali, and Tripathi [ITT2012], using Lovász extension of submodular functions. We show a (2−1+ℓf1+|E|)21subscriptℓ𝑓1𝐸(2-\\frac{1+\\ell_{f}}{1+|E|})-approximation for monotone submodular MLOP where ℓf=f​(E)maxx∈E⁡f​({x})subscriptℓ𝑓𝑓𝐸subscript𝑥𝐸𝑓𝑥\\ell_{f}=\\frac{f(E)}{\\max_{x\\in E}f(\\{x\\})} satisfies 1≤ℓf≤|E|1subscriptℓ𝑓𝐸1\\leq\\ell_{f}\\leq|E|. Our theory provides new approximation bounds for special cases of the problem, in particular a (2−1+r​(E)1+|E|)21𝑟𝐸1𝐸(2-\\frac{1+r(E)}{1+|E|})-approximation for the matroid MLOP, where f=r𝑓𝑟f=r is the rank function of a matroid. We further show that minimum latency vertex cover (MLVC) is 4343\\frac{4}{3}-approximable, by which we also lower bound the integrality gap of its natural LP relaxation, which might be of independent interest.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
