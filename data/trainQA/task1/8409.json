Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: An Embedding-based Approach to Inconsistency-tolerant Reasoning with Inconsistent Ontologies\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Inconsistency handling is an important issue in knowledge management. Especially in ontology engineering, logical inconsistencies may occur during ontology construction. A natural way to reason with an inconsistent ontology is to utilize the maximal consistent subsets of the ontology. However, previous studies on selecting maximal consistent subsets have rarely considered the semantics of the axioms, which may result in irrational inference. In this paper, we present a novel approach to reasoning with inconsistent ontologies in description logics based on the embeddings of axioms. We first propose a sentence-embedding-based method and a knowledge-graph-embedding-based method for translating axioms into semantic vectors to calculate semantic similarities among axioms. We then define an embedding-based approach for selecting the maximal consistent subsets of the inconsistent ontology and use it to define an inconsistency-tolerant inference relation. We show the rationality of our inference relation by considering some logical properties. Finally, we conduct experiments on several ontologies to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. The experimental results show that our embedding-based method can outperform existing inconsistency-tolerant reasoning methods based on maximal consistent subsets.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 43 most likely reference titles for this paper.
