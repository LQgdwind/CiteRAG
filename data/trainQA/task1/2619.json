Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: VARA-TTS: Non-Autoregressive Text-to-Speech Synthesis based on Very Deep VAE with Residual Attention\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper proposes VARA-TTS111Codes will be released soon., a non-autoregressive (non-AR) end-to-end text-to-speech (TTS) model using a very deep Variational Autoencoder (VDVAE) with Residual Attention mechanism, which refines the textual-to-acoustic alignment layer-wisely. Hierarchical latent variables with different temporal resolutions from the VDVAE are used as queries for the residual attention module. By leveraging the coarse global alignment from previous attention layer as an extra input, the following attention layer can produce a refined version of alignment. This amortizes the burden of learning the textual-to-acoustic alignment among multiple attention layers and outperforms the use of only a single attention layer in robustness. An utterance-level speaking speed factor is computed by a jointly-trained speaking speed predictor, which takes the mean-pooled latent variables of the coarsest layer as input, to determine number of acoustic frames at inference. Experimental results show that VARA-TTS achieves slightly inferior speech quality to an AR counterpart Tacotron 2 but an order-of-magnitude speed-up at inference; and outperforms an analogous non-AR model, BVAE-TTS, in terms of speech quality.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
