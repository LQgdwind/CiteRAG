Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Locality Relationship Constrained Multi-view Clustering Framework\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In most practical applications, itâ€™s common to utilize multiple features from different views to represent one object. Among these works, multi-view subspace-based clustering has gained extensive attention from many researchers, which aims to provide clustering solutions to multi-view data. However, most existing methods fail to take full use of the locality geometric structure and similarity relationship among samples under the multi-view scenario. To solve these issues, we propose a novel multi-view learning method with locality relationship constraint to explore the problem of multi-view clustering, called Locality Relationship Constrained Multi-view Clustering Framework (LRC-MCF). LRC-MCF aims to explore the diversity, geometric, consensus and complementary information among different views, by capturing the locality relationship information and the common similarity relationships among multiple views. Moreover, LRC-MCF takes sufficient consideration to weights of different views in finding the common-view locality structure and straightforwardly produce the final clusters. To effectually reduce the redundancy of the learned representations, the low-rank constraint on the common similarity matrix is considered additionally. To solve the minimization problem of LRC-MCF, an Alternating Direction Minimization (ADM) method is provided to iteratively calculate all variables LRC-MCF. Extensive experimental results on seven benchmark multi-view datasets validate the effectiveness of the LRC-MCF method.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
