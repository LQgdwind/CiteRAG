Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Fair Allocation Algorithms for Indivisible Items under Structured Conflict Constraints\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We consider the fair allocation of indivisible items to several agents with additional conflict constraints. These are represented by a conflict graph where each item corresponds to a vertex of the graph and edges in the graph represent incompatible pairs of items which should not be allocated to the same agent. This setting combines the issues of Partition and Independent Set and can be seen as a partial coloring of the conflict graph. In the resulting optimization problem each agent has its own valuation function for the profits of the items. We aim at maximizing the lowest total profit obtained by any of the agents. In a previous paper this problem was shown to be strongly NP-hard for several well-known graph classes, e.g., bipartite graphs and their line graphs. On the other hand, it was shown that pseudo-polynomial time algorithms exist for the classes of chordal graphs, cocomparability graphs, biconvex bipartite graphs, and graphs of bounded treewidth. In this contribution we extend this line of research by developing pseudo-polynomial time algorithms that solve the problem for the class of convex bipartite conflict graphs, graphs of bounded clique-width, and graphs of bounded tree-independence number. The algorithms are based on dynamic programming and also permit fully polynomial-time approximation schemes (FPTAS).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
