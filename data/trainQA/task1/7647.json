      "content": "Paper Title: FADO: Floorplan-Aware Directive Optimization for High-Level Synthesis Designs on Multi-Die FPGAs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Multi-die FPGAs are widely adopted to deploy large-scale hardware accelerators. Two factors impede the performance optimization of high-level synthesis (HLS) designs implemented on multi-die FPGAs. On the one hand, the long net delay due to nets crossing die-boundaries results in an NP-hard problem to properly floorplan and pipeline an application. On the other hand, traditional automated searching flow for HLS directive optimizations targets single-die FPGAs, and hence, it cannot consider the resource constraints on each die and the timing issue incurred by the die-crossings. Further, it leads to an excessively long runtime to legalize the floorplanning of HLS designs generated under each group of configurations during directive optimization due to the large design scale. To co-optimize the directives and floorplan of HLS designs on multi-die FPGAs, we propose the FADO framework, which formulates the directive-floorplan co-search problem based on the multi-choice multi-dimensional bin-packing and solves it using an iterative optimization flow. For each step of directive optimization, a latency-bottleneck-guided greedy algorithm searches for more efficient directive configurations. For floorplanning, instead of repetitively incurring global floorplanning algorithms, we implement a more efficient incremental floorplan legalization algorithm. It mainly applies the worst-fit strategy from the online bin-packing algorithm to balance the floorplan, together with an offline best-fit-decreasing re-packing step to compact the floorplan, followed by pipelining of the long wires crossing die-boundaries. Through experiments on a set of HLS designs mixing dataflow and non-dataflow kernels, FADO not only well-automates the co-optimization and finishes within 693X∼similar-to\\sim4925X shorter runtime, compared with DSE assisted by global floorplanning, but also yields an improvement of 1.16X∼similar-to\\sim8.78X in overall workflow execution time after implementation on the Xilinx Alveo U250 FPGA.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 43 most likely reference titles for this paper.
