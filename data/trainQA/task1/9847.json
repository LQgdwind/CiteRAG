      "content": "Paper Title: Pre-trained Neural Recommenders: A Transferable Zero-Shot Framework for Recommendation Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Modern neural collaborative filtering techniques are critical to the success of e-commerce, social media, and content-sharing platforms. However, despite technical advancesâ€”for every new application domain, we need to train an NCF model from scratch. In contrast, pre-trained vision and language models are routinely applied to diverse applications directly (zero-shot) or with limited fine-tuning. Inspired by the impact of pre-trained models, we explore the possibility of pre-trained recommender models that support building recommender systems in new domains, with minimal or no retraining, without the use of any auxiliary user or item information. Zero-shot recommendation without auxiliary information is challenging because we cannot form associations between users and items across datasets when there are no overlapping users or items. Our fundamental insight is that the statistical characteristics of the user-item interaction matrix are universally available across different domains and datasets. Thus, we use the statistical characteristics of the user-item interaction matrix to identify dataset-independent representations for users and items. We show how to learn universal (i.e., supporting zero-shot adaptation without user or item auxiliary information) representations for nodes and edges from the bipartite user-item interaction graph. We learn representations by exploiting the statistical properties of the interaction data, including user and item marginals, and the size and density distributions of their clusters. With extensive experiments on five diverse public real-world datasets, we show that the proposed dataset-agnostic features, combined with a pre-trained recommendation model, generalizes to unseen users and unseen items within a dataset and across different datasets (i.e., cross-domain, zero-shot) with comparable performance to state-of-the-art neural recommenders in traditional single-dataset settings. Furthermore, we show for the in-domain setting, the proposed features can boost the performance of existing state-of-the-art neural recommender models by up to 14% on three out of five datasets via a simple post-hoc interpolation on the ranking prediction. Pre-trained models will have a significant application impact on developing recommender systems for new application domains with minimal fine-tuning (few-shot) or no training (zero-shot).
