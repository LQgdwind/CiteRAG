Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Topological Measurement of Deep Neural Networks Using Persistent Homology\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The inner representation of deep neural networks (DNNs) is indecipherable, which makes it difficult to tune DNN models, control their training process, and interpret their outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to investigate the inner representation of DNNs through topological data analysis (TDA). Persistent homology (PH), one of the outstanding methods in TDA, was employed for investigating the complexities of trained DNNs. We constructed clique complexes on trained DNNs and calculated the one-dimensional PH of DNNs. The PH reveals the combinational effects of multiple neurons in DNNs at different resolutions, which is difficult to be captured without using PH. Evaluations were conducted using fully connected networks (FCNs) and networks combining FCNs and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets. Evaluation results demonstrate that the PH of DNNs reflects both the excess of neurons and problem difficulty, making PH one of the prominent methods for investigating the inner representation of DNNs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
