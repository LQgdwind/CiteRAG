Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Emulating the First Principles of Matter: A Probabilistic Roadmap\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This chapter provides a tutorial overview of first principles methods to describe the properties of matter at the ground state or equilibrium. It begins with a brief introduction to quantum and statistical mechanics for predicting the electronic structure and diverse static properties of of many-particle systems useful for practical applications. Pedagogical examples are given to illustrate the basic concepts and simple applications of quantum Monte Carlo and density functional theory —two representative methods commonly used in the literature of first principles modeling. In addition, this chapter highlights the practical needs for the integration of physics-based modeling and data-science approaches to reduce the computational cost and expand the scope of applicability. A special emphasis is placed on recent developments of statistical surrogate models to emulate first principles calculation from a probabilistic point of view. The probabilistic approach provides an internal assessment of the approximation accuracy of emulation that quantifies the uncertainty in predictions. Various recent advances toward this direction establish a new marriage between Gaussian processes and first principles calculation, with physical properties, such as translational, rotational, and permutation symmetry, naturally encoded in new kernel functions. Finally, it concludes with some prospects on future advances in the field toward faster yet more accurate computation leveraging a synergetic combination of novel theoretical concepts and efficient numerical algorithms.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
