      "content": "Paper Title: Laplace-Beltrami based Multi-Resolution Shape Reconstruction on Subdivision Surfaces\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator have widespread applications in a number of disciplines of engineering, computer vision/graphics, machine learning, etc. These eigenfunctions or manifold harmonics, provide the means to smoothly interpolate data on a manifold. They are highly effective, specifically as it relates to geometry representation and editing; manifold harmonics form a natural basis for multi-resolution representation (and editing) of complex surfaces and functioned defined therein. In this paper, we seek to develop the framework to exploit the benefits of manifold harmonics for shape reconstruction. To this end, we develop a highly compressible, multi-resolution shape reconstruction scheme using manifold harmonics. The method relies on subdivision basis sets to construct both boundary element isogeometric methods for analysis and surface finite elements to construct manifold harmonics. We pair this technique with volumetric source reconstruction method to determine an initial starting point. Examples presented highlight efficacy of the approach in the presence of noisy data, including significant reduction in the number of degrees of freedom for complex objects, accuracy of reconstruction, and multi-resolution capabilities.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper.
