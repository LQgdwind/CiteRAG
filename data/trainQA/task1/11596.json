Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Physically Aware Synthesis Revisited: Guiding Technology Mapping with Primitive Logic Gate Placement\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. A typical VLSI design flow is divided into separated front-end logic synthesis and back-end physical design (PD) stages, which often require costly iterations between these stages to achieve design closure. Existing approaches face significant challenges, notably in utilizing feedback from physical metrics to better adapt and refine synthesis operations, and in establishing a unified and comprehensive metric. This paper introduces a new Primitive logic gate placement guided technology MAPping (PigMAP) framework to address these challenges. With approximating technology-independent spatial information, we develop a novel wirelength (WL) driven mapping algorithm to produce PD-friendly netlists. PigMAP is equipped with two schemes: a performance mode that focuses on optimizing the critical path WL to achieve high performance, and a power mode that aims to minimize the total WL, resulting in balanced power and performance outcomes. We evaluate our framework using the EPFL benchmark suites with ASAP7 technology, using the OpenROAD tool for place-and-route. Compared with OpenROAD flow scripts, performance mode reduces delay by 14% while increasing power consumption by only 6%. Meanwhile, power mode achieves a 3% improvement in delay and a 9% reduction in power consumption.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 44\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
