Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Knowledge graph completion (KGC) can predict missing links and is crucial for real-world knowledge graphs, which widely suffer from incompleteness. KGC methods assume a knowledge graph is static, but that may lead to inaccurate prediction results because many facts in the knowledge graphs change over time. Recently, emerging methods have shown improved predictive results by further incorporating the timestamps of facts; namely, temporal knowledge graph completion (TKGC). With this temporal information, TKGC methods can learn the dynamic evolution of the knowledge graph that KGC methods fail to capture. In this paper, for the first time, we summarize the recent advances in TKGC research. First, we detail the background of TKGC, including the problem definition, benchmark datasets, and evaluation metrics. Then, we summarize existing TKGC methods based on how timestamps of facts are used to capture the temporal dynamics. Finally, we conclude the paper and present future research directions of TKGC.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
