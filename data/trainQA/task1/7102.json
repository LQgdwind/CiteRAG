      "content": "Paper Title: A Mixing Time Lower Bound for a Simplified Version of BART\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) is a popular Bayesian non-parametric regression algorithm. The posterior is a distribution over sums of decision trees, and predictions are made by averaging approximate samples from the posterior. The combination of strong predictive performance and the ability to provide uncertainty measures has led BART to be commonly used in the social sciences, biostatistics, and causal inference. BART uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to obtain approximate posterior samples over a parameterized space of sums of trees, but it has often been observed that the chains are slow to mix. In this paper, we provide the first lower bound on the mixing time for a simplified version of BART in which we reduce the sum to a single tree and use a subset of the possible moves for the MCMC proposal distribution. Our lower bound for the mixing time grows exponentially with the number of data points. Inspired by this new connection between the mixing time and the number of data points, we perform rigorous simulations on BART. We show qualitatively that BART’s mixing time increases with the number of data points. The slow mixing time of the simplified BART suggests a large variation between different runs of the simplified BART algorithm and a similar large variation is known for BART in the literature. This large variation could result in a lack of stability in the models, predictions and posterior intervals obtained from the BART MCMC samples. Our lower bound and simulations suggest increasing the number of chains with the number of data points.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
