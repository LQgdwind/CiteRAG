Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Incomplete Knowledge Graph Alignment\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Knowledge graph (KG) alignment – the task of recognizing entities referring to the same thing in different KGs – is recognized as one of the most important operations in the field of KG construction and completion. However, existing alignment techniques often assume that the input KGs are complete and isomorphic, which is not true due to the real-world heterogeneity in domain, size, and sparsity. In this work, we address the problem of aligning incomplete KGs with representation learning. Our KG embedding framework exploits two feature channels: transitivity-based and proximity-based. The former captures the consistency constraints between entities via translation paths, while the latter captures the neighborhood structure of KGs via an attention guided relation-aware graph neural network. The two feature channels are jointly learned to exchange important features between the input KGs while enforcing the output representations of the input KGs in the same embedding space. Also, we develop a missing links detector that discovers and recovers the missing links in the input KGs during the training process, which helps mitigate the incompleteness issue and thus improve the compatibility of the learned representations. The embeddings then are fused to generate the alignment result, and the high-confidence matched node pairs are updated to the pre-aligned supervision data to improve the embeddings gradually. Empirical results show that our model is more accurate than the SOTA and is robust against different levels of incompleteness.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
