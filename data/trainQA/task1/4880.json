      "content": "Paper Title: Multicriteria Scalable Graph Drawing via Stochastic Gradient Descent, (ùëÜ‚Å¢ùê∫‚Å¢ùê∑)¬≤\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Readability criteria, such as distance or neighborhood preservation, are often used to optimize node-link representations of graphs to enable the comprehension of the underlying data. With few exceptions, graph drawing algorithms typically optimize one such criterion, usually at the expense of others. We propose a layout approach, Multicriteria Scalable Graph Drawing via Stochastic Gradient Descent, (S‚ÄãG‚ÄãD)2superscriptùëÜùê∫ùê∑2(SGD)^{2}, that can handle multiple readability criteria. (S‚ÄãG‚ÄãD)2superscriptùëÜùê∫ùê∑2(SGD)^{2} can optimize any criterion that can be described by a differentiable function. Our approach is flexible and can be used to optimize several criteria that have already been considered earlier (e.g., obtaining ideal edge lengths, stress, neighborhood preservation) as well as other criteria which have not yet been explicitly optimized in such fashion (e.g., node resolution, angular resolution, aspect ratio). The approach is scalable and can handle large graphs. A variation of the underlying approach can also be used to optimize many desirable properties in planar graphs, while maintaining planarity. Finally, we provide quantitative and qualitative evidence of the effectiveness of (S‚ÄãG‚ÄãD)2superscriptùëÜùê∫ùê∑2(SGD)^{2}: we analyze the interactions between criteria, measure the quality of layouts generated from (S‚ÄãG‚ÄãD)2superscriptùëÜùê∫ùê∑2(SGD)^{2} as well as the runtime behavior, and analyze the impact of sample sizes. The source code is available on github and we also provide an interactive demo for small graphs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 57\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
