Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5.

      "content": "Paper Title: Examining the Role of Mood Patterns in Predicting Self-Reported Depressive symptoms\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Researchers have explored automatic screening models as a quick way to identify potential risks of developing depressive symptoms. Most existing models include a person’s mood as reflected on social media at a single point in time as one of the predictive variables. In this paper, we study the changes and transition in mood reflected on social media text over a period of one year using a mood profile. We used a subset of the ”MyPersonality” Facebook data set that comprises users who have consented to and completed an assessment of depressive symptoms. The subset consists of 93,378 Facebook posts from 781 users. We observed less evidence of mood fluctuation expressed in social media text from those with low symptom measures compared to others with high symptom scores. Next, we leveraged a daily mood representation in Hidden Markov Models to determine its associations with subsequent self-reported symptoms. We found that individuals who have specific mood patterns are highly likely to have reported high depressive symptoms. However, not all of the high symptoms individuals necessarily displayed this characteristic, which indicates presence of potential subgroups driving these findings. Finally, we leveraged multiple mood representations to characterize levels of depressive symptoms with a logistic regression model. Our findings support the claim that for some people, derived mood from social media text can be a proxy of real-life mood, in particular depressive symptoms. Combining the mood representations with other proxy signals can potentially advance responsibly used semi-automatic screening procedures.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
