Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Quantum Language Model with Entanglement Embedding for Question Answering\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Quantum Language Models (QLMs) in which words are modelled as a quantum superposition of sememes have demonstrated a high level of model transparency and good post-hoc interpretability. Nevertheless, in the current literature word sequences are basically modelled as a classical mixture of word states, which cannot fully exploit the potential of a quantum probabilistic description. A quantum-inspired neural network module is yet to be developed to explicitly capture the non-classical correlations within the word sequences. We propose a neural network model with a novel Entanglement Embedding (EE) module, whose function is to transform the word sequence into an entangled pure state representation. Strong quantum entanglement, which is the central concept of quantum information and an indication of parallelized correlations among the words, is observed within the word sequences. The proposed QLM with EE (QLM-EE) is proposed to implement on classical computing devices with a quantum-inspired neural network structure, and numerical experiments show that QLM-EE achieves superior performance compared with the classical deep neural network models and other QLMs on Question Answering (QA) datasets. In addition, the post-hoc interpretability of the model can be improved by quantifying the degree of entanglement among the word states.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
