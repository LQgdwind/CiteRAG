Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Metric on the Polycrystalline Microstructure State Space\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Material microstructures are traditionally compared using sets of statistical measures that are incomplete, e.g., two visually distinct microstructures can have identical grain size distributions and phase fractions. While this is not a severe concern for materials fabricated by traditional means, the microstructures produced by advanced manufacturing methods can depend sensitively and unpredictably on the processing conditions. Moreover, the advent of computational materials design has increased the frequency of synthetic microstructure generation, and there is not yet a standard approach in the literature to validate the generated microstructures with experimental ones. This work proposes an idealized distance on the space of single-phase polycrystalline microstructures such that two microstructures that are close with respect to the distance exhibit statistically similar grain geometries in all respects below a user-specified length scale. Given a pair of micrographs, the distance is approximated by sampling windows from the micrographs, defining a distance between pairs of windows, and finding a window matching that minimizes the sum of pairwise window distances. The approach is used to compare a variety of synthetic microstructures and to develop a procedure to query a proof-of-concept database suitable for general single-phase polycrystalline microstructures.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
