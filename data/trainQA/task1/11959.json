      "content": "Paper Title: Generalized Word-Representable Graphs: A Formal Language Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The literature on word-representable graphs is quite rich, and a number of variations of the original definition have been proposed over the years. In this paper, we are initiating a systematic study of such variations based on formal languages. In our framework, we can associate a graph class to each language over the binary alphabet {0,1}01\\{0,1\\}. All graph classes that are language-representable in this sense are hereditary and enjoy further common properties. Besides word-representable graphs and, more generally, 1ksuperscript1ùëò1^{k}- or kùëòk-11-representable graphs, we can identify many more graph classes in our framework, like (co)bipartite graphs, (co)comparability graphs, to name a few. It was already known that any graph is 111111111- or 2-11-representable. However, when such representations are considered for storing graphs (as in graph databases), 111111111- or 2-11-representability bears the disadvantage of being significantly inferior to standard adjacency matrices or lists. We will prove that quite famous language like the palindrome language, the copy language or the language of Lyndon words, as well as their complements, can match the efficiency of standard graph representations in general. The perspective of language theory allows us to prove very general results that hold for all graph classes that can be defined in this framework. This includes certain closure properties (e.g., all language-definable graph classes are hereditary) as well as certain limitations (e.g., all language-representable graph classes contain graphs of arbitrarily large treewidth and graphs of arbitrarily large degeneracy, except a trivial case). As each language describes a graph class, we can also ask questions like: Given a language, say, by a context-free grammar, does the described graph class only contain graphs of treewidth at most 2? We show that this (and similar questions) are decidable. We also present a systematic study of graph classes that can be represented by binary languages in which each letter occurs at most twice. Here, we find graph classes like interval graphs, permutation graphs, circle graphs, bipartite chain graphs, convex graphs, and threshold graphs, to name the most prominent ones.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 63 most likely reference titles for this paper.
