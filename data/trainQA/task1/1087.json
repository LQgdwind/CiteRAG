Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: From Spectrum Wavelet to Vertex Propagation: Graph Convolutional Networks Based on Taylor Approximation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Graph convolutional networks (GCN) have been recently utilized to extract the underlying structures of datasets with some labeled data and high-dimensional features. Existing GCNs mostly rely on a first-order Chebyshev approximation of graph wavelet-kernels. Such a generic propagation model does not always suit the various datasets and their features. This work revisits the fundamentals of graph wavelet and explores the utility of signal propagation in the vertex domain to approximate the spectral wavelet-kernels. We first derive the conditions for representing the graph wavelet-kernels via vertex propagation. We next propose alternative propagation models for GCN layers based on Taylor expansions. We further analyze the choices of detailed graph representations for TGCNs. Experiments on citation networks, multimedia datasets and synthetic graphs demonstrate the advantage of Taylor-based GCN (TGCN) in the node classification problems over the traditional GCN methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
