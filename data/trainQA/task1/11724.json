      "content": "Paper Title: Large Language Models Are Strong Audio-Visual Speech Recognition Learners\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently become a focal point of research due to their formidable multimodal understanding capabilities. For example, in the audio and speech domains, an LLM can be equipped with (automatic) speech recognition (ASR) abilities by just concatenating the audio tokens, computed with an audio encoder, and the text tokens to achieve state-of-the-art results. On the contrary, tasks like visual and audio-visual speech recognition (VSR/AVSR), which also exploit noise-invariant lip movement information, have received little or no attention. To bridge this gap, we propose Llama-AVSR, a new MLLM with strong audio-visual speech recognition capabilities. It leverages pre-trained audio and video encoders to produce modality-specific tokens which, together with the text tokens, are processed by a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Llama3.1-8B) to yield the resulting response in an auto-regressive fashion. Llama-AVSR requires a small number of trainable parameters as only modality-specific projectors and LoRA modules are trained whereas the multi-modal encoders and LLM are kept frozen. We evaluate our proposed approach on LRS3, the largest public AVSR benchmark, and we achieve new state-of-the-art results for the tasks of ASR and AVSR with a WER of 0.81% and 0.77%, respectively. To bolster our results, we investigate the key factors that underpin the effectiveness of Llama-AVSR: the choice of the pre-trained encoders and LLM, the efficient integration of LoRA modules, and the optimal performance-efficiency trade-off obtained via modality-aware compression rates.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
