Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Symmetry-aware Neural Architecture for Embodied Visual Navigation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Visual exploration is a task that seeks to visit all the navigable areas of an environment as quickly as possible. The existing methods employ deep reinforcement learning (RL) as the standard tool for the task. However, they tend to be vulnerable to statistical shifts between the training and test data, resulting in poor generalization over novel environments that are out-of-distribution (OOD) from the training data. In this paper, we attempt to improve the generalization ability by utilizing the inductive biases available for the task. Employing the active neural SLAM (ANS) that learns exploration policies with the advantage actor-critic (A2C) method as the base framework, we first point out that the mappings represented by the actor and the critic should satisfy specific symmetries. We then propose a network design for the actor and the critic to inherently attain these symmetries. Specifically, we use Gùê∫G-convolution instead of the standard convolution and insert the semi-global polar pooling (SGPP) layer, which we newly design in this study, in the last section of the critic network. Experimental results show that our method increases area coverage by 8.1‚Äãm28.1superscriptùëö28.1m^{2} when trained on the Gibson dataset and tested on the MP3D dataset, establishing the new state-of-the-art.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
