      "content": "Paper Title: Proof-of-Learning with Incentive Security\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Most concurrent blockchain systems rely heavily on the Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanisms for decentralized consensus and security assurance. However, the substantial energy expenditure stemming from computationally intensive yet meaningless tasks has raised considerable concerns surrounding traditional PoW approaches, and the PoS mechanism, while free of energy consumption, is subject to security and economic issues. Addressing these issues, the paradigm of Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) seeks to employ challenges of practical significance as PoW, thereby imbuing energy consumption with tangible value. While previous efforts in Proof of Learning (PoL) explored the utilization of deep learning model training Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) tasks as PoUW challenges, recent research has revealed its vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks and the theoretical hardness in crafting a byzantine-secure PoL mechanism. In this paper, we introduce the concept of incentive-security that incentivizes rational provers to behave honestly for their best interest, bypassing the existing hardness to design a PoL mechanism with computational efficiency, a provable incentive-security guarantee, and controllable difficulty. Particularly, our work is secure against two attacks (Zhang et al., 2022; Fang et al., 2023) to the recent work of Jia et al. (2021). For a training task of Eùê∏E epochs and model size |ùí≤|ùí≤|\\mathcal{W}|, we improve the relative computational overhead from Œò‚Äã(1)Œò1\\Theta(1) to O‚Äã(log‚Å°EE)ùëÇùê∏ùê∏O(\\frac{\\log E}{E}) without any staking requirement, or O‚Äã(1E)ùëÇ1ùê∏O(\\frac{1}{E}) with a staking requirement comparable to the block reward, and improve the communication complexity from Œò‚Äã(E‚Äã|ùí≤|)Œòùê∏ùí≤\\Theta(E|\\mathcal{W}|) to O‚Äã(E+|ùí≤|‚Äãlog‚Å°E)ùëÇùê∏ùí≤ùê∏O(E+|\\mathcal{W}|\\log E) or O‚Äã(E+|ùí≤|)ùëÇùê∏ùí≤O(E+|\\mathcal{W}|), respectively. Furthermore, while most recent research on PoUW assumes trusted problem providers and verifiers, our design also guarantees frontend incentive-security against known-model and model-stealing attacks even when problem providers are untrusted, and verifier incentive-security that bypasses the Verifier‚Äôs Dilemma via a capture-the-flag protocol. By incorporating ML training into blockchain consensus mechanisms with provable incentive-security guarantees, our research not only proposes an eco-friendly solution to blockchain systems, but also provides a proposal for a completely decentralized computing power market in the new AI age.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 43 most likely reference titles for this paper.
