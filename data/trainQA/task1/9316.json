      "content": "Paper Title: On the complexity of isomorphism problems for tensors, groups, and polynomials IV: linear-length reductions and their applications\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Many isomorphism problems for tensors, groups, algebras, and polynomials were recently shown to be equivalent to one another under polynomial-time reductions, prompting the introduction of the complexity class 𝖳𝖨𝖳𝖨\\mathsf{TI} (Grochow & Qiao, ITCS ’21; SIAM J. Comp., ’23). Using the tensorial viewpoint, Grochow & Qiao (CCC ’21) then gave moderately exponential-time search- and counting-to-decision reductions for a class of p𝑝p-groups. A significant issue was that the reductions usually incurred a quadratic increase in the length of the tensors involved. When the tensors represent p𝑝p-groups, this corresponds to an increase in the order of the group of the form |G|Θ​(log⁡|G|)superscript𝐺Θ𝐺|G|^{\\Theta(\\log|G|)}, negating any asymptotic gains in the Cayley table model. In this paper, we present a new kind of tensor gadget that allows us to replace those quadratic-length reductions with linear-length ones, yielding the following consequences: 1. Combined with the recent breakthrough |G|O​((log⁡|G|)5/6)superscript𝐺𝑂superscript𝐺56|G|^{O((\\log|G|)^{5/6})}-time isomorphism-test for p𝑝p-groups of class 2 and exponent p𝑝p (Sun, STOC ’23), our reductions extend this runtime to p𝑝p-groups of class c𝑐c and exponent p𝑝p where c<p𝑐𝑝c<p. 2. Our reductions show that Sun’s algorithm solves several 𝖳𝖨𝖳𝖨\\mathsf{TI}-complete problems over a finite prime field 𝔽psubscript𝔽𝑝\\mathbb{F}_{p}, such as isomorphism problems for cubic forms, algebras, and tensors, in time pO​(n1.8​log⁡p)superscript𝑝𝑂superscript𝑛1.8𝑝p^{O(n^{1.8}\\log p)}, where n𝑛n is the side length. When n≫(log⁡p)5much-greater-than𝑛superscript𝑝5n\\gg(\\log p)^{5}, this improves over the previous state of the art, which was the brute-force upper bound of pO​(n2)superscript𝑝𝑂superscript𝑛2p^{O(n^{2})}. 3. Polynomial-time search- and counting-to-decision reduction for testing isomorphism of p𝑝p-groups of class 222 and exponent p𝑝p in the Cayley table model. This answers questions of Arvind and Tóran (Bull. EATCS, 2005) for this group class, thought to be one of the hardest cases of Group Isomorphism. 4. If Graph Isomorphism is in 𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{P}, then testing equivalence of cubic forms in n𝑛n variables over a finite field 𝔽qsubscript𝔽𝑞\\mathbb{F}_{q}, and testing isomorphism of n𝑛n-dimensional algebras over 𝔽qsubscript𝔽𝑞\\mathbb{F}_{q}, can both be solved in time qO​(n)superscript𝑞𝑂𝑛q^{O(n)}, improving from the brute-force upper bound qO​(n2)superscript𝑞𝑂superscript𝑛2q^{O(n^{2})} for both of these. Our reductions are also presented in a more modular and composable fashion compared to previous gadgets, making them easier to reason about and, crucially, easier to combine.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
