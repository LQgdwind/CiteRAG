Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: An efficient optimization model and tabu search-based global optimization approach for continuous ùëù-dispersion problem\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Continuous pùëùp-dispersion problems with and without boundary constraints are NP-hard optimization problems with numerous real-world applications, notably in facility location and circle packing, which are widely studied in mathematics and operations research. In this work, we concentrate on general cases with a non-convex multiply-connected region that are rarely studied in the literature due to their intractability and the absence of an efficient optimization model. Using the penalty function approach, we design a unified and almost everywhere differentiable optimization model for these complex problems and propose a tabu search-based global optimization (TSGO) algorithm for solving them. Computational results over a variety of benchmark instances show that the proposed model works very well, allowing popular local optimization methods (e.g., the quasi-Newton methods and the conjugate gradient methods) to reach high-precision solutions due to the differentiability of the model. These results further demonstrate that the proposed TSGO algorithm is very efficient and significantly outperforms several popular global optimization algorithms in the literature, improving the best-known solutions for several existing instances in a short computational time. Experimental analyses are conducted to show the influence of several key ingredients of the algorithm on computational performance. Keywords: Circle packing, continuous dispersion problem, global optimization, tabu search, nonlinear optimization.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
