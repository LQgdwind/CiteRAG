Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Denoising Multi-Similarity Formulation: A Self-paced Curriculum-Driven Approach for Robust Metric Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep Metric Learning (DML) is a group of techniques that aim to measure the similarity between objects through the neural network. Although the number of DML methods has rapidly increased in recent years, most previous studies cannot effectively handle noisy data, which commonly exists in practical applications and often leads to serious performance deterioration. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we build a connection between noisy samples and hard samples in the framework of self-paced learning, and propose a Balanced Self-Paced Metric Learning (BSPML) algorithm with a denoising multi-similarity formulation, where noisy samples are treated as extremely hard samples and adaptively excluded from the model training by sample weighting. Especially, due to the pairwise relationship and a new balance regularization term, the sub-problem w.r.t. sample weights is a nonconvex quadratic function. To efficiently solve this nonconvex quadratic problem, we propose a doubly stochastic projection coordinate gradient algorithm. Importantly, we theoretically prove the convergence not only for the doubly stochastic projection coordinate gradient algorithm, but also for our BSPML algorithm. Experimental results on several standard data sets demonstrate that our BSPML algorithm has better generalization ability and robustness than the state-of-the-art robust DML approaches.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
