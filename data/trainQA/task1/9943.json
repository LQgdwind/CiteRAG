Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: XFedHunter: An Explainable Federated Learning Framework for Advanced Persistent Threat Detection in SDN\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks are highly sophisticated and employ a multitude of advanced methods and techniques to target organizations and steal sensitive and confidential information. APT attacks consist of multiple stages and have a defined strategy, utilizing new and innovative techniques and technologies developed by hackers to evade security software monitoring. To effectively protect against APTs, detecting and predicting APT indicators with an explanation from Machine Learning (ML) prediction is crucial to reveal the characteristics of attackers lurking in the network system. Meanwhile, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for building intelligent applications without compromising privacy. This is particularly important in cybersecurity, where sensitive data and high-quality labeling play a critical role in constructing effective machine learning models for detecting cyber threats. Therefore, this work proposes XFedHunter, an explainable federated learning framework for APT detection in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) leveraging local cyber threat knowledge from many training collaborators. In XFedHunter, Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Deep Learning model are utilized to reveal the malicious events effectively in the large number of normal ones in the network system. The experimental results on NF-ToN-IoT and DARPA TCE3 datasets indicate that our framework can enhance the trust and accountability of ML-based systems utilized for cybersecurity purposes without privacy leakage.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 47\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
