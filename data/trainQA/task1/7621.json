Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: KNIFE: Distilling Reasoning Knowledge From Free-Text Rationales\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Language models (LMs) have yielded impressive results on many language reasoning tasks, but their unexpected errors raise doubts about their reasoning abilities. In light of this, there is growing interest in finetuning/prompting LMs with both task instances and their associated free-text rationales (FTRs), which explain the correct reasoning process for predicting the correct task output (i.e., how to be “right for the right reasons”). However, existing finetuning methods fail to improve LM performance, while prompting needs prohibitively large (i.e., >50B) LMs to work well. We propose KNIFE, which shows that reasoning knowledge can be effectively distilled from FTRs into a small (i.e., <1B) LM and improve the LM’s performance. First, KNIFE finetunes a teacher LM (given task input and FTR) to predict the task output, transferring reasoning knowledge from the FTRs to the teacher’s hidden states. Second, KNIFE finetunes a student LM (given task input only) such that its hidden states are aligned with the teacher’s. Thus, the student is endowed with reasoning knowledge but can be used for inference without direct FTR input. On two question-answering datasets, KNIFE outperforms various finetuning and prompting baselines in fully-supervised and low-resource settings. Also, we observe that FTR quality is crucial to KNIFE’s performance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
