      "content": "Paper Title: Com-DDPG: A Multiagent Reinforcement Learning-based Offloading Strategy for Mobile Edge Computing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The development of mobile services has impacted a variety of computation-intensive and time-sensitive applications, such as recommendation systems and daily payment methods. However, computing task competition involving limited resources increases the task processing latency and energy consumption of mobile devices, as well as time constraints. Mobile edge computing (MEC) has been widely used to address these problems. However, there are limitations to existing methods used during computation offloading. On the one hand, they focus on independent tasks rather than dependent tasks. The challenges of task dependency in the real world, especially task segmentation and integration, remain to be addressed. On the other hand, the multiuser scenarios related to resource allocation and the mutex access problem must be considered. In this paper, we propose a novel offloading approach, Com-DDPG, for MEC using multiagent reinforcement learning to enhance the offloading performance. First, we discuss the task dependency model, task priority model, energy consumption model, and average latency from the perspective of server clusters and multidependence on mobile tasks. Our method based on these models is introduced to formalize communication behavior among multiple agents; then, reinforcement learning is executed as an offloading strategy to obtain the results. Because of the incomplete state information, long short-term memory (LSTM) is employed as a decision-making tool to assess the internal state. Moreover, to optimize and support effective action, we consider using a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) to learn and enhance features obtained from agentsâ€™ communication. Finally, we simulate experiments on the Alibaba cluster dataset. The results show that our method is better than other baselines in terms of energy consumption, load status and latency.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
