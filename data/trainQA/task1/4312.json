Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Cross Modification Attention Based Deliberation Model for Image Captioning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The conventional encoder-decoder framework for image captioning generally adopts a single-pass decoding process, which predicts the target descriptive sentence word by word in temporal order. Despite the great success of this framework, it still suffers from two serious disadvantages. Firstly, it is unable to correct the mistakes in the predicted words, which may mislead the subsequent prediction and result in error accumulation problem. Secondly, such a framework can only leverage the already generated words but not the possible future words, and thus lacks the ability of global planning on linguistic information. To overcome these limitations, we explore a universal two-pass decoding framework, where a single-pass decoding based model serving as the Drafting Model first generates a draft caption according to an input image, and a Deliberation Model then performs the polishing process to refine the draft caption to a better image description. Furthermore, inspired from the complementarity between different modalities, we propose a novel Cross Modification Attention (CMA) module to enhance the semantic expression of the image features and filter out error information from the draft captions. We integrate CMA with the decoder of our Deliberation Model and name it as Cross Modification Attention based Deliberation Model (CMA-DM). We train our proposed framework by jointly optimizing all trainable components from scratch with a trade-off coefficient. Experiments on MS COCO dataset demonstrate that our approach obtains significant improvements over single-pass decoding baselines and achieves competitive performances compared with other state-of-the-art two-pass decoding based methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
