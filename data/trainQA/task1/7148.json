Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: RMBench: Benchmarking Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Manipulator Control\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Reinforcement learning is applied to solve actual complex tasks from high-dimensional, sensory inputs. The last decade has developed a long list of reinforcement learning algorithms. Recent progress benefits from deep learning for raw sensory signal representation. One question naturally arises: how well do they perform concerning different robotic manipulation tasks? Benchmarks use objective performance metrics to offer a scientific way to compare algorithms. In this paper, we present RMBench, the first benchmark for robotic manipulations, which have high-dimensional continuous action and state spaces. We implement and evaluate reinforcement learning algorithms that directly use observed pixels as inputs. We report their average performance and learning curves to show their performance and stability of training. Our study concludes that none of the studied algorithms can handle all tasks well, soft Actor-Critic outperforms most algorithms in average reward and stability, and an algorithm combined with data augmentation may facilitate learning policies. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/xiangyanfei212/RMBench-2022.git, including all benchmark tasks and studied algorithms.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 53\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
