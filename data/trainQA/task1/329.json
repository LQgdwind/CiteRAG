Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Toward Interpretability of Dual-Encoder Models for Dialogue Response Suggestions\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This work shows how to improve and interpret the commonly used dual encoder model for response suggestion in dialogue. We present an attentive dual encoder model that includes an attention mechanism on top of the extracted word-level features from two encoders, one for context and one for label respectively. To improve the interpretability in the dual encoder models, we design a novel regularization loss to minimize the mutual information between unimportant words and desired labels, in addition to the original attention method, so that important words are emphasized while unimportant words are de-emphasized. This can help not only with model interpretability, but can also further improve model accuracy. We propose an approximation method that uses a neural network to calculate the mutual information. Furthermore, by adding a residual layer between raw word embeddings and the final encoded context feature, word-level interpretability is preserved at the final prediction of the model. We compare the proposed model with existing methods for the dialogue response task on two public datasets (Persona and Ubuntu). The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of better Recall@1 accuracy and visualized interpretability.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
