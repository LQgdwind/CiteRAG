Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamic Multimodal Fusion\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep multimodal learning has achieved great progress in recent years. However, current fusion approaches are static in nature, i.e., they process and fuse multimodal inputs with identical computation, without accounting for diverse computational demands of different multimodal data. In this work, we propose dynamic multimodal fusion (DynMM), a new approach that adaptively fuses multimodal data and generates data-dependent forward paths during inference. To this end, we propose a gating function to provide modality-level or fusion-level decisions on-the-fly based on multimodal features and a resource-aware loss function that encourages computational efficiency. Results on various multimodal tasks demonstrate the efficiency and wide applicability of our approach. For instance, DynMM can reduce the computation costs by 46.5% with only a negligible accuracy loss (CMU-MOSEI sentiment analysis) and improve segmentation performance with over 21% savings in computation (NYU Depth V2 semantic segmentation) when compared with static fusion approaches. We believe our approach opens a new direction towards dynamic multimodal network design, with applications to a wide range of multimodal tasks. 111Our code is available at https://github.com/zihuixue/DynMM.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 52\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
