Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Concurrent Self-testing of Neural Networks Using Uncertainty Fingerprint\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Neural networks (NNs) are increasingly used in always-on safety-critical applications deployed on hardware accelerators (NN-HAs) employing various memory technologies. Reliable continuous operation of NN is essential for safety-critical applications. During online operation, NNs are susceptible to single and multiple permanent and soft errors due to factors such as radiation, aging, and thermal effects. Explicit NN-HA testing methods cannot detect transient faults during inference, are unsuitable for always-on applications, and require extensive test vector generation and storage. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the uncertainty fingerprint approach representing the online fault status of NN. Furthermore, we propose a dual head NN topology specifically designed to produce uncertainty fingerprints and the primary prediction of the NN in a single shot. During the online operation, by matching the uncertainty fingerprint, we can concurrently self-test NNs with up to 100%percent100100\\% coverage with a low false positive rate while maintaining a similar performance of the primary task. Compared to existing works, memory overhead is reduced by up to 243.7243.7243.7 MB, multiply and accumulate (MAC) operation is reduced by up to 10000Ã—10000\\times, and false-positive rates are reduced by up to 89%percent8989\\%.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
