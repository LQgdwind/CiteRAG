Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Crafting Adversarial Examples for Deep Learning Based Prognostics (Extended Version)\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In manufacturing, unexpected failures are considered a primary operational risk, as they can hinder productivity and can incur huge losses. State-of-the-art Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) systems incorporate Deep Learning (DL) algorithms and Internet of Things (IoT) devices to ascertain the health status of equipment, and thus reduce the downtime, maintenance cost and increase the productivity. Unfortunately, IoT sensors and DL algorithms, both are vulnerable to cyber attacks, and hence pose a significant threat to PHM systems. In this paper, we adopt the adversarial example crafting techniques from the computer vision domain and apply them to the PHM domain. Specifically, we craft adversarial examples using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Basic Iterative Method (BIM) and apply them on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based PHM models. We evaluate the impact of adversarial attacks using NASAâ€™s turbofan engine dataset. The obtained results show that all the evaluated PHM models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and can cause a serious defect in the remaining useful life estimation. The obtained results also show that the crafted adversarial examples are highly transferable and may cause significant damages to PHM systems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
