Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: In-Context Personalization Learning in LLMs for Text Summarization Task\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Large Language Models (LLMs) have succeeded considerably in In-Context-Learning (ICL) based summarization. However, saliency is subject to the users’ specific preference histories. Hence, we need reliable In-Context Personalization Learning (ICPL) capabilities within such LLMs. For any arbitrary LLM to exhibit ICPL, it needs to have the ability to discern contrast in user profiles. A recent study proposed a measure for degree-of-personalization called EGISES for the first time. EGISES measures a model’s responsiveness to user profile differences. However, it cannot test if a model utilizes all three types of cues provided in ICPL prompts: (i) example summaries, (ii) user’s reading histories, and (iii) contrast in user profiles. To address this, we propose the iCOPERNICUS framework, a novel In-Context Personalization Learning Scrutiny of Summarization capability in LLMs that uses EGISES as a comparative measure. As a case-study, we evaluate 17 state-of-the-art LLMs based on their reported ICL performances and observe that 15 models’ ICPL degrades (min: 1.6%↓↓\\downarrow; max: 3.6%↓↓\\downarrow) when probed with richer prompts, thereby showing lack of true ICPL.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
