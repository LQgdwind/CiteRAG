Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Uncertainty with Artificial Neural Networks for Predictive Process Monitoring\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The inability of artificial neural networks to assess the uncertainty of their predictions is an impediment to their widespread use. We distinguish two types of learnable uncertainty: model uncertainty due to a lack of training data and noise-induced observational uncertainty. Bayesian neural networks use solid mathematical foundations to learn the model uncertainties of their predictions. The observational uncertainty can be calculated by adding one layer to these networks and augmenting their loss functions. Our contribution is to apply these uncertainty concepts to predictive process monitoring tasks to train uncertainty-based models to predict the remaining time and outcomes. Our experiments show that uncertainty estimates allow more and less accurate predictions to be differentiated and confidence intervals to be constructed in both regression and classification tasks. These conclusions remain true even in early stages of running processes. Moreover, the deployed techniques are fast and produce more accurate predictions. The learned uncertainty could increase usersâ€™ confidence in their process prediction systems, promote better cooperation between humans and these systems, and enable earlier implementations with smaller datasets.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
