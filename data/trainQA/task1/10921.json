Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Better Schedules for Low Precision Training of Deep Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Low precision training can significantly reduce the computational overhead of training deep neural networks (DNNs). Though many such techniques exist, cyclic precision training (CPT), which dynamically adjusts precision throughout training according to a cyclic schedule, achieves particularly impressive improvements in training efficiency, while actually improving DNN performance. Existing CPT implementations take common learning rate schedules (e.g., cyclical cosine schedules) and use them for low precision training without adequate comparisons to alternative scheduling options. We define a diverse suite of CPT schedules and analyze their performance across a variety of DNN training regimes, some of which are unexplored in the low precision training literature (e.g., node classification with graph neural networks). From these experiments, we discover alternative CPT schedules that offer further improvements in training efficiency and model performance, as well as derive a set of best practices for choosing CPT schedules. Going further, we find that a correlation exists between model performance and training cost, and that changing the underlying CPT schedule can control the tradeoff between these two variables. To explain the direct correlation between model performance and training cost, we draw a connection between quantized training and critical learning periods, suggesting that aggressive quantization is a form of learning impairment that can permanently damage model performance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
