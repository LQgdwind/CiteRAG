Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Adaptive Neural Network-Based Approximation to Accelerate Eulerian Fluid Simulation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. The Eulerian fluid simulation is an important HPC application. The neural network has been applied to accelerate it. The current methods that accelerate the fluid simulation with neural networks lack flexibility and generalization. In this paper, we tackle the above limitation and aim to enhance the applicability of neural networks in the Eulerian fluid simulation. We introduce Smart-fluidnet, a framework that automates model generation and application. Given an existing neural network as input, Smart-fluidnet generates multiple neural networks before the simulation to meet the execution time and simulation quality requirement. During the simulation, Smart-fluidnet dynamically switches the neural networks to make best efforts to reach the user’s requirement on simulation quality. Evaluating with 20,480 input problems, we show that Smart-fluidnet achieves 1.46x and 590x speedup comparing with a state-of-the-art neural network model and the original fluid simulation respectively on an NVIDIA Titan X Pascal GPU, while providing better simulation quality than the state-of-the-art model.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
