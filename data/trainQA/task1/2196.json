Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Fever Basketball: A Complex, Flexible, and Asynchronized Sports Game Environment for Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The development of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has benefited from the emergency of a variety type of game environments where new challenging problems are proposed and new algorithms can be tested safely and quickly, such as Board games, RTS, FPS, and MOBA games. However, many existing environments lack complexity and flexibility, and assume the actions are synchronously executed in multi-agent settings, which become less valuable. We introduce the Fever Basketball game, a novel reinforcement learning environment where agents are trained to play basketball game. It is a complex and challenging environment that supports multiple characters, multiple positions, and both the single-agent and multi-agent player control modes. In addition, to better simulate real-world basketball games, the execution time of actions differs among players, which makes Fever Basketball a novel asynchronized environment. We evaluate commonly used multi-agent algorithms of both independent learners and joint-action learners in three game scenarios with varying difficulties, and heuristically propose two baseline methods to diminish the extra non-stationarity brought by asynchronism in Fever Basketball Benchmarks. Besides, we propose an integrated curricula training (ICT) framework to better handle Fever Basketball problems, which includes several game-rule based cascading curricula learners and a coordination curricula switcher focusing on enhancing coordination within the team. The results show that the game remains challenging and can be used as a benchmark environment for studies like long-time horizon, sparse rewards, credit assignment, and non-stationarity, etc. in multi-agent settings.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 47\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
