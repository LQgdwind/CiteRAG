Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 60 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Modeling Player Personality Factors from In-Game Behavior and Affective Expression This work is funded by National Science Foundation (NSF), Division of Information and Intelligence Systems (IIS) under Grant Number 1355298 awarded to the project V-PAL: Virtual Personality Assessment Laboratory.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Developing a thorough understanding of the target audience (and/or single individuals) is a key factor for success - which is exceptionally important and powerful for the domain of video games that can not only benefit from informed decision making during development, but ideally even tailor game content, difficulty and player experience while playing. The granular assessment of individual personality and differences across players is a particularly difficult endeavor, given the highly variant human nature, disagreement in psychological background models and because of the effortful data collection that most often builds upon long, time-consuming and deterrent questionnaires. In this work, we explore possibilities to predict a series of player personality questionnaire metrics from recorded in-game behavior and extend related work by explicitly adding affective dialog decisions to the game environment which could elevate the model‚Äôs accuracy. Using random forest regression, we predicted a wide variety of personality metrics from seven established questionnaires across (n=62ùëõ62n=62) players over 60 minute gameplay of a customized version of the role-playing game Fallout: New Vegas. While some personality variables could already be identified from reasonable underlying in-game actions and affective expressions, we did not find ways to predict others or encountered questionable correlations that could not be justified by theoretical background literature. Yet, building on the initial opportunities of this explorative study, we are striving to massively enlarge our data set to players from an ecologically valid industrial game environment and investigate the performance of more sophisticated machine learning approaches.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper.
