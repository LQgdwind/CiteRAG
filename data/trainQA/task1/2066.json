Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Conservative Extensions in Horn Description Logics with Inverse Roles\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We investigate the decidability and computational complexity of conservative extensions and the related notions of inseparability and entailment in Horn description logics (DLs) with inverse roles. We consider both query conservative extensions, defined by requiring that the answers to all conjunctive queries are left unchanged, and deductive conservative extensions, which require that the entailed concept inclusions, role inclusions, and functionality assertions do not change. Upper bounds for query conservative extensions are particularly challenging because characterizations in terms of unbounded homomorphisms between universal models, which are the foundation of the standard approach to establishing decidability, fail in the presence of inverse roles. We resort to a characterization that carefully mixes unbounded and bounded homomorphisms and enables a decision procedure that combines tree automata and a mosaic technique. Our main results are that query conservative extensions are 2ExpTime-complete in all DLs between ℰ​ℒ​ℐℰℒℐ{\\cal E\\!\\!\\>LI} and Horn-𝒜​ℒ​𝒞​ℋ​ℐ​ℱ𝒜ℒ𝒞ℋℐℱ{\\cal ALCHIF} and between Horn-𝒜​ℒ​𝒞𝒜ℒ𝒞{\\cal ALC} and Horn-𝒜​ℒ​𝒞​ℋ​ℐ​ℱ𝒜ℒ𝒞ℋℐℱ{\\cal ALCHIF}, and that deductive conservative extensions are 2ExpTime-complete in all DLs between ℰ​ℒ​ℐℰℒℐ{\\cal E\\!\\!\\>LI} and ℰ​ℒ​ℋ​ℐ​ℱ⊥ℰℒℋℐsubscriptℱbottom{\\cal E\\!\\!\\>LHIF}_{\\!\\!\\!\\>\\bot}. The same results hold for inseparability and entailment.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
