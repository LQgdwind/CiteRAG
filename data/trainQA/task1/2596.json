Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Enhancing Human-Machine Teaming for Medical Prognosis Through Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs)\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Machine Learning (ML) has recently been demonstrated to rival expert-level human accuracy in prediction and detection tasks in a variety of domains, including medicine. Despite these impressive findings, however, a key barrier to the full realization of ML’s potential in medical prognoses is technology acceptance. Recent efforts to produce explainable AI (XAI) have made progress in improving the interpretability of some ML models, but these efforts suffer from limitations intrinsic to their design: they work best at identifying why a system fails, but do poorly at explaining when and why a model’s prediction is correct. We posit that the acceptability of ML predictions in expert domains is limited by two key factors: the machine’s horizon of prediction that extends beyond human capability, and the inability for machine predictions to incorporate human intuition into their models. We propose the use of a novel ML architecture, Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) to enhance human understanding and encourage acceptability. Our approach prioritizes human cognitive intuition at the center of the algorithm design, and offers a distribution of predictions rather than single outputs. We explain how this approach may significantly improve human-machine collaboration in prediction tasks in expert domains such as medical prognoses. We propose a model and demonstrate, by expanding a concrete example from the literature, how our model advances the vision of future hybrid Human-AI systems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
