Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Operator Splitting for Adaptive Radiation Therapy with Nonlinear Health Dynamics\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present an optimization-based approach to radiation treatment planning over time. Our approach formulates treatment planning as an optimal control problem with nonlinear patient health dynamics derived from the standard linear-quadratic cell survival model. As the formulation is nonconvex, we propose a method for obtaining an approximate solution by solving a sequence of convex optimization problems. This method is fast, efficient, and robust to model error, adapting readily to changes in the patientâ€™s health between treatment sessions. Moreover, we show that it can be combined with the operator splitting method ADMM to produce an algorithm that is highly scalable and can handle large clinical cases. We introduce an open-source Python implementation of our algorithm, AdaRad, and demonstrate its performance on several examples.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
