Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Multiple Instance Learning for Cheating Detection and Localization in Online Examinations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The spread of the Coronavirus disease-2019 epidemic has caused many courses and exams to be conducted online. The cheating behavior detection model in examination invigilation systems plays a pivotal role in guaranteeing the equality of long-distance examinations. However, cheating behavior is rare, and most researchers do not comprehensively take into account features such as head posture, gaze angle, body posture, and background information in the task of cheating behavior detection. In this paper, we develop and present CHEESE, a CHEating detection framework via multiplE inStancE learning. The framework consists of a label generator that implements weak supervision and a feature encoder to learn discriminative features. In addition, the framework combines body posture and background features extracted by 3D convolution with eye gaze, head posture and facial features captured by OpenFace 2.0. These features are fed into the spatio-temporal graph module by stitching to analyze the spatio-temporal changes in video clips to detect the cheating behaviors. Our experiments on three datasets, UCF-Crime, ShanghaiTech and Online Exam Proctoring (OEP), prove the effectiveness of our method as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, and obtain the frame-level AUC score of 87.58% on the OEP dataset.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 54\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
