We establish a qualitatively optimal upper bound on the size of ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-covers for S𝑆S, in the ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-norm. Roughly speaking, we show that there exists an ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-cover for S𝑆S of cardinality M=(k/ϵ)Od​(k1/d)𝑀superscript𝑘italic-ϵsubscript𝑂𝑑superscript𝑘1𝑑M=(k/\\epsilon)^{O_{d}(k^{1/d})}. Our result is constructive yielding an algorithm to compute such an ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-cover that runs in time poly​(M)poly𝑀\\mathrm{poly}(M). Building on our structural result, we obtain significantly improved learning algorithms for several fundamental high-dimensional probabilistic models with hidden variables. These include density and parameter estimation for k𝑘k-mixtures of spherical Gaussians (with known common covariance), PAC learning one-hidden-layer ReLU networks with k𝑘k hidden units (under the Gaussian distribution), density and parameter estimation for k𝑘k-mixtures of linear regressions (with Gaussian covariates), and parameter estimation for k𝑘k-mixtures of hyperplanes. Our algorithms run in time quasi-polynomial in the parameter k𝑘k. Previous algorithms for these problems had running times exponential in kΩ​(1)superscript𝑘Ω1k^{\\Omega(1)}. At a high-level our algorithms for all these learning problems work as follows: By computing the low-degree moments of the hidden parameters, we are able to find a vector space of polynomials that nearly vanish on the unknown parameters. Our structural result allows us to compute a quasi-polynomial sized cover for the set of hidden parameters, which we exploit in our learning algorithms.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
