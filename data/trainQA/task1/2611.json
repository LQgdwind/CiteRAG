Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Non-stationary Reinforcement Learning without Prior Knowledge: An Optimal Black-box Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We propose a black-box reduction that turns a certain reinforcement learning algorithm with optimal regret in a (near-)stationary environment into another algorithm with optimal dynamic regret in a non-stationary environment, importantly without any prior knowledge on the degree of non-stationarity. By plugging different algorithms into our black-box, we provide a list of examples showing that our approach not only recovers recent results for (contextual) multi-armed bandits achieved by very specialized algorithms, but also significantly improves the state of the art for (generalized) linear bandits, episodic MDPs, and infinite-horizon MDPs in various ways. Specifically, in most cases our algorithm achieves the optimal dynamic regret ùí™~‚Äã(min‚Å°{L‚ÄãT,Œî1/3‚ÄãT2/3})~ùí™ùêøùëásuperscriptŒî13superscriptùëá23\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\min\\{\\sqrt{LT},\\Delta^{\\nicefrac{{1}}{{3}}}T^{\\nicefrac{{2}}{{3}}}\\}) where TùëáT is the number of rounds and LùêøL and ŒîŒî\\Delta are the number and amount of changes of the world respectively, while previous works only obtain suboptimal bounds and/or require the knowledge of LùêøL and ŒîŒî\\Delta.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
