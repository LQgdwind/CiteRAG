      "content": "Paper Title: Metaball-Imaging Discrete Element Lattice Boltzmann Method for fluid-particle system of complex morphologies with settling case study\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Fluid-particle systems are highly sensitive to particle morphologies. While many attempts have been made on shape descriptors and coupling schemes, how to simulate the particle-particle and particle-fluid interactions with a balance between accuracy and efficiency is still a challenge, especially when complex-shaped particles are considered. This study presents a Metaball-Imaging (MI) based Discrete Element Lattice Boltzmann Method (DELBM) for fluid simulations with irregular shaped particles. The major innovation is the MI algorithm to capture the real grain shape for DELBM simulations, where the Metaball function is utilized as the mathematical representation due to its versatile and efficient expressiveness of complex shapes. The contact detection is tackled robustly by gradient calculation of the closest point with a Newton–Raphson based scheme. And the coupling with LBM is accomplished by a classic sharp-interface scheme. As for refiling, a local refiling algorithm based on the bounce back rule is implemented. Validations on three settling experiments of irregular-shaped natural cobblestones indicate the proposed model to be effective and powerful in probing micromechanics of irregular-shaped granular media immersed in fluid systems. The potential of this model on studies of shape-induced physical processes is further investigated with numerical examples on the ”drafting, kissing and tumbling” phenomenon of pair particles in various shapes.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
