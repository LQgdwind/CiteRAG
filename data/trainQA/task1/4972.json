Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

It is known that every n𝑛n-vertex graph admits a (2​k−1)2𝑘1(2k-1)-spanner with O​(n1+1/k)𝑂superscript𝑛11𝑘O(n^{1+1/k}) edges for k≥1𝑘1k\\geq 1. This bound is the best possible for 1≤k≤91𝑘91\\leq k\\leq 9 and is conjectured to be optimal due to Erdős’ girth conjecture. We study t𝑡t-spanners for t∈{2,3}𝑡23t\\in\\{2,3\\} for geometric intersection graphs in the plane. These spanners are also known as t𝑡t-hop spanners to emphasize the use of graph-theoretic distances (as opposed to Euclidean distances between the geometric objects or their centers). We obtain the following results: (1) Every n𝑛n-vertex unit disk graph (UDG) admits a 2-hop spanner with O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) edges; improving upon the previous bound of O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n). (2) The intersection graph of n𝑛n axis-aligned fat rectangles admits a 2-hop spanner with O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n) edges, and this bound is tight up to a factor of log⁡log⁡n𝑛\\log\\log n. (3) The intersection graph of n𝑛n fat convex bodies in the plane admits a 3-hop spanner with O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n) edges. (4) The intersection graph of n𝑛n axis-aligned rectangles admits a 3-hop spanner with O​(n​log2⁡n)𝑂𝑛superscript2𝑛O(n\\log^{2}n) edges.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 63 most likely reference titles for this paper.
