      "content": "Paper Title: Complexity Theory for Quantum Promise Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Quantum computing introduces many well-motivated problems rooted in physics, asking to compute information from input quantum states. Identifying the computational hardness of these problems yields potential applications with far-reaching impacts across both the realms of computer science and physics. However, these new problems do not neatly fit within the scope of existing complexity theory. The standard classes primarily cater to problems with classical inputs and outputs, leaving a gap to characterize problems involving quantum states as inputs. Notably, the emergence of new quantum cryptographic primitives is reshaping our understanding of the minimal assumption in cryptography, which directly affects the relationships between cryptography and complexity theory; in particular, the connection between Minicrypt and Pessiland in Impagliazzo‚Äôs five worlds view is somewhat unclear ‚Äî one reason for this is that breaking new quantum cryptographic primitives involves solving problems with quantum inputs, while the complexity classes central to Pessiland, Heuristica, and Algorithmica are grounded in problems with classical inputs and outputs. To bridge these knowledge gaps, we explore the complexity theory for quantum promise problems and potential applications. Quantum promise problems are quantum-input decision problems asking to identify whether input quantum states (that can be pure and mixed states) satisfy specific properties. In this work, we focus on complexity classes, p/mBQP, p/mQ(C)MA, p/mQSZKhvsubscriptp/mQSZKhv\\text{p/mQSZK}_{\\text{hv}}, p/mQIP, and p/mPSPACE, where ‚Äúp/mC‚Äù denotes the corresponding quantum promise complexity class with pure (p) or mixed (m) quantum input states for any classical complexity class C. We start with establishing the structural results of these classes, including natural complete problems, search-to-decision reduction, and relationships between complexity classes. Surprisingly, our results reveal relationships that differ from their classical counterparts, such as p/mQIP ‚â†\\neq p/mPSPACE and mcoQSZKhv‚â†mQSZKhvsubscriptmcoQSZKhvsubscriptmQSZKhv\\text{mcoQSZK}_{\\text{hv}}\\neq\\text{mQSZK}_{\\text{hv}}. Building on this framework, we show applications to cryptography, demonstrating that breaking one-way state generators and pseudorandom states, and EFI has mQCMA and mQSZKhvsubscriptmQSZKhv\\text{mQSZK}_{\\text{hv}} upper bounds, and that the average-case hardness of pQCZKhvsubscriptpQCZKhv\\text{pQCZK}_{\\text{hv}} implies the existence of EFI. Notably, our results offer new insights into Impagliazzo‚Äôs five worlds view. Roughly, by substituting classical complexity classes in Pessiland, Heuristica, and Algorithmica with mBQP and mQCMA or mQSZKhvsubscriptmQSZKhv\\text{mQSZK}_{\\text{hv}}, we establish a natural connection between quantum cryptography and quantum promise complexity theory. Finally, we extend our findings to quantum property testing and unitary synthesis, highlighting further applications of this new framework.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
