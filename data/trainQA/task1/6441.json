Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Task Agnostic Representation Consolidation: a Self-supervised based Continual Learning Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Continual learning (CL) over non-stationary data streams remains one of the long-standing challenges in deep neural networks (DNNs) as they are prone to catastrophic forgetting. CL models can benefit from self-supervised pre-training as it enables learning more generalizable task-agnostic features. However, the effect of self-supervised pre-training diminishes as the length of task sequences increases. Furthermore, the domain shift between pre-training data distribution and the task distribution reduces the generalizability of the learned representations. To address these limitations, we propose Task Agnostic Representation Consolidation (TARC)111Code can be found at: https://github.com/NeurAI-Lab/TARC., a two-stage training paradigm for CL that intertwines task-agnostic and task-specific learning whereby self-supervised training is followed by supervised learning for each task. To further restrict the deviation from the learned representations in the self-supervised stage, we employ a task-agnostic auxiliary loss during the supervised stage. We show that our training paradigm can be easily added to memory- or regularization-based approaches and provides consistent performance gain across more challenging CL settings. We further show that it leads to more robust and well-calibrated models.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
