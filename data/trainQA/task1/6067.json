Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: MDMLP: Image Classification from Scratch on Small Datasets with MLP\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The attention mechanism has become a go-to technique for natural language processing and computer vision tasks. Recently, the MLP-Mixer and other MLP-based architectures, based simply on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), are also powerful compared to CNNs and attention techniques and raises a new research direction. However, the high capability of the MLP-based networks severely relies on large volume of training data, and lacks of explanation ability compared to the Vision Transformer (ViT) or ConvNets. When trained on small datasets, they usually achieved inferior results than ConvNets. To resolve it, we present (i) multi-dimensional MLP (MDMLP), a conceptually simple and lightweight MLP-based architecture yet achieves SOTA when training from scratch on small-size datasets; (ii) multi-dimension MLP Attention Tool (MDAttnTool), a novel and efficient attention mechanism based on MLPs. Even without strong data augmentation, MDMLP achieves 90.90% accuracy on CIFAR10 with only 0.3M parameters, while the well-known MLP-Mixer achieves 85.45% with 17.1M parameters. In addition, the lightweight MDAttnTool highlights objects in images, indicating its explanation power. Our code is available at https://github.com/Amoza-Theodore/MDMLP.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
