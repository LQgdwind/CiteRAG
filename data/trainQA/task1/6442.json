Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: DiverGet: A Search-Based Software Testing Approach for Deep Neural Network Quantization Assessment\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Quantization is one of the most applied Deep Neural Network (DNN) compression strategies, when deploying a trained DNN model on an embedded system or a cell phone. This is owing to its simplicity and adaptability to a wide range of applications and circumstances, as opposed to specific Artificial Intelligence (AI) accelerators and compilers that are often designed only for certain specific hardware (e.g., Google Coral Edge TPU). With the growing demand for quantization, ensuring the reliability of this strategy is becoming a critical challenge. Traditional testing methods, which gather more and more genuine data for better assessment, are often not practical because of the large size of the input space and the high similarity between the original DNN and its quantized counterpart. As a result, advanced assessment strategies have become of paramount importance. In this paper, we present DiverGet, a search-based testing framework for quantization assessment. DiverGet defines a space of metamorphic relations that simulate naturally-occurring distortions on the inputs. Then, it optimally explores these relations to reveal the disagreements among DNNs of different arithmetic precision. We evaluate the performance of DiverGet on state-of-the-art DNNs applied to hyperspectral remote sensing images. We chose the remote sensing DNNs as they’re being increasingly deployed at the edge (e.g., high-lift drones) in critical domains like climate change research and astronomy. Our results show that DiverGet successfully challenges the robustness of established quantization techniques against naturally-occurring shifted data, and outperforms its most recent concurrent, DiffChaser, with a success rate that is (on average) four times higher.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
