Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Evolutionary Approximation of Ternary Neurons for On-sensor Printed Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Printed electronics offer ultra-low manufacturing costs and the potential for on-demand fabrication of flexible hardware. However, significant intrinsic constraints stemming from their large feature sizes and low integration density pose design challenges that hinder their practicality. In this work, we conduct a holistic exploration of printed neural network accelerators, starting from the analog-to-digital interface—a major area and power sink for sensor processing applications—and extending to networks of ternary neurons and their implementation. We propose bespoke ternary neural networks using approximate popcount and popcount-compare units, developed through a multi-phase evolutionary optimization approach and interfaced with sensors via customizable analog-to-binary converters. Our evaluation results show that the presented designs outperform the state of the art, achieving at least 6×\\times improvement in area and 19×\\times in power. To our knowledge, they represent the first open-source digital printed neural network classifiers capable of operating with existing printed energy harvesters.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
