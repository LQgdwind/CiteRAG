Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: DGTN: Dual-channel Graph Transition Network for Session-based Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The task of session-based recommendation is to predict user actions based on anonymous sessions. Recent research mainly models the target session as a sequence or a graph to capture item transitions within it, ignoring complex transitions between items in different sessions that have been generated by other users. These item transitions include potential collaborative information and reflect similar behavior patterns, which we assume may help with the recommendation for the target session. In this paper, we propose a novel method, namely Dual-channel Graph Transition Network (DGTN), to model item transitions within not only the target session but also the neighbor sessions. Specifically, we integrate the target session and its neighbor (similar) sessions into a single graph. Then the transition signals are explicitly injected into the embedding by channel-aware propagation. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DGTN outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis verifies the rationality of dual-channel item transition modeling, suggesting a potential future direction for session-based recommendation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
