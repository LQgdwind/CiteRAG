Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Geometric and computational hardness of bilevel programming\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We first show a simple but striking result in bilevel optimization: unconstrained C‚àûsuperscriptùê∂C^{\\infty} smooth bilevel programming is as hard as general extended-real-valued lower semicontinuous minimization. We then proceed to a worst-case analysis of box-constrained bilevel polynomial optimization. We show in particular that any extended-real-valued semi-algebraic function, possibly non-continuous, can be expressed as the value function of a polynomial bilevel program. Secondly, from a computational complexity perspective, the decision version of polynomial bilevel programming is one level above NP in the polynomial hierarchy (Œ£2psuperscriptsubscriptŒ£2ùëù\\Sigma_{2}^{p}-hard). Both types of difficulties are uncommon in non-linear programs for which objective functions are typically continuous and belong to the class NP. These results highlight the irremediable hardness attached to general bilevel optimization and the necessity of imposing some form of regularity on the lower level.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
