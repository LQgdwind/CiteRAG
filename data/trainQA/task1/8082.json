      "content": "Paper Title: An Iterative Classification and Semantic Segmentation Network for Old Landslide Detection Using High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The geological characteristics of old landslides can provide crucial information for the task of landslide protection. However, detecting old landslides from high-resolution remote sensing images (HRSIs) is of great challenges due to their partially or strongly transformed morphology over a long time and thus the limited difference with their surroundings. Additionally, small-sized datasets can restrict in-depth learning. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a new iterative classification and semantic segmentation network (ICSSN), which can significantly improve both object-level and pixel-level classification performance by iteratively upgrading the feature extraction module shared by the object classification and semantic segmentation networks. To improve the detection performance on small-sized datasets, object-level contrastive learning is employed in the object classification network featuring a siamese network to realize global features extraction, and a sub-object-level contrastive learning method is designed in the semantic segmentation network to efficiently extract salient features from boundaries of landslides. An iterative training strategy is also proposed to fuse features in the semantic space, further improving both the object-level and pixel-level classification performances. The proposed ICSSN is evaluated on a real-world landslide dataset, and experimental results show that it greatly improves both the classification and segmentation accuracy of old landslides. For the semantic segmentation task, compared to the baseline, the F1 score increases from 0.5054 to 0.5448, the mIoU improves from 0.6405 to 0.6610, the landslide IoU grows from 0.3381 to 0.3743, and the object-level detection accuracy of old landslides surges from 0.55 to 0.90. For the object classification task, the F1 score increases from 0.8846 to 0.9230, and the accuracy score is up from 0.8375 to 0.8875.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
