Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: On the Role of Memory in Robust Opinion Dynamics\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We investigate opinion dynamics in a fully-connected system, consisting of nùëõn identical and anonymous agents, where one of the opinions (which is called correct) represents a piece of information to disseminate. In more detail, one source agent initially holds the correct opinion and remains with this opinion throughout the execution. The goal for non-source agents is to quickly agree on this correct opinion, and do that robustly, i.e., from any initial configuration. The system evolves in rounds. In each round, one agent chosen uniformly at random is activated: unless it is the source, the agent pulls the opinions of ‚Ñì‚Ñì\\ell random agents and then updates its opinion according to some rule. We consider a restricted setting, in which agents have no memory and they only revise their opinions on the basis of those of the agents they currently sample. As restricted as it is, this setting encompasses very popular opinion dynamics, such as the voter model and best-of-kùëòk majority rules. Qualitatively speaking, we show that lack of memory prevents efficient convergence. Specifically, we prove that no dynamics can achieve correct convergence in an expected number of steps that is sub-quadratic in nùëõn, even under a strong version of the model in which activated agents have complete access to the current configuration of the entire system, i.e., the case ‚Ñì=n‚Ñìùëõ\\ell=n. Conversely, we prove that the simple voter model (in which ‚Ñì=1‚Ñì1\\ell=1) correctly solves the problem, while almost matching the aforementioned lower bound. These results suggest that, in contrast to symmetric consensus problems (that do not involve a notion of correct opinion), fast convergence on the correct opinion using stochastic opinion dynamics may indeed require the use of memory. This insight may reflect on natural information dissemination processes that rely on a few knowledgeable individuals.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
