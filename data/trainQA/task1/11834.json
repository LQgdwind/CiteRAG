      "content": "Paper Title: Parameterized Spanning Tree Congestion\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper we study the Spanning Tree Congestion problem, where we are given a graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) and are asked to find a spanning tree T𝑇T of minimum maximum congestion. Here, the congestion of an edge e∈T𝑒𝑇e\\in T is the number of edges u​v∈E𝑢𝑣𝐸uv\\in E such that the (unique) path from u𝑢u to v𝑣v in T𝑇T traverses e𝑒e. We consider this well-studied NP-hard problem from the point of view of (structural) parameterized complexity and obtain the following results: • We resolve a natural open problem by showing that Spanning Tree Congestion is not FPT parameterized by treewidth (under standard assumptions). More strongly, we present a generic reduction which applies to (almost) any parameter of the form “vertex-deletion distance to class 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}”, thus obtaining W[1]-hardness for parameters more restricted than treewidth, including tree-depth plus feedback vertex set, or incomparable to treewidth, such as twin cover. Via a slight tweak of the same reduction we also show that the problem is NP-complete on graphs of modular-width 444. • Even though it is known that Spanning Tree Congestion remains NP-hard on instances with only one vertex of unbounded degree, it is currently open whether the problem remains hard on bounded-degree graphs. We resolve this question by showing NP-hardness on graphs of maximum degree 888. • Complementing the problem’s W[1]-hardness for treewidth, we formulate an algorithm that runs in time roughly (k+w)𝒪​(w)superscript𝑘𝑤𝒪𝑤{(k+w)}^{\\mathcal{O}(w)}, where k𝑘k is the desired congestion and w𝑤w the treewidth, improving a previous argument for parameter k+w𝑘𝑤k+w that was based on Courcelle’s theorem. This explicit algorithm pays off in two ways: it allows us to obtain an FPT approximation scheme for parameter treewidth, that is, a (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-approximation running in time roughly (w/ε)𝒪​(w)superscript𝑤𝜀𝒪𝑤{(w/\\varepsilon)}^{\\mathcal{O}(w)}; and it leads to an exact FPT algorithm for parameter clique-width+k𝑘+k via a Win/Win argument. • Finally, motivated by the problem’s hardness for most standard structural parameters, we present FPT algorithms for several more restricted cases, namely, for the parameters vertex-deletion distance to clique; vertex integrity; and feedback edge set, in the latter case also achieving a single-exponential running time dependence on the parameter.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper.
