We propose and evaluate an Optically Connected Memory (OCM) architecture that disaggregates the main memory from the computation nodes in data centers. OCM is based on micro-ring resonators (MRRs), and it does not require any modification to the DRAM memory modules. We calculate energy consumption from real photonic devices and integrate them into a system simulator to evaluate performance. Our results show that (1) OCM is capable of interconnecting four DDR4 memory channels to a computing node using two fibers with 1.071.071.07 pJ energy-per-bit consumption and (2) OCM performs up to 5.5×\\times faster than a disaggregated memory with 40G PCIe NIC connectors to computing nodes.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 62 most likely reference titles for this paper.
