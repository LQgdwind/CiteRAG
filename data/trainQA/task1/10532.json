      "content": "Paper Title: The Category of Iterative Sets in Homotopy Type Theory and Univalent Foundations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract When working in Homotopy Type Theory and Univalent Foundations, the traditional role of the category of sets, 𝒮​ℯ​𝓉𝒮ℯ𝓉\\mathcal{Set}, is replaced by the category 𝒽​𝒮​ℯ​𝓉𝒽𝒮ℯ𝓉\\mathcal{hSet} of homotopy sets (h-sets); types with h-propositional identity types. Many of the properties of 𝒮​ℯ​𝓉𝒮ℯ𝓉\\mathcal{Set} hold for 𝒽​𝒮​ℯ​𝓉𝒽𝒮ℯ𝓉\\mathcal{hSet} ((co)completeness, exactness, local cartesian closure, etc.). Notably, however, the univalence axiom implies that 𝖮𝖻​𝒽​𝒮​ℯ​𝓉𝖮𝖻𝒽𝒮ℯ𝓉\\mathsf{Ob}\\,\\mathcal{hSet} is not itself an h-set, but an h-groupoid. This is expected in univalent foundations, but it is sometimes useful to also have a stricter universe of sets, for example when constructing internal models of type theory. In this work, we equip the type of iterative sets 𝖵0superscript𝖵0\\mathsf{V}^{0}, due to Gylterud, (2018) as a refinement of the pioneering work of Aczel, (1978) on universes of sets in type theory, with the structure of a Tarski universe and show that it satisfies many of the good properties of h-sets. In particular, we organize 𝖵0superscript𝖵0\\mathsf{V}^{0} into a (non-univalent strict) category and prove that it is locally cartesian closed. This enables us to organize it into a category with families with the structure necessary to model extensional type theory internally in HoTT/UF. We do this in a rather minimal univalent type theory with W-types, in particular we do not rely on any HITs, or other complex extensions of type theory. Furthermore, the construction of 𝖵0superscript𝖵0\\mathsf{V}^{0} and the model is fully constructive and predicative, while still being very convenient to work with as the decoding from 𝖵0superscript𝖵0\\mathsf{V}^{0} into h-sets commutes definitionally for all type constructors.
