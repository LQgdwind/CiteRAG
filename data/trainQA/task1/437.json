Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: On Tractable Representations of Binary Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We consider the compilation of a binary neural network’s decision function into tractable representations such as Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs) and Sentential Decision Diagrams (SDDs). Obtaining this function as an OBDD/SDD facilitates the explanation and formal verification of a neural network’s behavior. First, we consider the task of verifying the robustness of a neural network, and show how we can compute the expected robustness of a neural network, given an OBDD/SDD representation of it. Next, we consider a more efficient approach for compiling neural networks, based on a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for compiling a neuron. We then provide a case study in a handwritten digits dataset, highlighting how two neural networks trained from the same dataset can have very high accuracies, yet have very different levels of robustness. Finally, in experiments, we show that it is feasible to obtain compact representations of neural networks as SDDs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
