Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Vision-free Baseline for Multimodal Grammar Induction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Past work has shown that paired vision-language signals substantially improve grammar induction in multimodal datasets such as MSCOCO. We investigate whether advancements in large language models (LLMs) that are only trained with text could provide strong assistance for grammar induction in multimodal settings. We find that our text-only approach, an LLM-based C-PCFG (LC-PCFG), outperforms previous multi-modal methods, and achieves state-of-the-art grammar induction performance for various multimodal datasets. Compared to image-aided grammar induction, LC-PCFG outperforms the prior state-of-the-art by 7.97.97.9 Corpus-F1 points, with an 85%percent8585\\% reduction in parameter count and 1.7×1.7\\times faster training speed. Across three video-assisted grammar induction benchmarks, LC-PCFG outperforms prior state-of-the-art by up to 7.77.77.7 Corpus-F1, with 8.8×8.8\\times faster training. These results shed light on the notion that text-only language models might include visually grounded cues that aid in grammar induction in multimodal contexts. Moreover, our results emphasize the importance of establishing a robust vision-free baseline when evaluating the benefit of multimodal approaches.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
