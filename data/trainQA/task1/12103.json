Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Dual Prototyping with Domain and Class Prototypes for Affective Brain-Computer Interface in Unseen Target Conditions\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract EEG signals have emerged as a powerful tool in affective brain–computer interfaces, playing a crucial role in emotion recognition. However, current deep transfer learning-based methods for EEG recognition face challenges due to the reliance of both source and target data in model learning, which significantly affect model performance and generalization. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel framework (PL-DCP) and introduce the concepts of feature disentanglement and prototype inference. The dual prototyping mechanism incorporates both domain and class prototypes: domain prototypes capture individual variations across subjects, while class prototypes represent the ideal class distributions within their respective domains. Importantly, the proposed PL-DCP framework operates exclusively with source data during training, meaning that target data remains completely unseen throughout the entire process. To address label noise, we employ a pairwise learning strategy that encodes proximity relationships between sample pairs, effectively reducing the influence of mislabeled data. Experimental validation on the SEED and SEED-IV datasets demonstrates that PL-DCP, despite not utilizing target data during training, achieves performance comparable to deep transfer learning methods that require both source and target data. This highlights the potential of PL-DCP as an effective and robust approach for EEG-based emotion recognition.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
