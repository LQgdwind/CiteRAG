      "content": "Paper Title: Solving parametric systems of polynomial equations over the reals through Hermite matrices\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We design a new algorithm for solving parametric systems of equations having finitely many complex solutions for generic values of the parameters.

Under the assumptions that 𝒇𝒇{\\bm{f}} admits finitely many complex solutions when specializing 𝒚𝒚{\\bm{y}} to generic values and that the ideal generated by 𝒇𝒇{\\bm{f}} is radical, we solve the following algorithmic problem. On input 𝒇𝒇{\\bm{f}}, we compute semi-algebraic formulas defining open semi-algebraic sets 𝒮1,…,𝒮ℓsubscript𝒮1…subscript𝒮ℓ\\mathcal{S}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathcal{S}_{\\ell} in the parameters’ space ℝtsuperscriptℝ𝑡\\mathbb{R}^{t} such that ∪i=1ℓ𝒮isuperscriptsubscript𝑖1ℓsubscript𝒮𝑖\\cup_{i=1}^{\\ell}\\mathcal{S}_{i} is dense in ℝtsuperscriptℝ𝑡\\mathbb{R}^{t} and, for 1≤i≤ℓ1𝑖ℓ1\\leq i\\leq\\ell, the number of real points in 𝒱∩π−1​(η)𝒱superscript𝜋1𝜂{\\mathcal{V}}\\cap\\pi^{-1}({\\eta}) is invariant when η𝜂{\\eta} ranges over 𝒮isubscript𝒮𝑖\\mathcal{S}_{i}. This algorithm exploits special properties of some well chosen monomial bases in the quotient algebra ℚ​(𝒚)​[𝒙]/Iℚ𝒚delimited-[]𝒙𝐼\\mathbb{Q}({\\bm{y}})[{\\bm{x}}]/I where I⊂ℚ​(𝒚)​[𝒙]𝐼ℚ𝒚delimited-[]𝒙I\\subset\\mathbb{Q}({\\bm{y}})[{\\bm{x}}] is the ideal generated by 𝒇𝒇{\\bm{f}} in ℚ​(𝒚)​[𝒙]ℚ𝒚delimited-[]𝒙\\mathbb{Q}({\\bm{y}})[{\\bm{x}}] as well as the specialization property of the so-called Hermite matrices which represent Hermite’s quadratic forms. This allows us to obtain “compact” representations of the semi-algebraic sets 𝒮isubscript𝒮𝑖\\mathcal{S}_{i} by means of semi-algebraic formulas encoding the signature of a given symmetric matrix. When 𝒇𝒇{\\bm{f}} satisfies extra genericity assumptions (such as regularity), we use the theory of Gröbner bases to derive complexity bounds both on the number of arithmetic operations in ℚℚ\\mathbb{Q} and the degree of the output polynomials. More precisely, letting d𝑑d be the maximal degrees of the fisubscript𝑓𝑖f_{i}’s and 𝔇=n​(d−1)​dn𝔇𝑛𝑑1superscript𝑑𝑛\\mathfrak{D}=n(d-1)d^{n}, we prove that, on a generic input 𝒇=(f1,…,fn)𝒇subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑛{\\bm{f}}=(f_{1},\\ldots,f_{n}), one can compute those semi-algebraic formulas using O​~​((t+𝔇t)​ 23​t​n2​t+1​d3​n​t+2​(n+t)+1)𝑂~absentbinomial𝑡𝔇𝑡superscript23𝑡superscript𝑛2𝑡1superscript𝑑3𝑛𝑡2𝑛𝑡1O\\ {\\widetilde{\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ }}\\left(\\binom{t+\\mathfrak{D}}{t}\\ 2^{3t}\\ n^{2t+1}d^{3nt+2(n+t)+1}\\right) arithmetic operations in ℚℚ\\mathbb{Q} and that the polynomials involved in these formulas have degree bounded by 𝔇𝔇\\mathfrak{D}. We report on practical experiments which illustrate the efficiency of this algorithm, both on generic parametric systems and parametric systems coming from applications since it allows us to solve systems which were out of reach on the current state-of-the-art.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
