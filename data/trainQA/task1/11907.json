Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: On performance bounds for topology optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Topology optimization has matured to become a powerful engineering design tool that is capable of designing extraordinary structures and materials taking into account various physical phenomena. Despite the method’s great advancements in recent years, several unanswered questions remain. This paper takes a step towards answering one of the larger questions, namely: How far from the global optimum is a given topology optimized design? Typically this is a hard question to answer, as almost all interesting topology optimization problems are non-convex. Unfortunately, this non-convexity implies that local minima may plague the design space, resulting in optimizers ending up in suboptimal designs. In this work, we investigate performance bounds for topology optimization via a computational framework that utilizes Lagrange duality theory. This approach provides a viable measure of how \\sayclose a given design is to the global optimum for a subset of optimization formulations. The method’s capabilities are exemplified via several numerical examples, including the design of mode converters and resonating plates.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
