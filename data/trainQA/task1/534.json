This problem is also called top-mùëöm arm identifications in the literature of reinforcement learning, and has numerous applications. We study the problem in the collaborative learning model where we have multiple agents who can draw samples from the nùëõn distributions in parallel. Our goal is to characterize the tradeoffs between the running time of learning process and the number of rounds of interaction between agents, which is very expensive in various scenarios. We give optimal time-round tradeoffs, as well as demonstrate complexity separations between top-111 arm identification and top-mùëöm arm identifications for general mùëöm and between fixed-time and fixed-confidence variants. As a byproduct, we also give an algorithm for selecting the distribution with the mùëöm-th largest mean in the collaborative learning model.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper.
