Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Quality-Diversity Optimization through Diverse Quality Species\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. A prevalent limitation of optimizing over a single objective is that it can be misguided, becoming trapped in local optimum. This can be rectified by Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms, where a population of high-quality and diverse solutions to a problem is preferred. Most conventional QD approaches, for example, MAP-Elites, explicitly manage a behavioral archive where solutions are broken down into predefined niches. In this work, we show that a diverse population of solutions can be found without the limitation of needing an archive or defining the range of behaviors in advance. Instead, we break down solutions into independently evolving species and use unsupervised skill discovery to learn diverse, high-performing solutions. We show that this can be done through gradient-based mutations that take on an information theoretic perspective of jointly maximizing mutual information and performance. We propose Diverse Quality Species (DQS) as an alternative to archive-based QD algorithms. We evaluate it over several simulated robotic environments and show that it can learn a diverse set of solutions from varying species. Furthermore, our results show that DQS is more sample-efficient and performant when compared to other QD algorithms.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 44\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
