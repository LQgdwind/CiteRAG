Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 66 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Citizens at the forefront of the constitutional debate: Participation determinants and emergent content in Chile\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In the past few decades, constitution-making processes have shifted from closed elite writing to incorporating democratic mechanisms. Yet, little is known about democratic participation in deliberative constitution-making processes. Here, we study a deliberative constituent process held by the Chilean government between 2015 and 2016. The Chilean process had the highest level of citizen participation in the world (204,402204402204,402 people, i.e., 1.3%percent1.31.3\\% of the population) for such a process and covered 98%percent9898\\% of the national territory. In its participatory phase, people gathered in self-convoked groups of 10 to 30 members, and they collectively selected, deliberated, and wrote down an argument on why the new constitution should include those social rights. To understand the citizen participation drivers in this volunteer process, we first identify the determinants at the municipality level. We find the educational level, engagement in politics, support for the (left-wing) government, and Internet access increased participation. In contrast, population density and the share of evangelical Christians decreased participation. Moreover, we do not find evidence of political manipulation on citizen participation. In light of those determinants, we analyze the collective selection of social rights, and the content produced during the deliberative phase. The findings suggest that the knowledge embedded in cities, proxied using education levels and main economic activity, facilitates deliberation about themes, concepts, and ideas. These results can inform the organization of new deliberative processes that involve voluntary citizen participation, from citizen consultations to constitution-making processes.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 66 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 66\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
