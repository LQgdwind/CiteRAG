Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Approximate Degree Composition for Recursive Functions\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Determining the approximate degree composition for Boolean functions remains a significant unsolved problem in Boolean function complexity. In recent decades, researchers have concentrated on proving that approximate degree composes for special types of inner and outer functions. An important and extensively studied class of functions are the recursive functions, i.e. functions obtained by composing a base function with itself a number of times. Let hdsuperscript‚Ñéùëëh^{d} denote the standard dùëëd-fold composition of the base function h‚Ñéh. The main result of this work is to show that the approximate degree composes if either of the following conditions holds: ‚Ä¢ The outer function f:{0,1}n‚Üí{0,1}:ùëì‚Üísuperscript01ùëõ01f:\\{0,1\\}^{n}\\to\\{0,1\\} is a recursive function of the form hdsuperscript‚Ñéùëëh^{d}, with h‚Ñéh being any base function and d=Œ©‚Äã(log‚Å°log‚Å°n)ùëëŒ©ùëõd=\\Omega(\\log\\log n). ‚Ä¢ The inner function is a recursive function of the form hdsuperscript‚Ñéùëëh^{d}, with h‚Ñéh being any constant arity base function (other than AND and OR) and d=Œ©‚Äã(log‚Å°log‚Å°n)ùëëŒ©ùëõd=\\Omega(\\log\\log n), where nùëõn is the arity of the outer function. In terms of proof techniques, we first observe that the lower bound for composition can be obtained by introducing majority in between the inner and the outer functions. We then show that majority can be efficiently eliminated if the inner or outer function is a recursive function.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
