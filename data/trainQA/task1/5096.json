      "content": "Paper Title: Modeling Human Driver Interactions Using an Infinite Policy Space Through Gaussian Processes\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper proposes a method for modeling human driver interactions that relies on multi-output gaussian processes. The proposed method is developed as a refinement of the game theoretical hierarchical reasoning approach called \"level-kùëòk reasoning\" which conventionally assigns discrete levels of behaviors to agents. Although it is shown to be an effective modeling tool, the level-kùëòk reasoning approach may pose undesired constraints for predicting human decision making due to a limited number (usually 2 or 3) of driver policies it extracts. The proposed approach is put forward to fill this gap in the literature by introducing a continuous domain framework that enables an infinite policy space. By using the approach presented in this paper, more accurate driver models can be obtained, which can then be employed for creating high fidelity simulation platforms for the validation of autonomous vehicle control algorithms. The proposed method is validated on a real traffic dataset and compared with the conventional level-kùëòk approach to demonstrate its contributions and implications.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
