Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: DisenHCN: Disentangled Hypergraph Convolutional Networks for Spatiotemporal Activity Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Spatiotemporal activity prediction, aiming to predict user activities at a specific location and time, is crucial for applications like urban planning and mobile advertising. Existing solutions based on tensor decomposition or graph embedding suffer from the following two major limitations: 1) ignoring the fine-grained similarities of user preferences; 2) user’s modeling is entangled. In this work, we propose a hypergraph neural network model called DisenHCN (short for Disentangled Hypergraph Convolutional Networks) to bridge the above gaps. In particular, we first unify the fine-grained user similarity and the complex matching between user preferences and spatiotemporal activity into a heterogeneous hypergraph. We then disentangle the user representations into different aspects (location-aware, time-aware, and activity-aware) and aggregate corresponding aspect’s features on the constructed hypergraph, capturing high-order relations from different aspects and disentangles the impact of each aspect for final prediction. Extensive experiments show that our DisenHCN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 14.23% to 18.10% on four real-world datasets. Further studies also convincingly verify the rationality of each component in our DisenHCN.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
