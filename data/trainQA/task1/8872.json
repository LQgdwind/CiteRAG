Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Building Transportation Foundation Model via Generative Graph Transformer\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Efficient traffic management is crucial for maintaining urban mobility, especially in densely populated areas where congestion, accidents, and delays can lead to frustrating and expensive commutes. However, existing prediction methods face challenges in terms of optimizing a single objective and understanding the complex composition of the transportation system. Moreover, they lack the ability to understand the macroscopic system and cannot efficiently utilize big data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Transportation Foundation Model (TFM), which integrates the principles of traffic simulation into traffic prediction. TFM uses graph structures and dynamic graph generation algorithms to capture the participatory behavior and interaction of transportation system actors. This data-driven and model-free simulation method addresses the challenges faced by traditional systems in terms of structural complexity and model accuracy and provides a foundation for solving complex transportation problems with real data. The proposed approach shows promising results in accurately predicting traffic outcomes in an urban transportation setting.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
