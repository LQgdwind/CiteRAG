      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Model Diverse Driving Behaviors in Highly Interactive Autonomous Driving Scenarios with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Autonomous vehicles trained through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) have shown impressive results in many driving scenarios. However, the performance of these trained policies can be impacted when faced with diverse driving styles and personalities, particularly in highly interactive situations. This is because conventional MARL algorithms usually operate under the assumption of fully cooperative behavior among all agents and focus on maximizing team rewards during training. To address this issue, we introduce the Personality Modeling Network (PeMN), which includes a cooperation value function and personality parameters to model the varied interactions in high-interactive scenarios. The PeMN also enables the training of a background traffic flow with diverse behaviors, thereby improving the performance and generalization of the ego vehicle. Our extensive experimental studies, which incorporate different personality parameters in high-interactive driving scenarios, demonstrate that the personality parameters effectively model diverse driving styles and that policies trained with PeMN demonstrate better generalization compared to traditional MARL methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
