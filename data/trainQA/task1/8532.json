Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: CP-CNN: Core-Periphery Principle Guided Convolutional Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The evolution of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be largely attributed to the design of its architecture, i.e., the network wiring pattern. Neural architecture search (NAS) advances this by automating the search for the optimal network architecture, but the resulting network instance may not generalize well in different tasks. To overcome this, exploring network design principles that are generalizable across tasks is a more practical solution. In this study, We explore a novel brain-inspired design principle based on the core-periphery property of the human brain network to guide the design of CNNs. Our work draws inspiration from recent studies suggesting that artificial and biological neural networks may have common principles in optimizing network architecture. We implement the core-periphery principle in the design of network wiring patterns and the sparsification of the convolution operation. The resulting core-periphery principle guided CNNs (CP-CNNs) are evaluated on three different datasets. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority compared to CNNs and ViT-based methods. Overall, our work contributes to the growing field of brain-inspired AI by incorporating insights from the human brain into the design of neural networks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
