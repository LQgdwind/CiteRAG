Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: OAG-BERT: Towards A Unified Backbone Language Model For Academic Knowledge Services\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Academic knowledge services have substantially facilitated the development of the science enterprise by providing a plenitude of efficient research tools. However, many applications highly depend on ad-hoc models and expensive human labeling to understand scientific contents, hindering deployments into real products. To build a unified backbone language model for different knowledge-intensive academic applications, we pre-train an academic language model OAG-BERT that integrates both the heterogeneous entity knowledge and scientific corpora in the Open Academic Graph (OAG)—the largest public academic graph to date. In OAG-BERT, we develop strategies for pre-training text and entity data along with zero-shot inference techniques. OAG-BERT achieves outperformance over baselines on nine academic tasks including two demo applications, demonstrating its potential to serve as one foundation model for academic knowledge services. Its zero-shot capability furthers the path to mitigate the need of expensive annotations. OAG-BERT has been deployed for real-world applications, such as the reviewer recommendation function for National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC)—one of the largest funding agencies in China—and paper tagging in AMiner (https://www.aminer.cn). All codes and pre-trained models are available via the CogDL toolkit111https://github.com/thudm/oag-bert..\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 57\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
