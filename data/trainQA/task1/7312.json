Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Outcome-Oriented Prescriptive Process Monitoring Based on Temporal Logic Patterns\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Background – Prescriptive Process Monitoring systems aim at recommending, during the execution of a business process, interventions that, if followed, prevent poor performance of the process. Such interventions have to be i) reliable: they have to guarantee the achievement of the desired outcome or performance and ii) flexible: they cannot overturn the normal process execution. Problem – Most of the Prescriptive Process Monitoring solutions perform well in terms of recommendation reliability but provide the users with recommendations expressed in terms of specific activities that have to be executed without caring about their feasibility. Method – We propose a new Outcome-Oriented Prescriptive Process Monitoring system recommending temporal relations among activities that have to be guaranteed during the process execution. The proposed system is based on a Machine Learning model that learns the correlations between temporal relations among activities and the (positive) outcome of the process. Then, given the prefix of an ongoing process, the model is queried to return the most promising recommendations. Contribution – The main contribution is that the proposed system softens the mandatory execution of an activity at a given point in time, thus leaving more freedom to the user in deciding the interventions to put in place. This is achieved by providing recommendations that are expressed as Linear Temporal Logic formulas over activities. Results – The proposed system has been widely assessed using a pool of 22 real-life datasets. The results demonstrate the reliability of the provided recommendations by achieving an F1 score higher than 90% on 18 datasets out of 22.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
