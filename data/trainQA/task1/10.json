Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Human-robot co-manipulation of extended objects: Data-driven models and control from analysis of human-human dyads\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Human teams are able to easily perform collaborative manipulation tasks. However, for a robot and human to simultaneously manipulate an extended object is a difficult task using existing methods from the literature. Our approach in this paper is to use data from human-human dyad experiments to determine motion intent which we use for a physical human-robot co-manipulation task. We first present and analyze data from human-human dyads performing co-manipulation tasks. We show that our human-human dyad data has interesting trends including that interaction forces are non-negligible compared to the force required to accelerate an object and that the beginning of a lateral movement is characterized by distinct torque triggers from the leader of the dyad. We also examine different metrics to quantify performance of different dyads. We also develop a deep neural network based on motion data from human-human trials to predict human intent based on past motion. We then show how force and motion data can be used as a basis for robot control in a human-robot dyad. Finally, we compare the performance of two controllers for human-robot co-manipulation to human-human dyad performance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
