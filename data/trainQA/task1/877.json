Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: The Art of CPU-Pinning: Evaluating and Improving the Performance of Virtualization and Containerization Platforms\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Cloud providers offer a variety of execution platforms in form of bare-metal, VM, and containers. However, due to the pros and cons of each execution platform, choosing the appropriate platform for a specific cloud-based application has become a challenge for solution architects. The possibility to combine these platforms (e.g., deploying containers within VMs) offers new capacities that makes the challenge even further complicated. However, there is a little study in the literature on the pros and cons of deploying different application types on various execution platforms. In particular, evaluation of diverse hardware configurations and different CPU provisioning methods, such as CPU pinning, have not been sufficiently studied in the literature. In this work, the performance overhead of container, VM, and bare-metal execution platforms are measured and analyzed for four categories of real-world applications, namely video processing, parallel processing (MPI), web processing, and No-SQL, respectively representing CPU intensive, parallel processing, and two IO intensive processes. Our analyses reveal a set of interesting and sometimes counterintuitive findings that can be used as best practices by the solution architects to efficiently deploy cloud-based applications. Here are some notable mentions: (A) Under specific circumstances, containers can impose a higher overhead than VMs; (B) Containers on top of VMs can mitigate the overhead of VMs for certain applications; (C) Containers with a large number of cores impose a lower overhead than those with a few cores.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 49\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
