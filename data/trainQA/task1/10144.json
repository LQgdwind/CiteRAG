      "content": "Paper Title: Predicting Infant Brain Connectivity with Federated Multi-Trajectory GNNs using Scarce Data\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The understanding of the convoluted evolution of infant brain networks during the first postnatal year is pivotal for identifying the dynamics of early brain connectivity development. Thanks to the valuable insights into the brain’s anatomy, existing deep learning frameworks focused on forecasting the brain evolution trajectory from a single baseline observation. While yielding remarkable results, they suffer from three major limitations. First, they lack the ability to generalize to multi-trajectory prediction tasks, where each graph trajectory corresponds to a particular imaging modality or connectivity type (e.g., T1-w MRI). Second, existing models require extensive training datasets to achieve satisfactory performance which are often challenging to obtain. Third, they do not efficiently utilize incomplete time series data. To address these limitations, we introduce FedGmTE-Net++, a federated graph-based multi-trajectory evolution network. Using the power of federation, we aggregate local learnings among diverse hospitals with limited datasets. As a result, we enhance the performance of each hospital’s local generative model, while preserving data privacy. The three key innovations of FedGmTE-Net++ are: (i) presenting the first federated learning framework specifically designed for brain multi-trajectory evolution prediction in a data-scarce environment, (ii) incorporating an auxiliary regularizer in the local objective function to exploit all the longitudinal brain connectivity within the evolution trajectory and maximize data utilization, (iii) introducing a two-step imputation process, comprising a preliminary KNN-based precompletion followed by an imputation refinement step that employs regressors to improve similarity scores and refine imputations. Our comprehensive experimental results showed the outperformance of FedGmTE-Net++ in brain multi-trajectory prediction from a single baseline graph in comparison with benchmark methods. Our source code is available at https://github.com/basiralab/FedGmTE-Net-plus.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
