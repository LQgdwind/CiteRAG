Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Convex Influences\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We introduce a new notion of influence for symmetric convex sets over Gaussian space, which we term ‚Äúconvex influence‚Äù. We show that this new notion of influence shares many of the familiar properties of influences of variables for monotone Boolean functions f:{¬±1}n‚Üí{¬±1}.:ùëìsuperscriptplus-or-minus1ùëõ‚Üíplus-or-minus1f\\mathrel{\\mathop{\\mathchar 58\\relax}}\\{\\pm 1\\}^{n}\\to\\{\\pm 1\\}. Our main results for convex influences give Gaussian space analogues of many important results on influences for monotone Boolean functions. These include (robust) characterizations of extremal functions, the Poincar√© inequality, the Kahn-Kalai-Linial theorem [KKL88], a sharp threshold theorem of Kalai [Kal04], a stability version of the Kruskal-Katona theorem due to O‚ÄôDonnell and Wimmer [OW09], and some partial results towards a Gaussian space analogue of Friedgut‚Äôs junta theorem [Fri98]. The proofs of our results for convex influences use very different techniques than the analogous proofs for Boolean influences over {¬±1}nsuperscriptplus-or-minus1ùëõ\\{\\pm 1\\}^{n}. Taken as a whole, our results extend the emerging analogy between symmetric convex sets in Gaussian space and monotone Boolean functions from {¬±1}nsuperscriptplus-or-minus1ùëõ\\{\\pm 1\\}^{n} to {¬±1}.plus-or-minus1\\{\\pm 1\\}.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
