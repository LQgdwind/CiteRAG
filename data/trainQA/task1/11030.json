Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Vision-and-Language Pre-training with Text-Relevant Image Patch Selection\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become increasingly popular in large-scale Vision and Language Pre-training (VLP) models. Although previous VLP research has demonstrated the efficacy of ViTs, these efforts still struggle with computational inefficiencies caused by lengthy visual sequences. To address this challenge, we introduce an efficient VLP approach called TRIPS, which stands for Text-Relevant Image Patch Selection. TRIPS progressively reduces the visual sequence using a text-guided patch-selection layer in the visual backbone, thereby accelerating both training and inference processes. This patch-selection layer dynamically computes text-dependent visual attention, enabling it to identify attentive image tokens with text guidance and fuse inattentive ones in an end-to-end fashion. Importantly, TRIPS does not add any extra parameters and generalizes to most ViT-based VLP models. We incorporate TRIPS into three representative VLP models covering single-stream, dual-stream, and generative paradigms, and conduct extensive experiments on five widely-used multi-modal benchmark datasets. Our experimental results reveal that TRIPS delivers a 40% speedup, while maintaining competitive or superior performance on downstream tasks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 61\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
