Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 62 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: CLOCR-C: Context Leveraging OCR Correction with Pre-trained Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The digitisation of historical print media archives is crucial for increasing accessibility to contemporary records. However, the process of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) used to convert physical records to digital text is prone to errors, particularly in the case of newspapers and periodicals due to their complex layouts. This paper introduces Context Leveraging OCR Correction (CLOCR-C), which utilises the infilling and context-adaptive abilities of transformer-based language models (LMs) to improve OCR quality. The study aims to determine if LMs can perform post-OCR correction, improve downstream NLP tasks, and the value of providing the socio-cultural context as part of the correction process. Experiments were conducted using seven LMs on three datasets: the 19th Century Serials Edition (NCSE) and two datasets from the Overproof collection. The results demonstrate that some LMs can significantly reduce error rates, with the top-performing model achieving over a 60% reduction in character error rate on the NCSE dataset. The OCR improvements extend to downstream tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition, with increased Cosine Named Entity Similarity. Furthermore, the study shows that providing socio-cultural context in the prompts improves performance, while misleading prompts lower performance. In addition to the findings, this study releases a dataset of 91 transcribed articles from the NCSE, containing a total of 40 thousand words, to support further research in this area. The findings suggest that CLOCR-C is a promising approach for enhancing the quality of existing digital archives by leveraging the socio-cultural information embedded in the LMs and the text requiring correction.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 62 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
