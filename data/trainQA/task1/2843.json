Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Simulation Studies on Deep Reinforcement Learning for Building Control with Human Interaction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The building sector consumes the largest energy in the world, and there have been considerable research interests in energy consumption and comfort management of buildings. Inspired by recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL), this paper aims at assessing the potential of RL in building climate control problems with occupant interaction. We apply a recent RL approach, called DDPG (deep deterministic policy gradient), for the continuous building control tasks and assess its performance with simulation studies in terms of its ability to handle (a) the partial state observability due to sensor limitations; (b) complex stochastic system with high-dimensional state-spaces, which are jointly continuous and discrete; (c) uncertainties due to ambient weather conditions, occupant’s behavior, and comfort feelings. Especially, the partial observability and uncertainty due to the occupant interaction significantly complicate the control problem. Through simulation studies, the policy learned by DDPG demonstrates reasonable performance and computational tractability.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
