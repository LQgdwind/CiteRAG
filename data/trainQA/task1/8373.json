      "content": "Paper Title: Does Sparsity Help in Learning Misspecified Linear Bandits?\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recently, the study of linear misspecified bandits has generated intriguing implications of the hardness of learning in bandits and reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, Du et al. (2020) show that even if a learner is given linear features in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} that approximate the rewards in a bandit or RL with a uniform error of ε𝜀\\varepsilon, searching for an O​(ε)𝑂𝜀O(\\varepsilon)-optimal action requires pulling at least Ω​(exp⁡(d))Ω𝑑\\Omega(\\exp(d)) queries. Furthermore, Lattimore et al. (2020) show that a degraded O​(ε​d)𝑂𝜀𝑑O(\\varepsilon\\sqrt{d})-optimal solution can be learned within poly⁡(d/ε)poly𝑑𝜀\\operatorname{poly}(d/\\varepsilon) queries. Yet it is unknown whether a structural assumption on the ground-truth parameter, such as sparsity, could break the ε​d𝜀𝑑\\varepsilon\\sqrt{d} barrier. In this paper, we address this question by showing that algorithms can obtain O​(ε)𝑂𝜀O(\\varepsilon)-optimal actions by querying O​(ε−s​ds)𝑂superscript𝜀𝑠superscript𝑑𝑠O(\\varepsilon^{-s}d^{s}) actions, where s𝑠s is the sparsity parameter, removing the exp⁡(d)𝑑\\exp(d)-dependence. We then establish information-theoretical lower bounds, i.e., Ω​(exp⁡(s))Ω𝑠\\Omega(\\exp(s)), to show that our upper bound on sample complexity is nearly tight if one demands an error O​(sδ​ε)𝑂superscript𝑠𝛿𝜀O(s^{\\delta}\\varepsilon) for 0<δ<10𝛿10<\\delta<1. For δ≥1𝛿1\\delta\\geq 1, we further show that poly⁡(s/ε)poly𝑠𝜀\\operatorname{poly}(s/\\varepsilon) queries are possible when the linear features are “good” and even in general settings. These results provide a nearly complete picture of how sparsity can help in misspecified bandit learning and provide a deeper understanding of when linear features are “useful” for bandit and reinforcement learning with misspecification.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
