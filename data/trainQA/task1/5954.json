Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Reliable Offline Model-based Optimization for Industrial Process Control\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. In the research area of offline model-based optimization, novel and promising methods are frequently developed. However, implementing such methods in real-world industrial systems such as production lines for process control is oftentimes a frustrating process. In this work, we address two important problems to extend the current success of offline model-based optimization to industrial process control problems: 1) how to learn a reliable dynamics model from offline data for industrial processes? 2) how to learn a reliable but not over-conservative control policy from offline data by utilizing existing model-based optimization algorithms? Specifically, we propose a dynamics model based on ensemble of conditional generative adversarial networks to achieve accurate reward calculation in industrial scenarios. Furthermore, we propose an epistemic-uncertainty-penalized reward evaluation function which can effectively avoid giving over-estimated rewards to out-of-distribution inputs during the learning/searching of the optimal control policy. We provide extensive experiments with the proposed method on two representative cases (a discrete control case and a continuous control case), showing that our method compares favorably to several baselines in offline policy learning for industrial process control.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
