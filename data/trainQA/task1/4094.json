      "content": "Paper Title: Continuous-Time Sequential Recommendation with Temporal Graph Collaborative Transformer\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. In order to model the evolution of user preference, we should learn user/item embeddings based on time-ordered item purchasing sequences, which is defined as Sequential Recommendation (SR) problem. Existing methods leverage sequential patterns to model item transitions. However, most of them ignore crucial temporal collaborative signals, which are latent in evolving user-item interactions and coexist with sequential patterns. Therefore, we propose to unify sequential patterns and temporal collaborative signals to improve the quality of recommendation, which is rather challenging. Firstly, it is hard to simultaneously encode sequential patterns and collaborative signals. Secondly, it is non-trivial to express the temporal effects of collaborative signals. Hence, we design a new framework Temporal Graph Sequential Recommender (TGSRec) upon our defined continuous-time bipartite graph. We propose a novel Temporal Collaborative Transformer (TCT) layer in TGSRec, which advances the self-attention mechanism by adopting a novel collaborative attention. TCT layer can simultaneously capture collaborative signals from both users and items, as well as considering temporal dynamics inside sequential patterns. We propagate the information learned from TCT layer over the temporal graph to unify sequential patterns and temporal collaborative signals. Empirical results on five datasets show that TGSRec significantly outperforms other baselines, in average up to 22.5%percent22.522.5\\% and 22.1%percent22.122.1\\% absolute improvements in Recall@101010 and MRR, respectively.
