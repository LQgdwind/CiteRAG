Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data.

      "content": "Paper Title: Trading Determinism for Noncommutativity in Edmonds’ Problem\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Let X=X1⊔X2⊔…⊔Xk𝑋square-unionsubscript𝑋1subscript𝑋2…subscript𝑋𝑘X=X_{1}\\sqcup X_{2}\\sqcup\\ldots\\sqcup X_{k} be a partitioned set of variables such that the variables in each part Xisubscript𝑋𝑖X_{i} are noncommuting but for any i≠j𝑖𝑗i\\neq j, the variables x∈Xi𝑥subscript𝑋𝑖x\\in X_{i} commute with the variables x′∈Xjsuperscript𝑥′subscript𝑋𝑗x^{\\prime}\\in X_{j}. Given as input a square matrix T𝑇T whose entries are linear forms over ℚ​⟨X⟩ℚdelimited-⟨⟩𝑋\\mathds{Q}\\langle X\\rangle, we consider the problem of checking if T𝑇T is invertible or not over the universal skew field of fractions of the partially commutative polynomial ring ℚ​⟨X⟩ℚdelimited-⟨⟩𝑋\\mathds{Q}\\langle X\\rangle [KVV20]. In this paper, we design a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for this problem for constant k𝑘k. The special case k=1𝑘1k=1 is the noncommutative Edmonds’ problem (NSingularNSingular\\operatorname{\\rm{\\textsc{NSingular}}}) which has a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm by recent results [GGdOW16, IQS18, HH21]. En-route, we obtain the first deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for the equivalence testing problem of k𝑘k-tape weighted automata (for constant k𝑘k) resolving a long-standing open problem [HK91, Wor13]. Algebraically, the equivalence problem reduces to testing whether a partially commutative rational series over the partitioned set X𝑋X is zero or not [Wor13]. Decidability of this problem was established by Harju and Karhumäki [HK91]. Prior to this work, a randomized polynomial-time algorithm for this problem was given by Worrell [Wor13] and, subsequently, a deterministic quasipolynomial-time algorithm was also developed [ACDM21].\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
