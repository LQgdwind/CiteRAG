Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: On the Global Convergence of Fitted Q-Iteration with Two-layer Neural Network Parametrization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep Q-learning based algorithms have been applied successfully in many decision making problems, while their theoretical foundations are not as well understood. In this paper, we study a Fitted Q-Iteration with two-layer ReLU neural network parameterization, and find the sample complexity guarantees for the algorithm. Our approach estimates the Q-function in each iteration using a convex optimization problem. We show that this approach achieves a sample complexity of ùí™~‚Äã(1/œµ2)~ùí™1superscriptitalic-œµ2\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\epsilon^{2}), which is order-optimal. This result holds for a countable state-spaces and does not require any assumptions such as a linear or low rank structure on the MDP.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
