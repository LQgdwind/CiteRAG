      "content": "Paper Title: RAVSS: Robust Audio-Visual Speech Separation in Multi-Speaker Scenarios with Missing Visual Cues\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. While existing Audio-Visual Speech Separation (AVSS) methods primarily concentrate on the audio-visual fusion strategy for two-speaker separation, they demonstrate a severe performance drop in the multi-speaker separation scenarios. Typically, AVSS methods employ guiding videos to sequentially isolate individual speakers from the given audio mixture, resulting in notable missing and noisy parts across various segments of the separated speech. In this study, we propose a simultaneous multi-speaker separation framework that can facilitate the concurrent separation of multiple speakers within a singular process. We introduce speaker-wise interactions to establish distinctions and correlations among speakers. Experimental results on the VoxCeleb2 and LRS3 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in separating mixtures with 2, 3, 4, and 5 speakers, respectively. Additionally, our model can utilize speakers with complete audio-visual information to mitigate other visual-deficient speakers, thereby enhancing its resilience to missing visual cues. We also conduct experiments where visual information for specific speakers is entirely absent or visual frames are partially missing. The results demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms others, exhibiting the smallest performance drop across all settings involving 2, 3, 4, and 5 speakers. Code is available at https://github.com/pantianrui/RAVSS.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
