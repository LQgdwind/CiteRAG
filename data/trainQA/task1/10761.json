Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data.

      "content": "Paper Title: Automated Design and Optimization of Distributed Filtering Circuits via Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Designing distributed filtering circuits (DFCs) is complex and time-consuming, with the circuit performance relying heavily on the expertise and experience of electronics engineers. However, manual design methods tend to have exceedingly low-efficiency. This study proposes a novel end-to-end automated method for fabricating circuits to improve the design of DFCs. The proposed method harnesses reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, eliminating the dependence on the design experience of engineers. Thus, it significantly reduces the subjectivity and constraints associated with circuit design. The experimental findings demonstrate clear improvements in both design efficiency and quality when comparing the proposed method with traditional engineer-driven methods. In particular, the proposed method achieves superior performance when designing complex or rapidly evolving DFCs. Furthermore, compared to existing circuit automation design techniques, the proposed method demonstrates superior design efficiency, highlighting the substantial potential of RL in circuit design automation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
