Preliminary versions of this paper appeared in [27] and [22].\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The cut-set ∂(S)𝑆\\partial(S) of a graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) is the set of edges that have one endpoint in S⊂V𝑆𝑉S\\subset V and the other endpoint in V∖S𝑉𝑆V\\setminus S, and whenever G​[S]𝐺delimited-[]𝑆G[S] is connected, the cut [S,V∖S]𝑆𝑉𝑆[S,V\\setminus S] of G𝐺G is called a connected cut. A bond of a graph G𝐺G is an inclusion-wise minimal disconnecting set of G𝐺G, i.e., bonds are cut-sets that determine cuts [S,V∖S]𝑆𝑉𝑆[S,V\\setminus S] of G𝐺G such that G​[S]𝐺delimited-[]𝑆G[S] and G​[V∖S]𝐺delimited-[]𝑉𝑆G[V\\setminus S] are both connected. Contrasting with a large number of studies related to maximum cuts, there exist very few results regarding the largest bond of general graphs. In this paper, we aim to reduce this gap on the complexity of computing the largest bond, and the maximum connected cut of a graph. Although cuts and bonds are similar, we remark that computing the largest bond and the maximum connected cut of a graph tends to be harder than computing its maximum cut. We show that it does not exist a constant-factor approximation algorithm to compute the largest bond, unless P=NPPNP\\mbox{P}=\\mbox{NP}. Also, we show that Largest Bond and Maximum Connected Cut are NP-hard even for planar bipartite graphs, whereas Maximum Cut is trivial on bipartite graphs and polynomial-time solvable on planar graphs. In addition, we show that Largest Bond and Maximum Connected Cut are NP-hard on split graphs, and restricted to graphs of clique-width w𝑤w they can not be solved in time f​(w)×no​(w)𝑓𝑤superscript𝑛𝑜𝑤f(w)\\times n^{o(w)} unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails, but they can be solved in time f​(w)×nO​(w)𝑓𝑤superscript𝑛𝑂𝑤f(w)\\times n^{O(w)}. Finally, we show that both problems are fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the size of the solution, the treewidth, and the twin-cover number.
