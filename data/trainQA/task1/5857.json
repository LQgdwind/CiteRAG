Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: MUTR3D: A Multi-camera Tracking Framework via 3D-to-2D Queries\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Accurate and consistent 3D tracking from multiple cameras is a key component in a vision-based autonomous driving system. It involves modeling 3D dynamic objects in complex scenes across multiple cameras. This problem is inherently challenging due to depth estimation, visual occlusions, appearance ambiguity, etc. Moreover, objects are not consistently associated across time and cameras. To address that, we propose an end-to-end MUlti-camera TRacking framework called MUTR3D. In contrast to prior works, MUTR3D does not explicitly rely on the spatial and appearance similarity of objects. Instead, our method introduces 3D track query to model spatial and appearance coherent track for each object that appears in multiple cameras and multiple frames. We use camera transformations to link 3D trackers with their observations in 2D images. Each tracker is further refined according to the features that are obtained from camera images. MUTR3D uses a set-to-set loss to measure the difference between the predicted tracking results and the ground truths. Therefore, it does not require any post-processing such as non-maximum suppression and/or bounding box association. MUTR3D outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5.3 AMOTA on the nuScenes dataset. Code is available at: https://github.com/a1600012888/MUTR3D.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 49\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
