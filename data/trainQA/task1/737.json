Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Interpretable Deep Learning Models for Knowledge Tracing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract As an important technique for modeling the knowledge states of learners, the traditional knowledge tracing (KT) models have been widely used to support intelligent tutoring systems and MOOC platforms. Driven by the fast advancements of deep learning techniques, deep neural network has been recently adopted to design new KT models for achieving better prediction performance. However, the lack of interpretability of these models has painfully impeded their practical applications, as their outputs and working mechanisms suffer from the intransparent decision process and complex inner structures. We thus propose to adopt the post-hoc method to tackle the interpretability issue for deep learning based knowledge tracing (DLKT) models. Specifically, we focus on applying the layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) method to interpret RNN-based DLKT model by backpropagating the relevance from the model’s output layer to its input layer. The experiment results show the feasibility using the LRP method for interpreting the DLKT model’s predictions, and partially validate the computed relevance scores from both question level and concept level. We believe it can be a solid step towards fully interpreting the DLKT models and promote their practical applications in the education domain.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
