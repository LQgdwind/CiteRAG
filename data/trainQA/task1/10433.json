      "content": "Paper Title: Genetic-based Constraint Programming for Resource Constrained Job Scheduling\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Resource constrained job scheduling is a hard combinatorial optimisation problem that originates in the mining industry. Off-the-shelf solvers cannot solve this problem satisfactorily in reasonable timeframes, while other solution methods such as many evolutionary computation methods and matheuristics cannot guarantee optimality and require low-level customisation and specialised heuristics to be effective. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a genetic programming algorithm to discover efficient search strategies of constraint programming for resource-constrained job scheduling. In the proposed algorithm, evolved programs represent variable selectors to be used in the search process of constraint programming, and their fitness is determined by the quality of solutions obtained for training instances. The novelties of this algorithm are (1) a new representation of variable selectors, (2) a new fitness evaluation scheme, and (3) a pre-selection mechanism. Tests with a large set of random and benchmark instances, the evolved variable selectors can significantly improve the efficiency of constraining programming. Compared to highly customised metaheuristics and hybrid algorithms, evolved variable selectors can help constraint programming identify quality solutions faster and proving optimality is possible if sufficiently large run-times are allowed. The evolved variable selectors are especially helpful when solving instances with large numbers of machines.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
