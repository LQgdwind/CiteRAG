Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Agent Constrained Policy Optimisation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Developing intelligent agents that satisfy safety constraints is becoming increasingly important for many real-world applications. In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) settings, policy optimisation with safety awareness is particularly challenging because each individual agent has to not only meet its own safety constraints, but also consider those of others so that their joint behaviours are guaranteed safe. Despite its importance, the research problem of safe multi-agent learning has not been rigorously studied, nor a shareable testing environment or benchmarks. To fill these gaps, in this work, we formulate the safe MARL problem as a constrained Markov game and solve it with policy optimisation methods. We propose two algorithms, Multi-Agent Constrained Policy Optimisation (MACPO) and MAPPO-Lagrangian, which leverage the theories from both constrained policy optimisation and multi-agent trust region learning. Crucially, our methods enjoy theoretical guarantees of both monotonic improvement in reward and satisfaction of safety constraints at every iteration. To examine the effectiveness of our methods, we develop the benchmark suites of Safe Multi-Agent MuJoCo and Safe Multi-Agent Robosuite that involve a variety of MARL baselines. Experimental results justify that MACPO and MAPPO-Lagrangian can consistently satisfy safety constraints, meanwhile achieving comparable performance in rewards.
