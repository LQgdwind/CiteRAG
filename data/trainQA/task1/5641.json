      "content": "Paper Title: HetSched: Quality-of-Mission Aware Scheduling for Autonomous Vehicle SoCs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Systems-on-Chips (SoCs) that power autonomous vehicles (AVs) must meet stringent performance and safety requirements prior to deployment. With increasing complexity in AV applications, the system needs to meet stringent real-time demands of multiple safety-critical applications simultaneously. A typical AV-SoC is a heterogeneous multiprocessor consisting of accelerators supported by general-purpose cores. Such heterogeneity, while needed for power-performance efficiency, complicates the art of task (process) scheduling. In this paper, we demonstrate that hardware heterogeneity impacts the scheduler‚Äôs effectiveness and that optimizing for only the real-time aspect of applications is not sufficient in AVs. Therefore, a more holistic approach is required ‚Äî one that considers global Quality-of-Mission (QoM) metrics, as defined in the paper. We then propose HetSched, a multi-step scheduler that leverages dynamic runtime information about the underlying heterogeneous hardware platform, along with the applications‚Äô real-time constraints and the task traffic in the system to optimize overall mission performance. HetSched proposes two scheduling policies: M‚ÄãSs‚Äãt‚Äãa‚ÄãtùëÄsubscriptùëÜùë†ùë°ùëéùë°MS_{stat} and M‚ÄãSd‚Äãy‚ÄãnùëÄsubscriptùëÜùëëùë¶ùëõMS_{dyn} and scheduling optimizations like task pruning, hybrid heterogeneous ranking and rank update. HetSched improves overall mission performance on average by 4.6√ó\\times, 2.6√ó\\times and 2.6√ó\\times when compared against CPATH, ADS and 2lvl-EDF (state-of-the-art real-time schedulers built for heterogeneous systems), respectively, and achieves an average of 53.3% higher hardware utilization, while meeting 100% critical deadlines for real-world applications of autonomous driving and aerial vehicles. Furthermore, when used as part of an SoC design space exploration loop, in comparison to the prior schedulers, HetSched reduces the number of processing elements required by an SoC to safely complete AV‚Äôs missions by 35% on average while achieving 2.7√ó\\times lower energy-mission time product.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 59\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
