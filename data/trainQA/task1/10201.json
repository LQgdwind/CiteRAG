This paper studies the algorithmic problem of jointly optimizing topology and routing in such demand-aware networks to minimize congestion, along two dimensions: (1) splittable or unsplittable flows, and (2) whether routing is segregated, i.e., whether routes can or cannot combine both demand-aware and demand-oblivious (static) links. For splittable and segregated routing, we show that the problem is generally 222-approximable, but APX-hard even for uniform demands induced by a bipartite demand graph. For unsplittable and segregated routing, we establish upper and lower bounds of O‚Äã(log‚Å°m/log‚Å°log‚Å°m)ùëÇùëöùëöO\\left(\\log m/\\log\\log m\\right) and Œ©‚Äã(log‚Å°m/log‚Å°log‚Å°m)Œ©ùëöùëö\\Omega\\left(\\log m/\\log\\log m\\right), respectively, for polynomial-time approximation algorithms, where mùëöm is the number of static links. We further reveal that under un-/splittable and non-segregated routing, even for demands of a single source (resp., destination), the problem cannot be approximated better than Œ©‚Äã(cmaxcmin)Œ©subscriptùëêsubscriptùëê\\Omega\\left(\\frac{c_{\\max}}{c_{\\min}}\\right) unless P=NP, where cmaxsubscriptùëêc_{\\max} (resp., cminsubscriptùëêc_{\\min}) denotes the maximum (resp., minimum) capacity. It remains NP-hard for uniform capacities, but is tractable for a single commodity and uniform capacities. Our trace-driven simulations show a significant reduction in network congestion compared to existing solutions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 62 most likely reference titles for this paper.
