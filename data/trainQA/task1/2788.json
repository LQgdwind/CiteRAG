Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Contrastive Disentanglement in Generative Adversarial Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Disentanglement is defined as the problem of learning a representation that can separate the distinct, informative factors of variations of data. Learning such a representation may be critical for developing explainable and human-controllable Deep Generative Models (DGMs) in artificial intelligence. However, disentanglement in GANs is not a trivial task, as the absence of sample likelihood and posterior inference for latent variables seems to prohibit the forward step. Inspired by contrastive learning (CL), this paper, from a new perspective, proposes contrastive disentanglement in generative adversarial networks (CD-GAN). It aims at disentangling the factors of inter-class variation of visual data through contrasting image features, since the same factor values produce images in the same class. More importantly, we probe a novel way to make use of limited amount of supervision to the largest extent, to promote inter-class disentanglement performance. Extensive experimental results on many well-known datasets demonstrate the efficacy of CD-GAN for disentangling inter-class variation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 48\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
