Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Fast and accurate solvers for simulating Janus particle suspensions in Stokes flow\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present a novel computational framework for simulating suspensions of rigid spherical Janus particles in Stokes flow. We show that long-range Janus particle interactions for a wide array of applications may be resolved using fast, spectrally accurate boundary integral methods tailored to polydisperse suspensions of spherical particles. These are incorporated into our rigid body Stokes platform. Our approach features the use of spherical harmonic expansions for spectrally accurate integral operator evaluation, complementarity-based collision resolution, and optimal ùí™‚Äã(n)ùí™ùëõ\\mathcal{O}(n) scaling with the number of particles when accelerated via fast summation techniques. We demonstrate the flexibility of our platform through three key examples of Janus particle systems prominent in biomedical applications: amphiphilic, bipolar electric and phoretic particles. We formulate Janus particle interactions in boundary integral form and showcase characteristic self-assembly and complex collective behavior for each particle type.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
