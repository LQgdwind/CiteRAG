Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: EO-GRAPE and EO-DRLPE: Open and Closed Loop Approaches for Energy Efficient Quantum Optimal Control\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This research investigates the possibility of using quantum optimal control techniques to co-optimize the energetic cost and the process fidelity of a quantum unitary gate. The energetic cost is theoretically defined, and thereby, the gradient of the energetic cost for pulse engineering is derived. We empirically demonstrate the Pareto optimality in the trade-off between process fidelity and energetic cost. Thereafter, two novel numerical quantum optimal control approaches are proposed: (i) energy-optimized gradient ascent pulse engineering (EO-GRAPE) as an open-loop gradient-based method, and (ii) energy-optimized deep reinforcement learning for pulse engineering (EO-DRLPE) as a closed-loop method. The performance of both methods is probed in the presence of increasing noise. We find that the EO-GRAPE method performs better than the EO-DRLPE methods with and without a warm start for most experimental settings. Additionally, for one qubit unitary gate, we illustrate the correlation between the Bloch sphere path length and the energetic cost.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
