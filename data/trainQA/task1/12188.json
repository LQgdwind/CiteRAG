Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 62 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer.

      "content": "Paper Title: How to fit large complexity classes into TFNP\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Subclasses of TFNP (total functional NP) are usually defined by specifying a complete problem, which is necessarily in TFNP, and including all problems many-one reducible to it. We study two notions of how a TFNP problem can be reducible to an object, such as a complexity class, outside TFNP. This gives rise to subclasses of TFNP which capture some properties of that outside object. We show that well-known subclasses can arise in this way, for example PPA from reducibility to ‚äïPdirect-sumP\\text{\\raisebox{0.5pt}{\\Large{$\\oplus$}}}\\mathrm{P} and PLS from reducibility to PNPsuperscriptPNP\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{NP}}. We study subclasses arising from PSPACE and the polynomial hierarchy, and show that they are characterized by the propositional proof systems Frege and constant-depth Frege, extending the known pairings between natural TFNP subclasses and proof systems. We study approximate counting from this point of view, and look for a subclass of TFNP that gives a natural home to combinatorial principles such as Ramsey which can be proved using approximate counting. We relate this to the recently-studied Long choice and Short choice problems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 62 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
