Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Selective Learning: Towards Robust Calibration with Dynamic Regularization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Miscalibration in deep learning refers to there is a discrepancy between the predicted confidence and performance. This problem usually arises due to the overfitting problem, which is characterized by learning everything presented in the training set, resulting in overconfident predictions during testing. Existing methods typically address overfitting and mitigate the miscalibration by adding a maximum-entropy regularizer to the objective function. The objective can be understood as seeking a model that fits the ground-truth labels by increasing the confidence while also maximizing the entropy of predicted probabilities by decreasing the confidence. However, previous methods lack clear guidance on confidence adjustment, leading to conflicting objectives (increasing but also decreasing confidence). Therefore, we introduce a method called Dynamic Regularization (DReg), which aims to learn what should be learned during training thereby circumventing the confidence adjusting trade-off. At a high level, DReg aims to obtain a more reliable model capable of acknowledging what it knows and does not know. Specifically, DReg effectively fits the labels for in-distribution samples (samples that should be learned) while applying regularization dynamically to samples beyond model capabilities (e.g., outliers), thereby obtaining a robust calibrated model especially on the samples beyond model capabilities. Both theoretical and empirical analyses sufficiently demonstrate the superiority of DReg compared with previous methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
