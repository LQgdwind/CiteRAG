Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: CGIBNet: Bandwidth-constrained Communication with Graph Information Bottleneck in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Communication is one of the core components for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). The communication bandwidth, in many real applications, is always subject to certain constraints. To improve communication efficiency, in this article, we propose to simultaneously optimize whom to communicate with and what to communicate for each agent in MARL. By initiating the communication between agents with a directed complete graph, we propose a novel communication model, named Communicative Graph Information Bottleneck Network (CGIBNet), to simultaneously compress the graph structure and the node information with the graph information bottleneck principle. The graph structure compression is designed to cut the redundant edges for determining whom to communicate with. The node information compression aims to address the problem of what to communicate via learning compact node representations. Moreover, CGIBNet is the universal module for bandwidth-constrained communication, which can be applied to various training frameworks (i.e., policy-based and value-based MARL frameworks) and communication modes (i.e., single-round and multi-round communication). Extensive experiments are conducted in Traffic Control and StarCraft II environments. The results indicate that our method can achieve better performance in bandwidth-constrained settings compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
