Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Total Generate: Cycle in Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks for Generating Human Faces, Hands, Bodies, and Natural Scenes\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We propose a novel and unified Cycle in Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (C2GAN) for generating human faces, hands, bodies, and natural scenes. Our proposed C2GAN is a cross-modal model exploring the joint exploitation of the input image data and guidance data in an interactive manner. C2GAN contains two different generators, i.e., an image-generation generator and a guidance-generation generator. Both generators are mutually connected and trained in an end-to-end fashion and explicitly form three cycled subnets, i.e., one image generation cycle and two guidance generation cycles. Each cycle aims at reconstructing the input domain and simultaneously produces a useful output involved in the generation of another cycle. In this way, the cycles constrain each other implicitly providing complementary information from both image and guidance modalities and bringing an extra supervision gradient across the cycles, facilitating a more robust optimization of the whole model. Extensive results on four guided image-to-image translation subtasks demonstrate that the proposed C2GAN is effective in generating more realistic images compared with state-of-the-art models. The code is available at https://github.com/Ha0Tang/C2GAN.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
