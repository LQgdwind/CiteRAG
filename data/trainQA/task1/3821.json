Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 61 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Scalable Teacher Forcing Network for Semi-Supervised Large Scale Data Streams\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The large-scale data stream problem refers to high-speed information flow which cannot be processed in scalable manner under a traditional computing platform. This problem also imposes expensive labelling cost making the deployment of fully supervised algorithms unfeasible. On the other hand, the problem of semi-supervised large-scale data streams is little explored in the literature because most works are designed in the traditional single-node computing environments while also being fully supervised approaches. This paper offers Weakly Supervised Scalable Teacher Forcing Network (WeScatterNet) to cope with the scarcity of labelled samples and the large-scale data streams simultaneously. WeScatterNet is crafted under distributed computing platform of Apache Spark with a data-free model fusion strategy for model compression after parallel computing stage. It features an open network structure to address the global and local drift problems while integrating a data augmentation, annotation and auto-correction (D‚ÄãA3ùê∑superscriptùê¥3DA^{3}) method for handling partially labelled data streams. The performance of WeScatterNet is numerically evaluated in the six large-scale data stream problems with only 25%percent2525\\% label proportions. It shows highly competitive performance even if compared with fully supervised learners with 100%percent100100\\% label proportions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper.
