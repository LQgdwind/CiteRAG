      "content": "Paper Title: Combining Causal Discovery and Machine Learning for Modeling Data Center Operations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Data centers consume large amounts of energy, and their electricity demand is predicted to multiply in the coming years. To mitigate the growing environmental challenges associated with data center energy consumption, optimizing the operation of IT equipment (ITE) and Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems is crucial. Yet, modeling such systems is challenging due to the complex and non-linear interactions between many factors, including server load, indoor climate, weather, and data center configurations. While physical simulations are capable of representing this complexity, they are often time-consuming to set up and run. Machine Learning (ML), in contrast, allows efficient data-driven modeling but typically does not consider a system’s causal dynamics, lacks interpretability, and suffers from overfitting. This study addresses the limitations of ML-driven predictive modeling by employing Causal Discovery to select features that are causally related to the response variable. We use a simulated data center to generate time series of its operation and conduct experiments to compare ML models trained with all features, traditional feature selection methods, and causal feature selection. Our results show that causal feature selection leads to models with substantially fewer features and similar or better performance, especially when predicting the effects of interventions. In addition, our proposed methodology allows the interpretation of the causal mechanism and the integration of expert knowledge into the modeling process. Overall, our findings suggest that combining Causal Discovery with ML can be a promising alternative for feature selection methods and prediction of interactions in complex physical systems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
