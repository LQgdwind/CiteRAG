      "content": "Paper Title: Energy-based Out-of-Distribution Detection for Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Learning on graphs, where instance nodes are inter-connected, has become one of the central problems for deep learning, as relational structures are pervasive and induce data inter-dependence which hinders trivial adaptation of existing approaches that assume inputs to be i.i.d. sampled. However, current models mostly focus on improving testing performance of in-distribution data and largely ignore the potential risk w.r.t. out-of-distribution (OOD) testing samples that may cause negative outcome if the prediction is overconfident on them. In this paper, we investigate the under-explored problem, OOD detection on graph-structured data, and identify a provably effective OOD discriminator based on an energy function directly extracted from graph neural networks trained with standard classification loss. This paves a way for a simple, powerful and efficient OOD detection model for GNN-based learning on graphs, which we call GNNSafe. It also has nice theoretical properties that guarantee an overall distinguishable margin between the detection scores for in-distribution and OOD samples, which, more critically, can be further strengthened by a learning-free energy belief propagation scheme. For comprehensive evaluation, we introduce new benchmark settings that evaluate the model for detecting OOD data from both synthetic and real distribution shifts (cross-domain graph shifts and temporal graph shifts). The results show that GNNSafe achieves up to 17.0%percent17.017.0\\% AUROC improvement over state-of-the-arts and it could serve as simple yet strong baselines in such an under-developed area.
