      "content": "Paper Title: On polynomially many queries to NP or QMA oracles\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study the complexity of problems solvable in deterministic polynomial time with access to an NPNP\\mathrm{NP} or Quantum Merlin-Arthur (QMAQMA\\mathrm{QMA})-oracle, such as PNPsuperscriptPNP\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{NP}} and PQMAsuperscriptPQMA\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{QMA}}, respectively. The former allows one to classify problems more finely than the Polynomial-Time Hierarchy (PHPH\\mathrm{PH}), whereas the latter characterizes physically motivated problems such as Approximate Simulation (APX−SIMAPXSIM\\mathrm{APX\\mathchar 45\\relax{}SIM}) [Ambainis, CCC 2014]. In this area, a central role has been played by the classes PNP​[log]superscriptPNPdelimited-[]\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{NP}[\\log]} and PQMA​[log]superscriptPQMAdelimited-[]\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{QMA}[\\log]}, defined identically to PNPsuperscriptPNP\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{NP}} and PQMAsuperscriptPQMA\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{QMA}}, except that only logarithmically many oracle queries are allowed. Here, [Gottlob, FOCS 1993] showed that if the adaptive queries made by a PNPsuperscriptPNP\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{NP}} machine have a “query graph” which is a tree, then this computation can be simulated in PNP​[log]superscriptPNPdelimited-[]\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{NP}[\\log]}. In this work, we first show that for any verification class C∈{NP,MA,QCMA,QMA,QMA​(2),NEXP,QMAexp}𝐶NPMAQCMAQMAQMA2NEXPsubscriptQMAexpC\\in\\{\\mathrm{NP},\\mathrm{MA},\\mathrm{QCMA},\\mathrm{QMA},\\mathrm{QMA}(2),\\allowbreak\\mathrm{NEXP},\\mathrm{QMA}_{\\mathrm{exp}}\\}, any PCsuperscriptPC\\mathrm{P}^{\\textup{C}} machine with a query graph of “separator number” s𝑠s can be simulated using deterministic time exp⁡(s​log⁡n)𝑠𝑛\\exp(s\\log n) and s​log⁡n𝑠𝑛s\\log n queries to a C𝐶C-oracle. When s∈O​(1)𝑠𝑂1s\\in O(1) (which includes the case of O​(1)𝑂1O(1)-treewidth, and thus also of trees), this gives an upper bound of PC​[log]superscriptPCdelimited-[]\\mathrm{P}^{\\textup{C}[\\log]}, and when s∈O​(logk⁡(n))𝑠𝑂superscript𝑘𝑛s\\in O(\\log^{k}(n)), this yields bound QPC​[logk+1]superscriptQP𝐶delimited-[]superscript𝑘1\\mathrm{QP}^{C[\\log^{k+1}]} (QPQP\\mathrm{QP} meaning quasi-polynomial time). We next show how to combine Gottlob’s “admissible-weighting function” framework with the “flag-qubit” framework of [Watson, Bausch, Gharibian, 2020], obtaining a unified approach for embedding PCsuperscriptPC\\mathrm{P}^{\\textup{C}} computations directly into APX−SIMAPXSIM\\mathrm{APX\\mathchar 45\\relax{}SIM} instances in a black-box fashion. Finally, we formalize a simple no-go statement about polynomials (c.f. [Krentel, STOC 1986]): Given a multi-linear polynomial p𝑝p specified via an arithmetic circuit, if one can “weakly compress” p𝑝p so that its optimal value requires m𝑚m bits to represent, then PNPsuperscriptPNP\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{NP}} can be decided with only m𝑚m queries to an NP-oracle.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
