      "content": "Paper Title: AdaRNN: Adaptive Learning and Forecasting for Time Series\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Though time series forecasting has a wide range of real-world applications, it is a very challenging task. This is because the statistical properties of a time series can vary with time, causing the distribution to change temporally, which is known as the distribution shift problem in the machine learning community. By far, it still remains unexplored to model time series from the distribution-shift perspective. In this paper, we formulate the Temporal Covariate Shift (TCS) problem for the time series forecasting. We propose Adaptive RNNs (AdaRNN) to tackle the TCS problem. AdaRNN is sequentially composed of two modules. The first module is referred to as Temporal Distribution Characterization, which aims to better characterize the distribution information in a time series. The second module is termed as Temporal Distribution Matching, which aims to reduce the distribution mismatch in the time series to learn an RNN-based adaptive time series prediction model. AdaRNN is a general framework with flexible distribution distances integrated. Experiments on human activity recognition, air quality prediction, household power consumption, and financial analysis show that AdaRNN outperforms some state-of-the-art methods by 2.6%percent2.62.6\\% in terms of accuracy on classification tasks and by 9.0%percent9.09.0\\% in terms of the mean squared error on regression tasks. We also show that the temporal distribution matching module can be extended to the Transformer architecture to further boost its performance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
