Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Sparse Voxels Rasterization: Real-time High-fidelity Radiance Field Rendering\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We propose an efficient radiance field rendering algorithm that incorporates a rasterization process on sparse voxels without neural networks or 3D Gaussians. There are two key contributions coupled with the proposed system. The first is to render sparse voxels in the correct depth order along pixel rays by using dynamic Morton ordering. This avoids the well-known popping artifact found in Gaussian splatting. Second, we adaptively fit sparse voxels to different levels of detail within scenes, faithfully reproducing scene details while achieving high rendering frame rates. Our method improves the previous neural-free voxel grid representation by over 4db PSNR and more than 10x rendering FPS speedup, achieving state-of-the-art comparable novel-view synthesis results. Additionally, our neural-free sparse voxels are seamlessly compatible with grid-based 3D processing algorithms. We achieve promising mesh reconstruction accuracy by integrating TSDF-Fusion and Marching Cubes into our sparse grid system.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
