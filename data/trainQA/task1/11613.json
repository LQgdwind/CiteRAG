Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Exact spectral gaps of random one-dimensional quantum circuits\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The spectral gap of local random quantum circuits is a fundamental property that determines how close the moments of the circuit‚Äôs unitaries match those of a Haar random distribution. When studying spectral gaps, it is common to bound these quantities using tools from statistical mechanics or via quantum information-based inequalities. By focusing on the second moment of one-dimensional unitary circuits where nearest neighboring gates act on sets of qudits (with open and closed boundary conditions), we show that one can exactly compute the associated spectral gaps. Indeed, having access to their functional form allows us to prove several important results, such as the fact that the spectral gap for closed boundary condition is exactly the square of the gap for open boundaries, as well as improve on previously known bounds for approximate design convergence. Finally, we verify our theoretical results by numerically computing the spectral gap for systems of up to 70 qubits, as well as comparing them to gaps of random orthogonal and symplectic circuits.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
