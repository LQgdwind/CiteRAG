Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Robust Topological Inference in the Presence of Outliers\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The distance function to a compact set plays a crucial role in the paradigm of topological data analysis. In particular, the sublevel sets of the distance function are used in the computation of persistent homology‚Äîa backbone of the topological data analysis pipeline. Despite its stability to perturbations in the Hausdorff distance, persistent homology is highly sensitive to outliers. In this work, we develop a framework of statistical inference for persistent homology in the presence of outliers. Drawing inspiration from recent developments in robust statistics, we propose a median-of-means variant of the distance function (MoM Dist), and establish its statistical properties. In particular, we show that, even in the presence of outliers, the sublevel filtrations and weighted filtrations induced by MoM Dist are both consistent estimators of the true underlying population counterpart, and their rates of convergence in the bottleneck metric are controlled by the fraction of outliers in the data. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed methodology through simulations and applications.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
