Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Alpha-Refine: Boosting Tracking Performance by Precise Bounding Box Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Visual object tracking aims to precisely estimate the bounding box for the given target, which is a challenging problem due to factors such as deformation and occlusion. Many recent trackers adopt the multiple-stage strategy to improve bounding box estimation. These methods first coarsely locate the target and then refine the initial prediction in the following stages. However, existing approaches still suffer from limited precision, and the coupling of different stages severely restricts the method’s transferability. This work proposes a novel, flexible, and accurate refinement module called Alpha-Refine (AR), which can significantly improve the base trackers’ box estimation quality. By exploring a series of design options, we conclude that the key to successful refinement is extracting and maintaining detailed spatial information as much as possible. Following this principle, Alpha-Refine adopts a pixel-wise correlation, a corner prediction head, and an auxiliary mask head as the core components. Comprehensive experiments on TrackingNet, LaSOT, GOT-10K, and VOT2020 benchmarks with multiple base trackers show that our approach significantly improves the base tracker’s performance with little extra latency. The proposed Alpha-Refine method leads to a series of strengthened trackers, among which the ARSiamRPN (AR strengthened SiamRPNpp) and the ARDiMP50 (AR strengthened DiMP50) achieve good efficiency-precision trade-off, while the ARDiMPsuper (AR strengthened DiMPsuper) achieves very competitive performance at a real-time speed. Code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/MasterBin-IIAU/AlphaRefine.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
