Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Mildly Exponential Lower Bounds on Tolerant Testers for Monotonicity, Unateness, and Juntas\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We give the first super-polynomial (in fact, mildly exponential) lower bounds for tolerant testing (equivalently, distance estimation) of monotonicity, unateness, and juntas with a constant separation between the ‚Äúyes‚Äù and ‚Äúno‚Äù cases. Specifically, we give ‚Ä¢ A 2Œ©‚Äã(n1/4/Œµ)superscript2Œ©superscriptùëõ14ùúÄ2^{\\Omega(n^{1/4}/\\sqrt{\\varepsilon})}-query lower bound for non-adaptive, two-sided tolerant monotonicity testers and unateness testers when the ‚Äúgap‚Äù parameter Œµ2‚àíŒµ1subscriptùúÄ2subscriptùúÄ1\\varepsilon_{2}-\\varepsilon_{1} is equal to ŒµùúÄ\\varepsilon, for any Œµ‚â•1/nùúÄ1ùëõ\\varepsilon\\geq 1/\\sqrt{n}; ‚Ä¢ A 2Œ©‚Äã(k1/2)superscript2Œ©superscriptùëò122^{\\Omega(k^{1/2})}-query lower bound for non-adaptive, two-sided tolerant junta testers when the gap parameter is an absolute constant.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
