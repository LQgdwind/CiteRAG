Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: 1 INTRODUCTION\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Training neural networks on a large dataset requires substantial computational costs. Dataset reduction selects or synthesizes data instances based on the large dataset, while minimizing the degradation in generalization performance from the full dataset. Existing methods utilize the neural network during the dataset reduction procedure, so the model parameter becomes important factor in preserving the performance after reduction. By depending upon the importance of parameters, this paper introduces a new reduction objective, coined LCMat, which Matches the Loss Curvatures of the original dataset and reduced dataset over the model parameter space, more than the parameter point. This new objective induces a better adaptation of the reduced dataset on the perturbed parameter region than the exact point matching. Particularly, we identify the worst case of the loss curvature gap from the local parameter region, and we derive the implementable upper bound of such worst-case with theoretical analyses. Our experiments on both coreset selection and condensation benchmarks illustrate that LCMat shows better generalization performances than existing baselines.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
