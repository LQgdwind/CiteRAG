      "content": "Paper Title: Identifying Electrocardiogram Abnormalities Using a Handcrafted-Rule-Enhanced Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A large number of people suffer from life-threatening cardiac abnormalities, and electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is beneficial to determining whether an individual is at risk of such abnormalities. Automatic ECG classification methods, especially the deep learning based ones, have been proposed to detect cardiac abnormalities using ECG records, showing good potential to improve clinical diagnosis and help early prevention of cardiovascular diseases. However, the predictions of the known neural networks still do not satisfactorily meet the needs of clinicians, and this phenomenon suggests that some information used in clinical diagnosis may not be well captured and utilized by these methods. In this paper, we introduce some rules into convolutional neural networks, which help present clinical knowledge to deep learning based ECG analysis, in order to improve automated ECG diagnosis performance. Specifically, we propose a Handcrafted-Rule-enhanced Neural Network (called HRNN) for ECG classification with standard 12-lead ECG input, which consists of a rule inference module and a deep learning module. Experiments on two large-scale public ECG datasets show that our new approach considerably outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Further, our proposed approach not only can improve the diagnosis performance, but also can assist in detecting mislabelled ECG samples. Our codes are available at https://github.com/alwaysbyx/ecg_processing.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
