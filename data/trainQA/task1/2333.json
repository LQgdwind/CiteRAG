Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 58 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring Data Augmentation for Multi-Modality 3D Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract It is counter-intuitive that multi-modality methods based on point cloud and images perform only marginally better or sometimes worse than approaches that solely use point cloud. This paper investigates the reason behind this phenomenon. Due to the fact that multi-modality data augmentation must maintain consistency between point cloud and images, recent methods in this field typically use relatively insufficient data augmentation. This shortage makes their performance under expectation. Therefore, we contribute a pipeline, named transformation flow, to bridge the gap between single and multi-modality data augmentation with transformation reversing and replaying. In addition, considering occlusions, a point in different modalities may be occupied by different objects, making augmentations such as cut and paste non-trivial for multi-modality detection. We further present Multi-mOdality Cut and pAste (MoCa), which simultaneously considers occlusion and physical plausibility to maintain the multi-modality consistency. Without using ensemble of detectors, our multi-modality detector achieves new state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes dataset and competitive performance on KITTI 3D benchmark. Our method also wins the best PKL award in the 3rd nuScenes detection challenge. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
