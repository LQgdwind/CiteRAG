Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Energy-Aware FPGA Implementation of Spiking Neural Network with LIF Neurons\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) has become a growing field in on-device processing for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, capitalizing on AI algorithms that are optimized for their low complexity and energy efficiency. These algorithms are designed to minimize power and memory footprints, making them ideal for the constraints of IoT devices. Within this domain, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) stand out as a cutting-edge solution for TinyML, owning to their event-driven processing paradigm which offers an efficient method of handling dataflow. This paper presents a novel SNN architecture based on the 1s‚Äãtsuperscript1ùë†ùë°1^{st} Order Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model to efficiently deploy vision-based ML algorithms on TinyML systems. A hardware-friendly LIF design is also proposed, and implemented on a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA. To evaluate the proposed model, a collision avoidance dataset is considered as a case study. The proposed SNN model is compared to the state-of-the-art works and Binarized Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN) as a baseline. The results show the proposed approach is 86% more energy efficient than the baseline.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
