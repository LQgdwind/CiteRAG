Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data.

      "content": "Paper Title: Towards real time assessment of earthfill dams via Model Order Reduction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The use of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies is becoming a preferred solution for the assessment of tailings dams’ safety. Real-time sensor monitoring proves to be a key tool for reducing the risk related to these ever-evolving earth-fill structures, that exhibit a high rate of sudden and hazardous failures. In order to optimally exploit real-time embankment monitoring, one major hindrance has to be overcome: the creation of a supporting numerical model for stability analysis, with rapid-enough response to perform data assimilation in real time. A model should be built, such that its response can be obtained faster than the physical evolution of the analyzed phenomenon. In this work, Reduced Order Modelling (ROM) is used to boost computational efficiency in solving the coupled hydro-mechanical system of equations governing the problem. The Reduced Basis method is applied to the coupled hydro-mechanical equations that govern the groundwater flow, that are made non-linear as a result of considering an unsaturated soil. The resulting model’s performance is assessed by solving a 2D and a 3D problem relevant to tailings dams’ safety. The ROM technique achieves a speedup of 3 to 15 times with respect to the full-order model (FOM) while maintaining high levels of accuracy.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
