Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: IRIS: Interpretable Rubric-Informed Segmentation for Action Quality Assessment\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. AI-driven Action Quality Assessment (AQA) of sports videos can mimic Olympic judges to help score performances as a second opinion or for training. However, these AI methods are uninterpretable and do not justify their scores, which is important for algorithmic accountability. Indeed, to account for their decisions, instead of scoring subjectively, sports judges use a consistent set of criteria — rubric — on multiple actions in each performance sequence. Therefore, we propose IRIS to perform Interpretable Rubric-Informed Segmentation on action sequences for AQA. We investigated IRIS for scoring videos of figure skating performance. IRIS predicts (1) action segments, (2) technical element score differences of each segment relative to base scores, (3) multiple program component scores, and (4) the summed final score. In a modeling study, we found that IRIS performs better than non-interpretable, state-of-the-art models. In a formative user study, practicing figure skaters agreed with the rubric-informed explanations, found them useful, and trusted AI judgments more. This work highlights the importance of using judgment rubrics to account for AI decisions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
