Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Visual Analysis of Electronic Densities and Transitions in Molecules\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The study of electronic transitions within a molecule connected to the absorption or emission of light is a common task in the process of the design of new materials. The transitions are complex quantum mechanical processes and a detailed analysis requires a breakdown of these processes into components that can be interpreted via characteristic chemical properties. We approach these tasks by providing a detailed analysis of the electron density field. This entails methods to quantify and visualize electron localization and transfer from molecular subgroups combining spatial and abstract representations. The core of our method uses geometric segmentation of the electronic density field coupled with a graph-theoretic formulation of charge transfer between molecular subgroups. The design of the methods has been guided by the goal of providing a generic and objective analysis following fundamental concepts. We illustrate the proposed approach using several case studies involving the study of electronic transitions in different molecular systems. {CCSXML} <ccs2012> <concept> <concept_id>10003120.10003145.10003147.10010364</concept_id> <concept_desc>Human-centered computing Scientific visualization</concept_desc> <concept_significance>300</concept_significance> </concept> <concept> <concept_id>10003120.10003145.10003146</concept_id> <concept_desc>Human-centered computing Visualization techniques</concept_desc> <concept_significance>300</concept_significance> </concept> <concept> <concept_id>10010405.10010432.10010436</concept_id> <concept_desc>Applied computing Chemistry</concept_desc> <concept_significance>300</concept_significance> </concept> <concept> <concept_id>10010405.10010432.10010441</concept_id> <concept_desc>Applied computing Physics</concept_desc> <concept_significance>300</concept_significance> </concept> </ccs2012> \\ccsdesc [300]Human-centered computing Scientific visualization \\ccsdesc[300]Human-centered computing Visualization techniques \\ccsdesc[300]Applied computing Chemistry \\ccsdesc[300]Applied computing Physics \\printccsdesc\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
