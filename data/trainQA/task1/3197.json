Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Mesoscale simulation of woven composite design decisions\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Characterizing the connection between material design decisions/parameters and their effective properties allows for accelerated materials development and optimization. We present a global sensitivity analysis of woven composite thermophysical properties, including density, volume fraction, thermal conductivity, specific heat, moduli, permeability, and tortuosity, predicted using mesoscale finite element simulations. The mesoscale simulations use microscale approximations for the tow and matrix phases. We performed Latin hypercube sampling of viable input parameter ranges, and the resulting effective property distributions are analyzed using a surrogate model to determine the correlations between material parameters and responses, interactions between properties, and finally Sobol’ indices and sensitivities. We demonstrate that both constituent physical properties and the mesoscale geometry strongly influence the composite material properties.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
