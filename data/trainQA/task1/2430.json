      "content": "Paper Title: CAnet: Uplink-aided Downlink Channel Acquisition in FDD Massive MIMO using Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In frequency-division duplexing systems, the downlink channel state information (CSI) acquisition scheme leads to high training and feedback overheads. In this paper, we propose an uplink-aided downlink channel acquisition framework using deep learning to reduce these overheads. Unlike most existing works that focus only on channel estimation or feedback modules, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that considers the entire downlink CSI acquisition process, including downlink pilot design, channel estimation, and feedback. First, we propose an adaptive pilot design module by exploiting the correlation in magnitude among bidirectional channels in the angular domain to improve channel estimation. Next, to avoid the bit allocation problem during the feedback module, we concatenate the complex channel and embed the uplink channel magnitude to the channel reconstruction at the base station. Lastly, we combine the above two modules and compare two popular downlink channel acquisition frameworks. The former framework estimates and feeds back the channel at the user equipment subsequently. The user equipment in the latter one directly feeds back the received pilot signals to the base station. Our results reveal that, with the help of uplink, directly feeding back the pilot signals can save approximately 20% of feedback bits, which provides a guideline for future research.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
