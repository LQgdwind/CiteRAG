Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Look Before You Leap: Detecting Phishing Web Pages by Exploiting Raw URL And HTML Characteristics\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Phishing websites distribute unsolicited content and are frequently used to commit email and internet fraud; detecting them before any user information is submitted is critical. Several efforts have been made to detect these phishing websites in recent years. Most existing approaches use hand-crafted lexical and statistical features from a website’s textual content to train classification models to detect phishing web pages. However, these phishing detection approaches have a few challenges, including 1) the tediousness of extracting hand-crafted features, which require specialized domain knowledge to determine which features are useful for a particular platform; and 2) the difficulties encountered by models built on hand-crafted features to capture the semantic patterns in words and characters in URL and HTML content. To address these challenges, this paper proposes WebPhish, an end-to-end deep neural network trained using embedded raw URLs and HTML content to detect website phishing attacks. First, the proposed model automatically employs an embedding technique to extract the corresponding characters into homologous dense vectors. Then, the concatenation layer merges the URL and HTML embedding matrices. Following that, Convolutional layers are used to model its semantic dependencies. Extensive experiments were conducted with real-world phishing data, which yielded an accuracy of 98.1%, showing that WebPhish outperforms baseline detection approaches in identifying phishing pages.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 49\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
