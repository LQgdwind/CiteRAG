Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Understanding and Improving Neural Active Learning on Heteroskedastic Distributions Correspondence to savyakhosla08@gmail.com\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Models that can actively seek out the best quality training data hold the promise of more accurate, adaptable, and efficient machine learning. Active learning techniques often tend to prefer examples that are the most difficult to classify. While this works well on homogeneous datasets, we find that it can lead to catastrophic failures when performed on multiple distributions with different degrees of label noise or heteroskedasticity. These active learning algorithms strongly prefer to draw from the distribution with more noise, even if their examples have no informative structure (such as solid color images with random labels). To this end, we demonstrate the catastrophic failure of these active learning algorithms on heteroskedastic distributions and propose a fine-tuning-based approach to mitigate these failures. Further, we propose a new algorithm that incorporates a model difference scoring function for each data point to filter out the noisy examples and sample clean examples that maximize accuracy, outperforming the existing active learning techniques on the heteroskedastic datasets. We hope these observations and techniques are immediately helpful to practitioners and can help to challenge common assumptions in the design of active learning algorithms.
