Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We consider the problem of learning a control policy that is robust against the parameter mismatches between the training environment and testing environment. We formulate this as a distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DR-RL) problem where the objective is to learn the policy which maximizes the value function against the worst possible stochastic model of the environment in an uncertainty set. We focus on the tabular episodic learning setting where the algorithm has access to a generative model of the nominal (training) environment around which the uncertainty set is defined. We propose the Robust Phased Value Learning (RPVL) algorithm to solve this problem for the uncertainty sets specified by four different divergences: total variation, chi-square, Kullback-Leibler, and Wasserstein. We show that our algorithm achieves ùí™~‚Äã(|ùíÆ|‚Äã|ùíú|‚ÄãH5)~ùí™ùíÆùíúsuperscriptùêª5\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\left\\lvert\\mathcal{S}\\right\\rvert\\left\\lvert\\mathcal{A}\\right\\rvert H^{5}) sample complexity, which is uniformly better than the existing results by a factor of |ùíÆ|ùíÆ\\left\\lvert\\mathcal{S}\\right\\rvert, where |ùíÆ|ùíÆ\\left\\lvert\\mathcal{S}\\right\\rvert is number of states, |ùíú|ùíú\\left\\lvert\\mathcal{A}\\right\\rvert is the number of actions, and HùêªH is the horizon length. We also provide the first-ever sample complexity result for the Wasserstein uncertainty set. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithm using simulation experiments.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
