      "content": "Paper Title: Chromatic 𝑘-Nearest Neighbor Queries\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Let P𝑃P be a set of n𝑛n colored points. We develop efficient data structures that store P𝑃P and can answer chromatic k𝑘k-nearest neighbor (k𝑘k-NN) queries. Such a query consists of a query point q𝑞q and a number k𝑘k, and asks for the color that appears most frequently among the k𝑘k points in P𝑃P closest to q𝑞q. Answering such queries efficiently is the key to obtain fast k𝑘k-NN classifiers. Our main aim is to obtain query times that are independent of k𝑘k while using near-linear space. We show that this is possible using a combination of two data structures. The first data structure allow us to compute a region containing exactly the k𝑘k-nearest neighbors of a query point q𝑞q, and the second data structure can then report the most frequent color in such a region. This leads to linear space data structures with query times of O​(n1/2​log⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛12𝑛O(n^{1/2}\\log n) for points in ℝ1superscriptℝ1\\mathbb{R}^{1}, and with query times varying between O​(n2/3​log2/3⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛23superscript23𝑛O(n^{2/3}\\log^{2/3}n) and O​(n5/6​polylog⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛56polylog𝑛O(n^{5/6}\\operatorname{polylog}n), depending on the distance measure used, for points in ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2}. Since these query times are still fairly large we also consider approximations. If we are allowed to report a color that appears at least (1−ε)​f∗1𝜀superscript𝑓(1-\\varepsilon)f^{*} times, where f∗superscript𝑓f^{*} is the frequency of the most frequent color, we obtain a query time of O​(log⁡n+log⁡log11−ε⁡n)𝑂𝑛subscript11𝜀𝑛O(\\log n+\\log\\log_{\\frac{1}{1-\\varepsilon}}n) in ℝ1superscriptℝ1\\mathbb{R}^{1} and expected query times ranging between O~​(n1/2​ε−3/2)~𝑂superscript𝑛12superscript𝜀32\\tilde{O}(n^{1/2}\\varepsilon^{-3/2}) and O~​(n1/2​ε−5/2)~𝑂superscript𝑛12superscript𝜀52\\tilde{O}(n^{1/2}\\varepsilon^{-5/2}) in ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2} using near-linear space (ignoring polylogarithmic factors).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
