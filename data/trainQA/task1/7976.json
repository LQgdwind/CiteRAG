Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: DualStreamFoveaNet: A Dual Stream Fusion Architecture with Anatomical Awareness for Robust Fovea Localization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Accurate fovea localization is essential for analyzing retinal diseases to prevent irreversible vision loss. While current deep learning-based methods outperform traditional ones, they still face challenges such as the lack of local anatomical landmarks around the fovea, the inability to robustly handle diseased retinal images, and the variations in image conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based architecture called DualStreamFoveaNet (DSFN) for multi-cue fusion. This architecture explicitly incorporates long-range connections and global features using retina and vessel distributions for robust fovea localization. We introduce a spatial attention mechanism in the dual-stream encoder to extract and fuse self-learned anatomical information, focusing more on features distributed along blood vessels and significantly reducing computational costs by decreasing token numbers. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public datasets and one large-scale private dataset. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the DSFN is more robust on both normal and diseased retina images and has better generalization capacity in cross-dataset experiments.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
