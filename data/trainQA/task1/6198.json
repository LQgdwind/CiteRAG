      "content": "Paper Title: Finite-Time Analysis of Decentralized Single-Timescale Actor-Critic\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Decentralized Actor-Critic (AC) algorithms have been widely utilized for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and have achieved remarkable success. Apart from its empirical success, the theoretical convergence property of decentralized AC algorithms is largely unexplored. Most of the existing finite-time convergence results are derived based on either double-loop update or two-timescale step sizes rule, and this is the case even for centralized AC algorithm under a single-agent setting. In practice, the single-timescale update is widely utilized, where actor and critic are updated in an alternating manner with step sizes being of the same order. In this work, we study a decentralized single-timescale AC algorithm. Theoretically, using linear approximation for value and reward estimation, we show that the algorithm has sample complexity of ùí™~‚Äã(Œµ‚àí2)~ùí™superscriptùúÄ2\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\varepsilon^{-2}) under Markovian sampling, which matches the optimal complexity with a double-loop implementation (here, ùí™~~ùí™\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}} hides a logarithmic term). When we reduce to the single-agent setting, our result yields new sample complexity for centralized AC using a single-timescale update scheme. The central to establishing our complexity results is the hidden smoothness of the optimal critic variable we revealed. We also provide a local action privacy-preserving version of our algorithm and its analysis. Finally, we conduct experiments to show the superiority of our algorithm over the existing decentralized AC algorithms.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
