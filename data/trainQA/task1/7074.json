      "content": "Paper Title: Identification of quantum entanglement with Siamese convolutional neural networks and semi-supervised learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Quantum entanglement is a fundamental property commonly used in various quantum information protocols and algorithms. Nonetheless, the problem of identifying entanglement has still not reached a general solution for systems larger than two qubits. In this study, we use deep convolutional neural networks, a type of supervised machine learning, to identify quantum entanglement for any bipartition in a 3-qubit system. We demonstrate that training the model on synthetically generated datasets of random density matrices excluding challenging positive-under-partial-transposition entangled states (PPTES), which cannot be identified (and correctly labeled) in general, leads to good model accuracy even for PPTES states, that were outside the training data. Our aim is to enhance the model‚Äôs generalization on PPTES. By applying entanglement-preserving symmetry operations through a triple Siamese network trained in a semi-supervised manner, we improve the model‚Äôs accuracy and ability to recognize PPTES. Moreover, by constructing an ensemble of Siamese models, even better generalization is observed, in analogy with the idea of finding separate types of entanglement witnesses for different classes of states. The neural models‚Äô code and training schemes, as well as data generation procedures, are available at github.com/Maticraft/quantum_correlations.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
