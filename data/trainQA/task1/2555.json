Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: GTAE: Graph-Transformer based Auto-Encoders for Linguistic-Constrained Text Style Transfer\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Non-parallel text style transfer has attracted increasing research interests in recent years. Despite successes in transferring the style based on the encoder-decoder framework, current approaches still lack the ability to preserve the content and even logic of original sentences, mainly due to the large unconstrained model space or too simplified assumptions on latent embedding space. Since language itself is an intelligent product of humans with certain grammars and has a limited rule-based model space by its nature, relieving this problem requires reconciling the model capacity of deep neural networks with the intrinsic model constraints from human linguistic rules. To this end, we propose a method called Graph Transformer based Auto Encoder (GTAE), which models a sentence as a linguistic graph and performs feature extraction and style transfer at the graph level, to maximally retain the content and the linguistic structure of original sentences. Quantitative experiment results on three non-parallel text style transfer tasks show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in content preservation, while achieving comparable performance on transfer accuracy and sentence naturalness.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 49\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
