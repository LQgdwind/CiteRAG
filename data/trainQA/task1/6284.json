Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Generalizing Multimodal Pre-training into Multilingual via Language Acquisition\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract English-based Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) has achieved great success in various downstream tasks. Some efforts have been taken to generalize this success to non-English languages through Multilingual Vision-Language Pre-training (M-VLP). However, due to the large number of languages, M-VLP models often require huge computing resources and cannot be flexibly extended to new languages. In this work, we propose a MultiLingual Acquisition (MLA) framework that can easily generalize a monolingual Vision-Language Pre-training model into multilingual. Specifically, we design a lightweight language acquisition encoder based on state-of-the-art monolingual VLP models. We further propose a two-stage training strategy to optimize the language acquisition encoder, namely the Native Language Transfer stage and the Language Exposure stage. With much less multilingual training data and computing resources, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multilingual image-text and video-text retrieval benchmarks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 47\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
