Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: RLM-Tracking: Online Multi-Pedestrian Tracking Supported by Relative Location Mapping\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The problem of multi-object tracking is a fundamental computer vision research focus, widely used in public safety, transport, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and other regions involving artificial intelligence. Because of the complexity of natural scenes, object occlusion and semi-occlusion usually occur in fundamental tracking tasks. These can easily lead to ID switching, object loss, detect errors, and misaligned limitation boxes. These conditions have a significant impact on the precision of multi-object tracking. In this paper, we design a new multi-object tracker for the above issues that contains an object Relative Location Mapping (RLM) model and Target Region Density (TRD) model. The new tracker is more sensitive to the differences in position relationships between objects. It can introduce low-score detection frames into different regions in real-time according to the density of object regions in the video. This improves the accuracy of object tracking without consuming extensive arithmetic resources. Our study shows that the proposed model has considerably enhanced the HOTA and DF1 measurements on the MOT17 and MOT20 data sets when applied to the advanced MOT method.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 52\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
