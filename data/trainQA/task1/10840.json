It has demonstrated empirical quantum advantages notably within domains such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and time-series prediction. A significant advancement lies in Quantum Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNNs), specifically tailored for memory-intensive tasks encompassing partially observable environments and non-linear time-series prediction. Nevertheless, QRNN-based models encounter challenges, notably prolonged training duration stemming from the necessity to compute quantum gradients using backpropagation-through-time (BPTT). This predicament exacerbates when executing the complete model on quantum devices, primarily due to the substantial demand for circuit evaluation arising from the parameter-shift rule. This paper introduces the Quantum Fast Weight Programmers (QFWP) as a solution to the temporal or sequential learning challenge. The QFWP leverages a classical neural network (referred to as the ’slow programmer’) functioning as a quantum programmer to swiftly modify the parameters of a variational quantum circuit (termed the ’fast programmer’). Instead of completely overwriting the fast programmer at each time-step, the slow programmer generates parameter changes or updates for the quantum circuit parameters. This approach enables the fast programmer to incorporate past observations or information. Notably, the proposed QFWP model achieves learning of temporal dependencies without necessitating the use of quantum recurrent neural networks. Numerical simulations conducted in this study showcase the efficacy of the proposed QFWP model in both time-series prediction and RL tasks. The model exhibits performance levels either comparable to or surpassing those achieved by QLSTM-based models.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
