Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 58 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Part\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Knowledge distillation (KD) has been widely-used to improve the test accuracy of a “student” network by training the student to mimic soft probabilities of a trained “teacher” network. Yet, it has been shown in recent work that, despite being trained to fit the teacher’s probabilities, the student not only significantly deviates from these probabilities, but also performs even better than the teacher. Our work aims to reconcile this seemingly paradoxical observation by characterizing the precise nature of the student-teacher deviations, and by arguing how they can co-occur with better generalization. First, through experiments on image and language data, we identify that these deviations correspond to the student systematically exaggerating the confidence levels of the teacher. Next, we theoretically and empirically establish in some simple settings that KD also exaggerates the implicit bias of gradient descent in converging faster along the top eigendirections of the data. Finally, we demonstrate that this exaggerated bias effect can simultaneously result in both (a) the exaggeration of confidence and (b) the improved generalization of the student, thus offering a resolution to the apparent paradox. Our analysis brings existing theory and practice closer by considering the role of gradient descent in KD and by demonstrating the exaggerated bias effect in both theoretical and empirical settings.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
