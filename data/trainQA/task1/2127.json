      "content": "Paper Title: XpulpNN: Enabling Energy Efficient and Flexible Inference of Quantized Neural Network on RISC-V based IoT End Nodes\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Strongly quantized fixed-point arithmetic is now considered a well-established solution to deploy Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on limited-memory low-power IoT end-nodes. Such a trend is challenging due to the lack of support for low bitwidth fixed-point instructions in the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) of state-of-the-art embedded Microcontrollers (MCUs), which are mainly based on closed ISA such as ARM Thumb2 and associated Helium extensions. Emerging open-source ISAs such as RISC-V provide a flexible way to address this challenge. This work introduces lightweight extensions to the RISC-V ISA to boost the efficiency of heavily Quantized Neural Network (QNN) inference on microcontroller-class cores. By extending the ISA with nibble (4-bit) and crumb (2-bit) SIMD instructions, we are able to show near-linear speedup with respect to higher precision integer computation on the key kernels for QNN computation. Also, we propose a custom execution paradigm for SIMD sum-of-dot-product operations, which consists of fusing a dot product with a load operation, with an up to 1.64 ×\\times peak MAC/cycle improvement compared to a standard execution scenario. To further push the efficiency, we integrate the RISC-V extended core in a parallel cluster of 8 processors, with near-linear improvement with respect to a single core architecture. To evaluate the proposed extensions, we fully implement the cluster of processors in GF22FDX technology. QNN convolution kernels on a parallel cluster implementing the proposed extension run 6 ×\\times and 8 ×\\times faster when considering 4- and 2-bit data operands, respectively, compared to a baseline processing cluster only supporting 8-bit SIMD instructions. With a peak of 2.22 TOPs/s/W, the proposed solution achieves efficiency levels comparable with dedicated DNN inference accelerators, and up to three orders of magnitude better than state-of-the-art ARM Cortex-M based microcontroller systems such as the low-end STM32L4 MCU and the high-end STM32H7 MCU.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
