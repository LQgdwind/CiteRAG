Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: SPI-GAN: Distilling Score-based Generative Models with Straight-Path Interpolations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Score-based generative models (SGMs) are a recently proposed paradigm for deep generative tasks and now show the state-of-the-art sampling performance. It is known that the original SGM design solves the two problems of the generative trilemma: i) sampling quality, and ii) sampling diversity. However, the last problem of the trilemma was not solved, i.e., their training/sampling complexity is notoriously high. To this end, distilling SGMs into simpler models, e.g., generative adversarial networks (GANs), is gathering much attention currently. We present an enhanced distillation method, called straight-path interpolation GAN (SPI-GAN), which can be compared to the state-of-the-art shortcut-based distillation method, called denoising diffusion GAN (DD-GAN). However, our method corresponds to an extreme method that does not use any intermediate shortcut information of the reverse SDE path, in which case DD-GAN fails to obtain good results. Nevertheless, our straight-path interpolation method greatly stabilizes the overall training process. As a result, SPI-GAN is one of the best models in terms of the sampling quality/diversity/time for CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ-256, and LSUN-Church-256.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
