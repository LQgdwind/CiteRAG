      "content": "Paper Title: Large scale three-dimensional manufacturing tolerant stress-constrained topology optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract [Summary]In topology optimization, the treatment of stress constraints for very large scale problems has so far not been tractable due to the failure of robust agglomeration methods, i.e. their inability to accurately handle the locality of the stress constraints. This paper presents a three-dimensional design methodology that alleviates this shortcoming using both deterministic and robust problem formulations. The robust formulation, based on the three-field density projection approach, is extended to handle manufacturing uncertainty in three-dimensional stress-constrained problems. Several numerical examples are solved and further post-processed with body-fitted meshes using commercial software. The numerical investigations demonstrate that: (1) the employed solution approach based on the augmented Lagrangian method is able to handle large problems, with hundreds of millions of stress constraints; (2) if appropriate interpolation parameters are adopted, voxel-based (fixed grid) models can be used to compute von Mises stresses with excellent accuracy; and (3) in order to ensure manufacturing tolerance in three-dimensional stress-constrained topology optimization, a combination of double filtering and more than three realizations may be required.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper.
