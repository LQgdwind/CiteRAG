Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Enhancing team performance with transfer learning during real-world human-robot collaborative learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Socially aware robots should be able, among others, to support fluent human-robot collaboration in tasks that require interdependent actions in order to be solved. Towards enhancing mutual performance, collaborative robots should be equipped with adaptation and learning capabilities. However, co-learning can be a time consuming procedure. For this reason, transferring knowledge from an expert could potentially boost the overall team performance. In the present study, transfer learning was integrated in a deep Reinforcement Learning (dRL) agent. In a real-time and real-world set-up, two groups of participants had to collaborate with a cobot under two different conditions of dRL agents; one that was transferring knowledge and one that did not. A probabilistic policy reuse method was used for the transfer learning (TL). The results showed that there was a significant difference between the performance of the two groups; TL halved the time needed for the training of new participants to the task. Moreover, TL also affected the subjective performance of the teams and enhanced the perceived fluency. Finally, in many cases the objective performance metrics did not correlate with the subjective ones providing interesting insights about the design of transparent and explainable cobot behaviour.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
