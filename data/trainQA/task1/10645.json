Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Embracing the black box: Heading towards foundation models for causal discovery from time series data\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Causal discovery from time series data encompasses many existing solutions, including those based on deep learning techniques. However, these methods typically do not endorse one of the most prevalent paradigms in deep learning: End-to-end learning. To address this gap, we explore what we call Causal Pretraining. A methodology that aims to learn a direct mapping from multivariate time series to the underlying causal graphs in a supervised manner. Our empirical findings suggest that causal discovery in a supervised manner is possible, assuming that the training and test time series samples share most of their dynamics. More importantly, we found evidence that the performance of Causal Pretraining can increase with data and model size, even if the additional data do not share the same dynamics. Further, we provide examples where causal discovery for real-world data with causally pretrained neural networks is possible within limits. We argue that this hints at the possibility of a foundation model for causal discovery.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
