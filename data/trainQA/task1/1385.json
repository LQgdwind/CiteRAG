Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Sequence-to-Sequence Predictive Model: From Prosody To Communicative Gestures\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Communicative gestures and speech acoustic are tightly linked. Our objective is to predict the timing of gestures according to the acoustic. That is, we want to predict when a certain gesture occurs. We develop a model based on a recurrent neural network with attention mechanism. The model is trained on a corpus of natural dyadic interaction where the speech acoustic and the gesture phases and types have been annotated. The input of the model is a sequence of speech acoustic and the output is a sequence of gesture classes. The classes we are using for the model output is based on a combination of gesture phases and gesture types. We use a sequence comparison technique to evaluate the model performance. We find that the model can predict better certain gesture classes than others. We also perform ablation studies which reveal that fundamental frequency is a relevant feature for gesture prediction task. In another sub-experiment, we find that including eyebrow movements as acting as beat gesture improves the performance. Besides, we also find that a model trained on the data of one given speaker also works for the other speaker of the same conversation. We also perform a subjective experiment to measure how respondents judge the naturalness, the time consistency, and the semantic consistency of the generated gesture timing of a virtual agent. Our respondents rate the output of our model favorably.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
