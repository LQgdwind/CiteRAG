Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Phantom: Constraining Generative Artificial Intelligence Models for Practical Domain Specific Peripherals Trace Synthesizing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) is the de facto interconnect standard for high-speed peripherals and CPUs. Prototyping and optimizing PCIe devices for emerging scenarios is an ongoing challenge. Since Transaction Layer Packets (TLPs) capture device-CPU interactions, it is crucial to analyze and generate realistic TLP traces for effective device design and optimization. Generative AI offers a promising approach for creating intricate, custom TLP traces necessary for PCIe hardware and software development. However, existing models often generate impractical traces due to the absence of PCIe-specific constraints, such as TLP ordering and causality. This paper presents Phantom, the first framework that treats TLP trace generation as a generative AI problem while incorporating PCIe-specific constraints. We validate Phantom’s effectiveness by generating TLP traces for an actual PCIe network interface card. Experimental results show that Phantom produces practical, large-scale TLP traces, significantly outperforming existing models, with improvements of up to 1000× in task-specific metrics and up to 2.19× in Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) compared to backbone-only methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
