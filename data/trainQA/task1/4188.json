Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Tree-constrained Pointer Generator for End-to-end Contextual Speech Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Contextual knowledge is important for real-world automatic speech recognition (ASR) applications. In this paper, a novel tree-constrained pointer generator (TCPGen) component is proposed that incorporates such knowledge as a list of biasing words into both attention-based encoder-decoder and transducer end-to-end ASR models in a neural-symbolic way. TCPGen structures the biasing words into an efficient prefix tree to serve as its symbolic input and creates a neural shortcut between the tree and the final ASR output distribution to facilitate recognising biasing words during decoding. Systems were trained and evaluated on the Librispeech corpus where biasing words were extracted at the scales of an utterance, a chapter, or a book to simulate different application scenarios. Experimental results showed that TCPGen consistently improved word error rates (WERs) compared to the baselines, and in particular, achieved significant WER reductions on the biasing words. TCPGen is highly efficient: it can handle 5,000 biasing words and distractors and only add a small overhead to memory use and computation cost.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
