Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: BioTABQA: Instruction Learning for Biomedical Table Question Answering\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Table Question Answering (TQA) is an important but under-explored task. Most of the existing QA datasets are in unstructured text format and only few of them use tables as the context. To the best of our knowledge, none of TQA datasets exist in the biomedical domain where tables are frequently used to present information. In this paper, we first curate a table question answering dataset, BioTabQA, using 22 templates and the context from a biomedical textbook on differential diagnosis. BioTabQA can not only be used to teach a model how to answer questions from tables but also evaluate how a model generalizes to unseen questions, an important scenario for biomedical applications. To achieve the generalization evaluation, we divide the templates into 17 training and 5 cross-task evaluations. Then, we develop two baselines using single and multi-tasks learning on BioTabQA. Furthermore, we explore instructional learning, a recent technique showing impressive generalizing performance. Experimental results show that our instruction-tuned model outperforms single and multi task baselines on an average by ∼23%similar-toabsentpercent23\\sim 23\\% and ∼6%similar-toabsentpercent6\\sim 6\\% across various evaluation settings, and more importantly, instruction-tuned model outperforms baselines by ∼5%similar-toabsentpercent5\\sim 5\\% on cross-tasks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
