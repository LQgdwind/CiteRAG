Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Indoor Localization Techniques Within a Home Monitoring Platform\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper details a number of indoor localization techniques developed for real-time monitoring of older adults. These were developed within the framework of the i-Light research project that was funded by the European Union. The project targeted the development and initial evaluation of a configurable and cost-effective cyber-physical system for monitoring the safety of older adults who are living in their own homes. Localization hardware consists of a number of custom-developed devices that replace existing luminaires. In addition to lighting capabilities, they measure the strength of a Bluetooth Low Energy signal emitted by a wearable device on the user. Readings are recorded in real time and sent to a software server for analysis. We present a comparative evaluation of the accuracy achieved by several server-side algorithms, including Kalman filtering, a look-back heuristic as well as a neural network-based approach. It is known that approaches based on measuring signal strength are sensitive to the placement of walls, construction materials used, the presence of doors as well as existing furniture. As such, we evaluate the proposed approaches in two separate locations having distinct building characteristics. We show that the proposed techniques improve the accuracy of localization. As the final step, we evaluate our results against comparable existing approaches.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
