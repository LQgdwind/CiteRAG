Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: No Free Lunch in Self Supervised Representation Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Self-supervised representation learning in computer vision relies heavily on hand-crafted image transformations to learn meaningful and invariant features. However few extensive explorations of the impact of transformation design have been conducted in the literature. In particular, the dependence of downstream performances to transformation design has been established, but not studied in depth. In this work, we explore this relationship, its impact on a domain other than natural images, and show that designing the transformations can be viewed as a form of supervision. First, we demonstrate that not only do transformations have an effect on downstream performance and relevance of clustering, but also that each category in a supervised dataset can be impacted in a different way. Following this, we explore the impact of transformation design on microscopy images, a domain where the difference between classes is more subtle and fuzzy than in natural images. In this case, we observe a greater impact on downstream tasks performances. Finally, we demonstrate that transformation design can be leveraged as a form of supervision, as careful selection of these by a domain expert can lead to a drastic increase in performance on a given downstream task.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
