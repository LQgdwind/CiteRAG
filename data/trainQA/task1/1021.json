      "content": "Paper Title: Metaheuristics for the Online Printing Shop Scheduling Problem\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this work, the online printing shop scheduling problem is considered. This challenging real-world scheduling problem, that emerged in the present-day printing industry, corresponds to a flexible job shop scheduling problem with sequencing flexibility; and it presents several complicating requirements such as resumable operations, periods of unavailability of the machines, sequence-dependent setup times, partial overlapping between operations with precedence constraints, and fixed operations, among others. A local search strategy and metaheuristics are proposed and evaluated. Based on a common representation scheme, trajectory and populational metaheuristics are considered. Extensive numerical experiments on large-sized instances show that the proposed methods are suitable for solving practical instances of the problem; and that they outperform a half-heuristic-half-exact off-the-shelf solver by a large extent. In addition, numerical experiments on classical instances of the flexible job shop scheduling problem show that the proposed methods are also competitive when applied to this particular case. Key words: Metaheuristics, Local search, Flexible job shop scheduling, Sequencing flexibility, Online printing shop scheduling. Mathematics Subject Classification (2010): 90B35, 90C11, 90C59.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 50\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
