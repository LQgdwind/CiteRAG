Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 58 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Learning for Multivariate Time Series Imputation: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The ubiquitous missing values cause the multivariate time series data to be partially observed, destroying the integrity of time series and hindering the effective time series data analysis. Recently deep learning imputation methods have demonstrated remarkable success in elevating the quality of corrupted time series data, subsequently enhancing performance in downstream tasks. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the recently proposed deep learning imputation methods. First, we propose a taxonomy for the reviewed methods, and then provide a structured review of these methods by highlighting their strengths and limitations. We also conduct empirical experiments to study different methods and compare their enhancement for downstream tasks. Finally, the open issues for future research on multivariate time series imputation are pointed out. All code and configurations of this work, including a regularly maintained multivariate time series imputation paper list, can be found in the GitHub repository https://github.com/WenjieDu/Awesome_Imputation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 58\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
