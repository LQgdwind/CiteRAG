      "content": "Paper Title: Direct sum theorems beyond query complexity\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A fundamental question in computer science is: Is it harder to solve nùëõn instances independently than to solve them simultaneously? This question, known as the direct sum question or direct sum theorem, has been paid much attention in several research fields including query complexity, communication complexity and information theory. Despite its importance, however, little has been discovered in many other research fields. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that extends to classical/quantum query complexity, PAC-learning for machine learning, statistical estimation theory, and more. Within this framework, we establish several fundamental direct sum theorems. The main contributions of this paper include: (i) establishing a complete characterization of the amortized query/oracle complexities, and (ii) proving tight direct sum theorems when the error is small. Note that in our framework, every oracle access needs to be performed classically, even though our framework is capable of both classical and quantum scenarios. This can be thought of one limitation of this work. As a direct consequence of our results, we obtain: ‚Ä¢ The first known asymptotic separation of the randomized query complexity. Specifically, we show that there is a function f:{0,1}k‚Üí{0,1}:ùëì‚Üísuperscript01ùëò01f:\\{0,1\\}^{k}\\to\\{0,1\\} and small error Œµ>0ùúÄ0\\varepsilon>0 such that solving nùëõn instances simultaneously requires the query complexity O~‚Äã(n‚Äãk)~ùëÇùëõùëò\\tilde{O}(n\\sqrt{k}) but solving one instance with the same error has the complexity Œ©~‚Äã(k)~Œ©ùëò\\tilde{\\Omega}(k). In communication complexity this type of separation was previously given in Feder, Kushilevitz, Naor and Nisan (1995). ‚Ä¢ The query complexity counterpart of the ‚Äúinformation = amortized communication‚Äù relation, one of the most influential results in communication complexity shown by Braverman and Rao (2011) and further investigated by Braverman (2015). ‚Ä¢ A partial answer to an open question given in Jain, Klauck and Santha (2010), by showing a tighter direct sum theorem. ‚Ä¢ A complete answer to the open problem given in Blais and Brody (2019) by exhibiting a counterexample. We hope that our results will provide further interesting applications in the future.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
