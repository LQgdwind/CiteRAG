Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 66 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Continuous Metrics on Atomic Clouds of Unordered Points\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The most fundamental model of a molecule is a cloud of unordered atoms, even without chemical bonds that can depend on thresholds for distances and angles. The strongest equivalence between clouds of atoms is rigid motion, which is a composition of translations and rotations. The existing datasets of experimental and simulated molecules require a continuous quantification of similarity in terms of a distance metric. While clouds of mùëöm ordered points were continuously classified by Lagrange‚Äôs quadratic forms (distance matrices or Gram matrices), their extensions to mùëöm unordered points are impractical due to the exponential number of m!ùëöm! permutations. We propose new metrics that are continuous in general position and are computable in a polynomial time in the number mùëöm of unordered points in any Euclidean space of a fixed dimension nùëõn.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 66 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
