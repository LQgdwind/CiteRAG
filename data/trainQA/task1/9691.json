      "content": "Paper Title: Distribution-Free Proofs of Proximity\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Motivated by the fact that input distributions are often unknown in advance, distribution-free property testing considers a setting in which the algorithmic task is to accept functions f:[n]→{0,1}:𝑓→delimited-[]𝑛01f:[n]\\to\\{0,1\\} having a certain property ΠΠ\\Pi and reject functions that are ε𝜀\\varepsilon-far from ΠΠ\\Pi, where the distance is measured according to an arbitrary and unknown input distribution 𝒟∼[n]similar-to𝒟delimited-[]𝑛\\mathcal{D}\\sim[n]. As usual in property testing, the tester is required to do so while making only a sublinear number of input queries, but as the distribution is unknown, we also allow a sublinear number of samples from the distribution 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}. In this work we initiate the study of distribution-free interactive proofs of proximity (df-𝖨𝖯𝖯𝖨𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{IPP}) in which the distribution-free testing algorithm is assisted by an all powerful but untrusted prover. Our main result is a df-𝖨𝖯𝖯𝖨𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{IPP} for any problem Π∈𝖭𝖢Π𝖭𝖢\\Pi\\in\\mathsf{NC}, with O~​(n)~𝑂𝑛\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n}) communication, sample, query, and verification complexities, for any proximity parameter ε>1/n𝜀1𝑛\\varepsilon>1/\\sqrt{n}. For such proximity parameters, this result matches the parameters of the best-known general purpose 𝖨𝖯𝖯𝖨𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{IPP}s in the standard uniform setting, and is optimal under reasonable cryptographic assumptions. For general values of the proximity parameter ε𝜀\\varepsilon, our distribution-free 𝖨𝖯𝖯𝖨𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{IPP} has optimal query complexity O​(1/ε)𝑂1𝜀O(1/\\varepsilon) but the communication complexity is O~​(ε⋅n+1/ε)~𝑂⋅𝜀𝑛1𝜀\\tilde{O}(\\varepsilon\\cdot n+1/\\varepsilon), which is worse than what is known for uniform 𝖨𝖯𝖯𝖨𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{IPP}s when ε<1/n𝜀1𝑛\\varepsilon<1/\\sqrt{n}. With the aim of improving on this gap, we further show that for 𝖨𝖯𝖯𝖨𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{IPP}s over specialised, but large distribution families, such as sufficiently smooth distributions and product distributions, the communication complexity can be reduced to ε⋅n⋅(1/ε)o​(1)⋅𝜀𝑛superscript1𝜀𝑜1\\varepsilon\\cdot n\\cdot(1/\\varepsilon)^{o(1)} (keeping the query complexity roughly the same as before) to match the communication complexity of the uniform case. In addition, we show that for certain natural families of languages, such as symmetric and (relaxed) self-correctable languages, it is possible to further improve the efficiency of distribution-free 𝖨𝖯𝖯𝖨𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{IPP}s.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
