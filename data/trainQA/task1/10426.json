      "content": "Paper Title: APPROXIMATING THE SMALLEST 𝐾-ENCLOSING GEODESIC DISC IN A SIMPLE POLYGONThis research was funded in part by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC). A preliminary version of this paper appeared in WADS 2023 [16]. A full version of this paper also appeared as a chapter in Anthony D’Angelo’s thesis [24]. This paper has undergone minor corrections since publication.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We consider the problem of finding a geodesic disc of smallest radius containing at least k𝑘k points from a set of n𝑛n points in a simple polygon that has m𝑚m vertices, r𝑟r of which are reflex vertices. We refer to such a disc as a SKEG disc. We present an algorithm to compute a SKEG disc using higher-order geodesic Voronoi diagrams with worst-case time O​(k2​n+k2​r+min⁡(k​r,r​(n−k))+m)𝑂superscript𝑘2𝑛superscript𝑘2𝑟𝑘𝑟𝑟𝑛𝑘𝑚O(k^{2}n+k^{2}r+\\min(kr,r(n-k))+m) ignoring polylogarithmic factors. We then present two 222-approximation algorithms that find a geodesic disc containing at least k𝑘k points whose radius is at most twice that of a SKEG disc. The first algorithm computes a 222-approximation with high probability in O​((n2/k)​log⁡n​log⁡r+m)𝑂superscript𝑛2𝑘𝑛𝑟𝑚O((n^{2}/k)\\log n\\log r+m) worst-case time with O​(n+m)𝑂𝑛𝑚O(n+m) space. The second algorithm runs in O​(n​log2⁡n​log⁡r+m)𝑂𝑛superscript2𝑛𝑟𝑚O(n\\log^{2}n\\log r+m) expected time using O​(n+m)𝑂𝑛𝑚O(n+m) expected space, independent of k𝑘k.
