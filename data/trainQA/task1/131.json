      "content": "Paper Title: Low Overhead Online Data Flow Tracking for Intermittently Powered Non-volatile FPGAs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Energy harvesting is an attractive way to power future IoT devices since it can eliminate the need for battery or power cables. However, harvested energy is intrinsically unstable. While FPGAs have been widely adopted in various embedded systems, it is hard to survive unstable power since all the memory components in FPGA are based on volatile SRAMs. The emerging non-volatile memory based FPGAs provide promising potentials to keep configuration data on the chip during power outages. Few works have considered implementing efficient runtime intermediate data checkpoint on non-volatile FPGAs. To realize accumulative computation under intermittent power on FPGA, this paper proposes a low-cost design framework, Data-Flow-Tracking FPGA (DFT-FPGA), which utilizes binary counters to track intermediate data flow. Instead of keeping all on-chip intermediate data, DFT-FPGA only targets on necessary data that is labeled by off-line analysis and identified by an online tracking system. The evaluation shows that compared with state-of-the-art techniques, DFT-FPGA can realize accumulative computing with less off-line workload and significantly reduce online roll-back time and resource utilization. This paper has been accepted by ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems (JETC).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
