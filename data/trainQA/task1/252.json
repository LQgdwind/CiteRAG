Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: On the complexity of evaluating highest weight vectors\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Geometric complexity theory (GCT) is an approach towards separating algebraic complexity classes through algebraic geometry and representation theory. Originally Mulmuley and Sohoni proposed (SIAM J Comput 2001, 2008) to use occurrence obstructions to prove Valiant‚Äôs determinant vs permament conjecture, but recently B√ºrgisser, Ikenmeyer, and Panova (Journal of the AMS 2019) proved this impossible. However, fundamental theorems of algebraic geometry and representation theory grant that every lower bound in GCT can be proved by the use of so-called highest weight vectors (HWVs). In the setting of interest in GCT (namely in the setting of polynomials) we prove the NP-hardness of the evaluation of HWVs in general, and we give efficient algorithms if the treewidth of the corresponding Young-tableau is small, where the point of evaluation is concisely encoded as a noncommutative algebraic branching program! In particular, this gives a large new class of separating functions that can be efficiently evaluated at points with low (border) Waring rank. As a structural side result we prove that border Waring rank is bounded from above by the ABP width complexity.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
