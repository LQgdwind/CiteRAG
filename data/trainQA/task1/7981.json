Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Semiconductor Fab Scheduling with Self-Supervised and Reinforcement LearningThis work was funded by KWF project 28472, cms electronics GmbH, FunderMax GmbH, Hirsch Armbänder GmbH, incubed IT GmbH, Infineon Technologies Austria AG, Isovolta AG, Kostwein Holding GmbH, and Privatstiftung Kärntner Sparkasse.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Semiconductor manufacturing is a notoriously complex and costly multi-step process involving a long sequence of operations on expensive and quantity-limited equipment. Recent chip shortages and their impacts have highlighted the importance of semiconductors in the global supply chains and how reliant on those our daily lives are. Due to the investment cost, environmental impact, and time scale needed to build new factories, it is difficult to ramp up production when demand spikes. This work introduces a method to successfully learn to schedule a semiconductor manufacturing facility more efficiently using deep reinforcement and self-supervised learning. We propose the first adaptive scheduling approach to handle complex, continuous, stochastic, dynamic, modern semiconductor manufacturing models. Our method outperforms the traditional hierarchical dispatching strategies typically used in semiconductor manufacturing plants, substantially reducing each order’s tardiness and time until completion. As a result, our method yields a better allocation of resources in the semiconductor manufacturing process.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
