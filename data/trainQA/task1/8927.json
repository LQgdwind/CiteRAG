Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Diagnostic Spatio-temporal Transformer with Faithful Encoding\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper addresses the task of anomaly diagnosis when the underlying data generation process has a complex spatio-temporal (ST) dependency. The key technical challenge is to extract actionable insights from the dependency tensor characterizing high-order interactions among temporal and spatial indices. We formalize the problem as supervised dependency discovery, where the ST dependency is learned as a side product of multivariate time-series classification. We show that temporal positional encoding used in existing ST transformer works has a serious limitation in capturing higher frequencies (short time scales). We propose a new positional encoding with a theoretical guarantee, based on discrete Fourier transform. We also propose a new ST dependency discovery framework, which can provide readily consumable diagnostic information in both spatial and temporal directions. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed model, DFStrans (Diagnostic Fourier-based Spatio-temporal Transformer), in a real industrial application of building elevator control.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
