Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Meta-learning Framework for Tuning Parameters of Protection Mechanisms in Trustworthy Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Trustworthy Federated Learning (TFL) typically leverages protection mechanisms to guarantee privacy. However, protection mechanisms inevitably introduce utility loss or efficiency reduction while protecting data privacy. Therefore, protection mechanisms and their parameters should be carefully chosen to strike an optimal tradeoff between privacy leakage, utility loss, and efficiency reduction. To this end, federated learning practitioners need tools to measure the three factors and optimize the tradeoff between them to choose the protection mechanism that is most appropriate to the application at hand. Motivated by this requirement, we propose a framework that (1) formulates TFL as a problem of finding a protection mechanism to optimize the tradeoff between privacy leakage, utility loss, and efficiency reduction and (2) formally defines bounded measurements of the three factors. We then propose a meta-learning algorithm to approximate this optimization problem and find optimal protection parameters for representative protection mechanisms, including Randomization, Homomorphic Encryption, Secret Sharing, and Compression. We further design estimation algorithms to quantify these found optimal protection parameters in a practical horizontal federated learning setting and provide a theoretical analysis of the estimation error.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 42 most likely reference titles for this paper.
