Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: 2-Layer ùëò-Planar Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The 222-layer drawing model is a well-established paradigm to visualize bipartite graphs. Several beyond-planar graph classes have been studied under this model. Surprisingly, however, the fundamental class of kùëòk-planar graphs has been considered only for k=1ùëò1k=1 in this context. We provide several contributions that address this gap in the literature. First, we show tight density bounds for the classes of 222-layer kùëòk-planar graphs with k‚àà{2,3,4,5}ùëò2345k\\in\\{2,3,4,5\\}. Based on these results, we provide a Crossing Lemma for 222-layer kùëòk-planar graphs, which then implies a general density bound for 222-layer kùëòk-planar graphs. We prove this bound to be almost optimal with a corresponding lower bound construction. Finally, we study relationships between kùëòk-planarity and h‚Ñéh-quasiplanarity in the 222-layer model and show that 222-layer kùëòk-planar graphs have pathwidth at most k+1ùëò1k+1.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
