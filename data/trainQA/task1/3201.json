Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Pose-driven Attention-guided Image Generation for Person Re-Identification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Person re-identification (re-ID) concerns the matching of subject images across different camera views in a multi camera surveillance system. One of the major challenges in person re-ID is pose variations across the camera network, which significantly affects the appearance of a person. Existing development data lack adequate pose variations to carry out effective training of person re-ID systems. To solve this issue, in this paper we propose an end-to-end pose-driven attention-guided generative adversarial network, to generate multiple poses of a person. We propose to attentively learn and transfer the subject pose through an attention mechanism. A semantic-consistency loss is proposed to preserve the semantic information of the person during pose transfer. To ensure fine image details are realistic after pose translation, an appearance discriminator is used while a pose discriminator is used to ensure the pose of the transferred images will exactly be the same as the target pose. We show that by incorporating the proposed approach in a person re-identification framework, realistic pose transferred images and state-of-the-art re-identification results can be achieved.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
