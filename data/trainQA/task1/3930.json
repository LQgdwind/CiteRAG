To do this, we use persistent homology (PH), which allows one to algorithmically detect geometric voids in a data set and quantify the persistence of such voids. We construct an efficient filtered simplicial complex (FSC) such that the voids in our FSC are in one-to-one correspondence with the anomalies. Our approach goes beyond simply identifying anomalies; it also encodes information about the relationships between anomalies. We use vineyards, which one can interpret as time-varying persistence diagrams (which are an approach for visualizing PH), to track how the locations of the anomalies change with time. We conduct two case studies using spatially heterogeneous COVID-19 data. First, we examine vaccination rates in New York City by zip code at a single point in time. Second, we study a year-long data set of COVID-19 case rates in neighborhoods of the city of Los Angeles.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
