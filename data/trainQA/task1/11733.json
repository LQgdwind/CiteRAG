Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Stimulus-to-stimulus learning in RNNs with cortical inductive biases\n\nPaper Abstract: Summary Animals learn to predict external contingencies from experience through a process of conditioning. A natural mechanism for conditioning is stimulus substitution, whereby the neuronal response to a stimulus with no prior behavioral significance becomes increasingly identical to that generated by a behaviorally significant stimulus it reliably predicts. We propose a recurrent neural network model of stimulus substitution which leverages two forms of inductive bias pervasive in the cortex: representational inductive bias in the form of mixed stimulus representations, and architectural inductive bias in the form of two-compartment pyramidal neurons that have been shown to serve as a fundamental unit of cortical associative learning. The properties of these neurons allow for a biologically plausible learning rule that implements stimulus substitution, utilizing only information available locally at the synapses. We show that the model generates a wide array of conditioning phenomena, and can learn large numbers of associations with an amount of training commensurate with animal experiments, without relying on parameter fine-tuning for each individual experimental task. In contrast, we show that commonly used Hebbian rules fail to learn generic stimulus-stimulus associations with mixed selectivity, and require task-specific parameter fine-tuning. Our framework highlights the importance of multi-compartment neuronal processing in the cortex, and showcases how it might confer cortical animals the evolutionary edge.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
