Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer.

      "content": "Paper Title: Effective Quadratic Error Bounds for Floating-Point Algorithms Computing the Hypotenuse Function\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We provide tools to help automate the error analysis of algorithms that evaluate simple functions over the floating-point numbers. The aim is to obtain tight relative error bounds for these algorithms, expressed as a function of the unit round-off. Due to the discrete nature of the set of floating-point numbers, the largest errors are often intrinsically ‚Äúarithmetic‚Äù in the sense that their appearance may depend on specific bit patterns in the binary representations of intermediate variables, which may be present only for some precisions. We focus on generic (i.e., parameterized by the precision) and analytic over-estimations that still capture the correlations between the errors made at each step of the algorithms. Using methods from computer algebra, which we adapt to the particular structure of the polynomial systems that encode the errors, we obtain bounds with a linear term in the unit round-off that is sharp in many cases. An explicit quadratic bound is given, rather than the O‚Äã()ùëÇO()-estimate that is more common in this area. This is particularly important when using low precision formats, which are increasingly common in modern processors. Using this approach, we compare five algorithms for computing the hypotenuse function, ranging from elementary to quite challenging.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
