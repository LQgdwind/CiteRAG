      "content": "Paper Title: TPMS2STEP: error-controlled and ùê∂¬≤ continuity-preserving translation of TPMS models to STEP files based on constrained-PIA\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) is emerging as an important way of designing microstructures. However, there has been limited use of commercial CAD/CAM/CAE software packages for TPMS design and manufacturing. This is mainly because TPMS is consistently described in the functional representation (F-rep) format, while modern CAD/CAM/CAE tools are built upon the boundary representation (B-rep) format. One possible solution to this gap is translating TPMS to STEP, which is the standard data exchange format of CAD/CAM/CAE. Following this direction, this paper proposes a new translation method with error-controlling and C2superscriptùê∂2C^{2} continuity-preserving features. It is based on an approximation error-driven TPMS sampling algorithm and a constrained-PIA algorithm. The sampling algorithm controls the deviation between the original and translated models. With it, an error bound of 2‚Äãœµ2italic-œµ2\\epsilon on the deviation can be ensured if two conditions called œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-density and œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-approximation are satisfied. The constrained-PIA algorithm enforces C2superscriptùê∂2C^{2} continuity constraints during TPMS approximation, and meanwhile attaining high efficiency. A theoretical convergence proof of this algorithm is also given. The effectiveness of the translation method has been demonstrated by a series of examples and comparisons.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
