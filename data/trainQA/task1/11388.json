Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Dual-Channel Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm Based on Adaptive Balance Search\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The balance between exploration (Er) and exploitation (Ei) determines the generalization performance of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm on different problems. Although the insufficient balance caused by global best being located near a local minimum has been widely researched, few scholars have systematically paid attention to two behaviors about personal best position (P) and global best position (G) existing in PSO: P’s uncontrollable-exploitation and involuntary-exploration guidance behavior, and G’s full-time and global guidance behavior, each of which negatively affects the balance of Er and Ei. With regards to this, we firstly discuss the two behaviors, unveiling the mechanisms by which they affect the balance, and further pinpoint three key points for better balancing Er and Ei: eliminating the coupling between P and G, empowering P with controllable-exploitation and voluntary-exploration guidance behavior, controlling G’s full-time and global guidance behavior. Then, we present a dual-channel PSO algorithm based on adaptive balance search (DCPSO-ABS). This algorithm entails a dual-channel framework to mitigate the interaction of P and G, aiding in regulating the behaviors of P and G, and meanwhile an adaptive balance search strategy for empowering P with voluntary-exploration and controllable-exploitation guidance behavior as well as adaptively controlling G’s full-time and global guidance behavior. Finally, three kinds of experiments on 57 benchmark functions are designed to demonstrate that our proposed algorithm has stronger generalization performance than selected state-of-the-art algorithms.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
