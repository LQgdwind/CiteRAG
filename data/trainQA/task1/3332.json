We thank Helena Bergold for many valuable comments and Ralf Hoffmann, Sven Grottke, and Norbert Paschedag for the technical support.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A famous result by Erdős and Szekeres (1935) asserts that, for all k,d∈ℕ𝑘𝑑ℕk,d\\in\\mathbb{N}, there is a smallest integer n=g(d)​(k)𝑛superscript𝑔𝑑𝑘n=g^{(d)}(k) such that every set of at least n𝑛n points in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} in general position contains a k𝑘k-gon, that is, a subset of k𝑘k points which is in convex position. In this article, we present a SAT model based on acyclic chirotopes (oriented matroids) to investigate Erdős–Szekeres numbers in small dimensions. To solve the SAT instances we use modern SAT solvers and all our unsatisfiability results are verified using DRAT certificates. We show g(3)​(7)=13superscript𝑔3713g^{(3)}(7)=13, g(4)​(8)≤13superscript𝑔4813g^{(4)}(8)\\leq 13, and g(5)​(9)≤13superscript𝑔5913g^{(5)}(9)\\leq 13, which are the first improvements for decades. For the setting of k𝑘k-holes (i.e., k𝑘k-gons with no other points in the convex hull), where h(d)​(k)superscriptℎ𝑑𝑘h^{(d)}(k) denotes the minimum number n𝑛n such that every set of at least n𝑛n points in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} in general position contains a k𝑘k-hole, we show h(3)​(7)≤14superscriptℎ3714h^{(3)}(7)\\leq 14, h(4)​(8)≤13superscriptℎ4813h^{(4)}(8)\\leq 13, and h(5)​(9)≤13superscriptℎ5913h^{(5)}(9)\\leq 13. Moreover, all obtained bounds are sharp in the setting of acyclic chirotopes and we conjecture them to be sharp also in the original setting of point sets. As a byproduct, we verify previously known bounds. In particular, we present the first computer-assisted proof of the upper bound h(2)​(6)≤g(2)​(9)≤1717superscriptℎ26superscript𝑔291717h^{(2)}(6)\\leq g^{(2)}(9)\\leq 1717 by Gerken (2008).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
