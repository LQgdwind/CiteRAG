Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: How VADER is your AI? Towards a definition of artificial intelligence systems appropriate for regulation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Artificial intelligence (AI) has driven many information and communication technology (ICT) breakthroughs. Nonetheless, the scope of ICT systems has expanded far beyond AI since the Turing test proposal. Critically, recent AI regulation proposals adopt AI definitions affecting ICT techniques, approaches, and systems that are not AI. In some cases, even works from mathematics, statistics, and engineering would be affected. Worryingly, AI misdefinitions are observed from Western societies to the Global South. In this paper, we propose a framework to score how validated as appropriately-defined for regulation (VADER) an AI definition is. Our online, publicly-available VADER framework scores the coverage of premises that should underlie AI definitions for regulation, which aim to (i) reproduce principles observed in other successful technology regulations, and (ii) include all AI techniques and approaches while excluding non-AI works. Regarding the latter, our score is based on a dataset of representative AI, non-AI ICT, and non-ICT examples. We demonstrate our contribution by reviewing the AI regulation proposals of key players, namely the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, and Brazil. Importantly, none of the proposals assessed achieve the appropriateness score, ranging from a revision need to a concrete risk to ICT systems and works from other fields.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
