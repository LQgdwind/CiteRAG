      "content": "Paper Title: Improved Approximation Factor for Adaptive Influence Maximization via Simple Greedy Strategies\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In the adaptive influence maximization problem, we are given a social network and a budget kùëòk, and we iteratively select kùëòk nodes, called seeds, in order to maximize the expected number of nodes that are reached by an influence cascade that they generate according to a stochastic model for influence diffusion. The decision on the next seed to select is based on the observed cascade of previously selected seeds. We focus on the myopic feedback model, in which we can only observe which neighbors of previously selected seeds have been influenced and on the independent cascade model, where each edge is associated with an independent probability of diffusing influence. While adaptive policies are strictly stronger than non-adaptive ones, in which all the seeds are selected beforehand, the latter are much easier to design and implement and they provide good approximation factors if the adaptivity gap, the ratio between the adaptive and the non-adaptive optima, is small. Previous works showed that the adaptivity gap is at most 444, and that simple adaptive or non-adaptive greedy algorithms guarantee an approximation of 14‚Äã(1‚àí1e)‚âà0.1581411ùëí0.158\\frac{1}{4}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{e}\\right)\\approx 0.158 for the adaptive optimum. This is the best approximation factor known so far for the adaptive influence maximization problem with myopic feedback. In this paper, we directly analyze the approximation factor of the non-adaptive greedy algorithm, without passing through the adaptivity gap, and show an improved bound of 12‚Äã(1‚àí1e)‚âà0.3161211ùëí0.316\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{e}\\right)\\approx 0.316. Therefore, the adaptivity gap is at most 2‚Äãee‚àí1‚âà3.1642ùëíùëí13.164\\frac{2e}{e-1}\\approx 3.164. To prove these bounds, we introduce a new approach to relate the greedy non-adaptive algorithm to the adaptive optimum. The new approach does not rely on multi-linear extensions or random walks on optimal decision trees, which are commonly used techniques in the field. We believe that it is of independent interest and may be used to analyze other adaptive optimization problems. Finally, we also analyze the adaptive greedy algorithm, and show that guarantees an improved approximation factor of 1‚àí1e‚âà0.39311ùëí0.3931-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{e}}\\approx 0.393.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
