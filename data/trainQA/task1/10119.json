      "content": "Paper Title: Global Convergence of Natural Policy Gradient with Hessian-aided Momentum Variance Reduction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Natural policy gradient (NPG) and its variants are widely-used policy search methods in reinforcement learning. Inspired by prior work, a new NPG variant coined NPG-HM is developed in this paper, which utilizes the Hessian-aided momentum technique for variance reduction, while the sub-problem is solved via the stochastic gradient descent method. It is shown that NPG-HM can achieve the global last iterate ŒµùúÄ\\varepsilon-optimality with a sample complexity of ùí™‚Äã(Œµ‚àí2)ùí™superscriptùúÄ2{\\cal O}(\\varepsilon^{-2}), which is the best known result for natural policy gradient type methods under the generic Fisher non-degenerate policy parameterizations. The convergence analysis is built upon a relaxed weak gradient dominance property tailored for NPG under the compatible function approximation framework, as well as a neat way to decompose the error when handling the sub-problem. Moreover, numerical experiments on Mujoco-based environments demonstrate the superior performance of NPG-HM over other state-of-the-art policy gradient methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
