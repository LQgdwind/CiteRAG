Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: RNA-2QCFA: Evolving Two-way Quantum Finite Automata with Classical States for RNA Secondary Structures\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recently, the use of mathematical methods and computer science applications have got significant response among biochemists and biologists to modeling the biological systems. The computational and mathematical methods have an enormous potential for modeling the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) structures. The modeling of DNA and RNA secondary structures using automata theory had a significant impact in the fields of computer science. It is a natural goal to model the RNA secondary biomolecular structures using quantum computational models. Two-way quantum finite automata with classical states are more dominant than two-way probabilistic finite automata in language recognition. The main objective of this paper is on using two-way quantum finite automata with classical states to simulate, model and analyze the ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequences. Keywords: ribonucleic acid, hairpin loop, formal languages, quantum finite automata, two-way finite automata with quantum and classical states, bio-molecular structures\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 50\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
