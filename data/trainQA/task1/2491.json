Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Enabling Large Neural Networks on Tiny Microcontrollers with Swapping\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Running neural networks (NNs) on microcontroller units (MCUs) is becoming increasingly important, but is very difficult due to the tiny SRAM size of MCU. Prior work proposes many algorithm-level techniques to reduce NN memory footprints, but all at the cost of sacrificing accuracy and generality, which disqualifies MCUs for many important use cases. We investigate a system solution for MCUs to execute NNs out of core: dynamically swapping NN data chunks between an MCU’s tiny SRAM and its large, low-cost external flash. Out-of-core NNs on MCUs raise multiple concerns: execution slowdown, storage wear out, energy consumption, and data security. We present a study showing that none is a showstopper; the key benefit – MCUs being able to run large NNs with full accuracy and generality – triumphs the overheads. Our findings suggest that MCUs can play a much greater role in edge intelligence.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
