Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: The sample complexity of smooth boosting and the tightness of the hardcore theorem\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Smooth boosters generate distributions that do not place too much weight on any given example. Originally introduced for their noise-tolerant properties, such boosters have also found applications in differential privacy, reproducibility, and quantum learning theory. We study and settle the sample complexity of smooth boosting: we exhibit a class that can be weak learned to Œ≥ùõæ\\gamma-advantage over smooth distributions with mùëöm samples, for which strong learning over the uniform distribution requires Œ©~‚Äã(1/Œ≥2)‚ãÖm‚ãÖ~Œ©1superscriptùõæ2ùëö\\tilde{\\Omega}(1/\\gamma^{2})\\cdot m samples. This matches the overhead of existing smooth boosters and provides the first separation from the setting of distribution-independent boosting, for which the corresponding overhead is O‚Äã(1/Œ≥)ùëÇ1ùõæO(1/\\gamma). Our work also sheds new light on Impagliazzo‚Äôs hardcore theorem from complexity theory, all known proofs of which can be cast in the framework of smooth boosting. For a function fùëìf that is mildly hard against size-sùë†s circuits, the hardcore theorem provides a set of inputs on which fùëìf is extremely hard against size-s‚Ä≤superscriptùë†‚Ä≤s^{\\prime} circuits. A downside of this important result is the loss in circuit size, i.e. that s‚Ä≤‚â™smuch-less-thansuperscriptùë†‚Ä≤ùë†s^{\\prime}\\ll s. Answering a question of Trevisan, we show that this size loss is necessary and in fact, the parameters achieved by known proofs are the best possible.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
