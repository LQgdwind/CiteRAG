Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 58 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: TRAPDOOR: Repurposing backdoors to detect dataset bias in machine learning-based genomic analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Machine Learning (ML) has achieved unprecedented performance in several applications including image, speech, text, and data analysis. Use of ML to understand underlying patterns in gene mutations (genomics) has far-reaching results, not only in overcoming diagnostic pitfalls, but also in designing treatments for life-threatening diseases like cancer. Success and sustainability of ML algorithms depends on the quality and diversity of data collected and used for training. Under-representation of groups (ethnic groups, gender groups, etc.) in such a dataset can lead to inaccurate predictions for certain groups, which can further exacerbate systemic discrimination issues. In this work, we propose TRAPDOOR, a methodology for identification of biased datasets by repurposing a technique that has been mostly proposed for nefarious purposes: Neural network backdoors. We consider a typical collaborative learning setting of the genomics supply chain, where data may come from hospitals, collaborative projects, or research institutes to a central cloud without awareness of bias against a sensitive group. In this context, we develop a methodology to leak potential bias information of the collective data without hampering the genuine performance using ML backdooring catered for genomic applications. Using a real-world cancer dataset, we analyze the dataset with the bias that already existed towards white individuals and also introduced biases in datasets artificially, and our experimental result show that TRAPDOOR can detect the presence of dataset bias with 100% accuracy, and furthermore can also extract the extent of bias by recovering the percentage with a small error.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 58\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
