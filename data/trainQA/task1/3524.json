Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-modal Entity Alignment in Hyperbolic Space\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Many AI-related tasks involve the interactions of data in multiple modalities. It has been a new trend to merge multi-modal information into knowledge graph(KG), resulting in multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKG). However, MMKGs usually suffer from low coverage and incompleteness. To mitigate this problem, a viable approach is to integrate complementary knowledge from other MMKGs. To this end, although existing entity alignment approaches could be adopted, they operate in the Euclidean space, and the resulting Euclidean entity representations can lead to large distortion of KG’s hierarchical structure. Besides, the visual information has yet not been well exploited. In response to these issues, in this work, we propose a novel multi-modal entity alignment approach, Hyperbolic multi-modal entity alignment (HMEA), which extends the Euclidean representation to hyperboloid manifold. We first adopt the Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Networks (HGCNs) to learn structural representations of entities. Regarding the visual information, we generate image embeddings using the densenet model, which are also projected into the hyperbolic space using HGCNs. Finally, we combine the structure and visual representations in the hyperbolic space and use the aggregated embeddings to predict potential alignment results. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model and its components.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
