Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Joint System-Wise Optimization for Pipeline Goal-Oriented Dialog System\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recent work Takanobu et al. (2020) proposed the system-wise evaluation on dialog systems and found that improvement on individual components (e.g., NLU, policy) in prior work may not necessarily bring benefit to pipeline systems in system-wise evaluation. To improve the system-wise performance, in this paper, we propose new joint system-wise optimization techniques for the pipeline dialog system. First, we propose a new data augmentation approach which automates the labeling process for NLU training. Second, we propose a novel stochastic policy parameterization with Poisson distribution that enables better exploration and offers a principled way to compute policy gradient. Third, we propose a reward bonus to help policy explore successful dialogs. Our approaches outperform the competitive pipeline systems from Takanobu et al. (2020) by big margins of 12% success rate in automatic system-wise evaluation and of 16% success rate in human evaluation on the standard multi-domain benchmark dataset MultiWOZ, and also outperform the recent state-of-the-art end-to-end trained model from DSTC9 Gunasekara et al. (2020).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
