      "content": "Paper Title: An equilibrated estimator for mixed finite element discretizations of the curl-curl problem\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. We propose a new a posteriori error estimator for mixed finite element discretizations of the curl-curl problem. This estimator relies on a Prager‚ÄìSynge inequality, and therefore leads to fully guaranteed constant-free upper bounds on the error. The estimator is also locally efficient and polynomial-degree-robust. The construction is based on patch-wise divergence-constrained minimization problems, leading to a cheap embarrassingly parallel algorithm. Crucially, the estimator operates without any assumption on the topology of the domain, and unconventional arguments are required to establish the reliability estimate. Numerical examples illustrate the key theoretical results, and suggest that the estimator is suited for mesh adaptivity purposes. Key words. a posteriori error estimate; electromagnetics finite element method; high order method; potential reconstruction; Prager‚ÄìSynge\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
