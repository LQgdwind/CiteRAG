      "content": "Paper Title: CommPOOL: An Interpretable Graph Pooling Framework for Hierarchical Graph Representation Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recent years have witnessed the emergence and flourishing of hierarchical graph pooling neural networks (HGPNNs) which are effective graph representation learning approaches for graph level tasks such as graph classification. However, current HGPNNs do not take full advantage of the graph’s intrinsic structures (e.g., community structure). Moreover, the pooling operations in existing HGPNNs are difficult to be interpreted. In this paper, we propose a new interpretable graph pooling framework - CommPOOL, that can capture and preserve the hierarchical community structure of graphs in the graph representation learning process. Specifically, the proposed community pooling mechanism in CommPOOL utilizes an unsupervised approach for capturing the inherent community structure of graphs in an interpretable manner. CommPOOL is a general and flexible framework for hierarchical graph representation learning that can further facilitate various graph-level tasks. Evaluations on five public benchmark datasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate the superior performance of CommPOOL in graph representation learning for graph classification compared to the state-of-the-art baseline methods, and its effectiveness in capturing and preserving the community structure of graphs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
