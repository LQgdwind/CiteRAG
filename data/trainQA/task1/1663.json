Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Deeper Look at Discounting Mismatch in Actor-Critic Algorithms\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. We investigate the discounting mismatch in actor-critic algorithm implementations from a representation learning perspective. Theoretically, actor-critic algorithms usually have discounting for both the actor and critic, i.e., there is a γtsuperscript𝛾𝑡\\gamma^{t} term in the actor update for the transition observed at time t𝑡t in a trajectory and the critic is a discounted value function. Practitioners, however, usually ignore the discounting (γtsuperscript𝛾𝑡\\gamma^{t}) for the actor while using a discounted critic. We investigate this mismatch in two scenarios. In the first scenario, we consider optimizing an undiscounted objective (γ=1)𝛾1(\\gamma=1) where γtsuperscript𝛾𝑡\\gamma^{t} disappears naturally (1t=1)superscript1𝑡1(1^{t}=1). We then propose to interpret the discounting in the critic in terms of a bias-variance-representation trade-off and provide supporting empirical results. In the second scenario, we consider optimizing a discounted objective (γ<1𝛾1\\gamma<1) and propose to interpret the omission of the discounting in the actor update from an auxiliary task perspective and provide supporting empirical results.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
