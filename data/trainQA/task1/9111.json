      "content": "Paper Title: Adaptivity Complexity for Causal Graph Discovery\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Causal discovery from interventional data is an important problem, where the task is to design an interventional strategy that learns the hidden ground truth causal graph G​(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G(V,E) on |V|=n𝑉𝑛|V|=n nodes while minimizing the number of performed interventions. Most prior interventional strategies broadly fall into two categories: non-adaptive and adaptive. Non-adaptive strategies decide on a single fixed set of interventions to be performed while adaptive strategies can decide on which nodes to intervene on sequentially based on past interventions. While adaptive algorithms may use exponentially fewer interventions than their non-adaptive counterparts, there are practical concerns that constrain the amount of adaptivity allowed. Motivated by this trade-off, we study the problem of r𝑟r-adaptivity, where the algorithm designer recovers the causal graph under a total of r𝑟r sequential rounds whilst trying to minimize the total number of interventions. For this problem, we provide a r𝑟r-adaptive algorithm that achieves O​(min⁡{r,log⁡n}⋅n1/min⁡{r,log⁡n})𝑂⋅𝑟𝑛superscript𝑛1𝑟𝑛O(\\min\\{r,\\log n\\}\\cdot n^{1/\\min\\{r,\\log n\\}}) approximation with respect to the verification number, a well-known lower bound for adaptive algorithms. Furthermore, for every r𝑟r, we show that our approximation is tight. Our definition of r𝑟r-adaptivity interpolates nicely between the non-adaptive (r=1𝑟1r=1) and fully adaptive (r=n𝑟𝑛r=n) settings where our approximation simplifies to O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) and O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) respectively, matching the best-known approximation guarantees for both extremes. Our results also extend naturally to the bounded size interventions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper.
