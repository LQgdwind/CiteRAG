Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Stochastic additive manufacturing simulation: from experiment to surface roughness and porosity prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deterministic computational modeling of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process fails to capture irregularities and roughness of the scan track, unless expensive powder-scale analysis is used. In this work we developed a stochastic computational modeling framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) capable of capturing the irregularities of LPBF scan. The model is calibrated against AFRL single track scan data using a specially designed tensor decomposition method, i.e., Higher-Order Proper Generalized Decomposition (HOPGD) that relies on non-intrusive data learning and construction of reduced order surrogate models.Once calibrated, the stochastic model can be used to predict the roughness and porosity at part scale at a significantly reduced computational cost compared to detailed powder-scale deterministic simulations. The stochastic simulation predictions are validated against AFRL multi-layer and multitrack experiments and reported as more accurate when compared with regular deterministic simulation results.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
