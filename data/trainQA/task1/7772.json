Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Simple Recipe for Competitive Low-compute Self supervised Vision Models\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Self-supervised methods in vision have been mostly focused on large architectures as they seem to suffer from a significant performance drop for smaller architectures. In this paper, we propose a simple self-supervised distillation technique that can train high performance low-compute neural networks. Our main insight is that existing joint-embedding based SSL methods can be repurposed for knowledge distillation from a large self-supervised teacher to a small student model. Thus, we call our method Replace one Branch (RoB) as it simply replaces one branch of the joint-embedding training with a large teacher model. RoB is widely applicable to a number of architectures such as small ResNets, MobileNets and ViT, and pretrained models such as DINO, SwAV or iBOT. When pretraining on the ImageNet dataset, RoB yields models that compete with supervised knowledge distillation. When applied to MSN, RoB produces students with strong semi-supervised capabilities. Finally, our best ViT-Tiny models improve over prior SSL state-of-the-art on ImageNet by 2.3%percent2.32.3\\% and are on par or better than a supervised distilled DeiT on five downstream transfer tasks (iNaturalist, CIFAR, Clevr/Count, Clevr/Dist and Places). We hope RoB enables practical self-supervision at smaller scale.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
