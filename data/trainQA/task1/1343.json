Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Cerberus: Minimalistic Multi-shard Byzantine-resilient Transaction Processing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract To enable high-performance and scalable blockchains, we need to step away from traditional consensus-based fully-replicated designs. One direction is to explore the usage of sharding in which we partition the managed dataset over many shards that‚Äîindependently‚Äîoperate as blockchains. Sharding requires an efficient fault-tolerant primitive for the ordering and execution of multi-shard transactions, however. In this work, we seek to design such a primitive suitable for distributed ledger networks with high transaction throughput. To do so, we propose Cerberus, a set of minimalistic primitives for processing single-shard and multi-shard UTXO-like transactions. Cerberus aims at maximizing parallel processing at shards while minimizing coordination within and between shards. First, we propose Core-Cerberus, that uses strict environmental requirements to enable simple yet powerful multi-shard transaction processing. In our intended UTXO-environment, Core-Cerberus will operate perfectly with respect to all transactions proposed and approved by well-behaved clients, but does not provide any guarantees for other transactions. To also support more general-purpose environments, we propose two generalizations of Core-Cerberus: we propose Optimistic-Cerberus, a protocol that does not require any additional coordination phases in the well-behaved optimistic case, while requiring intricate coordination when recovering from attacks; and we propose Pessimistic-Cerberus, a protocol that adds sufficient coordination to the well-behaved case of Core-Cerberus, allowing it to operate in a general-purpose fault-tolerant environments without significant costs to recover from attacks. Finally, we compare the three protocols, showing their potential scalability and high transaction throughput in practical environments.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
