Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Clustered Vehicular Federated Learning: Process and Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Federated Learning (FL) is expected to play a prominent role for privacy-preserving machine learning (ML) in autonomous vehicles. FL involves the collaborative training of a single ML model among edge devices on their distributed datasets while keeping data locally. While FL requires less communication compared to classical distributed learning, it remains hard to scale for large models. In vehicular networks, FL must be adapted to the limited communication resources, the mobility of the edge nodes, and the statistical heterogeneity of data distributions. Indeed, a judicious utilization of the communication resources alongside new perceptive learning-oriented methods are vital. To this end, we propose a new architecture for vehicular FL and corresponding learning and scheduling processes. The architecture utilizes vehicular-to-vehicular(V2V) resources to bypass the communication bottleneck where clusters of vehicles train models simultaneously and only the aggregate of each cluster is sent to the multi-access edge (MEC) server. The cluster formation is adapted for single and multi-task learning, and takes into account both communication and learning aspects. We show through simulations that the proposed process is capable of improving the learning accuracy in several non-independent and-identically-distributed (non-i.i.d) and unbalanced datasets distributions, under mobility constraints, in comparison to standard FL.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
