Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Natural Strategic Ability in Stochastic Multi-Agent Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Strategies synthesized using formal methods can be complex and often require infinite memory, which does not correspond to the expected behavior when trying to model Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). To capture such behaviors, natural strategies are a recently proposed framework striking a balance between the ability of agents to strategize with memory and the model-checking complexity, but until now has been restricted to fully deterministic settings. For the first time, we consider the probabilistic temporal logics 𝖯𝖠𝖳𝖫subscript𝖯𝖠𝖳𝖫absent\\mathsf{PATL_{\\mathrm{}}} and 𝖯𝖠𝖳𝖫∗superscriptsubscript𝖯𝖠𝖳𝖫absent\\mathsf{PATL_{\\mathrm{}}^{*}} under natural strategies (Nat𝖯𝖠𝖳𝖫subscript𝖯𝖠𝖳𝖫absent\\mathsf{PATL_{\\mathrm{}}} and Nat𝖯𝖠𝖳𝖫∗superscriptsubscript𝖯𝖠𝖳𝖫absent\\mathsf{PATL_{\\mathrm{}}^{*}}, resp.). As main result we show that, in stochastic MAS, Nat𝖯𝖠𝖳𝖫subscript𝖯𝖠𝖳𝖫absent\\mathsf{PATL_{\\mathrm{}}} model-checking is 𝐍𝐏𝐍𝐏\\mathbf{{NP}}-complete when the active coalition is restricted to deterministic strategies.
