Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 59 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Unifying Relational Sentence Generation and Retrieval for Medical Image Report Composition\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Beyond generating long and topic-coherent paragraphs in traditional captioning tasks, the medical image report composition task poses more task-oriented challenges by requiring both the highly-accurate medical term diagnosis and multiple heterogeneous forms of information including impression and findings. Current methods often generate the most common sentences due to dataset bias for individual case, regardless of whether the sentences properly capture key entities and relationships. Such limitations severely hinder their applicability and generalization capability in medical report composition where the most critical sentences lie in the descriptions of abnormal diseases that are relatively rare. Moreover, some medical terms appearing in one report are often entangled with each other and co-occurred, e.g. symptoms associated with a specific disease. To enforce the semantic consistency of medical terms to be incorporated into the final reports and encourage the sentence generation for rare abnormal descriptions, we propose a novel framework that unifies template retrieval and sentence generation to handle both common and rare abnormality while ensuring the semantic-coherency among the detected medical terms. Specifically, our approach exploits hybrid-knowledge co-reasoning: i) explicit relationships among all abnormal medical terms to induce the visual attention learning and topic representation encoding for better topic-oriented symptoms descriptions; ii) adaptive generation mode that changes between the template retrieval and sentence generation according to a contextual topic encoder. Experimental results on two medical report benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in terms of both human and metrics evaluation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
