Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Temporal Piecewise-Linear Numeric Planning with Lazy Consistency Checking\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Temporal planning often involves numeric effects that are directly proportional to their action’s duration. These include continuous effects, where a numeric variable is subjected to a rate of change while the action is being executed, and discrete duration-dependent effects, where the variable is updated instantaneously but the magnitude of such change is computed from the action’s duration. When these effects are linear, state–of–the–art temporal planners often make use of Linear Programming to ensure that these numeric updates are consistent with the chosen start times and durations of the plan’s actions. This is typically done for each evaluated state as part of the search process. This exhaustive approach is not scalable to solve real-world problems that require long plans, because the linear program’s size becomes larger and slower to solve. In this work we propose techniques that minimise this overhead by computing these checks more selectively and formulating linear programs that have a smaller footprint. The effectiveness of these techniques is demonstrated on domains that use a mix of discrete and continuous effects, which is typical of real-world planning problems. The resultant planner also outperforms most state-of-the-art temporal-numeric and hybrid planners, in terms of both coverage and scalability.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 50\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
