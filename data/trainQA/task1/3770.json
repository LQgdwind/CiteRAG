      "content": "Paper Title: A Generative Model For Raw Audio Using Transformer Architectures\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper proposes a novel way of doing audio synthesis at the waveform level using Transformer architectures. We propose a deep neural network for generating waveforms, similar to wavenet [1]. This is fully probabilistic, auto-regressive, and causal, i.e. each sample generated depends on only the previously observed samples. Our approach outperforms a widely used wavenet architecture by up to 9% on a similar dataset for predicting the next step. Using the attention mechanism, we enable the architecture to learn which audio samples are important for the prediction of the future sample. We show how causal transformer generative models can be used for raw waveform synthesis. We also show that this performance can be improved by another 2% by conditioning samples over a wider context. The flexibility of the current model to synthesize audio from latent representations suggests a large number of potential applications. The novel approach of using generative transformer architectures for raw audio synthesis is, however, still far away from generating any meaningful music similar to wavenet, without using latent codes/meta-data to aid the generation process.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
