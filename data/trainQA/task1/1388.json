      "content": "Paper Title: Stable Matchings with Restricted Preferences: Structure and Complexity\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract It is well known that every stable matching instance I𝐼I has a rotation poset ℛ​(I)ℛ𝐼\\mathcal{R}(I) that can be computed efficiently and the downsets of ℛ​(I)ℛ𝐼\\mathcal{R}(I) are in one-to-one correspondence with the stable matchings of I𝐼I. Furthermore, for every poset 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P}, an instance I​(𝒫)𝐼𝒫I(\\mathcal{P}) can be constructed efficiently so that the rotation poset of I​(𝒫)𝐼𝒫I(\\mathcal{P}) is isomorphic to 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P}. In this case, we say that I​(𝒫)𝐼𝒫I(\\mathcal{P}) realizes 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P}. Many researchers exploit the rotation poset of an instance to develop fast algorithms or to establish the hardness of stable matching problems. In order to gain a parameterized understanding of the complexity of sampling stable matchings, Bhatnagar et al. [1] introduced stable matching instances whose preference lists are restricted but nevertheless model situations that arise in practice. In this paper, we study four such parameterized restrictions; our goal is to characterize the rotation posets that arise from these models: 1. k𝑘k-bounded, where each agent has at most k𝑘k acceptable partners; 2. k𝑘k-attribute, where each agent a𝑎a has an associated vector a→∈𝐑k→𝑎superscript𝐑𝑘\\vec{a}\\in\\mathbf{R}^{k}, and a𝑎a ranks agents in decreasing order according to a linear function φa:𝐑k→𝐑:subscript𝜑𝑎→superscript𝐑𝑘𝐑\\varphi_{a}:\\mathbf{R}^{k}\\to\\mathbf{R}; 3. (k1,k2)subscript𝑘1subscript𝑘2(k_{1},k_{2})-list, where the men and women can be partitioned into k1subscript𝑘1k_{1} and k2subscript𝑘2k_{2} sets (respectively) such that within each set all agents have identical preferences; 4. k𝑘k-range, where for each woman w𝑤w, the men’s rankings of w𝑤w differ by at most k−1𝑘1k-1 (and symmetrically for the women’s rankings of each man m𝑚m). We prove that there is a constant k𝑘k so that every rotation poset is realized by some instance in models 1–3 (k≥3𝑘3k\\geq 3 for k𝑘k-bounded, k≥6𝑘6k\\geq 6 for k𝑘k-attribute, and k1≥2,k2=∞formulae-sequencesubscript𝑘12subscript𝑘2k_{1}\\geq 2,k_{2}=\\infty for (k1,k2)subscript𝑘1subscript𝑘2(k_{1},k_{2})-list, respectively). We describe efficient algorithms for constructing such instances given the Hasse diagram of a poset. As a consequence, the fundamental problem of counting stable matchings remains #​BIS#BIS\\mathrm{\\#BIS}-complete even for these restricted instances. For k𝑘k-range preferences, we show that a poset 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} is realizable if and only if the Hasse diagram of 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} has pathwidth bounded by functions of k𝑘k. Using this characterization, we show that the following problems are fixed parameter tractable when parameterized by the range of the instance: exactly counting and uniformly sampling stable matchings, finding median, sex-equal, and balanced stable matchings.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
