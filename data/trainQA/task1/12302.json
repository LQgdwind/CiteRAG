Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

Sensory data are projected randomly to much higher-dimensionality (expand part) where only few the most strongly excited neurons are activated (sparsify part). This principle has been leveraged to design a FlyHash algorithm that forms similarity-preserving sparse embeddings, which have been found useful for such tasks as novelty detection, pattern recognition, and similarity search. Despite its simplicity, FlyHash has a number of design choices to be set such as preprocessing of the input data, choice of sparsifying activation function, and formation of the random projection matrix. In this paper, we explore the effect of these choices on the performance of similarity search with FlyHash embeddings. We find that the right combination of design choices can lead to drastic difference in the search performance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
