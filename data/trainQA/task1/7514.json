      "content": "Paper Title: Analogical Math Word Problems Solving with Enhanced Problem-Solution Association\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Math word problem (MWP) solving is an important task in question answering which requires human-like reasoning ability. Analogical reasoning has long been used in mathematical education, as it enables students to apply common relational structures of mathematical situations to solve new problems. In this paper, we propose to build a novel MWP solver by leveraging analogical MWPs, which advance the solver’s generalization ability across different kinds of MWPs. The key idea, named analogy identification, is to associate the analogical MWP pairs in a latent space, i.e., encoding an MWP close to another analogical MWP, while moving away from the non-analogical ones. Moreover, a solution discriminator is integrated into the MWP solver to enhance the association between the representations of MWPs and their true solutions. The evaluation results verify that our proposed analogical learning strategy promotes the performance of MWP-BERT on Math23k over the state-of-the-art model Generate2Rank, with 5 times fewer parameters in the encoder. We also find that our model has a stronger generalization ability in solving difficult MWPs due to the analogical learning from easy MWPs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
