Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Corpus-level and Concept-based Explanations for Interpretable Document Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Using attention weights to identify information that is important for models’ decision making is a popular approach to interpret attention-based neural networks. This is commonly realized in practice through the generation of a heat-map for each single document based on attention weights. However, this interpretation method is fragile and easy to find contradictory examples. In this paper, we propose a corpus-level explanation approach, which aims to capture causal relationships between keywords and model predictions via learning importance of keywords for predicted labels across a training corpus based on attention weights. Based on this idea, we further propose a concept-based explanation method that can automatically learn higher level concepts and their importance to model prediction task. Our concept-based explanation method is built upon a novel Abstraction-Aggregation Network, which can automatically cluster important keywords during an end-to-end training process. We apply these methods to the document classification task and show that they are powerful in extracting semantically meaningful keywords and concepts. Our consistency analysis results based on an attention-based Naïve Bayes classifier also demonstrate these keywords and concepts are important for model predictions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
