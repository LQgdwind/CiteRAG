Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 58 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Closeness and Uncertainty Aware Adversarial Examples Detection in Adversarial Machine Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract While state-of-the-art Deep Neural Network (DNN) models are considered to be robust to random perturbations, it was shown that these architectures are highly vulnerable to deliberately crafted perturbations, albeit being quasi-imperceptible. These vulnerabilities make it challenging to deploy DNN models in security-critical areas. In recent years, many research studies have been conducted to develop new attack methods and come up with new defense techniques that enable more robust and reliable models. In this work, we explore and assess the usage of different type of metrics for detecting adversarial samples. We first leverage the usage of moment-based predictive uncertainty estimates of a DNN classifier obtained using Monte-Carlo Dropout Sampling. And we also introduce a new method that operates in the subspace of deep features extracted by the model. We verified the effectiveness of our approach on a range of standard datasets like MNIST (Digit), MNIST (Fashion) and CIFAR-10. Our experiments show that these two different approaches complement each other, and the combined usage of all the proposed metrics yields up to 99 % ROC-AUC scores regardless of the attack algorithm.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
