      "content": "Paper Title: AI Driven Knowledge Extraction from Clinical Practice Guidelines: Turning Research into Practice\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Background and Objectives: Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) represent the foremost methodology for sharing state-of-the-art research findings in the healthcare domain with medical practitioners to limit practice variations, reduce clinical cost, improve the quality of care, and provide evidence based treatment. However, extracting relevant knowledge from the plethora of CPGs is not feasible for already burdened healthcare professionals, leading to large gaps between clinical findings and real practices. It is therefore imperative that state-of-the-art Computing research, especially machine learning is used to provide artificial intelligence based solution for extracting the knowledge from CPGs and reducing the gap between healthcare research/guidelines and practice. Methods: This research presents a novel methodology for knowledge extraction from CPGs to reduce the gap and turn the latest research findings into clinical practice. First, our system classifies the CPG sentences into four classes such as condition-action (C-A), condition-consequences (C-C), action (A), and not-applicable (NA) based on the information presented in a sentence. We use deep learning with state-of-the-art word embedding, improved word vectors technique in classification process. Second, it identifies qualifier terms in the classified sentences, which assist in recognizing the condition and action phrases in a sentence. Finally, the condition and action phrase are processed and transformed into plain rule If Condition(s) Then Action format. Results: We evaluate the methodology on three different domains guidelines including Hypertension, Rhinosinusitis, and Asthma. The deep learning model classifies the CPG sentences with an accuracy of 95%. While rule extraction was validated by user-centric approach, which achieved a Jaccard coefficient of 0.6, 0.7, and 0.4 with three human experts extracted rules, respectively. Conclusions: The methodology is beneficial in transforming the latest research findings into an executable format that can be directly unitized by healthcare systems to assist in making the right clinical decisions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
