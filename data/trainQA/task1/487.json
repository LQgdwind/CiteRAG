Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Divide-and-Conquer Approach to the Summarization of Long Documents\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present a novel divide-and-conquer method for the neural summarization of long documents. Our method exploits the discourse structure of the document and uses sentence similarity to split the problem into an ensemble of smaller summarization problems. In particular, we break a long document and its summary into multiple source-target pairs, which are used for training a model that learns to summarize each part of the document separately. These partial summaries are then combined in order to produce a final complete summary. With this approach we can decompose the problem of long document summarization into smaller and simpler problems, reducing computational complexity and creating more training examples, which at the same time contain less noise in the target summaries compared to the standard approach. We demonstrate that this approach paired with different summarization models, including sequence-to-sequence RNNs and Transformers, can lead to improved summarization performance. Our best models achieve results that are on par with the state-of-the-art in two two publicly available datasets of academic articles.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
