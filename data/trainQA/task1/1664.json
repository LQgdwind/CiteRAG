Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Manipulation of Articulated Objects using Dual-arm Robots via Answer Set Programming\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The manipulation of articulated objects is of primary importance in Robotics, and can be considered as one of the most complex manipulation tasks. Traditionally, this problem has been tackled by developing ad-hoc approaches, which lack flexibility and portability. In this paper we present a framework based on Answer Set Programming (ASP) for the automated manipulation of articulated objects in a robot control architecture. In particular, ASP is employed for representing the configuration of the articulated object, for checking the consistency of such representation in the knowledge base, and for generating the sequence of manipulation actions. The framework is exemplified and validated on the Baxter dual-arm manipulator in a first, simple scenario. Then, we extend such scenario to improve the overall setup accuracy, and to introduce a few constraints in robot actions execution to enforce their feasibility. The extended scenario entails a high number of possible actions that can be fruitfully combined together. Therefore, we exploit macro actions from automated planning in order to provide more effective plans. We validate the overall framework in the extended scenario, thereby confirming the applicability of ASP also in more realistic Robotics settings, and showing the usefulness of macro actions for the robot-based manipulation of articulated objects. Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
