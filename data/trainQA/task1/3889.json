      "content": "Paper Title: Centralized Model and Exploration Policy for Multi-Agent RL\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Reinforcement learning (RL) in partially observable, fully cooperative multi-agent settings (Dec-POMDPs) can in principle be used to address many real-world challenges such as controlling a swarm of rescue robots or a team of quadcopters. However, Dec-POMDPs are significantly harder to solve than single-agent problems, with the former being NEXP-complete and the latter, MDPs, being just P-complete. Hence, current RL algorithms for Dec-POMDPs suffer from poor sample complexity, which greatly reduces their applicability to practical problems where environment interaction is costly. Our key insight is that using just a polynomial number of samples, one can learn a centralized model that generalizes across different policies. We can then optimize the policy within the learned model instead of the true system, without requiring additional environment interactions. We also learn a centralized exploration policy within our model that learns to collect additional data in state-action regions with high model uncertainty. We empirically evaluate the proposed model-based algorithm, MARCO111MARCO is short for Multi-Agent RL with Centralized Models and Exploration Code available at https://github.com/irenezhang30/MARCO/., in three cooperative communication tasks, where it improves sample efficiency by up to 20x. Finally, to investigate the theoretical sample complexity, we adapt an existing model-based method for tabular MDPs to Dec-POMDPs, and prove that it achieves polynomial sample complexity.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
