Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Never trust, always verify : a roadmap for Trustworthy AI?\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming the corner stone of many systems used in our daily lives such as autonomous vehicles, healthcare systems, and unmanned aircraft systems. Machine Learning is a field of AI that enables systems to learn from data and make decisions on new data based on models to achieve a given goal. The stochastic nature of AI models makes verification and validation tasks challenging. Moreover, there are intrinsic biaises in AI models such as reproductibility bias, selection bias (e.g., races, genders, color), and reporting bias (i.e., results that do not reflect the reality). Increasingly, there is also a particular attention to the ethical, legal, and societal impacts of AI. AI systems are difficult to audit and certify because of their black-box nature. They also appear to be vulnerable to threats; AI systems can misbehave when untrusted data are given, making them insecure and unsafe. Governments, national and international organizations have proposed several principles to overcome these challenges but their applications in practice are limited and there are different interpretations in the principles that can bias implementations. In this paper, we examine trust in the context of AI-based systems to understand what it means for an AI system to be trustworthy and identify actions that need to be undertaken to ensure that AI systems are trustworthy. To achieve this goal, we first review existing approaches proposed for ensuring the trustworthiness of AI systems, in order to identify potential conceptual gaps in understanding what trustworthy AI is. Then, we suggest a trust (resp. zero-trust) model for AI and suggest a set of properties that should be satisfied to ensure the trustworthiness of AI systems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
