Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Functional norms, condition numbers and numerical algorithms in algebraic geometryThis work was supported by the Einstein Foundation Berlin. 2010 Mathematics Subject Classification: 14Q20, 65Y20 (primary); 68Q25, 68U05 (secondary).\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In numerical linear algebra, a well-established practice is to choose a norm that exploits the structure of the problem at hand in order to optimize accuracy or computational complexity. In numerical polynomial algebra, a single norm (attributed to Weyl) dominates the literature. This article initiates the use of LpsubscriptùêøùëùL_{p} norms for numerical algebraic geometry, with an emphasis on L‚àûsubscriptùêøL_{\\infty}. This classical idea yields strong improvements in the analysis of the number of steps performed by numerous iterative algorithms. In particular, we exhibit three algorithms where, despite the complexity of computing L‚àûsubscriptùêøL_{\\infty}-norm, the use of LpsubscriptùêøùëùL_{p}-norms substantially reduces computational complexity: a subdivision-based algorithm in real algebraic geometry for computing the homology of semialgebraic sets, a well-known meshing algorithm in computational geometry, and the computation of zeros of systems of complex quadratic polynomials (a particular case of Smale‚Äôs 17th problem).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
