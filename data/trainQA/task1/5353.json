Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Beyond Worst-Case Analysis for Root Isolation Algorithms\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Isolating the real roots of univariate polynomials is a fundamental problem in symbolic computation and it is arguably one of the most important problems in computational mathematics. The problem has a long history decorated with numerous ingenious algorithms and furnishes an active area of research. However, the worst-case analysis of root-finding algorithms does not correlate with their practical performance. We develop a smoothed analysis framework for polynomials with integer coefficients to bridge the gap between the complexity estimates and the practical performance. In this setting, we derive that the expected bit complexity of descartes solver to isolate the real roots of a polynomial, with coefficients uniformly distributed, is ùí™~B‚Äã(d2+d‚ÄãœÑ)subscript~ùí™ùêµsuperscriptùëë2ùëëùúè\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}_{B}(d^{2}+d\\tau), where dùëëd is the degree of the polynomial and œÑùúè\\tau the bitsize of the coefficients.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
