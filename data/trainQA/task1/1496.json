Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer.

      "content": "Paper Title: An integrative smoothed particle hydrodynamics framework for modeling cardiac function\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Mathematical modeling of cardiac function can provide augmented simulation-based diagnosis tool for complementing and extending human understanding of cardiac diseases which represent the most common cause of worldwide death. As the realistic starting-point for developing an unified meshless approach for total heart modeling, herein we propose an integrative smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) framework for addressing the simulation of the principle aspects of cardiac function, including cardiac electrophysiology, passive mechanical response and electromechanical coupling. To that end, several algorithms, e.g., splitting reaction-by-reaction method combined with quasi-steady-state (QSS) solver , anisotropic SPH-diffusion discretization and total Lagrangian SPH formulation, are introduced and exploited for dealing with the fundamental challenges of developing integrative SPH framework for simulating cardiac function, namely, (i) the correct capturing of the stiff dynamics of the transmembrane potential and the gating variables , (ii) the stable predicting of the large deformations and the strongly anisotropic behavior of the myocardium, and (iii) the proper coupling of electrophysiology and tissue mechanics for electromechanical feedback. A set of numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the present SPH framework, and render it a potential and powerful alternative that can augment current lines of total cardiac modeling and clinical applications.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
