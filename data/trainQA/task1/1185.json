      "content": "Paper Title: Information Theoretic Limits of Cardinality Estimation: Fisher Meets ShannonThis work was supported by NSF grants CCF-1637546 and CCF-1815316.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Estimating the cardinality (number of distinct elements) of a large multiset is a classic problem in streaming and sketching, dating back to Flajolet and Martin’s classic Probabilistic Counting (𝖯𝖢𝖲𝖠𝖯𝖢𝖲𝖠\\mathsf{PCSA}) algorithm from 1983. In this paper we study the intrinsic tradeoff between the space complexity of the sketch and its estimation error in the random oracle model. We define a new measure of efficiency for cardinality estimators called the Fisher-Shannon (𝖥𝗂𝗌𝗁𝖥𝗂𝗌𝗁\\mathsf{Fish}) number ℋ/ℐℋℐ\\mathcal{H}/\\mathcal{I}. It captures the tension between the limiting Shannon entropy (ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}) of the sketch and its normalized Fisher information (ℐℐ\\mathcal{I}), which characterizes the variance of a statistically efficient, asymptotically unbiased estimator. Our results are as follows. • We prove that all base-q𝑞q variants of Flajolet and Martin’s 𝖯𝖢𝖲𝖠𝖯𝖢𝖲𝖠\\mathsf{PCSA} sketch have 𝖥𝗂𝗌𝗁𝖥𝗂𝗌𝗁\\mathsf{Fish}-number H0/I0≈1.98016subscript𝐻0subscript𝐼01.98016H_{0}/I_{0}\\approx 1.98016 and that every base-q𝑞q variant of (Hyper)LogLog has 𝖥𝗂𝗌𝗁𝖥𝗂𝗌𝗁\\mathsf{Fish}-number worse than H0/I0subscript𝐻0subscript𝐼0H_{0}/I_{0}, but that they tend to H0/I0subscript𝐻0subscript𝐼0H_{0}/I_{0} in the limit as q→∞→𝑞q\\rightarrow\\infty. Here H0,I0subscript𝐻0subscript𝐼0H_{0},I_{0} are precisely defined constants. • We describe a sketch called Fishmonger that is based on a smoothed, entropy-compressed variant of 𝖯𝖢𝖲𝖠𝖯𝖢𝖲𝖠\\mathsf{PCSA} with a different estimator function. It is proved that with high probability, Fishmonger processes a multiset of [U]delimited-[]𝑈[U] such that at all times, its space is O​(log2⁡log⁡U)+(1+o​(1))​(H0/I0)​b≈1.98​b𝑂superscript2𝑈1𝑜1subscript𝐻0subscript𝐼0𝑏1.98𝑏O(\\log^{2}\\log U)+(1+o(1))(H_{0}/I_{0})b\\approx 1.98b bits and its standard error is 1/b1𝑏1/\\sqrt{b}. • We give circumstantial evidence that H0/I0subscript𝐻0subscript𝐼0H_{0}/I_{0} is the optimum 𝖥𝗂𝗌𝗁𝖥𝗂𝗌𝗁\\mathsf{Fish}-number of mergeable sketches for Cardinality Estimation. We define a class of linearizable sketches and prove that no member of this class can beat H0/I0subscript𝐻0subscript𝐼0H_{0}/I_{0}. The popular mergeable sketches are, in fact, also linearizable.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
