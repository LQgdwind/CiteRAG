Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Simplified Framework for Contrastive Learning for Node Representations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Contrastive learning has recently established itself as a powerful self-supervised learning framework for extracting rich and versatile data representations. Broadly speaking, contrastive learning relies on a data augmentation scheme to generate two versions of the input data and learns low-dimensional representations by maximizing a normalized temperature-scaled cross entropy loss (NT-Xent) to identify augmented samples corresponding to the same original entity (Chen et al., 2020). In this paper, we investigate the potential of deploying contrastive learning in combination with Graph Neural Networks (Scarselli et al., 2008) for embedding nodes in a graph. Specifically, we show that the quality of the resulting embeddings and training time can be significantly improved by a simple column-wise postprocessing of the embedding matrix, instead of the row-wise postprocessing via multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) that is adopted by the majority of peer methods. This modification yields improvements in downstream classification tasks of up to 1.5% and even beats existing state-of-the-art approaches on 6 out of 8 different benchmarks. We justify our choices of postprocessing by revisiting the “alignment vs. uniformity paradigm” of Wang and Isola (2020), and show that column-wise post-processing improves both “alignment” and “uniformity” of the embeddings.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
