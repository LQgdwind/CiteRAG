      "content": "Paper Title: Group channel pruning and spatial attention distilling for object detection\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Due to the over-parameterization of neural networks, many model compression methods based on pruning and quantization have emerged. They are remarkable in reducing the size, parameter number, and computational complexity of the model. However, most of the models compressed by such methods need the support of special hardware and software, which increases the deployment cost. Moreover, these methods are mainly used in classification tasks, and rarely directly used in detection tasks. To address these issues, for the object detection network we introduce a three-stage model compression method: dynamic sparse training, group channel pruning, and spatial attention distilling. Firstly, to select out the unimportant channels in the network and maintain a good balance between sparsity and accuracy, we put forward a dynamic sparse training method, which introduces a variable sparse rate, and the sparse rate will change with the training process of the network. Secondly, to reduce the effect of pruning on network accuracy, we propose a novel pruning method called group channel pruning. In particular, we divide the network into multiple groups according to the scales of the feature layer and the similarity of module structure in the network, and then we use different pruning thresholds to prune the channels in each group. Finally, to recover the accuracy of the pruned network, we use an improved knowledge distillation method for the pruned network. Especially, we extract spatial attention information from the feature maps of specific scales in each group as knowledge for distillation. In the experiments, we use YOLOv4 as the object detection network and PASCAL VOC as the training dataset. Our method reduces the parameters of the model by 64.7%percent\\% and the calculation by 34.9%percent\\%. When the input image size is 416Ã—416, compared with the original network model with 256MB size and 87.1 accuracies, our compressed model achieves 86.6 accuracies with 90MB size. To demonstrate the generality of our method, we replace the backbone to Darknet53 and Mobilenet and also achieve satisfactory compression results.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
