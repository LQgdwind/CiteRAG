      "content": "Paper Title: Intelligence of Astronomical Optical Telescope: Present Status and Future Perspectives\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract With new artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and application scenarios constantly emerging, AI technology has been widely used in astronomy, and has promoted notable progress in related fields. A large number of papers have reviewed the application of AI technology in astronomy. However, relevant articles seldom mention telescope intelligence separately, and it is difficult to understand the current development status and research hotspots of telescope intelligence from these papers. This paper combines the development history of AI technology and the difficulties of critical technologies of telescopes, comprehensively introduces the development and research hotspots of telescope intelligence, conducts statistical analysis on various research directions of telescope intelligence and defines merits of the research directions. All kinds of research directions are evaluated, and the research trend of each telescope’s intelligence is pointed out. Finally, according to the advantages of AI technology and the development trend of telescopes, future research hotspots of telescope intelligence are given.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 174 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 174\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
