      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Knowledge Graph Embedding via Iterative Self-Semantic Knowledge Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has been intensively investigated for link prediction by projecting entities and relations into continuous vector spaces. Current popular high-dimensional KGE methods obtain quite slight performance gains while require enormous computation and memory costs. In contrast to high-dimensional KGE models, training low-dimensional models is more efficient and worthwhile for better deployments to practical intelligent systems. However, the model expressiveness of semantic information in knowledge graphs (KGs) is highly limited in the low dimension parameter space. In this paper, we propose iterative self-semantic knowledge distillation strategy to improve the KGE model expressiveness in the low dimension space. KGE model combined with our proposed strategy plays the teacher and student roles alternatively during the whole training process. Specifically, at a certain iteration, the model is regarded as a teacher to provide semantic information for the student. At next iteration, the model is regard as a student to incorporate the semantic information transferred from the teacher. We also design a novel semantic extraction block to extract iteration-based semantic information for the training model self-distillation. Iteratively incorporating and accumulating iteration-based semantic information enables the low-dimensional model to be more expressive for better link prediction in KGs. There is only one model during the whole training, which alleviates the increase of computational expensiveness and memory requirements. Furthermore, the proposed strategy is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly combined with other KGE models. Consistent and significant performance gains in experimental evaluations on four standard datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed self-distillation strategy.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
