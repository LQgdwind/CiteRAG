      "content": "Paper Title: Improved Approximation Algorithms for 2-Dimensional Knapsack: Packing into Multiple L-Shapes, Spirals, and More\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In the 2-Dimensional Knapsack problem (2DK) we are given a square knapsack and a collection of nùëõn rectangular items with integer sizes and profits. Our goal is to find the most profitable subset of items that can be packed non-overlappingly into the knapsack. The currently best known polynomial-time approximation factor for 2DK is 17/9+Œµ<1.89179ùúÄ1.8917/9+\\varepsilon<1.89 and there is a (3/2+Œµ)32ùúÄ(3/2+\\varepsilon)-approximation algorithm if we are allowed to rotate items by 90 degrees [G√°lvez et al., FOCS 2017]. In this paper, we give (4/3+Œµ)43ùúÄ(4/3+\\varepsilon)-approximation algorithms in polynomial time for both cases, assuming that all input data are integers polynomially bounded in nùëõn. G√°lvez et al.‚Äôs algorithm for 2DK partitions the knapsack into a constant number of rectangular regions plus one L-shaped region and packs items into those in a structured way. We generalize this approach by allowing up to a constant number of more general regions that can have the shape of an L, a U, a Z, a spiral, and more, and therefore obtain an improved approximation ratio. In particular, we present an algorithm that computes the essentially optimal structured packing into these regions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
