      "content": "Paper Title: Masked Faces with Faced Masks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Modern face recognition systems (FRS) still fall short when the subjects are wearing facial masks, a common theme in the age of respiratory pandemics. An intuitive partial remedy is to add a mask detector to flag any masked faces so that the FRS can act accordingly for those low-confidence masked faces. In this work, we set out to investigate the potential vulnerability of such FRS equipped with a mask detector, on large-scale masked faces, which might trigger a serious risk, e.g., letting a suspect evade the FRS where both facial identity and mask are undetected. As existing face recognizers and mask detectors have high performance in their respective tasks, it is significantly challenging to simultaneously fool them and preserve the transferability of the attack. We formulate the new task as the generation of realistic & adversarial-faced mask and make three main contributions: First, we study the naive Delanunay-based masking method (DM) to simulate the process of wearing a faced mask that is cropped from a template image, which reveals the main challenges of this new task. Second, we further equip the DM with the adversarial noise attack and propose the adversarial noise Delaunay-based masking method (AdvNoise-DM) that can fool the face recognition and mask detection effectively but make the face less natural. Third, we propose the adversarial filtering Delaunay-based masking method denoted as MF2​MsuperscriptMF2M\\text{MF}^{2}\\text{M} by employing the adversarial filtering for AdvNoise-DM and obtain more natural faces. With the above efforts, the final version not only leads to significant performance deterioration of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning-based FRS, but also remains undetected by the SOTA facial mask detector, thus successfully fooling both systems at the same time. We conduct extensive white-box and black-box experiments on three FRS and a facial mask detector. We utilize the datasets in MegaFace Challenge 1 and evaluate on dimensions of face recognition, face verification and mask detection, comparing with the solid-colored masking method and seven SOTA adversarial attacks. Moreover, we also set up the physical experiments by printing the adversarial faces in the real world and re-capturing them to fool the face recognition and mask detector, which demonstrates the high generalizability of our method. Overall, the proposed method, for the first attempt, unveils the vulnerability of the FRS when dealing with masked faces wearing faced masks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
