      "content": "Paper Title: Variance-Covariance Regularization Improves Representation Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Transfer learning has emerged as a key approach in the machine learning domain, enabling the application of knowledge derived from one domain to improve performance on subsequent tasks. Given the often limited information about these subsequent tasks, a strong transfer learning approach calls for the model to capture a diverse range of features during the initial pretraining stage. However, recent research suggests that, without sufficient regularization, the network tends to concentrate on features that primarily reduce the pretraining loss function. This tendency can result in inadequate feature learning and impaired generalization capability for target tasks. To address this issue, we propose Variance-Covariance Regularization (VCR), a regularization technique aimed at fostering diversity in the learned network features. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in the self-supervised learning approach, our approach promotes learned representations that exhibit high variance and minimal covariance, thus preventing the network from focusing solely on loss-reducing features. We empirically validate the efficacy of our method through comprehensive experiments coupled with in-depth analytical studies on the learned representations. In addition, we develop an efficient implementation strategy that assures minimal computational overhead associated with our method. Our results indicate that VCR is a powerful and efficient method for enhancing transfer learning performance for both supervised learning and self-supervised learning, opening new possibilities for future research in this domain.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
