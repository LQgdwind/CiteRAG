Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Quantized Adam with Error Feedback\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. In this paper, we present a distributed variant of adaptive stochastic gradient method for training deep neural networks in the parameter-server model. To reduce the communication cost among the workers and server, we incorporate two types of quantization schemes, i.e., gradient quantization and weight quantization, into the proposed distributed Adam. Besides, to reduce the bias introduced by quantization operations, we propose an error-feedback technique to compensate for the quantized gradient. Theoretically, in the stochastic nonconvex setting, we show that the distributed adaptive gradient method with gradient quantization and error-feedback converges to the first-order stationary point, and that the distributed adaptive gradient method with weight quantization and error-feedback converges to the point related to the quantized level under both the single-worker and multi-worker modes. At last, we apply the proposed distributed adaptive gradient methods to train deep neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
