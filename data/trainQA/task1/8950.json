Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: HyperTime: Hyperparameter Optimization for Combating Temporal Distribution Shifts\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this work, we propose a hyperparameter optimization method named HyperTime to find hyperparameters robust to potential temporal distribution shifts in the unseen test data. Our work is motivated by an important observation that it is, in many cases, possible to achieve temporally robust predictive performance via hyperparameter optimization. Based on this observation, we leverage the ‘worst-case-oriented’ philosophy from the robust optimization literature to help find such robust hyperparameter configurations. HyperTime imposes a lexicographic priority order on average validation loss and worst-case validation loss over chronological validation sets. We perform a theoretical analysis on the upper bound of the expected test loss, which reveals the unique advantages of our approach. We also demonstrate the strong empirical performance of the proposed method on multiple machine learning tasks with temporal distribution shifts.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
