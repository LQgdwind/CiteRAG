Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Multi-task Adversarial Attack Against Face Authentication\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Deep-learning-based identity management systems, such as face authentication systems, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, existing attacks are typically designed for single-task purposes, which means they are tailored to exploit vulnerabilities unique to the individual target rather than being adaptable for multiple users or systems. This limitation makes them unsuitable for certain attack scenarios, such as morphing, universal, transferable, and counter attacks. In this paper, we propose a multi-task adversarial attack algorithm called MTADV that are adaptable for multiple users or systems. By interpreting these scenarios as multi-task attacks, MTADV is applicable to both single- and multi-task attacks, and feasible in the white- and gray-box settings. Furthermore, MTADV is effective against various face datasets, including LFW, CelebA, and CelebA-HQ, and can work with different deep learning models, such as FaceNet, InsightFace, and CurricularFace. Importantly, MTADV retains its feasibility as a single-task attack targeting a single user/system. To the best of our knowledge, MTADV is the first adversarial attack method that can target all of the aforementioned scenarios in one algorithm.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
