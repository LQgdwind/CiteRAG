Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: An experiment exploring the theoretical and methodological challenges in developing a semi-automated approach to analysis of small-N qualitative data A Preprint\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper experiments with designing a semi-automated qualitative data analysis (QDA) algorithm to analyse 20 transcripts by using freeware. Text-mining (TM) and QDA were guided by frequency and association measures, because these statistics remain robust when the sample size is small. The refined TM algorithm split the text into various sizes based on a manually revised dictionary. This lemmatisation approach may reflect the context of the text better than uniformly tokenising the text into one single size. TM results were used for initial coding. Code repacking was guided by association measures and external data to implement a general inductive QDA approach. The information retrieved by TM and QDA was depicted in subgraphs for comparisons. The analyses were completed in 6–7 days. Both algorithms retrieved contextually consistent and relevant information. However, the QDA algorithm retrieved more specific information than TM alone. The QDA algorithm does not strictly comply with the convention of TM or of QDA, but becomes a more efficient, systematic and transparent text analysis approach than a conventional QDA approach. Scaling up QDA to reliably discover knowledge from text was exactly the research purpose. This paper also sheds light on understanding the relations between information technologies, theory and methodologies.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
