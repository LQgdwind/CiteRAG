      "content": "Paper Title: Adversarial Interaction Attack: Fooling AI to Misinterpret Human Intentions\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Understanding the actions of both humans and artificial intelligence (AI) agents is important before modern AI systems can be fully integrated into our daily life. In this paper, we show that, despite their current huge success, deep learning based AI systems can be easily fooled by subtle adversarial noise to misinterpret the intention of an action in interaction scenarios. Based on a case study of skeleton-based human interactions, we propose a novel adversarial attack on interactions, and demonstrate how DNN-based interaction models can be tricked to predict the participantsâ€™ reactions in unexpected ways. From a broader perspective, the scope of our proposed attack method is not confined to problems related to skeleton data but can also be extended to any type of problems involving sequential regressions. Our study highlights potential risks in the interaction loop with AI and humans, which need to be carefully addressed when deploying AI systems in safety-critical applications.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
