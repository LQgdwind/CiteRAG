Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Commutative codensity monads and probability bimeasures\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Several well-studied probability monads have been expressed as codensity monads over small categories of stochastic maps, giving a limit description of spaces of probability measures. In this paper we show how properties of probability monads such as commutativity and affineness can arise from their codensity presentation. First we show that their codensity presentation is closely related to another characterisation of probability monads as terminal endofunctors admitting certain maps into the Giry monad, which allows us to generalise a result by Van Breugel on the Kantorovich monad. We then provide sufficient conditions for a codensity monad to lift to MonCat, and give a characterisation of exactly pointwise monoidal codensity monads; codensity monads that satisfy a strengthening of these conditions. We show that the Radon monad is exactly pointwise monoidal, and hence give a description of the tensor product of free algebras of the Radon monad in terms of Day convolution. Finally we show that the Giry monad is not exactly pointwise monoidal due to the existence of probability bimeasures that do not extend to measures, although its restriction to standard Borel spaces is. We introduce the notion of a ∗*-monad and its Kleisli monoidal op-multicategory to describe the categorical structure that organises the spaces of probability polymeasures on measurable spaces.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
