      "content": "Paper Title: Physics-Driven AI Correction in Laser Absorption Sensing Quantification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Laser absorption spectroscopy (LAS) quantification is a popular tool used in measuring temperature and concentration of gases. It has low error tolerance, whereas current ML-based solutions cannot guarantee their measure reliability. In this work, we propose a new framework, SPEC, to address this issue. In addition to the conventional ML estimator-based estimation mode, SPEC also includes a Physics-driven Anomaly Detection module (PAD) to assess the error of the estimation. And a Correction mode is designed to correct the unreliable estimation. The correction mode is a network-based optimization algorithm, which uses the guidance of error to iteratively correct the estimation. A hybrid surrogate error model is proposed to estimate the error distribution, which contains an ensemble of networks to simulate reconstruction error, and true feasible error computation. A greedy ensemble search is proposed to find the optimal correction robustly and efficiently from the gradient guidance of surrogate model. The proposed SPEC is validated on the test scenarios which are outside the training distribution. The results show that SPEC can significantly improve the estimation quality, and the correction mode outperforms current network-based optimization algorithms. In addition, SPEC has the reconfigurability, which can be easily adapted to different quantification tasks via changing PAD without retraining the ML estimator.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
