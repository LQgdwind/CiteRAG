Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Explainability in Process Outcome Prediction: Guidelines to Obtain Interpretable and Faithful Models\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Predicting the outcome of various sorts of processes has seen a strong uptake in recent years due to the advances in machine and deep learning. Although a recent shift has been made in the field of process outcome prediction to use models from the explainable artificial intelligence field, the evaluation still occurs mainly through predictive performance-based metrics, thus not accounting for the explainability, actionability, and implications of the results of the models. This paper addresses explainability through the properties interpretability and faithfulness in the field of process outcome prediction. We introduce metrics to analyse these properties along the main dimensions of (business) process data: the event, case, and control flow attributes. This allows comparing inherently created explanations with post-hoc explanations techniques, for which we benchmark seven classifiers on thirteen real-life events logs covering a range of transparent and non-transparent machine learning and deep learning models complemented with post-hoc (model-agnostic or model-dependent) explainability techniques. Next, this paper contributes a set of guidelines named X-MOP which allows selecting the appropriate model by providing insight into how the varying preprocessing, model complexity, and explainability techniques typical in process outcome prediction influence the explainability of the model.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 51\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
