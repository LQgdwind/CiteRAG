Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Decision Tree Learning with Spatial Modal Logics\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Symbolic learning represents the most straightforward approach to interpretable modeling, but its applications have been hampered by a single structural design choice: the adoption of propositional logic as the underlying language. Recently, more-than-propositional symbolic learning methods have started to appear, in particular for time-dependent data. These methods exploit the expressive power of modal temporal logics in powerful learning algorithms, such as temporal decision trees, whose classification capabilities are comparable with the best non-symbolic ones, while producing models with explicit knowledge representation. With the intent of following the same approach in the case of spatial data, in this paper we: (i) present a theory of spatial decision tree learning; (ii) describe a prototypical implementation of a spatial decision tree learning algorithm based, and strictly extending, the classical C4.5 algorithm, and (iii) perform a series of experiments in which we compare the predicting power of spatial decision trees with that of classical propositional decision trees in several versions, for a multi-class image classification problem, on publicly available datasets. Our results are encouraging, showing clear improvements in the performances from the propositional to the spatial models, which in turn show higher levels of interpretability.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
