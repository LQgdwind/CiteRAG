      "content": "Paper Title: A Flexible Template for Edge Generative AI with High-Accuracy Accelerated Softmax & GELU\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Transformer-based generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models achieve remarkable results in a wide range of fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and audio processing. However, this comes at the cost of increased complexity and the need of sophisticated non-linearities such as softmax and GELU. Even if Transformers are computationally dominated by matrix multiplications (MatMul), these non-linearities can become a performance bottleneck, especially if dedicated hardware is used to accelerate MatMul operators. In this work, we introduce a GenAI BFloat16 Transformer acceleration template based on a heterogeneous tightly-coupled cluster containing 256KiB of shared SRAM, 8 general-purpose RISC-V cores, a 24×\\times8 systolic array MatMul accelerator, and a novel accelerator for Transformer softmax and GELU non-linearities: SoftEx. SoftEx introduces an approximate exponentiation algorithm balancing efficiency (121×\\times speedup over glibc’s implementation) with accuracy (mean relative error of 0.14%). In 12nm technology, SoftEx occupies 0.039 mm2, only 3.22% of the cluster, which achieves an operating frequency of 1.12 GHz. Compared to optimized software running on the RISC-V cores, SoftEx achieves significant improvements, accelerating softmax and GELU computations by up to 10.8×\\times and 5.11×\\times, respectively, while reducing their energy consumption by up to 10.8×\\times and 5.29×\\times. These enhancements translate into a 1.58×\\times increase in throughput (310 GOPS at 0.8V) and a 1.42×\\times improvement in energy efficiency (1.34 TOPS/W at 0.55V) on end-to-end ViT inference workloads.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 56\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
