Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Agent Disk InspectionResearch supported in part by NSERC Discovery grant.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We consider nùëõn unit-speed mobile agents initially positioned at the center of a unit disk, tasked with inspecting all points on the disk‚Äôs perimeter. A perimeter point is considered covered if an agent positioned outside the disk‚Äôs interior has unobstructed visibility of it, treating the disk itself as an obstacle. For n=1ùëõ1n=1, this problem is referred to as the shoreline problem with a known distance. Isbell [44] derived an optimal trajectory that minimizes the worst-case inspection time for that problem. For n‚â•2ùëõ2n\\geq 2 agents, worst-case optimal trajectories were show in [1, 29]. The one agent version of the problem was originally proposed as a more tractable variant of Bellman‚Äôs famous lost-in-the-forest problem [14]. Our contributions are threefold. First, and as a warm-up, we extend Isbell‚Äôs findings by deriving worst-case optimal trajectories addressing the partial inspection of a section of the disk, hence deriving an alternative proof of optimality for inspecting the disk with n‚â•2ùëõ2n\\geq 2 agents. Second, we analyze the average-case inspection time, assuming a uniform distribution of perimeter points (equivalent to randomized inspection algorithms). Using spatial discretization and Nonlinear Programming (NLP), we propose feasible solutions to the continuous problem and evaluate their effectiveness compared to NLP solutions. Third, we establish Pareto-optimal bounds for the multi-objective problem of jointly minimizing the worst-case and average-case inspection times.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
