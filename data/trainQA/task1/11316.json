Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Computational lower bounds for multi-frequency group synchronization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We consider a group synchronization problem with multiple frequencies which involves observing pairwise relative measurements of group elements on multiple frequency channels, corrupted by Gaussian noise. We study the computational phase transition in the problem of detecting whether a structured signal is present in such observations by analyzing low-degree polynomial algorithms. We show that, assuming the low-degree conjecture, in synchronization models over arbitrary finite groups as well as over the circle group S‚ÄãO‚Äã(2)ùëÜùëÇ2SO(2), a simple spectral algorithm is optimal among algorithms of runtime exp‚Å°(Œ©~‚Äã(n1/3))~Œ©superscriptùëõ13\\exp(\\tilde{\\Omega}(n^{1/3})) for detection from an observation including a constant number of frequencies. Combined with an upper bound for the statistical threshold shown in Perry et al. [PWBM16a], our results indicate the presence of a statistical-to-computational gap in such models with a sufficiently large number of frequencies.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
