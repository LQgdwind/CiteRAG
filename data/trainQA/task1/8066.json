Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Revisiting the Gumbel-Softmax in MADDPG\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. MADDPG is an algorithm in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) that extends the popular single-agent method, DDPG, to multi-agent scenarios. Importantly, DDPG is an algorithm designed for continuous action spaces, where the gradient of the state-action value function exists. For this algorithm to work in discrete action spaces, discrete gradient estimation must be performed. For MADDPG, the Gumbel-Softmax (GS) estimator is usedâ€”a reparameterisation which relaxes a discrete distribution into a similar continuous one. This method, however, is statistically biased, and a recent MARL benchmarking paper suggests that this bias makes MADDPG perform poorly in grid-world situations, where the action space is discrete. Fortunately, many alternatives to the GS exist, boasting a wide range of properties. This paper explores several of these alternatives and integrates them into MADDPG for discrete grid-world scenarios. The corresponding impact on various performance metrics is then measured and analysed. It is found that one of the proposed estimators performs significantly better than the original GS in several tasks, achieving up to 55% higher returns, along with faster convergence.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
