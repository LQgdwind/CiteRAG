Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Near-Optimal Deployment Efficiency in Reward-Free Reinforcement Learning with Linear Function Approximation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study the problem of deployment efficient reinforcement learning (RL) with linear function approximation under the reward-free exploration setting. This is a well-motivated problem because deploying new policies is costly in real-life RL applications. Under the linear MDP setting with feature dimension dùëëd and planning horizon HùêªH, we propose a new algorithm that collects at most O~‚Äã(d2‚ÄãH5œµ2)~ùëÇsuperscriptùëë2superscriptùêª5superscriptitalic-œµ2\\widetilde{O}(\\frac{d^{2}H^{5}}{\\epsilon^{2}}) trajectories within HùêªH deployments to identify œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-optimal policy for any (possibly data-dependent) choice of reward functions. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to achieve optimal deployment complexity and optimal dùëëd dependence in sample complexity at the same time, even if the reward is known ahead of time. Our novel techniques include an exploration-preserving policy discretization and a generalized G-optimal experiment design, which could be of independent interest. Lastly, we analyze the related problem of regret minimization in low-adaptive RL and provide information-theoretic lower bounds for switching cost and batch complexity.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
