Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Elastically-Constrained Meta-Learner for Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Federated learning is an approach to collaboratively training machine learning models for multiple parties that prohibit data sharing. One of the challenges in federated learning is non-IID data between clients, as a single model can not fit the data distribution for all clients. Meta-learning, such as Per-FedAvg, is introduced to cope with the challenge. Meta-learning learns shared initial parameters for all clients. Each client employs gradient descent to adapt the initialization to local data distributions quickly to realize model personalization. However, due to non-convex loss function and randomness of sampling update, meta-learning approaches have unstable goals in local adaptation for the same client. This fluctuation in different adaptation directions hinders the convergence in meta-learning. To overcome this challenge, we use the historical local adapted model to restrict the direction of the inner loop and propose an elastic-constrained method. As a result, the current round inner loop keeps historical goals and adapts to better solutions. Experiments show our method boosts meta-learning convergence and improves personalization without additional calculation and communication. Our method achieved SOTA on all metrics in three public datasets.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
