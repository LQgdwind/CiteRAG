Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: FedIIC: Towards Robust Federated Learning for Class-Imbalanced Medical Image Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Federated learning (FL), training deep models from decentralized data without privacy leakage, has shown great potential in medical image computing recently. However, considering the ubiquitous class imbalance in medical data, FL can exhibit performance degradation, especially for minority classes (e.g. rare diseases). Existing methods towards this problem mainly focus on training a balanced classifier to eliminate class prior bias among classes, but neglect to explore better representation to facilitate classification performance. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving FL method named FedIIC to combat class imbalance from two perspectives: feature learning and classifier learning. In feature learning, two levels of contrastive learning are designed to extract better class-specific features with imbalanced data in FL. In classifier learning, per-class margins are dynamically set according to real-time difficulty and class priors, which helps the model learn classes equally. Experimental results on publicly-available datasets demonstrate the superior performance of FedIIC in dealing with both real-world and simulated multi-source medical imaging data under class imbalance. Code is available at https://github.com/wnn2000/FedIIC.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
