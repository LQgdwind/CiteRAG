      "content": "Paper Title: A GOA-based Fault-tolerant Trajectory Tracking Control for an Underwater Vehicle of Multi-thruster System without Actuator Saturation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper proposes an intelligent fault-tolerant control (FTC) strategy to tackle the trajectory tracking problem of an underwater vehicle (UV) under thruster damage (power loss) cases and meanwhile resolve the actuator saturation brought by the vehicleâ€™s physical constraints. In the proposed control strategy, the trajectory tracking component is formed by a refined backstepping algorithm that controls the velocity variation and a sliding mode control deducts the torque/force outputs; the fault-tolerant component is established based on a Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA), which provides fast convergence speed as well as satisfactory accuracy of deducting optimized reallocation of the thruster forces to compensate for the power loss in different fault cases. Simulations with or without environmental perturbations under different fault cases and comparisons to other traditional FTCs are presented, thus verifying the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed GOA-based fault-tolerant trajectory tracking design. Note to Practitioners: This paper is motivated by the actuator saturation problem that exists in the trajectory tracking of an underwater vehicle (UV) when encountering power loss of the thruster system. The fault-tolerance trajectory tracking performance is affected by physical constraints of the vehicle when using the traditional methods as they may deduct excessive kinematic/dynamic requirements during the control process, thus inducing the deviation of the tracking trajectory. Therefore, the refined backstepping as well as the grasshopper optimization (GOA) are combined to eliminate the excess, where the refined backstepping is used to alleviate the speed jumps (kinematic outputs) and the GOA is to control the propulsion forces (dynamic outputs) when facing thruster fault cases. This innovates the industrial practitioners that the control design of the vehicle can be improved to avoid the tracking deviation brought by unsatisfied driving commands under fault cases through embedding optimization algorithms. Moreover, for the specific type of UV studied in this paper used for dam detection, simulations regarding practical dam detection such as the 3D polygonal line trajectory tracking and the frequently occurring UV single-fault cases are chosen, which can serve as references for practitioners working in the related field. In the future, underwater experiments of the UV will be investigated, with more effects of the practical environment involved.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
