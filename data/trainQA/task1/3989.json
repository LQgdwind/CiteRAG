Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Fast Wireless Sensor Anomaly Detection based on Data Stream in Edge Computing Enabled Smart Greenhouse\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Edge computing enabled smart greenhouse is a representative application of Internet of Things technology, which can monitor the environmental information in real time and employ the information to contribute to intelligent decision-making. In the process, anomaly detection for wireless sensor data plays an important role. However, traditional anomaly detection algorithms originally designed for anomaly detection in static data have not properly considered the inherent characteristics of data stream produced by wireless sensor such as infiniteness, correlations and concept drift, which may pose a considerable challenge on anomaly detection based on data stream, and lead to low detection accuracy and efficiency. First, data stream usually generates quickly which means that it is infinite and enormous, so any traditional off-line anomaly detection algorithm that attempts to store the whole dataset or to scan the dataset multiple times for anomaly detection will run out of memory space. Second, there exist correlations among different data streams, which traditional algorithms hardly consider. Third, the underlying data generation process or data distribution may change over time. Thus, traditional anomaly detection algorithms with no model update will lose their effects. Considering these issues, a novel method (called DLSHiForest) on basis of Locality-Sensitive Hashing and time window technique in this paper is proposed to solve these problems while achieving accurate and efficient detection. Comprehensive experiments are executed using real-world agricultural greenhouse dataset to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. Experimental results show that our proposal is practicable in addressing challenges of traditional anomaly detection while ensuring accuracy and efficiency.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
