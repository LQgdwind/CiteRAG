Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 43 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Online Advertising Revenue Forecasting: An Interpretable Deep Learning ApproachThis work was funded by Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (UID/ECO/00124/2019, UIDB/00124/2020 and Social Sciences DataLab, PINFRA/22209/2016), POR Lisboa and POR Norte (Social Sciences DataLab, PINFRA/22209/2016)\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Online advertising revenues account for an increasing share of publishers’ revenue streams, especially for small and medium-sized publishers who depend on the advertisement networks of tech companies such as Google and Facebook. Thus publishers may benefit significantly from accurate online advertising revenue forecasts to better manage their website monetization strategies. However, publishers who only have access to their own revenue data lack a holistic view of the total ad market of publishers, which in turn limits their ability to generate insights into their own future online advertising revenues. To address this business issue, we leverage a proprietary database encompassing Google Adsense revenues from a large collection of publishers in diverse areas. We adopt the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model, a novel attention-based architecture to predict publishers’ advertising revenues. We leverage multiple covariates, including not only the publisher’s own characteristics but also other publishers’ advertising revenues. Our prediction results outperform several benchmark deep-learning time-series forecast models over multiple time horizons. Moreover, we interpret the results by analyzing variable importance weights to identify significant features and self-attention weights to reveal persistent temporal patterns.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 43 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 43\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
