Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: FedACK: Federated Adversarial Contrastive Knowledge Distillation for Cross-Lingual and Cross-Model Social Bot Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Social bot detection is of paramount importance to the resilience and security of online social platforms. The state-of-the-art detection models are siloed and have largely overlooked a variety of data characteristics from multiple cross-lingual platforms. Meanwhile, the heterogeneity of data distribution and model architecture make it intricate to devise an efficient cross-platform and cross-model detection framework. In this paper, we propose FedACK, a new federated adversarial contrastive knowledge distillation framework for social bot detection. We devise a GAN-based federated knowledge distillation mechanism for efficiently transferring knowledge of data distribution among clients. In particular, a global generator is used to extract the knowledge of global data distribution and distill it into each clientâ€™s local model. We leverage local discriminator to enable customized model design and use local generator for data enhancement with hard-to-decide samples. Local training is conducted as multi-stage adversarial and contrastive learning to enable consistent feature spaces among clients and to constrain the optimization direction of local models, reducing the divergences between local and global models. Experiments demonstrate that FedACK outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy, communication efficiency, and feature space consistency.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 50\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
