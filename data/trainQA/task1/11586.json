      "content": "Paper Title: Sequential sampling without comparison to boundary through model-free reinforcement learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Although evidence integration to the boundary model has successfully explained a wide range of behavioral and neural data in decision making under uncertainty, how animals learn and optimize the boundary remains unresolved. Here, we propose a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm for perceptual decisions under uncertainty that dispenses entirely with the concepts of decision boundary and evidence accumulation. Our model learns whether to commit to a decision given the available evidence or continue sampling information at a cost. We reproduced the canonical features of perceptual decision-making such as dependence of accuracy and reaction time on evidence strength, modulation of speed-accuracy trade-off by payoff regime, and many others. By unifying learning and decision making within the same framework, this model can account for unstable behavior during training as well as stabilized post-training behavior, opening the door to revisiting the extensive volumes of discarded training data in the decision science literature.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
