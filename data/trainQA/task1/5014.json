      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Graph-level Anomaly Detection by Glocal Knowledge Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Graph-level anomaly detection (GAD) describes the problem of detecting graphs that are abnormal in their structure and/or the features of their nodes, as compared to other graphs. One of the challenges in GAD is to devise graph representations that enable the detection of both locally- and globally-anomalous graphs, i.e., graphs that are abnormal in their fine-grained (node-level) or holistic (graph-level) properties, respectively. To tackle this challenge we introduce a novel deep anomaly detection approach for GAD that learns rich global and local normal pattern information by joint random distillation of graph and node representations. The random distillation is achieved by training one GNN to predict another GNN with randomly initialized network weights. Extensive experiments on 16 real-world graph datasets from diverse domains show that our model significantly outperforms seven state-of-the-art models. Code and datasets are available at https://git.io/GLocalKD.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 54\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
