      "content": "Paper Title: Quantum Random Access Codes for Boolean Functions\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract An n‚Äã‚Ü¶ùëù‚Äãmùëõùëùmaps-toùëön\\overset{p}{\\mapsto}m random access code (RAC) is an encoding of nùëõn bits into mùëöm bits such that any initial bit can be recovered with probability at least pùëùp, while in a quantum RAC (QRAC), the nùëõn bits are encoded into mùëöm qubits. Since its proposal, the idea of RACs was generalized in many different ways, e.g. allowing the use of shared entanglement (called entanglement-assisted random access code, or simply EARAC) or recovering multiple bits instead of one. In this paper we generalize the idea of RACs to recovering the value of a given Boolean function fùëìf on any subset of fixed size of the initial bits, which we call fùëìf-random access codes. We study and give protocols for fùëìf-random access codes with classical (fùëìf-RAC) and quantum (fùëìf-QRAC) encoding, together with many different resources, e.g. private or shared randomness, shared entanglement (fùëìf-EARAC) and Popescu-Rohrlich boxes (fùëìf-PRRAC). The success probability of our protocols is characterized by the noise stability of the Boolean function fùëìf. Moreover, we give an upper bound on the success probability of any fùëìf-QRAC with shared randomness that matches its success probability up to a multiplicative constant (and fùëìf-RACs by extension), meaning that quantum protocols can only achieve a limited advantage over their classical counterparts.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 66 most likely reference titles for this paper.
