Extended abstracts of this paper appeared in [17] and [15].\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A (unit) disk graph is the intersection graph of closed (unit) disks in the plane. Almost three decades ago, an elegant polynomial-time algorithm was found for Maximum Clique on unit disk graphs [Clark, Colbourn, Johnson; Discrete Mathematics ‚Äô90]. Since then, it has been an intriguing open question whether or not tractability can be extended to general disk graphs. We show that the disjoint union of two odd cycles is never the complement of a disk graph nor of a unit (3-dimensional) ball graph. From that fact and existing results, we derive a simple QPTAS and a subexponential algorithm running in time 2O~‚Äã(n2/3)superscript2~ùëÇsuperscriptùëõ232^{\\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})} for Maximum Clique on disk and unit ball graphs. We then obtain a randomized EPTAS for computing the independence number on graphs having no disjoint union of two odd cycles as an induced subgraph, bounded VC-dimension, and linear independence number. This, in combination with our structural results, yields a randomized EPTAS for Max Clique on disk and unit ball graphs. Max Clique on unit ball graphs is equivalent to finding, given a collection of points in ‚Ñù3superscript‚Ñù3\\mathbb{R}^{3}, a maximum subset of points with diameter at most some fixed value. In stark contrast, Maximum Clique on ball graphs and unit 444-dimensional ball graphs, as well as intersection graphs of filled ellipses (even close to unit disks) or filled triangles is unlikely to have such algorithms. Indeed, we show that, for all those problems, there is a constant ratio of approximation which cannot be attained even in time 2n1‚àíŒµsuperscript2superscriptùëõ1ùúÄ2^{n^{1-\\varepsilon}}, unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper.
