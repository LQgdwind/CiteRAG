Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey of Near-Data Processing Architectures for Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Data-intensive workloads and applications, such as machine learning (ML), are fundamentally limited by traditional computing systems based on the von-Neumann architecture. As data movement operations and energy consumption become key bottlenecks in the design of computing systems, the interest in unconventional approaches such as Near-Data Processing (NDP), machine learning, and especially neural network (NN)-based accelerators has grown significantly. Emerging memory technologies, such as ReRAM and 3D-stacked, are promising for efficiently architecting NDP-based accelerators for NN due to their capabilities to work as both: High-density/low-energy storage and in/near-memory computation/search engine. In this paper, we present a survey of techniques for designing NDP architectures for NN. By classifying the techniques based on the memory technology employed, we underscore their similarities and differences. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future perspectives that need to be explored in order to improve and extend the adoption of NDP architectures for future computing platforms. This paper will be valuable for computer architects, chip designers and researchers in the area of machine learning.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
