Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Broadcast Channel Coding: Algorithmic Aspects and Non-Signaling Assistance\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We address the problem of coding for classical broadcast channels, which entails maximizing the success probability that can be achieved by sending a fixed number of messages over a broadcast channel. For point-to-point channels, Barman and Fawzi found in [1] a (1‚àíe‚àí1)1superscriptùëí1(1-e^{-1})-approximation algorithm running in polynomial time, and showed that it is NP-hard to achieve a strictly better approximation ratio. Furthermore, these algorithmic results were at the core of the limitations they established on the power of non-signaling assistance for point-to-point channels. It is natural to ask if similar results hold for broadcast channels, exploiting links between approximation algorithms of the channel coding problem and the non-signaling assisted capacity region. In this work, we make several contributions on algorithmic aspects and non-signaling assisted capacity regions of broadcast channels. For the class of deterministic broadcast channels, we describe a (1‚àíe‚àí1)2superscript1superscriptùëí12(1-e^{-1})^{2}-approximation algorithm running in polynomial time, and we show that the capacity region for that class is the same with or without non-signaling assistance. Finally, we show that in the value query model, we cannot achieve a better approximation ratio than Œ©‚Äã(1m)Œ©1ùëö\\Omega\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}}\\right) in polynomial time for the general broadcast channel coding problem, with mùëöm the size of one of the outputs of the channel.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
