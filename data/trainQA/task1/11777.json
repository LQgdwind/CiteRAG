Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Quantum Fast Implementation of Private Information Retrieval and Functional Bootstrapping\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Quantum computation has found greater efficiency and security across various fields. We show that, in a near-term hybrid cloud computing scenario with only one single quantum server and an entirely classical client, critical bottlenecks in privacy-preserving computation can be addressed. First, we propose an efficient quantum functional bootstrapping algorithm with a runtime polynomial in the plaintext-size, providing an exponential quantum speedup over classical algorithms. Second, we present a secure and fast quantum private information retrieval protocol with logarithmic query time. The security relies on the learning with errors (LWE) problem with polynomial modulus, greatly improving the security of classical fast PIR protocol based on ring-LWE with super-polynomial modulus. Technically, we extend an important classical homomorphic operation, known as blind rotation, to the quantum case by an encrypted conditional rotation technique. This technique holds promise for broader applications in quantum cryptography.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
