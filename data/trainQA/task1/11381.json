Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 64 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Introducing Moment: A toolkit for semi-definite programming with moment matrices\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Non-commutative polynomial optimization is a powerful technique with numerous applications in quantum nonlocality, quantum key distribution, causal inference, many-body physics, amongst others. The standard approach is to reduce such optimizations to a hierarchy of semi-definite programs, which can be solved numerically using well-understood interior-point methods. A key, but computationally costly, step is the formulation of moment matrices, whose size (and hence cost) grows exponentially with the depth of the hierarchy. It is therefore essential to have highly-optimized software to construct moment matrices. Here, we introduce Moment: a toolkit that produces moment matrix relaxations from the specification of a non-commutative optimization problem. In order to obtain the absolute best performance, Moment is written in C++, and for convenience of use provides an interface via MATLAB. We benchmark Moment’s performance, and see that it can be up to four orders of magnitude faster than current software with similar functionality.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 64 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
