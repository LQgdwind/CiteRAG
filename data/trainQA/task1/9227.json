      "content": "Paper Title: Blockchain-Enabled Federated Learning: A Reference Architecture Design, Implementation, and Verification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper presents a novel reference architecture for blockchain-enabled federated learning (BCFL), a state-of-the-art approach that amalgamates the strengths of federated learning and blockchain technology. We define smart contract functions, stakeholders and their roles, and the use of interplanetary file system (IPFS) as key components of BCFL and conduct a comprehensive analysis. In traditional centralized federated learning, the selection of local nodes and the collection of learning results for each round are merged under the control of a central server. In contrast, in BCFL, all these processes are monitored and managed via smart contracts. Additionally, we propose an extension architecture to support both cross-device and cross-silo federated learning scenarios. Furthermore, we implement and verify the architecture in a practical real-world Ethereum development environment. Our BCFL reference architecture provides significant flexibility and extensibility, accommodating the integration of various additional elements, as per specific requirements and use cases, thereby rendering it an adaptable solution for a wide range of BCFL applications. As a prominent example of extensibility, decentralized identifiers (DIDs) have been employed as an authentication method to introduce practical utilization within BCFL. This study not only bridges a crucial gap between research and practical deployment but also lays a solid foundation for future explorations in the realm of BCFL. The pivotal contribution of this study is the successful implementation and verification of a realistic BCFL reference architecture. We intend to make the source code publicly accessible shortly, fostering further advancements and adaptations within the community.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
