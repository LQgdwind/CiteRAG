Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Endurance Management in Neuromorphic Computing via Hardware-Software Co-design\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Non-Volatile Memories (NVMs) such as Resistive RAM (RRAM) are used in neuromorphic systems to implement high-density and low-power analog synaptic weights. Unfortunately, an RRAM cell can switch its state after reading its content a certain number of times. Such behavior challenges the integrity and program-once-read-many-times philosophy of implementing machine learning inference on neuromorphic systems, impacting the Quality-of-Service (QoS). Elevated temperatures and frequent usage can significantly shorten the number of times an RRAM cell can be reliably read before it becomes absolutely necessary to reprogram. We propose an architectural solution to extend the read endurance of RRAM-based neuromorphic systems. We make two key contributions. First, we formulate the read endurance of an RRAM cell as a function of the programmed synaptic weight and its activation within a machine learning workload. Second, we propose an intelligent workload mapping strategy incorporating the endurance formulation to place the synapses of a machine learning model onto the RRAM cells of the hardware. The objective is to extend the inference lifetime, defined as the number of times the model can be used to generate output (inference) before the trained weights need to be reprogrammed on the RRAM cells of the system. We evaluate our architectural solution with machine learning workloads on a cycle-accurate simulator of an RRAM-based neuromorphic system. Our results demonstrate a significant increase in inference lifetime with only a minimal performance impact.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
