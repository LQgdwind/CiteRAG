To the best of our knowledge, the cases 4–6 were not considered in literature before. We develop true sub-quadratic algorithms for them. We apply our results to the knapsack problem with a separable nonlinear objective function, shortest lattice vector, and closest lattice vector problems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
