      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is a powerful technique for model compression, reducing the precision of neural networks without additional training overhead. Recent works have investigated adopting 8-bit floating-point quantization (FP8) in the context of PTQ for model inference. However, the exploration of floating-point formats smaller than 8 bits and their comparison with integer quantization remains relatively limited. In this work, we present minifloats, which are reduced-precision floating-point formats capable of further reducing the memory footprint, latency, and energy cost of a model while approaching full-precision model accuracy. Our work presents a novel PTQ design-space exploration, comparing minifloat and integer quantization schemes across a range of 3 to 8 bits for both weights and activations. We examine the applicability of various PTQ techniques to minifloats, including weight equalization, bias correction, SmoothQuant, gradient-based learned rounding, and the GPTQ method. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of low-precision minifloats when compared to their integer counterparts across a spectrum of accuracy-precision trade-offs on a set of reference deep learning vision workloads. Finally, we evaluate our results against an FPGA-based hardware cost model, showing that integer quantization often remains the Pareto-optimal option, given its relatively smaller hardware resource footprint.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
