Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Colouring Generalized Claw-Free Graphs and Graphs of Large Girth: Bounding the Diameter 1footnote 11footnote 1Some of the results in this paper appeared in an extended abstract in the proceedings of MFCS 2019 [33].\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract For a fixed integer, the k𝑘k-Colouring problem is to decide if the vertices of a graph can be coloured with at most k𝑘k colours for an integer k𝑘k, such that no two adjacent vertices are coloured alike. A graph G𝐺G is H𝐻H-free if G𝐺G does not contain H𝐻H as an induced subgraph. It is known that for all k≥3𝑘3k\\geq 3, the k𝑘k-Colouring problem is NP-complete for H𝐻H-free graphs if H𝐻H contains an induced claw or cycle. The case where H𝐻H contains a cycle follows from the known result that the problem is NP-complete even for graphs of arbitrarily large fixed girth. We examine to what extent the situation may change if in addition the input graph has bounded diameter.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
