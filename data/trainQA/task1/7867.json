Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Explicit two-sided unique-neighbor expanders\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study the problem of constructing explicit sparse graphs that exhibit strong vertex expansion. Our main result is the first two-sided construction of imbalanced unique-neighbor expanders, meaning bipartite graphs where small sets contained in both the left and right bipartitions exhibit unique-neighbor expansion, along with algebraic properties relevant to constructing quantum codes. Our constructions are obtained from instantiations of the tripartite line product of a large tripartite spectral expander and a sufficiently good constant-sized unique-neighbor expander, a new graph product we defined that generalizes the line product in the work of Alon and Capalbo [AC02] and the routed product in the work of Asherov and Dinur [AD23]. To analyze the vertex expansion of graphs arising from the tripartite line product, we develop a sharp characterization of subgraphs that can arise in bipartite spectral expanders, generalizing results of Kahale [Kah95], which may be of independent interest. By picking appropriate graphs to apply our product to, we give a strongly explicit construction of an infinite family of (d1,d2)subscript𝑑1subscript𝑑2(d_{1},d_{2})-biregular graphs (Gn)n⩾1subscriptsubscript𝐺𝑛𝑛1(G_{n})_{n\\geqslant 1} (for large enough d1subscript𝑑1d_{1} and d2subscript𝑑2d_{2}) where all sets S𝑆S with fewer than a small constant fraction of vertices have Ω​(d1⋅|S|)Ω⋅subscript𝑑1𝑆\\Omega(d_{1}\\cdot|S|) unique-neighbors (assuming d1⩽d2subscript𝑑1subscript𝑑2d_{1}\\leqslant d_{2}). Additionally, we can also guarantee that subsets of vertices of size up to exp⁡(Ω​(log⁡|V​(Gn)|))Ω𝑉subscript𝐺𝑛\\exp(\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\log|V(G_{n})|})) expand losslessly.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
