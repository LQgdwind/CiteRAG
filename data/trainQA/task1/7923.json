Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Topological Deep Learning: A Review of an Emerging Paradigm\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Topological data analysis (TDA) provides insight into data shape. The summaries obtained by these methods are principled global descriptions of multi-dimensional data whilst exhibiting stable properties such as robustness to deformation and noise. Such properties are desirable in deep learning pipelines but they are typically obtained using non-TDA strategies. This is partly caused by the difficulty of combining TDA constructs (e.g. barcode and persistence diagrams) with current deep learning algorithms. Fortunately, we are now witnessing a growth of deep learning applications embracing topologically-guided components. In this survey, we review the nascent field of topological deep learning by first revisiting core concepts of TDA. We then explore how the use of TDA techniques has evolved over time to support deep learning frameworks, and how they can be integrated into different aspects of deep learning. Furthermore, we touch on TDA usage for analyzing existing deep models; deep topological analytics. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future prospects of topological deep learning.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
