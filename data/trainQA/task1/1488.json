Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: 2.5D Root of Trust: Secure System-Level Integration of Untrusted Chiplets\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Dedicated, after acceptance and publication, in memory of the late Vassos Soteriou. For the first time, we leverage the 2.5D interposer technology to establish system-level security in the face of hardware- and software-centric adversaries. More specifically, we integrate chiplets (i.e., third-party hard intellectual property of complex functionality, like microprocessors) using a security-enforcing interposer. Such hardware organization provides a robust 2.5D root of trust for trustworthy, yet powerful and flexible, computation systems. The security paradigms for our scheme, employed firmly by design and construction, are: 1) stringent physical separation of trusted from untrusted components, and 2) runtime monitoring. The system-level activities of all untrusted commodity chiplets are checked continuously against security policies via physically separated security features. Aside from the security promises, the good economics of outsourced supply chains are still maintained; the system vendor is free to procure chiplets from the open market, while only producing the interposer and assembling the 2.5D system oneself. We showcase our scheme using the Cortex-M0 core and the AHB-Lite bus by ARM, building a secure 64-core system with shared memories. We evaluate our scheme through hardware simulation, considering different threat scenarios. Finally, we devise a physical-design flow for 2.5D systems, based on commercial-grade design tools, to demonstrate and evaluate our 2.5D root of trust.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
