      "content": "Paper Title: A First Running Time Analysis of the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2)\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have emerged as a predominant approach for addressing multi-objective optimization problems. However, the theoretical foundation of multi-objective EAs (MOEAs), particularly the fundamental aspects like running time analysis, remains largely underexplored. Existing theoretical studies mainly focus on basic MOEAs, with little attention given to practical MOEAs. In this paper, we present a running time analysis of strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 (SPEA2) for the first time. Specifically, we prove that the expected running time of SPEA2 for solving three commonly used multi-objective problems, i.e., mùëömOneMinMax, mùëömLeadingOnesTrailingZeroes, and mùëöm-OneJumpZeroJump, is O‚Äã(Œº‚Äãn‚ãÖmin‚Å°{m‚Äãlog‚Å°n,n})ùëÇ‚ãÖùúáùëõùëöùëõùëõO(\\mu n\\cdot\\min\\{m\\log n,n\\}), O‚Äã(Œº‚Äãn2)ùëÇùúásuperscriptùëõ2O(\\mu n^{2}), and O(Œºnk‚ãÖmin{mnO(\\mu n^{k}\\cdot\\min\\{mn, 3m/2})3^{m/2}\\}), respectively. Here mùëöm denotes the number of objectives, and the population size Œºùúá\\mu is required to be at least (2‚Äãn/m+1)m/2superscript2ùëõùëö1ùëö2(2n/m+1)^{m/2}, (2‚Äãn/m+1)m‚àí1superscript2ùëõùëö1ùëö1(2n/m+1)^{m-1} and (2‚Äãn/m‚àí2‚Äãk+3)m/2superscript2ùëõùëö2ùëò3ùëö2(2n/m-2k+3)^{m/2}, respectively. The proofs are accomplished through general theorems which are also applicable for analyzing the expected running time of other MOEAs on these problems, and thus can be helpful for future theoretical analysis of MOEAs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
