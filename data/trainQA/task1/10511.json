      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-class Road Defect Detection and Segmentation using Spatial and Channel-wise Attention for Autonomous Road Repairing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Road pavement detection and segmentation are critical for developing autonomous road repair systems. However, developing an instance segmentation method that simultaneously performs multi-class defect detection and segmentation is challenging due to the textural simplicity of road pavement image, the diversity of defect geometries, and the morphological ambiguity between classes. We propose a novel end-to-end method for multi-class road defect detection and segmentation. The proposed method comprises multiple spatial and channel-wise attention blocks available to learn global representations across spatial and channel-wise dimensions. Through these attention blocks, more globally generalised representations of morphological information (spatial characteristics) of road defects and colour and depth information of images can be learned. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we conducted various ablation studies and comparisons with prior methods on a newly collected dataset annotated with nine road defect classes. The experiments show that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for multi-class road defect detection and segmentation methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
