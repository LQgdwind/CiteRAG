Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Narrowing the Generalization Gap in Deep Boolean Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The rapid growth of the size and complexity in deep neural networks has sharply increased computational demands, challenging their efficient deployment in real-world scenarios. Boolean networks, constructed with logic gates, offer a hardware-friendly alternative that could enable more efficient implementation. However, their ability to match the performance of traditional networks has remained uncertain. This paper explores strategies to enhance deep Boolean networks with the aim of surpassing their traditional counterparts. We propose novel methods, including logical skip connections and spatiality preserving sampling, and validate them on vision tasks using widely adopted datasets, demonstrating significant improvement over existing approaches. Our analysis shows how deep Boolean networks can maintain high performance while minimizing computational costs through 1-bit logic operations. These findings suggest that Boolean networks are a promising direction for efficient, high-performance deep learning models, with significant potential for advancing hardware-accelerated AI applications.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
