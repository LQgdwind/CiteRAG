Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Offline Reinforcement Learning for Mixture-of-Expert Dialogue Management\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great promise for developing agents for dialogue management (DM) that are non-myopic, conduct rich conversations, and maximize overall user satisfaction. Despite the advancements in RL and language models (LMs), employing RL to drive conversational chatbots still poses significant challenges. A primary issue stems from RL’s dependency on online exploration for effective learning, a process that can be costly. Moreover, engaging in online interactions with humans during the training phase can raise safety concerns, as the LM can potentially generate unwanted outputs. This issue is exacerbated by the combinatorial action spaces facing these algorithms, as most LM agents generate responses at the word level. We develop various RL algorithms, specialized in dialogue planning, that leverage recent Mixture-of-Expert Language Models (MoE-LMs)—models that capture diverse semantics, generate utterances reflecting different intents, and are amenable for multi-turn DM. By exploiting the MoE-LM structure, our methods significantly reduce the size of the action space and improve the efficacy of RL-based DM. We evaluate our methods in open-domain dialogue to demonstrate their effectiveness with respect to the diversity of intent in generated utterances and overall DM performance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
