Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 58 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: High-order Multi-view Clustering for Generic Data\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Graph-based multi-view clustering has achieved better performance than most non-graph approaches. However, in many real-world scenarios, the graph structure of data is not given or the quality of initial graph is poor. Additionally, existing methods largely neglect the high-order neighborhood information that characterizes complex intrinsic interactions. To tackle these problems, we introduce an approach called high-order multi-view clustering (HMvC) to explore the topology structure information of generic data. Firstly, graph filtering is applied to encode structure information, which unifies the processing of attributed graph data and non-graph data in a single framework. Secondly, up to infinity-order intrinsic relationships are exploited to enrich the learned graph. Thirdly, to explore the consistent and complementary information of various views, an adaptive graph fusion mechanism is proposed to achieve a consensus graph. Comprehensive experimental results on both non-graph and attributed graph data show the superior performance of our method with respect to various state-of-the-art techniques, including some deep learning methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 58\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
