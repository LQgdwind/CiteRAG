Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: MARS: Middleware for Adaptive Reflective Computer Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Self-adaptive approaches for runtime resource management of manycore computing platforms often require a runtime model of the system that represents the software organization or the architecture of the target platform. The increasing heterogeneity in a platform’s resource types and the interactions between resources pose challenges for coordinated model-based decision making in the face of dynamic workloads. Self-awareness properties address these challenges for emerging heterogeneous manycore processing (HMP) platforms through reflective resource managers. However, with HMP computing platform architectures evolving rapidly, porting the self-aware decision logic across different hardware platforms is challenging, requiring resource managers to update their models and platform-specific interfaces. We propose MARS (Middleware for Adaptive and Reflective Systems), a cross-layer and multi-platform framework that allows users to easily create resource managers by composing system models and resource management policies in a flexible and coordinated manner. MARS consists of a generic user-level sensing/actuation interface that allows for portable policy design, and a reflective system model used to coordinate multiple policies. We demonstrate MARS’ interaction across multiple layers of the system stack through a dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) policy example which can run on any Linux-based HMP computing platform.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
