Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 75 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: NAAQA: A Neural Architecture for Acoustic Question Answering\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The goal of the Acoustic Question Answering (AQA) task is to answer a free-form text question about the content of an acoustic scene. It was inspired by the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task. In this paper, based on the previously introduced CLEAR dataset, we propose a new benchmark for AQA, namely CLEAR2, that emphasizes the specific challenges of acoustic inputs. These include handling of variable duration scenes, and scenes built with elementary sounds that differ between training and test set. We also introduce NAAQA, a neural architecture that leverages specific properties of acoustic inputs. The use of 1D convolutions in time and frequency to process 2D spectro-temporal representations of acoustic content shows promising results and enables reductions in model complexity. We show that time coordinate maps augment temporal localization capabilities which enhance performance of the network by ∼similar-to\\sim17 percentage points. On the other hand, frequency coordinate maps have little influence on this task. NAAQA achieves 79.5% of accuracy on the AQA task with ∼similar-to\\sim4 times fewer parameters than the previously explored VQA model. We evaluate the performance of NAAQA on an independent data set reconstructed from DAQA. We also test the addition of a MALiMo module in our model on both CLEAR2 and DAQA. We provide a detailed analysis of the results for the different question types. We release the code to produce CLEAR2 as well as NAAQA to foster research in this newly emerging machine learning task.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 75 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 75\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
