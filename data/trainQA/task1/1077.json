Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: A ùê∂¬π-continuous Trace-Finite-Cell-Method for linear thin shell analysis on implicitly defined surfaces\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A Trace-Finite-Cell-Method for the numerical analysis of thin shells is presented combining concepts of the TraceFEM and the Finite-Cell-Method. As an underlying shell model we use the Koiter model, which we re-derive in strong form based on first principles of continuum mechanics by recasting well-known relations formulated in local coordinates to a formulation independent of a parametrization. The field approximation is constructed by restricting shape functions defined on a structured background grid on the shell surface. As shape functions we use on a background grid the tensor product of cubic splines. This yields C1superscriptùê∂1C^{1}-continuous approximation spaces, which are required by the governing equations of fourth order. The parametrization-free formulation allows a natural implementation of the proposed method and manufactured solutions on arbitrary geometries for code verification. Thus, the implementation is verified by a convergence analysis where the error is computed with an exact manufactured solution. Furthermore, benchmark tests are investigated.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
