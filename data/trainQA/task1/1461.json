Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Structured Graph Learning for Clustering and Semi-supervised Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Graphs have become increasingly popular in modeling structures and interactions in a wide variety of problems during the last decade. Graph-based clustering and semi-supervised classification techniques have shown impressive performance. This paper proposes a graph learning framework to preserve both the local and global structure of data. Specifically, our method uses the self-expressiveness of samples to capture the global structure and adaptive neighbor approach to respect the local structure. Furthermore, most existing graph-based methods conduct clustering and semi-supervised classification on the graph learned from the original data matrix, which doesn‚Äôt have explicit cluster structure, thus they might not achieve the optimal performance. By considering rank constraint, the achieved graph will have exactly cùëêc connected components if there are cùëêc clusters or classes. As a byproduct of this, graph learning and label inference are jointly and iteratively implemented in a principled way. Theoretically, we show that our model is equivalent to a combination of kernel k-means and k-means methods under certain condition. Extensive experiments on clustering and semi-supervised classification demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
