Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: G√∂del logics: Prenex fragments Research supported by FWF grant P 36571\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we provide a complete classification for the first-order G√∂del logics concerning the property that the formulas admit logically equivalent prenex normal forms. We show that the only first-order G√∂del logics that admit such prenex forms are those with finite truth value sets since they allow all quantifier-shift rules and the logic G‚Üësubscriptùê∫‚ÜëG_{\\uparrow} with only one accumulation point at 111 in the infinite truth values set. In all the other cases, there are generally no logically equivalent prenex normal forms. We will also see that G‚Üësubscriptùê∫‚ÜëG_{\\uparrow} is the intersection of all finite first-order G√∂del logics. The second part of this paper investigates the existence of effective equivalence between the validity of a formula and the validity of some prenex normal form. The existence of such a normal form is obvious for finite valued G√∂del logic and G‚Üësubscriptùê∫‚ÜëG_{\\uparrow}. G√∂del logics with an uncountable truth value set admit the prenex normal forms if and only if every surrounding of 00 is uncountable or 00 is an isolated point. Otherwise, uncountable G√∂del logics are not recursively enumerable, however, the prenex fragment is always recursively enumerable. Therefore, there is no effective translation between the valid formula and the valid prenex normal form. However, the existence of effectively constructible validity equivalent prenex forms for the countable case is still up for debate.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
