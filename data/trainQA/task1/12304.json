      "content": "Paper Title: A survey on pioneering metaheuristic algorithms between 2019 and 2024\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This review examines over 150 new metaheuristics of the last six years (between 2019-2024), underscoring their profound influence and performance. Over the past three decades, more than 500 new metaheuristic algorithms have been proposed, with no slowdown in sight—an overwhelming abundance that complicates the process of selecting and assessing the most effective solutions for complex optimization challenges. Our evaluation centers on pivotal criteria, including annual citation metrics, the breadth of addressed problem types, source code availability, user-friendly parameter configurations, innovative mechanisms and operators, and approaches designed to mitigate traditional metaheuristic issues such as stagnation and premature convergence. We further explore recent high-impact applications of the past six years’ most influential 23 metaheuristic algorithms, shedding light on their advantages and limitations, while identifying challenges and potential avenues for future research.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 304 most likely reference titles for this paper.
