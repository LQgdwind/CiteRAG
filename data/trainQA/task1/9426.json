      "content": "Paper Title: QBitOpt: Fast and Accurate Bitwidth Reallocation during Training\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Quantizing neural networks is one of the most effective methods for achieving efficient inference on mobile and embedded devices. In particular, mixed precision quantized (MPQ) networks, whose layers can be quantized to different bitwidths, achieve better task performance for the same resource constraint compared to networks with homogeneous bitwidths. However, finding the optimal bitwidth allocation is a challenging problem as the search space grows exponentially with the number of layers in the network. In this paper, we propose QBitOpt, a novel algorithm for updating bitwidths during quantization-aware training (QAT). We formulate the bitwidth allocation problem as a constraint optimization problem. By combining fast-to-compute sensitivities with efficient solvers during QAT, QBitOpt can produce mixed-precision networks with high task performance guaranteed to satisfy strict resource constraints. This contrasts with existing mixed-precision methods that learn bitwidths using gradients and cannot provide such guarantees. We evaluate QBitOpt on ImageNet and confirm that we outperform existing fixed and mixed-precision methods under average bitwidth constraints, commonly found in literature.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
