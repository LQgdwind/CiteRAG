Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Hybrid Approach to Dependency Parsing: Combining Rules and Morphology with Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Fully data-driven, deep learning-based models are usually designed as language-independent and have been shown to be successful for many natural language processing tasks. However, when the studied language is low-resourced and the amount of training data is insufficient, these models can benefit from the integration of natural language grammar-based information. We propose two approaches to dependency parsing especially for languages with restricted amount of training data. Our first approach combines a state-of-the-art deep learning-based parser with a rule-based approach and the second one incorporates morphological information into the parser. In the rule-based approach, the parsing decisions made by the rules are encoded and concatenated with the vector representations of the input words as additional information to the deep network. The morphology-based approach proposes different methods to include the morphological structure of words into the parser network. Experiments are conducted on the IMST-UD Treebank and the results suggest that integration of explicit knowledge about the target language to a neural parser through a rule-based parsing system and morphological analysis leads to more accurate annotations and hence, increases the parsing performance in terms of attachment scores. The proposed methods are developed for Turkish, but can be adapted to other languages as well.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
