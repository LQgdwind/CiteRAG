Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Hybrid Search for Efficient Planning with Completeness Guarantees\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Solving complex planning problems has been a long-standing challenge in computer science. Learning-based subgoal search methods have shown promise in tackling these problems, but they often suffer from a lack of completeness guarantees, meaning that they may fail to find a solution even if one exists. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach to augment a subgoal search method to achieve completeness in discrete action spaces. Specifically, we augment the high-level search with low-level actions to execute a multi-level (hybrid) search, which we call complete subgoal search. This solution achieves the best of both worlds: the practical efficiency of high-level search and the completeness of low-level search. We apply the proposed search method to a recently proposed subgoal search algorithm and evaluate the algorithm trained on offline data on complex planning problems. We demonstrate that our complete subgoal search not only guarantees completeness but can even improve performance in terms of search expansions for instances that the high-level could solve without low-level augmentations. Our approach makes it possible to apply subgoal-level planning for systems where completeness is a critical requirement.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
