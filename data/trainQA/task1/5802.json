Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Time Window Fr√©chet and Metric-Based Edit Distance for Passively Collected Trajectories\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The advances of modern localization techniques and the wide spread of mobile devices have provided us great opportunities to collect and mine human mobility trajectories. In this work, we focus on passively collected trajectories, which are sequences of time-stamped locations that mobile entities visit. To analyse such trajectories, a crucial part is a measure of similarity between two trajectories. We propose the time-window Fr√©chet distance, which enforces the maximum temporal separation between points of two trajectories that can be paired in the calculation of the Fr√©chet distance, and the metric-based edit distance which incorporates the underlying metric in the computation of the insertion and deletion costs. Using these measures, we can cluster trajectories to infer group motion patterns. We look at the kùëòk-gather problem which requires each cluster to have at least kùëòk trajectories. We prove that kùëòk-gather remains NP-hard under edit distance, metric-based edit distance and Jaccard distance. Finally, we improve over previous results on discrete Fr√©chet distance and show that there is no strongly sub-quadratic time with approximation factor less than 1.611.611.61 in two dimensional setting unless SETH fails.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 47\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
