Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Pre-training for Information Retrieval: Are Hyperlinks Fully Explored?\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Recent years have witnessed great progress on applying pre-trained language models, e.g., BERT, to information retrieval (IR) tasks. Hyperlinks, which are commonly used in Web pages, have been leveraged for designing pre-training objectives. For example, anchor texts of the hyperlinks have been used for simulating queries, thus constructing tremendous query-document pairs for pre-training. However, as a bridge across two web pages, the potential of hyperlinks has not been fully explored. In this work, we focus on modeling the relationship between two documents that are connected by hyperlinks and designing a new pre-training objective for ad-hoc retrieval. Specifically, we categorize the relationships between documents into four groups: no link, unidirectional link, symmetric link, and the most relevant symmetric link. By comparing two documents sampled from adjacent groups, the model can gradually improve its capability of capturing matching signals. We propose a progressive hyperlink predication (PHP) framework to explore the utilization of hyperlinks in pre-training. Experimental results on two large-scale ad-hoc retrieval datasets and six question-answering datasets demonstrate its superiority over existing pre-training methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 44\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
