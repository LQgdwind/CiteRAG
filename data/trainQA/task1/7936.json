Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Data Quality-aware Mixed-precision Quantization via Hybrid Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Mixed-precision quantization mostly predetermines the model bit-width settings before actual training due to the non-differential bit-width sampling process, obtaining sub-optimal performance. Worse still, the conventional static quality-consistent training setting, i.e., all data is assumed to be of the same quality across training and inference, overlooks data quality changes in real-world applications which may lead to poor robustness of the quantized models. In this paper, we propose a novel Data Quality-aware Mixed-precision Quantization framework, dubbed DQMQ, to dynamically adapt quantization bit-widths to different data qualities. The adaption is based on a bit-width decision policy that can be learned jointly with the quantization training. Concretely, DQMQ is modeled as a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) task that combines model-based policy optimization with supervised quantization training. By relaxing the discrete bit-width sampling to a continuous probability distribution that is encoded with few learnable parameters, DQMQ is differentiable and can be directly optimized end-to-end with a hybrid optimization target considering both task performance and quantization benefits. Trained on mixed-quality image datasets, DQMQ can implicitly select the most proper bit-width for each layer when facing uneven input qualities. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets and networks demonstrate the superiority of DQMQ against existing fixed/mixed-precision quantization methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
