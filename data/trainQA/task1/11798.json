Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 66 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: A survey of Zarankiewicz problem in geometry\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract One of the central topics in extremal graph theory is the study of the function e​x​(n,H)𝑒𝑥𝑛𝐻ex(n,H), which represents the maximum number of edges a graph with n𝑛n vertices can have while avoiding a fixed graph H𝐻H as a subgraph. Turán provided a complete characterization for the case when H𝐻H is a complete graph on r𝑟r vertices. Erdős, Stone, and Simonovits extended Turán’s result to arbitrary graphs H𝐻H with χ​(H)>2𝜒𝐻2\\chi(H)>2 (chromatic number greater than 2). However, determining the asymptotics of e​x​(n,H)𝑒𝑥𝑛𝐻ex(n,H) for bipartite graphs H𝐻H remains a widely open problem. A classical example of this is Zarankiewicz’s problem, which asks for the asymptotics of e​x​(n,Kt,t)𝑒𝑥𝑛subscript𝐾𝑡𝑡ex(n,K_{t,t}). In this paper, we survey Zarankiewicz’s problem, with a focus on graphs that arise from geometry. Incidence geometry, in particular, can be viewed as a manifestation of Zarankiewicz’s problem in geometrically defined graphs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 66 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
