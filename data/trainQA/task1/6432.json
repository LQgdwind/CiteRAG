Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Camera Pose Auto-Encoders for Improving Pose Regression\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Absolute pose regressor (APR) networks are trained to estimate the pose of the camera given a captured image. They compute latent image representations from which the camera position and orientation are regressed. APRs provide a different tradeoff between localization accuracy, runtime, and memory, compared to structure-based localization schemes that provide state-of-the-art accuracy. In this work, we introduce Camera Pose Auto-Encoders (PAEs), multilayer perceptrons that are trained via a Teacher-Student approach to encode camera poses using APRs as their teachers. We show that the resulting latent pose representations can closely reproduce APR performance and demonstrate their effectiveness for related tasks. Specifically, we propose a light-weight test-time optimization in which the closest train poses are encoded and used to refine camera position estimation. This procedure achieves a new state-of-the-art position accuracy for APRs, on both the CambridgeLandmarks and 7Scenes benchmarks. We also show that train images can be reconstructed from the learned pose encoding, paving the way for integrating visual information from the train set at a low memory cost. Our code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/yolish/camera-pose-auto-encoders.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
