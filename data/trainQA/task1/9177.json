      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Generalization in Meta-Learning via Meta-Gradient Augmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Meta-learning methods typically follow a two-loop framework, where each loop potentially suffers from notorious overfitting, hindering rapid adaptation and generalization to new tasks. Existing schemes solve it by enhancing the mutual-exclusivity or diversity of training samples, but these data manipulation strategies are data-dependent and insufficiently flexible. This work alleviates overfitting in meta-learning from the perspective of gradient regularization and proposes a data-independent Meta-Gradient Augmentation (MGAug) method. The key idea is to first break the rote memories by network pruning to address memorization overfitting in the inner loop, and then the gradients of pruned sub-networks naturally form the high-quality augmentation of the meta-gradient to alleviate learner overfitting in the outer loop. Specifically, we explore three pruning strategies, including random width pruning, random parameter pruning, and a newly proposed catfish pruning that measures a Meta-Memorization Carrying Amount (MMCA) score for each parameter and prunes high-score ones to break rote memories as much as possible. The proposed MGAug is theoretically guaranteed by the generalization bound from the PAC-Bayes framework. In addition, we extend a lightweight version, called MGAug-MaxUp, as a trade-off between performance gains and resource overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple few-shot learning benchmarks validate MGAugâ€™s effectiveness and significant improvement over various meta-baselines. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/xxLifeLover/Meta-Gradient-Augmentation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 60\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
