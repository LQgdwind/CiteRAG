      "content": "Paper Title: Spectral mesh-free quadrature for planar regions bounded by rational parametric curves\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This work presents spectral, mesh-free, Green‚Äôs theorem-based numerical quadrature schemes for integrating functions over planar regions bounded by rational parametric curves. Our algorithm proceeds in two steps: (1) We first find intermediate quadrature rules for line integrals along the region‚Äôs boundary curves corresponding to Green‚Äôs theorem. (2) We then use a high-order quadrature rule to compute the numerical antiderivative of the integrand along a coordinate axis, which is used to evaluate the Green‚Äôs theorem line integral. We present two methods to compute the intermediate quadrature rule. The first is spectrally accurate (it converges faster than any algebraic order with respect to number of quadrature points) and is relatively easy to implement, but has no guarantee of polynomial exactness. The second guarantees exactness for polynomial integrands up to a pre-specified degree kùëòk with an a priori-known number of quadrature points and retains the convergence properties of the first, but is slightly more complicated. The quadrature schemes have applications to computation of geometric moments, immersogeometric analysis, conservative field transfer between high-order meshes, and initialization of multi-material simulations with rational geometry. We compare the quadrature schemes produced using our method to other methods in the literature and show that they are much more efficient both in terms of number of quadrature points and computational time. We provide an open-source implementation of the algorithm in MATLAB.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
