Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Rethinking Skip Connections in Encoder-decoder Networks for Monocular Depth Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Skip connections are fundamental units in encoder-decoder networks, which are able to improve the feature propagtion of the neural networks. However, most methods with skip connections just connected features with the same resolution in the encoder and the decoder, which ignored the information loss in the encoder with the layers going deeper. To leverage the information loss of the features in shallower layers of the encoder, we propose a full skip connection network (FSCN) for monocular depth estimation task. In addition, to fuse features within skip connections more closely, we present an adaptive concatenation module (ACM). Further more, we conduct extensive experiments on the ourdoor and indoor datasets (i.e., the KITTI dataste and the NYU Depth V2 dataset) for FSCN and FSCN gets the state-of-the-art results.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
