Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 60 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Dimensional Event Data in Graph Databases\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Process event data is usually stored either in a sequential process event log or in a relational database. While the sequential, single-dimensional nature of event logs aids querying for (sub)sequences of events based on temporal relations such as “directly/eventually-follows”, it does not support querying multi-dimensional event data of multiple related entities. Relational databases allow storing multi-dimensional event data but existing query languages do not support querying for sequences or paths of events in terms of temporal relations. In this paper, we propose a general data model for multi-dimensional event data based on labeled property graphs that allows storing structural and temporal relations in a single, integrated graph-based data structure in a systematic way. We provide semantics for all concepts of our data model, and generic queries for modeling event data over multiple entities that interact synchronously and asynchronously. The queries allow for efficiently converting large real-life event data sets into our data model and we provide 5 converted data sets for further research. We show that typical and advanced queries for retrieving and aggregating such multi-dimensional event data can be formulated and executed efficiently in the existing query language Cypher, giving rise to several new research questions. Specifically aggregation queries on our data model enable process mining over multiple inter-related entities using off-the-shelf technology.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 60\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
