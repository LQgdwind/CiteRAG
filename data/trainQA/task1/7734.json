Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Asynchronous training of quantum reinforcement learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The development of quantum machine learning (QML) has received a lot of interest recently thanks to developments in both quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML). One of the ML paradigms that can be utilized to address challenging sequential decision-making issues is reinforcement learning (RL). It has been demonstrated that classical RL can successfully complete many difficult tasks. A leading method of building quantum RL agents relies on the variational quantum circuits (VQC). However, training QRL algorithms with VQCs requires significant amount of computational resources. This issue hurdles the exploration of various QRL applications. In this paper, we approach this challenge through asynchronous training QRL agents. Specifically, we choose the asynchronous training of advantage actor-critic variational quantum policies. We demonstrate the results via numerical simulations that within the tasks considered, the asynchronous training of QRL agents can reach performance comparable to or superior than classical agents with similar model sizes and architectures.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
