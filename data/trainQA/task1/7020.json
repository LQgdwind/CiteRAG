Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Learning of Locomotion Skills through the Discovery of Diverse Environmental Trajectory Generator Priors\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Data-driven learning based methods have recently been particularly successful at learning robust locomotion controllers for a variety of unstructured terrains. Prior work has shown that incorporating good locomotion priors in the form of trajectory generators (TGs) is effective at efficiently learning complex locomotion skills. However, defining a good, single TG as tasks/environments become increasingly more complex remains a challenging problem as it requires extensive tuning and risks reducing the effectiveness of the prior. In this paper, we present Evolved Environmental Trajectory Generators (EETG), a method that learns a diverse set of specialised locomotion priors using Quality-Diversity algorithms while maintaining a single policy within the Policies Modulating TG (PMTG) architecture. The results demonstrate that EETG enables a quadruped robot to successfully traverse a wide range of environments, such as slopes, stairs, rough terrain, and balance beams. Our experiments show that learning a diverse set of specialized TG priors is significantly (5 times) more efficient than using a single, fixed prior when dealing with a wide range of environments.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
