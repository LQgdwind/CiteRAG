Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Metaheuristic Enhanced with Feature-Based Guidance and Diversity Management for Solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We propose a metaheuristic algorithm enhanced with feature-based guidance that is designed to solve the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). To formulate the proposed guidance, we developed and explained a supervised Machine Learning (ML) model, that is used to formulate the guidance and control the diversity of the solution during the optimization process. We propose a metaheuristic algorithm combining neighborhood search and a novel mechanism of hybrid split and path relinking to implement the proposed guidance. The proposed guidance has proven to give a statistically significant improvement to the proposed metaheuristic algorithm when solving CVRP. Moreover, the proposed guided metaheuristic is also capable of producing competitive solutions among state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
