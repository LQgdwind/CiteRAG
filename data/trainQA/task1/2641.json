      "content": "Paper Title: TDQMF: Two-dimensional quantum mass function\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Quantum mass function has been applied in lots of fields because of its efficiency and validity of managing uncertainties in the form of quantum which can be regarded as an extension of classical Dempster‐Shafer (D‐S) evidence theory. However, how to handle uncertainties in the form of quantum is still an open issue. In this paper, a new method is proposed to dispose uncertain quantum information, which is called two-dimensional quantum mass function (TDQMF). A TDQMF is consist of two elements, T​Q=(ℚo​r​i​g​i​n​a​l,ℚi​n​d​i​c​a​t​i​v​e)𝑇𝑄subscriptℚ𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙subscriptℚ𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒TQ=(\\mathbb{Q}_{original},\\mathbb{Q}_{indicative}), both of the ℚ​sℚ𝑠\\mathbb{Q}s are quantum mass functions, in which the ℚi​n​d​i​c​a​t​i​v​esubscriptℚ𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒\\mathbb{Q}_{indicative} is an indicator of the reliability on ℚo​r​i​g​i​n​a​lsubscriptℚ𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙\\mathbb{Q}_{original}. More flexibility and effectiveness are offered in handling uncertainty in the field of quantum by the proposed method compared with primary quantum mass function. Besides, some numerical examples are provided and some practical applications are given to verify its correctness and validity.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper.
