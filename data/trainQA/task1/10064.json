      "content": "Paper Title: Optimal Clifford Initial States for Ising Hamiltonians\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Modern day quantum devices are in the NISQ era, meaning that the effects of size restrictions and noise are essential considerations when developing practical quantum algorithms. Recent developments have demonstrated that Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are an appropriate choice for current era quantum devices. VQAs make use of classical computation to iteratively optimize parameters of a quantum circuit, referred to as the ansatz. These parameters are usually chosen such that a given objective function is minimized. Generally, the cost function to be minimized is computed on a quantum device, and then the parameters are updated using a classical optimizer. One of the most promising VQAs for practical hardware is the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). VQE uses the expectation value of a given Hamiltonian as the cost function, and the minimal value of this particular cost function corresponds to the minimal eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian. Because evaluating quantum circuits is currently very noisy, developing classical bootstraps that help minimize the number of times a given circuit has to be evaluated is a powerful technique for improving the practicality of VQE. One possible such bootstrapping method is creating an ansatz which can be efficiently simulated on classical computers for restricted parameter values. Once the optimal set of restricted parameters is determined, they can be used as initial parameters for a VQE optimization which has access to the full parameter space. Stabilizer states are states which are generated by a particular group of operators called the Clifford Group. Because of the underlying structure of these operators, circuits consisting of only Clifford operators can be simulated efficiently on classical computers. Clifford Ansatz For Quantum Algorithms (CAFQA) is a proposed classical bootstrap for VQAs that uses ansatzes which reduce to clifford operators for restricted parameter values [1]. CAFQA has been shown to produce fairly accurate initialization for VQE applied to molecular Hamiltonians. Motivated by this result, in this paper we seek to analyze the Clifford states that optimize the cost function for a new type of Hamiltonian, namely Transverse Field Ising Hamiltonians. Our primary result is contained in theorem IV.1 which connects the problem of finding the optimal CAFQA initialization to a submodular minimization problem which in turn can be solved in polynomial time.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
