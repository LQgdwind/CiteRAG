Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: RSPT: Reconstruct Surroundings and Predict Trajectories for Generalizable Active Object Tracking\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Active Object Tracking (AOT) aims to maintain a specific relation between the tracker and object(s) by autonomously controlling the motion system of a tracker given observations. AOT has wide-ranging applications, such as in mobile robots and autonomous driving. However, building a generalizable active tracker that works robustly across different scenarios remains a challenge, especially in unstructured environments with cluttered obstacles and diverse layouts. We argue that constructing a state representation capable of modeling the geometry structure of the surroundings and the dynamics of the target is crucial for achieving this goal. To address this challenge, we present RSPT, a framework that forms a structure-aware motion representation by Reconstructing the Surroundings and Predicting the target Trajectory. Additionally, we enhance the generalization of the policy network by training in an asymmetric dueling mechanism. We evaluate RSPT on various simulated scenarios and show that it outperforms existing methods in unseen environments, particularly those with complex obstacles and layouts. We also demonstrate the successful transfer of RSPT to real-world settings. ††Project Website: https://sites.google.com/view/aot-rspt.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
