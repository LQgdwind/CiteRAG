Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Fortified quantum mass function utilizing ordinal pictorial check based on time interval analysis and expertise\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Information management has enter a completely new era, quantum era. However, there exists a lack of sufficient theory to extract truly useful quantum information and transfer it to a form which is intuitive and straightforward for decision making. Therefore, based on the quantum model of mass function, a fortified dual check system is proposed to ensure the judgment generated retains enough high accuracy. Moreover, considering the situations in real life, everything takes place in an observable time interval, then the concept of time interval is introduced into the frame of the check system. The proposed model is very helpful in disposing uncertain quantum information in this paper. And some applications are provided to verify the rationality and correctness of the proposed method.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
