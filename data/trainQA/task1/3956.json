      "content": "Paper Title: HierMUD: Hierarchical Multi-task Unsupervised Domain Adaptation between Bridges for Drive-by Damage Diagnosis\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Monitoring bridges through vibration responses of drive-by vehicles enables efficient and low-cost bridge maintenance by allowing each vehicle to inspect multiple bridges and eliminating the needs for installing and maintaining sensors on every bridge. However, many of the existing drive-by monitoring approaches are based on supervised learning models that require massive labeled data from every bridge. It is expensive and time-consuming, if not impossible, to obtain these labeled data. Furthermore, directly applying a supervised learning model trained on one bridge to new bridges would result in low accuracy due to the shift between different bridges’ data distributions. Moreover, when we have multiple tasks (e.g., damage detection, localization, and quantification), the distribution shifts become more challenging than having only one task because different tasks have distinct distribution shifts and varying task difficulties. To this end, we introduce HierMUD, the first Hierarchical Multi-task Unsupervised Domain adaptation framework that transfers the damage diagnosis model learned from one bridge to a new bridge without requiring any labels from the new bridge in any of the tasks. Specifically, our framework learns a hierarchical neural network model in an adversarial way to extract features that are informative to multiple diagnostic tasks and invariant across multiple bridges. To match distributions over multiple tasks, we design a new loss function based on a new provable generalization risk bound to adaptively assign higher weights to tasks with more shifted distributions. To learn multiple tasks with varying task difficulties, we split them into easy-to-learn and hard-to-learn based on empirical observations. Then, we formulate a feature hierarchy to utilize more learning resources to improve the hard-to-learn tasks’ performance. We evaluate our framework with experimental data from 2 bridges and 3 vehicles. We achieve average accuracy of 95% for damage detection, 93% for localization, and up to 72% for quantification.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
