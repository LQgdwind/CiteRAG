Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Constant rank factorizations of smooth maps\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Sonar systems are frequently used to classify objects at a distance by using the structure of the echoes of acoustic waves as a proxy for the object’s shape and composition. Traditional synthetic aperture processing is highly effective in solving classification problems when the conditions are favorable but relies on accurate knowledge of the sensor’s trajectory relative to the object being measured. This article provides several new theoretical tools that decouple object classification performance from trajectory estimation in synthetic aperture sonar processing. The key insight is that decoupling the trajectory from classification-relevant information involves factoring a function into the composition of two functions. The article presents several new general topological invariants for smooth functions based upon their factorizations over function composition. These invariants specialize to the case when a sonar platform trajectory is deformed by a non-small perturbation. The mathematical results exhibited in this article apply well beyond sonar classification problems. This article is written in a way that supports full mathematical generality.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
