Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: RFGAN: RF-Based Human Synthesis\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper demonstrates human synthesis based on the Radio Frequency (RF) signals, which leverages the fact that RF signals can record human movements with the signal reflections off the human body. Different from existing RF sensing works that can only perceive humans roughly, this paper aims to generate fine-grained optical human images by introducing a novel cross-modal RFGAN model. Specifically, we first build a radio system equipped with horizontal and vertical antenna arrays to transceive RF signals. Since the reflected RF signals are processed as obscure signal projection heatmaps on the horizontal and vertical planes, we design a RF-Extractor with RNN in RFGAN for RF heatmap encoding and combining to obtain the human activity information. Then we inject the information extracted by the RF-Extractor and RNN as the condition into GAN using the proposed RF-based adaptive normalizations. Finally, we train the whole model in an end-to-end manner. To evaluate our proposed model, we create two cross-modal datasets (RF-Walk & RF-Activity) that contain thousands of optical human activity frames and corresponding RF signals. Experimental results show that the RFGAN can generate target human activity frames using RF signals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to generate optical images based on RF signals.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
