Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Modeling Dyadic Conversations for Personality Inference\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Nowadays, automatical personality inference is drawing extensive attention from both academia and industry. Conventional methods are mainly based on user generated contents, e.g., profiles, likes, and texts of an individual, on social media, which are actually not very reliable. In contrast, dyadic conversations between individuals can not only capture how one expresses oneself, but also reflect how one reacts to different situations. Rich contextual information in dyadic conversation can explain an individualâ€™s response during his or her conversation. In this paper, we propose a novel augmented Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model for learning unsupervised Personal Conversational Embeddings (PCE) based on dyadic conversations between individuals. We adjust the formulation of each layer of a conventional GRU with sequence to sequence learning and personal information of both sides of the conversation. Based on the learned PCE, we can infer the personality of each individual. We conduct experiments on the Movie Script dataset, which is collected from conversations between characters in movie scripts. We find that modeling dyadic conversations between individuals can significantly improve personality inference accuracy. Experimental results illustrate the successful performance of our proposed method.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
