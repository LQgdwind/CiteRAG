Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: FedGen: Generalizable Federated Learning for Sequential Data\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Existing federated learning models that follow the standard risk minimization paradigm of machine learning often fail to generalize in the presence of spurious correlations in the training data. In many real-world distributed settings, spurious correlations exist due to biases and data sampling issues on distributed devices or clients that can erroneously influence models. Current generalization approaches are designed for centralized training and attempt to identify features that have an invariant causal relationship with the target, thereby reducing the effect of spurious features. However, such invariant risk minimization approaches rely on apriori knowledge of training data distributions which is hard to obtain in many applications. In this work, we present a generalizable federated learning framework called FedGen, which allows clients to identify and distinguish between spurious and invariant features in a collaborative manner without prior knowledge of training distributions. We evaluate our approach on real-world datasets from different domains and show that FedGen results in models that achieve significantly better generalization and can outperform the accuracy of current federated learning approaches by over 24%percent2424\\%.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
