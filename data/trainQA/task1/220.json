Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Road Map to Strong Intelligence\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract I wrote this paper because technology can really improve people’s lives. With it, we can live longer in a healthy body, save time through increased efficiency and automation, and make better decisions. To get to the next level, we need to start looking at intelligence from a much broader perspective, and promote international interdisciplinary collaborations. Section 1 of this paper delves into sociology and social psychology to explain that the mechanisms underlying intelligence are inherently social. Section 2 proposes a method to classify intelligence, and describes the differences between weak and strong intelligence. Section 3 examines the Chinese Room argument from a different perspective. It demonstrates that a Turing-complete machine cannot have strong intelligence, and considers the modifications necessary for a computer to be intelligent and have understanding. Section 4 argues that the existential risk caused by the technological explosion of a single agent should not be of serious concern. Section 5 looks at the AI control problem and argues that it is impossible to build a super-intelligent machine that will do what it creators want. By using insights from biology, it also proposes a solution to the control problem. Section 6 discusses some of the implications of strong intelligence. Section 7 lists the main challenges with deep learning, and asserts that radical changes will be required to reach strong intelligence. Section 8 examines a neuroscience framework that could help explain how a cortical column works. Section 9 lays out the broad strokes of a road map towards strong intelligence. Finally, section 10 analyzes the impacts and the challenges of greater intelligence.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
