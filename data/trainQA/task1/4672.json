Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient, Anytime Algorithms for Calibration with Isotonic Regression under Strictly Convex Losses\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We investigate the calibration of estimations to increase performance with an optimal monotone transform on the estimator outputs. We start by studying the traditional square error setting with its weighted variant and show that the optimal monotone transform is in the form of a unique staircase function. We further show that this staircase behavior is preserved for general strictly convex loss functions. Their optimal monotone transforms are also unique, i.e., there exist a single staircase transform that achieves the minimum loss. We propose a linear time and space algorithm that can find such optimal transforms for specific loss settings. Our algorithm has an online implementation where the optimal transform for the samples observed so far are found in linear space and amortized time when the samples arrive in an ordered fashion. We also extend our results to cases where the functions are not trivial to individually optimize and propose an anytime algorithm, which has linear space and pseudo-linearithmic time complexity.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
