Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: LOKI: Long Term and Key Intentions for Trajectory Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recent advances in trajectory prediction have shown that explicit reasoning about agents’ intent is important to accurately forecast their motion. However, the current research activities are not directly applicable to intelligent and safety critical systems. This is mainly because very few public datasets are available, and they only consider pedestrian-specific intents for a short temporal horizon from a restricted egocentric view. To this end, we propose LOKI (LOng term and Key Intentions), a novel large-scale dataset that is designed to tackle joint trajectory and intention prediction for heterogeneous traffic agents (pedestrians and vehicles) in an autonomous driving setting. The LOKI dataset is created to discover several factors that may affect intention, including i) agent’s own will, ii) social interactions, iii) environmental constraints, and iv) contextual information. We also propose a model that jointly performs trajectory and intention prediction, showing that recurrently reasoning about intention can assist with trajectory prediction. We show our method outperforms state-of-the-art trajectory prediction methods by upto 27%percent2727\\% and also provide a baseline for frame-wise intention estimation. The dataset is available at https://usa.honda-ri.com/loki\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
