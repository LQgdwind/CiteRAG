Given a graph Gùê∫G with a set œÄ‚Äã(v)ùúãùë£\\pi(v) of feasible degrees, called a degree constraint, for each vertex vùë£v of Gùê∫G, the general factor problem is to find a (spanning) subgraph FùêπF of Gùê∫G such that degF‚Å°(x)‚ààœÄ‚Äã(v)subscriptdegreeùêπùë•ùúãùë£\\deg_{F}(x)\\in\\pi(v) for every vùë£v of Gùê∫G. When all degree constraints are symmetric ŒîŒî\\Delta-matroids, the problem is solvable in polynomial time. The weighted general factor problem is to find a general factor of the maximum total weight in an edge-weighted graph. Strongly polynomial-time algorithms are only known for weighted general factor problems that are reducible to the weighted matching problem by gadget constructions. In this paper, we present the first strongly polynomial-time algorithm for a type of weighted general factor problems with real-valued edge weights that is provably not reducible to the weighted matching problem by gadget constructions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
