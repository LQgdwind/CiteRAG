Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: CGRA4ML: A Framework to Implement Modern Neural Networks for Scientific Edge Computing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Scientific edge computing increasingly relies on hardware-accelerated neural networks to implement complex, near-sensor processing at extremely high throughputs and low latencies. Existing frameworks like hls4ml are effective for smaller models, but struggle with larger, modern neural networks due to their requirement of spatially implementing the neural network layers and storing all weights in on-chip memory. CGRA4ML is an open-source, modular framework designed to bridge the gap between neural network model complexity and extreme performance requirements. CGRA4ML extends the capabilities of hls4ml by allowing off-chip data storage and supporting a broader range of neural network architectures, including models like ResNet, PointNet, and transformers. Unlike hls4ml, CGRA4ML generates SystemVerilog RTL, making it more suitable for targeting ASIC and FPGA design flows. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by implementing and scaling larger models that were previously unattainable with hls4ml, showcasing its adaptability and efficiency in handling complex computations. CGRA4ML also introduces an extensive verification framework, with a generated runtime firmware that enables its integration into different SoC platforms. CGRA4ML’s minimal and modular infrastructure of Python API, SystemVerilog hardware, Tcl toolflows, and C runtime, facilitates easy integration and experimentation, allowing scientists to focus on innovation rather than the intricacies of hardware design and optimization.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 49\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
