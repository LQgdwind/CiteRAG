Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

We determine defining equations for the set of concise tensors of minimal border rank in ‚ÑÇm‚Äã‚äó‚Äã‚ÑÇm‚Äã‚äó‚Äã‚ÑÇmsuperscript‚ÑÇùëötensor-productsuperscript‚ÑÇùëötensor-productsuperscript‚ÑÇùëö\\mathbb{C}^{m}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{m}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{m} when m=5ùëö5m=5 and the set of concise minimal border rank 1‚àósubscript11_{*}-generic tensors when m=5,6ùëö56m=5,6. We solve the classical problem in algebraic complexity theory of classifying minimal border rank tensors in the special case m=5ùëö5m=5. Our proofs utilize two recent developments: the 111-equations defined by Buczy≈Ñska-Buczy≈Ñski and results of Jelisiejew-≈†ivic on the variety of commuting matrices. We introduce a new algebraic invariant of a concise tensor, its 111-algebra, and exploit it to give a strengthening of Friedland‚Äôs normal form for 111-degenerate tensors satisfying Strassen‚Äôs equations. We use the 111-algebra to characterize wild minimal border rank tensors and classify them in ‚ÑÇ5‚Äã‚äó‚Äã‚ÑÇ5‚Äã‚äó‚Äã‚ÑÇ5superscript‚ÑÇ5tensor-productsuperscript‚ÑÇ5tensor-productsuperscript‚ÑÇ5\\mathbb{C}^{5}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{5}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{5}.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
