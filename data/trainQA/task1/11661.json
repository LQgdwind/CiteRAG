      "content": "Paper Title: Active Symbolic Discovery of Ordinary Differential Equations via Phase Portrait Sketching\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Discovering Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) from trajectory data is a crucial task in AI-driven scientific discovery. Recent methods for symbolic discovery of ODEs primarily rely on fixed training datasets collected a-priori, often leading to suboptimal performance, as observed in our experiments in Figure 1. Inspired by active learning, we explore methods for querying informative trajectory data to evaluate predicted ODEs, where data are obtained by the specified initial conditions of the trajectory. Chaos theory indicates that small changes in the initial conditions of a dynamical system can result in vastly different trajectories, necessitating the maintenance of a large set of initial conditions of the trajectory. To address this challenge, we introduce Active Symbolic Discovery of Ordinary Differential Equations via Phase Portrait Sketching (Apps). Instead of directly selecting individual initial conditions, Apps first identifies an informative region and samples a batch of initial conditions within that region. Compared to traditional active learning methods, Apps eliminates the need for maintaining a large amount of data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Apps consistently discovers more accurate ODE expressions than baseline methods using passively collected datasets.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper.
