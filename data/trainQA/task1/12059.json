      "content": "Paper Title: Minimum Monotone Spanning TreesThis work was initiated at the GNV Workshop 2022 at Heiligkreuztal.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Computing a Euclidean minimum spanning tree of a set of points is a seminal problem in computational geometry and geometric graph theory. We combine it with another classical problem in graph drawing, namely computing a monotone geometric representation of a given graph. More formally, given a finite set S𝑆S of points in the plane and a finite set 𝒟𝒟\\cal D of directions, a geometric spanning tree T𝑇T with vertex set S𝑆S is 𝒟𝒟{\\cal D}-monotone if, for every pair {u,v}𝑢𝑣\\{u,v\\} of vertices of T𝑇T, there exists a direction d∈𝒟𝑑𝒟d\\in\\cal D for which the unique path from u𝑢u to v𝑣v in T𝑇T is monotone with respect to d𝑑d. We provide a characterization of 𝒟𝒟{\\cal D}-monotone spanning trees. Based on it, we show that a 𝒟𝒟{\\cal D}-monotone spanning tree of minimum length can be computed in polynomial time if the number k=|𝒟|𝑘𝒟k=|{\\cal D}| of directions is fixed, both when (i) the set 𝒟𝒟{\\cal D} of directions is prescribed and when (ii) the objective is to find a minimum-length 𝒟𝒟{\\cal D}-monotone spanning tree over all sets 𝒟𝒟{\\cal D} of k𝑘k directions. For k=2𝑘2k=2, we describe algorithms that are much faster than those for the general case. Furthermore, in contrast to the classical Euclidean minimum spanning tree, whose vertex degree is at most six, we show that for every even integer k𝑘k, there exists a point set Sksubscript𝑆𝑘S_{k} and a set 𝒟𝒟\\cal D of k𝑘k directions such that any minimum-length 𝒟𝒟\\cal D-monotone spanning tree of Sksubscript𝑆𝑘S_{k} has maximum vertex degree 2​k2𝑘2k.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
