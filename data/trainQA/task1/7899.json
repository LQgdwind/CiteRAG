Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Less is More: Understanding Word-level Textual Adversarial Attack via ùíè-gram Frequency Descend\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Word-level textual adversarial attacks have achieved striking performance in fooling natural language processing models. However, the fundamental questions of why these attacks are effective, and the intrinsic properties of the adversarial examples (AEs), are still not well understood. This work attempts to interpret textual attacks through the lens of nùëõn-gram frequency. Specifically, it is revealed that existing word-level attacks exhibit a strong tendency toward generation of examples with nùëõn-gram frequency descend (nùëõn-FD). Intuitively, this finding suggests a natural way to improve model robustness by training the model on the nùëõn-FD examples. To verify this idea, we devise a model-agnostic and gradient-free AE generation approach that relies solely on the nùëõn-gram frequency information, and further integrate it into the recently proposed convex hull framework for adversarial training. Surprisingly, the resultant method performs quite similarly to the original gradient-based method in terms of model robustness. These findings provide a human-understandable perspective for interpreting word-level textual adversarial attacks, and a new direction to improve model robustness.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
