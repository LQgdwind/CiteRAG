      "content": "Paper Title: Progress Report on Numerical Modeling of a Prototype Fuel Cell: 1. Comparison between Mathematical Formulations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Progress on the numerical modeling of a prototype fuel cell is reported. Some known limitations of the previously published Alpha model are addressed, and the numerical uncertainty due to discretization of the improved model, Beta, was estimated. In this part, the Beta model is compared to Alpha, where significant albeit small differences are seen. One noteworthy difference lies in the reactant usage, where the Beta model shows a better fit to available experimental data. Shortcomings of the improved model are discussed, paving the way forward, while a discrepancy with previous results is addressed, further suggesting the use of the Darcy-Brinkman over Stokes-Darcy formulation for free and porous media flow. Furthermore, a parametric study is carried out, constraining plausible values of the reaction rate constants to 10<k1≈102<103​s−110subscript𝑘1superscript102superscript103superscripts110<k_{1}\\approx 10^{2}<10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}, for adsorption, and k2⪆103​s−1greater-than-or-approximately-equalssubscript𝑘2superscript103superscripts1k_{2}\\gtrapprox 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}} for decomposition reactions. Additional opportunities for validation are identified, viz. the stoichiometry and reactant partial pressure profiles along the catalyst layer. Nevertheless, given the uncertainties in the numerical data and the available experimental data, the results lack validation power, highlighting the need for additional experimental data and improved precision for the numerical data.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
