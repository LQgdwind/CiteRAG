      "content": "Paper Title: Fourier growth of structured 𝔽₂-polynomials and applications\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We analyze the Fourier growth, i.e. the L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} Fourier weight at level k𝑘k (denoted L1,ksubscript𝐿1𝑘L_{1,k}), of various well-studied classes of “structured” 𝔽2subscript𝔽2\\mathbbm{F}_{2}-polynomials. This study is motivated by applications in pseudorandomness, in particular recent results and conjectures due to [CHHL19, CHLT19, CGL+20] which show that upper bounds on Fourier growth (even at level k=2𝑘2k=2) give unconditional pseudorandom generators. Our main structural results on Fourier growth are as follows: • We show that any symmetric degree-d𝑑d 𝔽2subscript𝔽2\\mathbbm{F}_{2}-polynomial p𝑝p has L1,k​(p)≤𝐏𝐫[p=1]⋅O​(d)ksubscript𝐿1𝑘𝑝𝐏𝐫⋅delimited-[]𝑝1𝑂superscript𝑑𝑘L_{1,k}(p)\\leq\\mathop{\\bf Pr\\/}[p=1]\\cdot O(d)^{k}, and this is tight for any constant k𝑘k. This quadratically strengthens an earlier bound that was implicit in [RSV13]. • We show that any read-ΔΔ\\Delta degree-d𝑑d 𝔽2subscript𝔽2\\mathbbm{F}_{2}-polynomial p𝑝p has L1,k​(p)≤𝐏𝐫[p=1]⋅(k​Δ​d)O​(k)subscript𝐿1𝑘𝑝𝐏𝐫⋅delimited-[]𝑝1superscript𝑘Δ𝑑𝑂𝑘L_{1,k}(p)\\leq\\mathop{\\bf Pr\\/}[p=1]\\cdot(k\\Delta d)^{O(k)}. • We establish a composition theorem which gives L1,ksubscript𝐿1𝑘L_{1,k} bounds on disjoint compositions of functions that are closed under restrictions and admit L1,ksubscript𝐿1𝑘L_{1,k} bounds. Finally, we apply the above structural results to obtain new unconditional pseudorandom generators and new correlation bounds for various classes of 𝔽2subscript𝔽2\\mathbbm{F}_{2}-polynomials.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
