Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Using Promises for Multi-Agent Cooperation in Goal Reasoning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Reasoning and planning for mobile robots is a challenging problem, as the world evolves over time and thus the robot’s goals may change. One technique to tackle this problem is goal reasoning, where the agent not only reasons about its actions, but also about which goals to pursue. While goal reasoning for single agents has been researched extensively, distributed, multi-agent goal reasoning comes with additional challenges, especially in a distributed setting. In such a context, some form of coordination is necessary to allow for cooperative behavior. Previous goal reasoning approaches share the agent’s world model with the other agents, which already enables basic cooperation. However, the agent’s goals, and thus its intentions, are typically not shared. In this paper, we present a method to tackle this limitation. Extending an existing goal reasoning framework, we propose enabling cooperative behavior between multiple agents through promises, where an agent may promise that certain facts will be true at some point in the future. Sharing these promises allows other agents to not only consider the current state of the world, but also the intentions of other agents when deciding on which goal to pursue next. We describe how promises can be incorporated into the goal life cycle, a commonly used goal refinement mechanism. We then show how promises can be used when planning for a particular goal by connecting them to timed initial literals (TILs) from PDDL planning. Finally, we evaluate our prototypical implementation in a simplified logistics scenario.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
