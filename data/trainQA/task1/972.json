Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation on massively parallel architectures\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The last ten years have witnessed fast spreading of massively parallel computing clusters, from leading supercomputing facilities down to the average university computing center. Many companies in the private sector have undergone a similar evolution. In this scenario, the seamless integration of software and middleware libraries is a key ingredient to ensure portability of scientific codes and guarantees them an extended lifetime. In this work, we describe the integration of the ChASE library, a modern parallel eigensolver, into an existing legacy code for the first-principles computation of optical properties of materials via solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the optical polarization function. Our numerical tests show that, as a result of integrating ChASE and parallelizing the reading routine, the code experiences a remarkable speedup and greatly improved scaling behavior on both multi- and many-core architectures. We demonstrate that such a modernized BSE code will, by fully exploiting parallel computing architectures and file systems, enable domain scientists to accurately study complex material systems that were not accessible before.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 53\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
