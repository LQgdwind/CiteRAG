Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Driving Style Recognition Using Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System and Multiple Experts Decision-Making\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Driving styles summarize different driving behaviors that reflect in the movements of the vehicles. These behaviors may indicate a tendency to perform riskier maneuvers, consume more fuel or energy, break traffic rules, or drive carefully. Therefore, this paper presents a driving style recognition using Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System with Multiple Experts Decision-Making for classifying drivers into calm, moderate and aggressive. This system receives as input features longitudinal and lateral kinematic parameters of the vehicle motion. The type-2 fuzzy sets are more robust than type-1 fuzzy sets when handling noisy data, because their membership function are also fuzzy sets. In addition, a multiple experts approach can reduce the bias and imprecision while building the fuzzy rulebase, which stores the knowledge of the fuzzy system. The proposed approach was evaluated using descriptive statistics analysis, and compared with clustering algorithms and a type-1 fuzzy inference system. The results show the tendency to associate lower and consistent kinematic profiles for the driving styles classified with the type-2 fuzzy inference system when compared to other algorithms, which is also in line with the more conservative approach adopted in the aggregation of the experts’ opinions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
