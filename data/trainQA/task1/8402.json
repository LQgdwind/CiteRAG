      "content": "You are a professional academic reference prediction expert. Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2. Title: Glove: Global vectors for word representation\n   Abstract: We present a new global log-bilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature.\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"titles\": [\n    \"Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\",\n    \"Glove: Global vectors for word representation\",\n    \"Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks\",\n    \"A Comparative Study of Neural Network Models for Sentence Classification\",\n    \"Deep lstm based feature mapping for query classification\"\n  ],\n  \"reasoning\": \"Based on the paper's focus on question classification using neural networks, I predict these references because: 1) CNN paper is directly relevant to the convolutional approach used; 2) GloVe embeddings are mentioned as pre-trained features; 3) QRNN is one of the compared methods; 4) Comparative study papers are common in this field; 5) LSTM-based query classification is closely related to question classification. Additional references cover related neural network architectures, NLP applications, deep learning methodologies, optimization techniques, and advanced neural network methods that would be relevant for this research area.\"\n}\n\nReturn JSON object only."

      "content": "Paper Title: Monotonicity of Multi-Term Floating-Point Adders\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In the literature on algorithms for computing multi-term addition sn=‚àëi=1nxisubscriptùë†ùëõsuperscriptsubscriptùëñ1ùëõsubscriptùë•ùëñs_{n}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i} in floating-point arithmetic it is often shown that a hardware unit that has single normalization and rounding improves precision, area, latency, and power consumption, compared with the use of standard add or fused multiply‚Äìadd units. However, non-monotonicity can appear when computing sums with a subclass of multi-term addition units, which is currently not explored in the literature. We prove that computing multi-term floating-point addition with n‚â•4ùëõ4n\\geq 4, without normalization of intermediate quantities, can result in non-monotonicity‚Äîincreasing one of the addends xisubscriptùë•ùëñx_{i} decreases the sum snsubscriptùë†ùëõs_{n}. Summation is required in dot product and matrix multiplication operations, operations that are increasingly appearing in the hardware of high-performance computers, and knowing where monotonicity is preserved can be of interest to the developers and users. Non-monotonicity of summation in existent hardware devices that implement a specific class of multi-term adders may have appeared unintentionally as a consequence of design choices that reduce circuit area and other metrics. To demonstrate our findings we simulate non-monotonic multi-term adders in MATLAB using the CPFloat custom-precision floating-point simulator.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
