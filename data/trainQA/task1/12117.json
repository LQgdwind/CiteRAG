Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Correspondence and Inverse Correspondence for Input/Output Logic and Region-Based Theories of Space\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We further develop the algebraic approach to input/output logic initiated in [27], where subordination algebras and a family of their generalizations were proposed as a semantic environment of various input/output logics. In particular: we extend the modal characterizations of a finite number of well known conditions on normative and permission systems, as well as on subordination, precontact, and dual precontact algebras developed in [29], to those corresponding to the infinite class of clopen-analytic inequalities in a modal language consisting both of positive and of negative unary modal operators; we characterize the syntactic shape of first-order conditions on algebras endowed with subordination, precontact, and dual precontact relations which guarantees these conditions to be the first-order correspondents of axioms in the modal language above; we introduce algorithms for computing the first-order correspondents of modal axioms on algebras endowed with subordination, precontact, and dual precontact relations, and conversely, for computing the modal axioms of which the conditions satisfying the suitable syntactic shape are the first-order correspondents; finally, we extend Celani’s dual characterization results between subordination lattices and subordination spaces to a wider environment which also encompasses precontact and dual precontact relations, and relative to an infinite class of first order conditions relating subordination, precontact and dual precontact relations on distributive lattices. The modal characterizations established in the present paper pave the way to establishing faithful embeddings for infinite classes of input/output logics, and hence to their implementation in LogiKEy, Isabelle/HOL, Lean, or other interactive systems. Keywords: input/output logic, subordination algebras, subordination lattices, precontact algebras, Sahlqvist theory, inverse correspondence, Kracht’s theorem.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
