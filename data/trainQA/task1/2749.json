Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Where the Action is: Let’s make Reinforcement Learning for Stochastic Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problems work!\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract There has been a paradigm-shift in urban logistic services in the last years; demand for real-time, instant mobility and delivery services grows. This poses new challenges to logistic service providers as the underlying stochastic dynamic vehicle routing problems (SDVRPs) require anticipatory real-time routing actions. Searching the combinatorial action space for efficient routing actions is by itself a complex task of mixed-integer programming (MIP) well-known by the operations research community. This complexity is now multiplied by the challenge of evaluating such actions with respect to their effectiveness given future dynamism and uncertainty, a potentially ideal case for reinforcement learning (RL) well-known by the computer science community. For solving SDVRPs, joint work of both communities is needed, but as we show, essentially non-existing. Both communities focus on their individual strengths leaving potential for improvement. Our survey paper highlights this potential in research originating from both communities. We point out current obstacles in SDVRPs and guide towards joint approaches to overcome them.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
