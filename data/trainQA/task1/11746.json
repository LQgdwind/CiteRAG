Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 58 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Bi-criterion Steiner Traveling Salesperson Problem with Time Windows for Last-Mile Electric Vehicle Logistics\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper addresses the problem of energy-efficient and safe routing of last-mile electric freight vehicles. With the rising environmental footprint of the transportation sector and the growing popularity of E-Commerce, freight companies are likely to benefit from optimal time-window-feasible tours that minimize energy usage while reducing traffic conflicts at intersections and thereby improving safety. We formulate this problem as a Bi-criterion Steiner Traveling Salesperson Problem with Time Windows (BSTSPTW) with energy consumed and the number of left turns at intersections as the two objectives while also considering regenerative braking capabilities. We first discuss an exact mixed-integer programming model with scalarization to enumerate points on the efficiency frontier for small instances. For larger networks, we develop an efficient local search-based heuristic, which uses several operators to intensify and diversify the search process. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed methods using benchmark data and real-world instances from Amazon delivery routes in Austin, US. Comparisons with state-of-the-art solvers shows that our heuristics can generate near-optimal solutions within reasonable time budgets, effectively balancing energy efficiency and safety under practical delivery constraints.
