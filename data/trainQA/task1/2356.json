      "content": "Paper Title: Color Channel Perturbation Attacks for Fooling Convolutional Neural Networks and A Defense Against Such Attacks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as a very powerful data dependent hierarchical feature extraction method. It is widely used in several computer vision problems. The CNNs learn the important visual features from training samples automatically. It is observed that the network overfits the training samples very easily. Several regularization methods have been proposed to avoid the overfitting. In spite of this, the network is sensitive to the color distribution within the images which is ignored by the existing approaches. In this paper, we discover the color robustness problem of CNN by proposing a Color Channel Perturbation (CCP) attack to fool the CNNs. In CCP attack new images are generated with new channels created by combining the original channels with the stochastic weights. Experiments were carried out over widely used CIFAR10, Caltech256 and TinyImageNet datasets in the image classification framework. The VGG, ResNet and DenseNet models are used to test the impact of the proposed attack. It is observed that the performance of the CNNs degrades drastically under the proposed CCP attack. Result show the effect of the proposed simple CCP attack over the robustness of the CNN trained model. The results are also compared with existing CNN fooling approaches to evaluate the accuracy drop. We also propose a primary defense mechanism to this problem by augmenting the training dataset with the proposed CCP attack. The state-of-the-art performance using the proposed solution in terms of the CNN robustness under CCP attack is observed in the experiments. The code is made publicly available at https://github.com/jayendrakantipudi/Color-Channel-Perturbation-Attack.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
