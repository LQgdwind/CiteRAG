Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: GRIL: A 2-parameter Persistence Based Vectorization for Machine Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract 111-parameter persistent homology, a cornerstone in Topological Data Analysis (TDA), studies the evolution of topological features such as connected components and cycles hidden in data. It has been applied to enhance the representation power of deep learning models, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To enrich the representations of topological features, here we propose to study 222-parameter persistence modules induced by bi-filtration functions. In order to incorporate these representations into machine learning models, we introduce a novel vector representation called Generalized Rank Invariant Landscape (Gril) for 222-parameter persistence modules. We show that this vector representation is 111-Lipschitz stable and differentiable with respect to underlying filtration functions and can be easily integrated into machine learning models to augment encoding topological features. We present an algorithm to compute the vector representation efficiently. We also test our methods on synthetic and benchmark graph datasets, and compare the results with previous vector representations of 111-parameter and 222-parameter persistence modules. Further, we augment GNNs with Gril features and observe an increase in performance indicating that Gril can capture additional features enriching GNNs. We make the complete code for the proposed method available at https://github.com/soham0209/mpml-graph.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
