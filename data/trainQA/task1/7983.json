Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Characterisation of the Set of Ground States of Uniformly Chaotic Finite-Range Lattice Models\\acknowledgements\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Chaotic dependence on temperature refers to the phenomenon of divergence of Gibbs measures as the temperature approaches a certain value. Models with chaotic behaviour near zero temperature have multiple ground states, none of which are stable. We study the class of uniformly chaotic models, that is, those in which, as the temperature goes to zero, every choice of Gibbs measures accumulates on the entire set of ground states. We characterise the possible sets of ground states of uniformly chaotic finite-range models up to computable homeomorphisms. Namely, we show that the set of ground states of every model with finite-range and rational-valued interactions is topologically closed and connected, and belongs to the class Œ†2subscriptŒ†2\\Pi_{2} of the arithmetical hierarchy. Conversely, every Œ†2subscriptŒ†2\\Pi_{2}-computable, topologically closed and connected set of probability measures can be encoded (via a computable affine homeomorphism) as the set of ground states of a uniformly chaotic two-dimensional model with finite-range rational-valued interactions. Keywords: Gibbs Measures, Chaotic Temperature Dependence, Ground States, Aperiodic Tiles, Computability, Arithmetical Hierarchy.
