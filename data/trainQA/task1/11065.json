Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: First-order factors of linear Mahler operators\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. We develop and compare two algorithms for computing first-order right-hand factors in the ring of linear Mahler operators ℓr​Mr+⋯+ℓ1​M+ℓ0subscriptℓ𝑟superscript𝑀𝑟⋯subscriptℓ1𝑀subscriptℓ0\\ell_{r}M^{r}+\\dots+\\ell_{1}M+\\ell_{0} where ℓ0,…,ℓrsubscriptℓ0…subscriptℓ𝑟\\ell_{0},\\dots,\\ell_{r} are polynomials in x𝑥x and M​x=xb​M𝑀𝑥superscript𝑥𝑏𝑀Mx=x^{b}M for some integer b≥2𝑏2b\\geq 2. In other words, we give algorithms for finding all formal infinite product solutions of linear functional equations ℓr​(x)​f​(xbr)+⋯+ℓ1​(x)​f​(xb)+ℓ0​(x)​f​(x)=0subscriptℓ𝑟𝑥𝑓superscript𝑥superscript𝑏𝑟⋯subscriptℓ1𝑥𝑓superscript𝑥𝑏subscriptℓ0𝑥𝑓𝑥0\\ell_{r}(x)f(x^{b^{r}})+\\dots+\\ell_{1}(x)f(x^{b})+\\ell_{0}(x)f(x)=0. The first of our algorithms is adapted from Petkovšek’s classical algorithm for the analogous problem in the case of linear recurrences. The second one proceeds by computing a basis of generalized power series solutions of the functional equation and by using Hermite–Padé approximants to detect those linear combinations of the solutions that correspond to first-order factors. We present implementations of both algorithms and discuss their use in combination with criteria from the literature to prove the differential transcendence of power series solutions of Mahler equations.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
