Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Avoiding Forgetting and Allowing Forward Transfer in Continual Learning via Sparse Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Using task-specific components within a neural network in continual learning (CL) is a compelling strategy to address the stability-plasticity dilemma in fixed-capacity models without access to past data. Current methods focus only on selecting a sub-network for a new task that reduces forgetting of past tasks. However, this selection could limit the forward transfer of relevant past knowledge that helps in future learning. Our study reveals that satisfying both objectives jointly is more challenging when a unified classifier is used for all classes of seen tasks–class-Incremental Learning (class-IL)–as it is prone to ambiguities between classes across tasks. Moreover, the challenge increases when the semantic similarity of classes across tasks increases. To address this challenge, we propose a new CL method, named AFAF111Code is available at: https://github.com/GhadaSokar/AFAF., that aims to Avoid Forgetting and Allow Forward transfer in class-IL using fix-capacity models. AFAF allocates a sub-network that enables selective transfer of relevant knowledge to a new task while preserving past knowledge, reusing some of the previously allocated components to utilize the fixed-capacity, and addressing class-ambiguities when similarities exist. The experiments show the effectiveness of AFAF in providing models with multiple CL desirable properties, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods on various challenging benchmarks with different semantic similarities.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
