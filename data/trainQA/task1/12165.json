Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Reducing Traffic Wastage in Video Streaming via Bandwidth-Efficient Bitrate Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Bitrate adaptation (also known as ABR) is a crucial technique to improve the quality of experience (QoE) for video streaming applications. However, existing ABR algorithms suffer from severe traffic wastage, which refers to the traffic cost of downloading the video segments that users do not finally consume, for example, due to early departure or video skipping. In this paper, we carefully formulate the dynamics of buffered data volume (BDV), a strongly correlated indicator of traffic wastage, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first time to rigorously clarify the effect of downloading plans on potential wastage. To reduce wastage while keeping a high QoE, we present a bandwidth-efficient bitrate adaptation algorithm (named BE-ABR), achieving consistently low BDV without distinct QoE losses. Specifically, we design a precise, time-aware transmission delay prediction model over the Transformer architecture, and develop a fine-grained buffer control scheme. Through extensive experiments conducted on emulated and real network environments including WiFi, 4G, and 5G, we demonstrate that BE-ABR performs well in both QoE and bandwidth savings, enabling a 60.87% wastage reduction and a comparable, or even better, QoE, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
