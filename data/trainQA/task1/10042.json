      "content": "Paper Title: Sharp Thresholds Imply Circuit Lower Bounds: from random 2-SAT to Planted Clique.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. We show that sharp thresholds for Boolean functions directly imply average-case circuit lower bounds. More formally we show that any Boolean function exhibiting a sharp enough threshold at arbitrary critical density cannot be computed by Boolean circuits of bounded depth and polynomial size. Our results hold in the average case, in the sense that sharp thresholds imply that for any bounded depth polynomial-size circuit that attempts to compute the function the following holds: for most p𝑝p near the critical density if the input is drawn from the product measure with bias p𝑝p, the circuit disagrees with the function with constant probability. Our general result implies new average-case bounded depth circuit lower bounds in a variety of settings. (a) (k𝑘k-cliques) For k=Θ​(n)𝑘Θ𝑛k=\\Theta(n), we prove that any circuit of depth d𝑑d deciding the presence of a size k𝑘k clique in a random graph requires exponential-in-nΘ​(1/d)superscript𝑛Θ1𝑑n^{\\Theta(1/d)} size. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first average-case exponential size lower bound for bounded depth circuits solving the fundamental k𝑘k-clique problem (for any k=kn𝑘subscript𝑘𝑛k=k_{n}). (b) (random 2-SAT) We prove that any circuit of depth d𝑑d deciding the satisfiability of a random 2-SAT formula requires exponential-in-nΘ​(1/d)superscript𝑛Θ1𝑑n^{\\Theta(1/d)} size. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first bounded depth circuit lower bound for random k𝑘k-SAT for any value of k≥2.𝑘2k\\geq 2. Our results also provide the first rigorous lower bound in agreement with a conjectured, but debated, “computational hardness” of random k𝑘k-SAT around its satisfiability threshold. (c) (Statistical estimation – planted k𝑘k-clique) Over the recent years, multiple statistical estimation problems have also been proven to exhibit a “statistical” sharp threshold, called the All-or-Nothing (AoN) phenomenon. We show that AoN also implies circuit lower bounds for statistical problems. As a simple corollary of that, we prove that any circuit of depth d𝑑d that solves to information-theoretic optimality a “dense” variant of the celebrated planted k𝑘k-clique problem requires exponential-in-nΘ​(1/d)superscript𝑛Θ1𝑑n^{\\Theta(1/d)} size. Finally, we mention that our result is in conceptual agreement with a plethora of papers from statistical physics over the last decades suggesting that the presence of a discontinuous phase transition is connected with a certain form of computational hardness.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
