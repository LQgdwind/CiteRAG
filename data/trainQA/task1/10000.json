Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

This work is supported by Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province (2019B010155003), the Joint Lab of CAS-HK, and Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission (JCYJ20200109114835623, JSGG20220831105002004).\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Text-conditioned image editing is a recently emerged and highly practical task, and its potential is immeasurable. However, most of the concurrent methods are unable to perform action editing, i.e. they can not produce results that conform to the action semantics of the editing prompt and preserve the content of the original image. To solve the problem of action editing, we propose KV Inversion, a method that can achieve satisfactory reconstruction performance and action editing, which can solve two major problems: 1) the edited result can match the corresponding action, and 2) the edited object can retain the texture and identity of the original real image. In addition, our method does not require training the Stable Diffusion model itself, nor does it require scanning a large-scale dataset to perform time-consuming training.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
