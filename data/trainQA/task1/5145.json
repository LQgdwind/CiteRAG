      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-task Pre-training Language Model for Semantic Network Completion\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Semantic networks, such as the knowledge graph, can represent the knowledge leveraging the graph structure. Although the knowledge graph shows promising values in natural language processing, it suffers from incompleteness. This paper focuses on knowledge graph completion by predicting linkage between entities, which is a fundamental yet critical task. Semantic matching is a potential solution for link prediction as it can deal with unseen entities, while the translational distance based methods struggle with the unseen entities. However, to achieve competitive performance as translational distance based methods, semantic matching based methods require large-scale datasets for the training purpose, which are typically unavailable in practical settings. Therefore, we employ the language model and introduce a novel knowledge graph architecture named LP-BERT, which contains two main stages: multi-task pre-training and knowledge graph fine-tuning. In the pre-training phase, three tasks are taken to drive the model to learn the relationship information from triples by predicting either entities or relations. While in the fine-tuning phase, inspired by contrastive learning, we design a triple-style negative sampling in a batch, which greatly increases the proportion of negative sampling while keeping the training time almost unchanged. Furthermore, we propose a new data augmentation method utilizing the inverse relationship of triples to improve the performance and robustness of the model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we conduct extensive experiments on three widely-used knowledge graph datasets, WN18RR, FB15k-237, and UMLS. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our methods, and our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the WN18RR and FB15k-237 datasets. Significantly, the Hits@10 indicator is improved by 5% from the previous state-of-the-art result on the WN18RR dataset while reaching 100% on the UMLS dataset.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
