Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: When alpha-complexes collapse onto codimension-1 submanifolds\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Given a finite set of points PùëÉP sampling an unknown smooth surface ‚Ñ≥‚äÜ‚Ñù3‚Ñ≥superscript‚Ñù3\\mathcal{M}\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^{3}, our goal is to triangulate ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M} based solely on PùëÉP. Assuming ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M} is a smooth orientable submanifold of codimension 111 in ‚Ñùdsuperscript‚Ñùùëë\\mathbb{R}^{d}, we introduce a simple algorithm, Naive Squash, which simplifies the Œ±ùõº\\alpha-complex of PùëÉP by repeatedly applying a new type of collapse called vertical relative to ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M}. Naive Squash also has a practical version that does not require knowledge of ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M}. We establish conditions under which both the naive and practical Squash algorithms output a triangulation of ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M}. We provide a bound on the angle formed by triangles in the Œ±ùõº\\alpha-complex with ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M}, yielding sampling conditions on PùëÉP that are competitive with existing literature for smooth surfaces embedded in ‚Ñù3superscript‚Ñù3\\mathbb{R}^{3}, while offering a more compartmentalized proof. As a by-product, we obtain that the restricted Delaunay complex of PùëÉP triangulates ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M} when ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M} is a smooth surface in ‚Ñù3superscript‚Ñù3\\mathbb{R}^{3} under weaker conditions than existing ones.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
