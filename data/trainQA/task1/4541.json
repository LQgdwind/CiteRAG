Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Reappraising Domain Generalization in Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Given that Neural Networks generalize unreasonably well in the IID setting (with benign overfitting and betterment in performance with more parameters), OOD presents a consistent failure case to better the understanding of how they learn. This paper focuses on Domain Generalization (DG), which is perceived as the front face of OOD generalization. We find that the presence of multiple domains incentivizes domain agnostic learning and is the primary reason for generalization in Tradition DG. We show that the state-of-the-art results can be obtained by borrowing ideas from IID generalization and the DG tailored methods fail to add any performance gains. Furthermore, we perform explorations beyond the Traditional DG (TDG) formulation and propose a novel ClassWise DG (CWDG) benchmark, where for each class, we randomly select one of the domains and keep it aside for testing. Despite being exposed to all domains during training, CWDG is more challenging than TDG evaluation. We propose a novel iterative domain feature masking approach, achieving state-of-the-art results on the CWDG benchmark. Overall, while explaining these observations, our work furthers insights into the learning mechanisms of neural networks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
