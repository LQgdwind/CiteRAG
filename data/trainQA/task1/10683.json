      "content": "Paper Title: Core Stability in Additively Separable Hedonic Games of Low Treewidth\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Additively Separable Hedonic Game (ASHG) are coalition-formation games where we are given a graph whose vertices represent n𝑛n selfish agents and the weight of each edge u​v𝑢𝑣uv denotes how much agent u𝑢u gains (or loses) when she is placed in the same coalition as agent v𝑣v. We revisit the computational complexity of the well-known notion of core stability of ASHGs, where the goal is to construct a partition of the agents into coalitions such that no group of agents would prefer to diverge from the given partition and form a new (blocking) coalition. Since both finding a core stable partition and verifying that a given partition is core stable are intractable problems (Σ2psuperscriptsubscriptΣ2𝑝\\Sigma_{2}^{p}-complete and coNP-complete respectively) we study their complexity from the point of view of structural parameterized complexity, using standard graph-theoretic parameters, such as treewidth. We begin by presenting several results on Core Stability Verification (CSV) indicating that this is an unusually intractable problem, even in very restricted cases: CSV remains coNP-complete on graphs of vertex cover 2; CSV is coW[1]-hard parameterized by vertex integrity when edge weights are polynomially bounded; and CSV is coW[1]-hard parameterized by tree-depth even if all weights are from {−1,1}11\\{-1,1\\}. We complement these results with essentially matching algorithms and one of the rare tractability results we present is that CSV is FPT parameterized by the treewidth 𝚝𝚠𝚝𝚠{\\mathtt{tw}} plus the maximum degree ΔΔ\\Delta (improving a previous algorithm’s dependence from 2O​(𝚝𝚠​Δ2)superscript2𝑂𝚝𝚠superscriptΔ22^{O({\\mathtt{tw}}\\Delta^{2})} to 2O​(𝚝𝚠​Δ)superscript2𝑂𝚝𝚠Δ2^{O({\\mathtt{tw}}\\Delta)}). We then move on to study Core Stability (CS), which one would naturally expect to be even harder than CSV. We confirm this intuition by showing that CS is Σ2psuperscriptsubscriptΣ2𝑝\\Sigma_{2}^{p}-complete even on graphs of bounded vertex cover. On the positive side, we consider the parameterization by 𝚝𝚠+Δ𝚝𝚠Δ{\\mathtt{tw}}+\\Delta and improve the known algorithm (which was based on Courcelle’s theorem) via an explicit algorithm utilizing a reduction to ∃∀for-all\\exists\\forall-SAT. The running time of our algorithm is, unfortunately, double-exponential in 𝚝𝚠+Δ𝚝𝚠Δ{\\mathtt{tw}}+\\Delta. However, we show that this is likely to be optimal, as the existence of an algorithm with less than double-exponential dependence on 𝚝𝚠𝚝𝚠{\\mathtt{tw}} (even for bounded-degree instances) would contradict the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). Finally, we consider another natural parameter for these problems: the size k𝑘k of the considered blocking (diverging) coalitions. Fixing k𝑘k to be constant does lower the complexities of CSV and CS to P and NP-complete respectively, since one can then consider all coalitions of size k𝑘k in polynomial time. Unfortunately, we show that a more efficient algorithm is unlikely to exist, as CSV is coW[1]-hard parameterized by k𝑘k (even on unweighted graphs), while CS is NP-complete for all k≥3𝑘3k\\geq 3 (even on graphs of bounded degree with bounded edge weights).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
