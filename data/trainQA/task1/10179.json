      "content": "Paper Title: A Heterogeneous RISC-V based SoC for Secure Nano-UAV Navigation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The rapid advancement of energy-efficient parallel ultra-low-power (ULP) Œºùúá\\mucontrollers units (MCUs) is enabling the development of autonomous nano-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (nano-UAVs). These sub-10cm drones represent the next generation of unobtrusive robotic helpers and ubiquitous smart sensors. However, nano-UAVs face significant power and payload constraints while requiring advanced computing capabilities akin to standard drones, including real-time Machine Learning (ML) performance and the safe co-existence of general-purpose and real-time OSs. Although some advanced parallel ULP MCUs offer the necessary ML computing capabilities within the prescribed power limits, they rely on small main memories (<<1MB) and Œºùúá\\mucontroller-class CPUs with no virtualization or security features, and hence only support simple bare-metal runtimes. In this work, we present Shaheen, a 9mm22{}^{\\textbf{2}} 200mW SoC implemented in 22nm FDX technology. Differently from state-of-the-art MCUs, Shaheen integrates a Linux-capable RV64 core, compliant with the v1.0 ratified Hypervisor extension and equipped with timing channel protection, along with a low-cost and low-power memory controller exposing up to 512MB of off-chip low-cost low-power HyperRAM directly to the CPU. At the same time, it integrates a fully programmable energy- and area-efficient multi-core cluster of RV32 cores optimized for general-purpose DSP as well as reduced- and mixed-precision ML. To the best of the authors‚Äô knowledge, it is the first silicon prototype of a ULP SoC coupling the RV64 and RV32 cores in a heterogeneous host+accelerator architecture fully based on the RISC-V ISA. We demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed SoC on a wide range of benchmarks relevant to nano-UAV applications including general-purpose DSP as well as inference and online learning of quantized DNNs. The cluster can deliver up to 90GOp/s and up to 1.8TOp/s/W on 2-bit integer kernels and up to 7.9GFLOp/s and up to 150GFLOp/s/W on 16-bit FP kernels.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 58\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
