Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: EvoSampling: A Granular Ball-based Evolutionary Hybrid Sampling with Knowledge Transfer for Imbalanced Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Class imbalance would lead to biased classifiers that favor the majority class and disadvantage the minority class. Unfortunately, from a practical perspective, the minority class is of importance in many real-life applications. Hybrid sampling methods address this by oversampling the minority class to increase the number of its instances, followed by undersampling to remove low-quality instances. However, most existing sampling methods face difficulties in generating diverse high-quality instances and often fail to remove noise or low-quality instances on a larger scale effectively. This paper therefore proposes an evolutionary multi-granularity hybrid sampling method, called EvoSampling. During the oversampling process, genetic programming (GP) is used with multi-task learning to effectively and efficiently generate diverse high-quality instances. During the undersampling process, we develop a granular ball-based undersampling method that removes noise in a multi-granular fashion, thereby enhancing data quality. Experiments on 20 imbalanced datasets demonstrate that EvoSampling effectively enhances the performance of various classification algorithms by providing better datasets than existing sampling methods. Besides, ablation studies further indicate that allowing knowledge transfer accelerates the GPâ€™s evolutionary learning process.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
