Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Correlation Capture in Generating Imbalanced Data using Differentially Private Conditional GANs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Despite the remarkable success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) on text, images, and videos, generating high-quality tabular data is still under development owing to some unique challenges such as capturing dependencies in imbalanced data, optimizing the quality of synthetic patient data while preserving privacy. In this paper, we propose DP-CGANS, a differentially private conditional GAN framework consisting of data transformation, sampling, conditioning, and networks training to generate realistic and privacy-preserving tabular data. DP-CGANS distinguishes categorical and continuous variables and transforms them to latent space separately. Then, we structure a conditional vector as an additional input to not only presents the minority class in the imbalanced data, but also capture the dependency between variables. We inject statistical noise to the gradients in the networking training process of DP-CGANS to provide a differential privacy guarantee. We extensively evaluate our model with state-of-the-art generative models on three public datasets and two real-world personal health datasets in terms of statistical similarity, machine learning performance, and privacy measurement. We demonstrate that our model outperforms other comparable models, especially in capturing dependency between variables. Finally, we present the balance between data utility and privacy in synthetic data generation considering the different data structure and characteristics of real-world datasets such as imbalance variables, abnormal distributions, and sparsity of data.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
