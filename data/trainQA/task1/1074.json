Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: A new Hodge operator in Discrete Exterior Calculus. Application to fluid mechanics\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This article introduces a new and general construction of discrete Hodge operator in the context of Discrete Exterior Calculus (DEC). This discrete Hodge operator enables to circumvent the well-centeredness limitation on the mesh with the popular diagonal Hodge. It allows a dual mesh based on any interior point, such as the incenter or the barycenter. It opens the way towards mesh-optimized discrete Hodge operators. In the particular case of a well-centered triangulation, it reduces to the diagonal Hodge if the dual mesh is circumcentric. Based on an analytical development, this discrete Hodge does not make use of Whitney forms, and is exact on piecewise constant forms, whichever interior point is chosen for the construction of the dual mesh. Numerical tests oriented to the resolution of fluid mechanics problems and thermal transfer are carried out. Convergence on various types of mesh is investigated.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
