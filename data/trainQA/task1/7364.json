      "content": "Paper Title: Cross-Modal Adapter for Text-Video Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Text-video retrieval is an important multi-modal learning task, where the goal is to retrieve the most relevant video for a given text query. Recently, pre-trained models, e.g., CLIP, show great potential on this task. However, as pre-trained models are scaling up, fully fine-tuning them on text-video retrieval datasets has a high risk of overfitting. Moreover, in practice, it would be costly to train and store a large model for each task. To overcome the above issues, we present a novel Cross-Modal Adapter for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Inspired by adapter-based methods, we adjust the pre-trained model with a few parameterization layers. However, there are two notable differences. First, our method is designed for the multi-modal domain. Secondly, it allows early cross-modal interactions between CLIP’s two encoders. Although surprisingly simple, our approach has three notable benefits: (1) reduces 99.6% of fine-tuned parameters, and alleviates the problem of overfitting, (2) saves approximately 30% of training time, and (3) allows all the pre-trained parameters to be fixed, enabling the pre-trained model to be shared across datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, without bells and whistles, it achieves superior or comparable performance compared to fully fine-tuned methods on MSR-VTT, MSVD, VATEX, ActivityNet, and DiDeMo datasets. The code will be available at https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/Cross-Modal-Adapter.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
