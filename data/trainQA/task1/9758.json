      "content": "Paper Title: REB: Reducing Biases in Representation for Industrial Anomaly Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Existing K-nearest neighbor (KNN) retrieval-based methods usually conduct industrial anomaly detection in two stages: obtain feature representations with a pre-trained CNN model and perform distance measures for anomaly detection. However, the features are not fully exploited as these methods ignore domain bias and the difference of local density in feature space, which limits the detection performance. In this paper, we propose Reducing Biases (REB) in representation by considering the domain bias of the pre-trained model and building a self-supervised learning task for better domain adaption with a defect generation strategy (DefectMaker) imitating the natural defects. Additionally, we propose a local density KNN (LDKNN) to reduce the local density bias and obtain effective anomaly detection. The proposed REB method achieve a promising result of 99.5% Image-level AUROC on the widely used MVTec AD, with smaller backbone networks such as Vgg11 and Resnet18. The proposed REB method also achieve 88.0% Image-level AUROC on the MVTec LOCO AD dataset and bring an improvement of 4.7% AUROC to the state-of-the-art result. These results indicate the effectiveness and efficiency of REB for practical industrial applications.
