Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: C2P: Featuring Large Language Models with Causal Reasoning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Causal reasoning is the primary bottleneck that Large Language Models (LLMs) must overcome to attain human-level intelligence. To address this, we introduce the Causal Chain of Prompting (C2P) as the first reasoning framework that equips current LLMs with causal reasoning capabilities. C2P operates autonomously, avoiding reliance on external tools or modules during both the causal learning and reasoning phases, and can be seamlessly implemented during the training or fine-tuning of LLMs. Experimental results across various benchmark datasets demonstrate a significant improvement in causal learning and subsequent reasoning accuracy of LLMs. We illustrate how C2P enhances LLMs’ ability to causally reason in real-world scenarios, addressing complex problems in fields such as healthcare, medicine, economics, education, social sciences, environmental science, and marketing. With few-shot learning, GPT-4 Turbo using C2P with as few as six examples achieves significant performance improvements, boasting over a 33%percent3333\\% increase in reasoning accuracy over the most state-of-the-art LLMs, which perform nearly randomly in similar circumstances. This demonstrates the transformative potential of integrating C2P into LLM training or fine-tuning processes, thereby empowering these models with advanced causal reasoning capabilities.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 51\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
