      "content": "Paper Title: Neural-PIM: Efficient Processing-In-Memory with Neural Approximation of Peripherals\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures have demonstrated great potential in accelerating numerous deep learning tasks. Particularly, resistive random-access memory (RRAM) devices provide a promising hardware substrate to build PIM accelerators due to their abilities to realize efficient in-situ vector-matrix multiplications (VMMs). However, existing PIM accelerators suffer from frequent and energy-intensive analog-to-digital (A/D) conversions, severely limiting their performance. This paper presents a new PIM architecture to efficiently accelerate deep learning tasks by minimizing the required A/D conversions with analog accumulation and neural approximated peripheral circuits. We first characterize the different dataflows employed by existing PIM accelerators, based on which a new dataflow is proposed to remarkably reduce the required A/D conversions for VMMs by extending shift and add (S+A) operations into the analog domain before the final quantizations. We then leverage a neural approximation method to design both analog accumulation circuits (S+A) and quantization circuits (ADCs) with RRAM crossbar arrays in a highly-efficient manner. Finally, we apply them to build a RRAM-based PIM accelerator (i.e., Neural-PIM) upon the proposed analog dataflow and evaluate its system-level performance. Evaluations on different benchmarks demonstrate that Neural-PIM can improve energy efficiency by 5.36√ó5.36\\times (1.73√ó1.73\\times) and speed up throughput by 3.43√ó3.43\\times (1.59√ó1.59\\times) without losing accuracy, compared to the state-of-the-art RRAM-based PIM accelerators, i.e., ISAAC [1] (CASCADE [2]).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
