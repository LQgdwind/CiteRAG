Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Preparation of Papers for IEEE Sponsored Conferences & Symposia*\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The performance of monocular depth estimation generally depends on the amount of parameters and computational cost. It leads to a large accuracy contrast between light-weight networks and heavy-weight networks, which limits their application in the real world. In this paper, we model the majority of accuracy contrast between them as the difference of depth distribution, which we call ’Distribution drift’. To this end, a distribution alignment network (DANet) is proposed. We firstly design a pyramid scene transformer (PST) module to capture inter-region interaction in multiple scales. By perceiving the difference of depth features between every two regions, DANet tends to predict a reasonable scene structure, which fits the shape of distribution to ground truth. Then, we propose a local-global optimization (LGO) scheme to realize the supervision of global range of scene depth. Thanks to the alignment of depth distribution shape and scene depth range, DANet sharply alleviates the distribution drift, and achieves a comparable performance with prior heavy-weight methods, but uses only 1% floating-point operations per second (FLOPs) of them. The experiments on two datasets, namely the widely used NYUDv2 dataset and the more challenging iBims-1 dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The source code is available at https://github.com/YiLiM1/DANet.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
