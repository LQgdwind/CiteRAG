Neither the European Union nor the granting authority can be held responsible for them.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Many computational problems can be modelled as the class of all finite relational structures ùî∏ùî∏\\mathbb{A} that satisfy a fixed first-order sentence œïitalic-œï\\phi hereditarily, i.e., we require that every substructure of ùî∏ùî∏\\mathbb{A} satisfies œïitalic-œï\\phi. In this case, we say that the class is in HerFO. The problems in HerFO are always in coNP, and sometimes coNP-complete. HerFO also contains many interesting computational problems in P, including many constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). We show that HerFO captures the class of complements of CSPs for reducts of finitely bounded structures, i.e., every such CSP is polynomial-time equivalent to the complement of a problem in Her‚àíFOHerFO\\operatorname{Her-FO}. However, we also prove that Her‚àíFOHerFO\\operatorname{Her-FO} does not have the full computational power of coNP: there are problems in coNP that are not polynomial-time equivalent to a problem in HerFO, unless E=NE. Another main result is a description of the quantifier-prefixes for œïitalic-œï\\phi such that hereditarily checking œïitalic-œï\\phi is in P; we show that for every other quantifier-prefix there exists a formula œïitalic-œï\\phi with this prefix such that hereditarily checking œïitalic-œï\\phi is coNP-complete.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
