Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 58 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Pseudo Contrastive Learning for Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Pseudo Labeling is a technique used to improve the performance of semi-supervised Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by generating additional pseudo-labels based on confident predictions. However, the quality of generated pseudo-labels has been a longstanding concern due to the sensitivity of the classification objective with respect to the given labels. To avoid the untrustworthy classification supervision indicating “a node belongs to a specific class,” we favor the fault-tolerant contrasting supervision demonstrating “two nodes do not belong to the same class.” Thus, the problem of generating high-quality pseudo-labels is then transformed into a relaxed version, i.e., identifying reliable negative pairs. To achieve this, we propose a general framework for GNNs, termed Pseudo Contrastive Learning (PCL). It separates two nodes whose positive and negative pseudo-labels target the same class. To incorporate topological knowledge into learning, we devise a topologically weighted contrastive loss that spends more effort separating negative pairs with smaller topological distances. Experimentally, we apply PCL to various GNNs, which consistently outperform their counterparts using other popular general techniques on five real-world graphs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
