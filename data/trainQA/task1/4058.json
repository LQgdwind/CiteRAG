      "content": "Paper Title: NASOA: Towards Faster Task-oriented Online Fine-tuning with a Zoo of Models\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract ††footnotetext: ∗ Corresponding Author: xdliang328@gmail.com Fine-tuning from pre-trained ImageNet models has been a simple, effective, and popular approach for various computer vision tasks. The common practice of fine-tuning is to adopt a default hyperparameter setting with a fixed pre-trained model, while both of them are not optimized for specific tasks and time constraints. Moreover, in cloud computing or GPU clusters where the tasks arrive sequentially in a stream, faster online fine-tuning is a more desired and realistic strategy for saving money, energy consumption, and CO2 emission. In this paper, we propose a joint Neural Architecture Search and Online Adaption framework named NASOA towards a faster task-oriented fine-tuning upon the request of users. Specifically, NASOA first adopts an offline NAS to identify a group of training-efficient networks to form a pretrained model zoo. We propose a novel joint block and macro level search space to enable a flexible and efficient search. Then, by estimating fine-tuning performance via an adaptive model by accumulating experience from the past tasks, an online schedule generator is proposed to pick up the most suitable model and generate a personalized training regime with respect to each desired task in a one-shot fashion. The resulting model zoo1††1The efficient training model zoo (ET-NAS) has been released at: https://github.com/NAS-OA/NASOA is more training efficient than SOTA models, e.g. 6x faster than RegNetY-16GF, and 1.7x faster than EfficientNetB3. Experiments on multiple datasets also show that NASOA achieves much better fine-tuning results, i.e. improving around 2.1% accuracy than the best performance in RegNet series under various constraints and tasks; 40x faster compared to the BOHB.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
