Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Tiny Adversarial Multi-Objective Oneshot Neural Architecture Search\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Due to limited computational cost and energy consumption, most neural network models deployed in mobile devices are tiny. However, tiny neural networks are commonly very vulnerable to attacks. Current research has proved that larger model size can improve robustness, but little research focuses on how to enhance the robustness of tiny neural networks. Our work focuses on how to improve the robustness of tiny neural networks without seriously deteriorating of clean accuracy under mobile-level resources. To this end, we propose a multi-objective oneshot network architecture search (NAS) algorithm to obtain the best trade-off networks in terms of the adversarial accuracy, the clean accuracy and the model size. Specifically, we design a novel search space based on new tiny blocks and channels to balance model size and adversarial performance. Moreover, since the supernet significantly affects the performance of subnets in our NAS algorithm, we reveal the insights into how the supernet helps to obtain the best subnet under white-box adversarial attacks. Concretely, we explore a new adversarial training paradigm by analyzing the adversarial transferability and the difference between training the subnets from scratch and fine-tuning. Finally, we make a statistical analysis for the layer-wise combination of certain blocks and channels on the first non-dominated front, which can serve as a guideline to design tiny neural network architectures for the resilience of adversarial perturbations.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
