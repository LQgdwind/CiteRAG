Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Functional Analysis Approach to Symbolic Regression\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Symbolic regression (SR) poses a significant challenge for randomized search heuristics due to its reliance on the synthesis of expressions for input-output mappings. Although traditional genetic programming (GP) algorithms have achieved success in various domains, they exhibit limited performance when tree-based representations are used for SR. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel SR approach called Fourier Tree Growing (FTG) that draws insights from functional analysis. This new perspective enables us to perform optimization directly in a different space, thus avoiding intricate symbolic expressions. Our proposed algorithm exhibits significant performance improvements over traditional GP methods on a range of classical one-dimensional benchmarking problems. To identify and explain limiting factors of GP and FTG, we perform experiments on a large-scale polynomials benchmark with high-order polynomials up to degree 100. To the best of the authorsâ€™ knowledge, this work represents the pioneering application of functional analysis in addressing SR problems. The superior performance of the proposed algorithm and insights into the limitations of GP open the way for further advancing GP for SR and related areas of explainable machine learning.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
