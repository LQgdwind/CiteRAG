Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: REPAIR: REnormalizing Permuted Activations for Interpolation Repair\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper we look into the conjecture of Entezari et al. (2021) which states that if the permutation invariance of neural networks is taken into account, then there is likely no loss barrier to the linear interpolation between SGD solutions. First, we observe that neuron alignment methods alone are insufficient to establish low-barrier linear connectivity between SGD solutions due to a phenomenon we call variance collapse: interpolated deep networks suffer a collapse in the variance of their activations, causing poor performance. Next, we propose REPAIR (REnormalizing Permuted Activations for Interpolation Repair) which mitigates variance collapse by rescaling the preactivations of such interpolated networks. We explore the interaction between our method and the choice of normalization layer, network width, and depth, and demonstrate that using REPAIR on top of neuron alignment methods leads to 60%-100% relative barrier reduction across a wide variety of architecture families and tasks. In particular, we report a 74% barrier reduction for ResNet50 on ImageNet and 90% barrier reduction for ResNet18 on CIFAR10. Our code is available at https://github.com/KellerJordan/REPAIR.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
