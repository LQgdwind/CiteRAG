Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Benchmarking the Operation of Quantum Heuristics and Ising Machines: Scoring Parameter Setting Strategies on Optimization Applications\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We discuss guidelines for evaluating the performance of parameterized stochastic solvers for optimization problems, with particular attention to systems that employ novel hardware, such as digital quantum processors running variational algorithms, analog processors performing quantum annealing, or coherent Ising Machines. We illustrate through an example a benchmarking procedure grounded in the statistical analysis of the expectation of a given performance metric measured in a test environment. In particular, we discuss the necessity and cost of setting parameters that affect the algorithm’s performance. The optimal value of these parameters could vary significantly between instances of the same target problem. We present an open-source software package that facilitates the design, evaluation, and visualization of practical parameter tuning strategies for complex use of the heterogeneous components of the solver. We examine in detail an example using parallel tempering and a simulator of a photonic Coherent Ising Machine computing and display the scoring of an illustrative baseline family of parameter-setting strategies that feature an exploration-exploitation trade-off.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
