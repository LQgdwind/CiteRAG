Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Vertical Symbolic Regression via Deep Policy Gradient\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Vertical Symbolic Regression (VSR) recently has been proposed to expedite the discovery of symbolic equations with many independent variables from experimental data. VSR reduces the search spaces following the vertical discovery path by building from reduced-form equations involving a subset of independent variables to full-fledged ones. Proved successful by many symbolic regressors, deep neural networks are expected to further scale up VSR. Nevertheless, directly combining VSR with deep neural networks will result in difficulty in passing gradients and other engineering issues. We propose Vertical Symbolic Regression using Deep Policy Gradient (Vsr-Dpg) and demonstrate that Vsr-Dpg can recover ground-truth equations involving multiple input variables, significantly beyond both deep reinforcement learning-based approaches and previous VSR variants. Our Vsr-Dpg models symbolic regression as a sequential decision-making process, in which equations are built from repeated applications of grammar rules. The integrated deep model is trained to maximize a policy gradient objective. Experimental results demonstrate that our Vsr-Dpg significantly outperforms popular baselines in identifying both algebraic equations and ordinary differential equations on a series of benchmarks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
