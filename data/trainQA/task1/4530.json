Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: OPEn: An Open-ended Physics Environment for Learning Without a Task\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Humans have mental models that allow them to plan, experiment, and reason in the physical world. How should an intelligent agent go about learning such models? In this paper, we will study if models of the world learned in an open-ended physics environment, without any specific tasks, can be reused for downstream physics reasoning tasks. To this end, we build a benchmark Open-ended Physics Environment (OPEn) and also design several tasks to test learning representations in this environment explicitly. This setting reflects the conditions in which real agents (i.e. rolling robots) find themselves, where they may be placed in a new kind of environment and must adapt without any teacher to tell them how this environment works. This setting is challenging because it requires solving an exploration problem in addition to a model building and representation learning problem. We test several existing RL-based exploration methods on this benchmark and find that an agent using unsupervised contrastive learning for representation learning, and impact-driven learning for exploration, achieved the best results. However, all models still fall short in sample efficiency when transferring to the downstream tasks. We expect that OPEn will encourage the development of novel rolling robot agents that can build reusable mental models of the world that facilitate many tasks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
