      "content": "Paper Title: Faster algorithms on linear delta-matroids\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We show new algorithms and constructions over linear delta-matroids. We observe an alternative representation for linear delta-matroids, as a contraction representation over a skew-symmetric matrix. This is equivalent to the more standard ‚Äútwist representation‚Äù up to O‚Äã(nœâ)ùëÇsuperscriptùëõùúîO(n^{\\omega})-time transformations (where nùëõn is the dimension of the delta-matroid and œâ<2.372ùúî2.372\\omega<2.372 the matrix multiplication exponent), but is much more convenient for algorithmic tasks. For instance, the problem of finding a max-weight feasible set now reduces directly to the problem of finding a max-weight basis in a linear matroid. Supported by this representation, we provide new algorithms and constructions over linear delta-matroids. We show that the union and delta-sum of linear delta-matroids define linear delta-matroids, and a representation for the resulting delta-matroid can be constructed in randomized time O‚Äã(nœâ)ùëÇsuperscriptùëõùúîO(n^{\\omega}) (or more precisely, in O‚Äã(nœâ)ùëÇsuperscriptùëõùúîO(n^{\\omega}) field operations, over a field of at least Œ©‚Äã(n‚ãÖ(1/Œµ))Œ©‚ãÖùëõ1ùúÄ\\Omega(n\\cdot(1/\\varepsilon)) elements, where Œµ>0ùúÄ0\\varepsilon>0 is an error parameter). Previously, it was only known that these operations define delta-matroids. We also note that every projected linear delta-matroid can be represented as an elementary projection. This implies that several optimization problems over (projected) linear delta-matroids, including the coverage, delta-coverage, and parity problems, reduce (in their decision versions) to a single O‚Äã(nœâ)ùëÇsuperscriptùëõùúîO(n^{\\omega})-time matrix rank computation. Using the methods of Harvey, previously used by Cheung, Lao and Leung for linear matroid parity, we furthermore show how to solve the search versions in the same time. This improves on the O‚Äã(n4)ùëÇsuperscriptùëõ4O(n^{4})-time augmenting path algorithm of Geelen, Iwata and Murota. Finally, we consider the maximum-cardinality delta-matroid intersection problem (or equivalently, the maximum-cardinality delta-matroid matching problem). Using Storjohann‚Äôs algorithms for symbolic determinants, we show that such a solution can be found in O‚Äã(nœâ+1)ùëÇsuperscriptùëõùúî1O(n^{\\omega+1}) time. This is the first polynomial-time algorithm for the problem, solving an open question of Kakimura and Takamatsu.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
