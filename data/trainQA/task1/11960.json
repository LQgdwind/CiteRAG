Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Maximal Extractable Value in Decentralized Finance: Taxonomy, Detection, and Mitigation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Decentralized Finance (DeFi) leverages blockchain-enabled smart contracts to deliver automated and trustless financial services without the need for intermediaries. However, the public visibility of financial transactions on the blockchain can be exploited, as participants can reorder, insert, or remove transactions to extract value, often at the expense of others. This extracted value is known as the Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). MEV causes financial losses and consensus instability, disrupting the security, efficiency, and decentralization goals of the DeFi ecosystem. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze, detect, and mitigate MEV to safeguard DeFi. Our comprehensive survey offers a holistic view of the MEV landscape in the DeFi ecosystem. We present an in-depth understanding of MEV through a novel taxonomy of MEV transactions supported by real transaction examples. We perform a critical comparative analysis of various MEV detection approaches, evaluating their effectiveness in identifying different transaction types. Furthermore, we assess different categories of MEV mitigation strategies and discuss their limitations. We identify the challenges of current mitigation and detection approaches and discuss potential solutions. This survey provides valuable insights for researchers, developers, stakeholders, and policymakers, helping to curb and democratize MEV for a more secure and efficient DeFi ecosystem.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 56\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
