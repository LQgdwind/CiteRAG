      "content": "Paper Title: Target set selection with maximum activation time\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A target set selection model is a graph G𝐺G with a threshold function τ:V→ℕ:𝜏→𝑉ℕ\\tau:V\\to\\mathbb{N} upper-bounded by the vertex degree. For a given model, a set S0⊆V​(G)subscript𝑆0𝑉𝐺S_{0}\\subseteq V(G) is a target set if V​(G)𝑉𝐺V(G) can be partitioned into non-empty subsets S0,S1,…,Stsubscript𝑆0subscript𝑆1…subscript𝑆𝑡S_{0},S_{1},\\dotsc,S_{t} such that, for i∈{1,…,t}𝑖1…𝑡i\\in\\{1,\\dotsc,t\\}, Sisubscript𝑆𝑖S_{i} contains exactly every vertex v𝑣v having at least τ​(v)𝜏𝑣\\tau(v) neighbors in S0∪⋯∪Si−1subscript𝑆0⋯subscript𝑆𝑖1S_{0}\\cup\\dots\\cup S_{i-1}. We say that t𝑡t is the activation time tτ​(S0)subscript𝑡𝜏subscript𝑆0t_{\\tau}(S_{0}) of the target set S0subscript𝑆0S_{0}. The problem of, given such a model, finding a target set of minimum size has been extensively studied in the literature. In this article, we investigate its variant, which we call TSS-time, in which the goal is to find a target set S0subscript𝑆0S_{0} that maximizes tτ​(S0)subscript𝑡𝜏subscript𝑆0t_{\\tau}(S_{0}). That is, given a graph G𝐺G, a threshold function τ𝜏\\tau in G𝐺G, and an integer k𝑘k, the objective of the TSS-time problem is to decide whether G𝐺G contains a target set S0subscript𝑆0S_{0} such that tτ​(S0)≥ksubscript𝑡𝜏subscript𝑆0𝑘t_{\\tau}(S_{0})\\geq k. Let τ∗=maxv∈V​(G)⁡τ​(v)superscript𝜏subscript𝑣𝑉𝐺𝜏𝑣\\tau^{*}=\\max_{v\\in V(G)}\\tau(v). Our main result is the following dichotomy about the complexity of TSS-time when G𝐺G belongs to a minor-closed graph class 𝒞𝒞{\\cal C}: if 𝒞𝒞{\\cal C} has bounded local treewidth, the problem is FPT parameterized by k𝑘k and τ⋆superscript𝜏⋆\\tau^{\\star}; otherwise, it is \\NP-complete even for fixed k=4𝑘4k=4 and τ⋆=2superscript𝜏⋆2\\tau^{\\star}=2. We also prove that, with τ∗=2superscript𝜏2\\tau^{*}=2, the problem is \\NP-hard in bipartite graphs for fixed k=5𝑘5k=5, and from previous results we observe that TSS-time is \\NP-hard in planar graphs and \\W[1]-hard parameterized by treewidth. Finally, we present a linear-time algorithm to find a target set S0subscript𝑆0S_{0} in a given tree maximizing tτ​(S0)subscript𝑡𝜏subscript𝑆0t_{\\tau}(S_{0}).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
