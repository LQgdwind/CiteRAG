Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: An Efficient Heuristic Approach Combining Maximal Itemsets and Area Measure for Compressing Voluminous Table Constraints\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Constraint Programming is a powerful paradigm to model and solve com- binatorial problems. While there are many kinds of constraints, the table constraint is perhaps the most significant-being the most well- studied and has the ability to encode any other constraints defined on finite variables. However, constraints can be very voluminous and their size can grow exponentially with their arity. To reduce space and the time complexity, researchers have focused on various forms of compression. In this paper we propose a new approach based on maxi- mal frequent itemsets technique and area measure for enumerating the maximal frequent itemsets relevant for compressing table constraints. Our experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of this approach on compression and on solving compressed table constraints.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
