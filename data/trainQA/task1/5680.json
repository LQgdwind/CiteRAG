Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Local Displacements for Point Cloud Completion\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We propose a novel approach aimed at object and semantic scene completion from a partial scan represented as a 3D point cloud. Our architecture relies on three novel layers that are used successively within an encoder-decoder structure and specifically developed for the task at hand. The first one carries out feature extraction by matching the point features to a set of pre-trained local descriptors. Then, to avoid losing individual descriptors as part of standard operations such as max-pooling, we propose an alternative neighbor-pooling operation that relies on adopting the feature vectors with the highest activations. Finally, up-sampling in the decoder modifies our feature extraction in order to increase the output dimension. While this model is already able to achieve competitive results with the state of the art, we further propose a way to increase the versatility of our approach to process point clouds. To this aim, we introduce a second model that assembles our layers within a transformer architecture. We evaluate both architectures on object and indoor scene completion tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
