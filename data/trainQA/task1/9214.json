      "content": "Paper Title: Memory-Constrained Algorithms for Convex Optimization via Recursive Cutting-Planes\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We propose a family of recursive cutting-plane algorithms to solve feasibility problems with constrained memory, which can also be used for first-order convex optimization. Precisely, in order to find a point within a ball of radius ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon with a separation oracle in dimension d𝑑d—or to minimize 111-Lipschitz convex functions to accuracy ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon over the unit ball—our algorithms use 𝒪​(d2p​ln⁡1ϵ)𝒪superscript𝑑2𝑝1italic-ϵ\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{d^{2}}{p}\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}) bits of memory, and make 𝒪​((C​dp​ln⁡1ϵ)p)𝒪superscript𝐶𝑑𝑝1italic-ϵ𝑝\\mathcal{O}((C\\frac{d}{p}\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})^{p}) oracle calls, for some universal constant C≥1𝐶1C\\geq 1. The family is parametrized by p∈[d]𝑝delimited-[]𝑑p\\in[d] and provides an oracle-complexity/memory trade-off in the sub-polynomial regime ln⁡1ϵ≫ln⁡dmuch-greater-than1italic-ϵ𝑑\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\gg\\ln d. While several works gave lower-bound trade-offs (impossibility results) [29, 5]—we explicit here their dependence with ln⁡1ϵ1italic-ϵ\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}, showing that these also hold in any sub-polynomial regime—to the best of our knowledge this is the first class of algorithms that provides a positive trade-off between gradient descent and cutting-plane methods in any regime with ϵ≤1/ditalic-ϵ1𝑑\\epsilon\\leq 1/\\sqrt{d}. The algorithms divide the d𝑑d variables into p𝑝p blocks and optimize over blocks sequentially, with approximate separation vectors constructed using a variant of Vaidya’s method. In the regime ϵ≤d−Ω​(d)italic-ϵsuperscript𝑑Ω𝑑\\epsilon\\leq d^{-\\Omega(d)}, our algorithm with p=d𝑝𝑑p=d achieves the information-theoretic optimal memory usage and improves the oracle-complexity of gradient descent.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
