Forthcoming. \"Reliability-Based Collapse Assessment of Wind-Excited Steel Structures within Performance-Based Wind Engineering.\" ASCE Journal of Structural Engineering. 10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0003444.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract As inelastic design for wind is embraced by the engineering community, there is an increasing demand for computational tools that enable the investigation of the nonlinear behavior of wind-excited structures and subsequent development of performance criteria. To address this need, a probabilistic collapse assessment framework for steel structures is proposed in this paper. The framework is based on the integration of a high-fidelity fiber-based nonlinear structural modeling environment with a wind-tunnel-informed stochastic wind load model to perform nonlinear time history analysis. General uncertainty is propagated using a stratified sampling scheme enabling the efficient estimation of reliabilities associated with rare events. The adopted models for simulating high-fidelity nonlinear structural behavior were found, in general, to be adequate for capturing phenomena, including progressive yielding, buckling, and low-cycle fatigue, that are essential for wind induced collapse analysis. In particular, the adopted fatigue model was found to be capable of predicting damage and potential fiber/section fracture associated with non-fully reversing stress-strain cycles that are characteristic of wind loading. Through illustration on a 45-story archetype steel building, critical discussions on the types of observed collapse mechanisms, the difference between alongwind and acrosswind nonlinear behavior, reliabilities associated with first yield, and collapse are presented. A probabilistic description of the residual and peak story drifts is also provided through development of fragility functions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
