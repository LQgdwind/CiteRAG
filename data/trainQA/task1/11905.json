Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Method for noise-induced regularization in quantum neural networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In the current quantum computing paradigm, significant focus is placed on the reduction or mitigation of quantum decoherence. When designing new quantum processing units, the general objective is to reduce the amount of noise qubits are subject to, and in algorithm design, a large effort is underway to provide scalable error correction or mitigation techniques. Yet some previous work has indicated that certain classes of quantum algorithms, such as quantum machine learning, may, in fact, be intrinsically robust to or even benefit from the presence of a small amount of noise. Here, we demonstrate that noise levels in quantum hardware can be effectively tuned to enhance the ability of quantum neural networks to generalize data, acting akin to regularisation in classical neural networks. As an example, we consider a medical regression task, where, by tuning the noise level in the circuit, we improved the mean squared error loss by 8%percent\\%.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
