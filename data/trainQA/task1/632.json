Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Domain Spoken Language Understanding Using Domain- and Task-Aware Parameterization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Spoken language understanding (SLU) has been addressed as a supervised learning problem, where a set of training data is available for each domain. However, annotating data for a new domain can be both financially costly and non-scalable. One existing approach solves the problem by conducting multi-domain learning where parameters are shared for joint training across domains, which is domain-agnostic and task-agnostic. In the paper, we propose to improve the parameterization of this method by using domain-specific and task-specific model parameters for fine-grained knowledge representation and transfer. Experiments on five domains show that our model is more effective for multi-domain SLU and obtain the best results. In addition, we show its transferability when adapting to a new domain with little data, outperforming the prior best model by 12.4%. Finally, we explore the strong pre-trained model in our framework and find that the contributions from our framework do not fully overlap with contextualized word representations (RoBERTa).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
