Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 63 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Action Languages Based Actual Causality for Computational Ethics: a Sound and Complete Implementation in ASP\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Although moral responsibility is not circumscribed by causality, they are both closely intermixed. Furthermore, rationally understanding the evolution of the physical world is inherently linked with the idea of causality. Thus, the decision-making applications based on automated planning inevitably have to deal with causality—especially if they consider imputability aspects or integrate references to ethical norms. The many debates around causation in the last decades have shown how complex this notion is and thus, how difficult is its integration with planning. As a result, much of the work in computational ethics relegates causality to the background, despite the considerations stated above. This paper’s contribution is to provide a complete and sound translation into logic programming from an actual causation definition suitable for action languages—this definition is a formalisation of Wright’s NESS test. The obtained logic program allows to deal with complex causal relations. In addition to enabling agents to reason about causality, this contribution specifically enables the computational ethics domain to handle situations that were previously out of reach. In a context where ethical considerations in decision-making are increasingly important, advances in computational ethics can greatly benefit the entire AI community.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 63 most likely reference titles for this paper.
