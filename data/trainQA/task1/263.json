Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Data-Dependent Algorithm for Querying Earth Mover‚Äôs Distance with Low Doubling Dimensions\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we consider the following query problem: given two weighted point sets Aùê¥A and BùêµB in the Euclidean space ‚Ñùdsuperscript‚Ñùùëë\\mathbb{R}^{d}, we want to quickly determine that whether their earth mover‚Äôs distance (EMD) is larger or smaller than a pre-specified threshold T‚â•0ùëá0T\\geq 0. The problem finds a number of important applications in the fields of machine learning and data mining. In particular, we assume that the dimensionality dùëëd is not fixed and the sizes |A|ùê¥|A| and |B|ùêµ|B| are large. Therefore, most of existing EMD algorithms are not quite efficient to solve this problem due to their high complexities. Here, we consider the problem under the assumption that Aùê¥A and BùêµB have low doubling dimensions, which is common for high-dimensional data in real world. Inspired by the geometric method net tree, we propose a novel ‚Äúdata-dependent‚Äù algorithm to avoid directly computing the EMD between Aùê¥A and BùêµB, so as to solve this query problem more efficiently. We also study the performance of our method on synthetic and real datasets. The experimental results suggest that our method can save a large amount of running time comparing with existing EMD algorithms.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
