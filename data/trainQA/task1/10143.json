Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Learning solutions to some toy constrained optimization problems in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this work we present deep learning implementations of two popular theoretical constrained optimization algorithms in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, namely, the penalty and the augmented Lagrangian methods. We test these algorithms on some toy problems originating in either calculus of variations or physics. We demonstrate that both methods are able to produce decent approximations for the test problems and are comparable in terms of different errors produced. Leveraging the common occurrence of the Lagrange multiplier update rule being computationally less expensive than solving subproblems in the penalty method, we achieve significant speedups in cases when the output of the constraint function is itself a function.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
