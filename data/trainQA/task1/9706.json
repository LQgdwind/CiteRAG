Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: SSMG: Spatial-Semantic Map Guided Diffusion Model for Free-form Layout-to-Image Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Despite significant progress in Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models, even lengthy and complex text descriptions still struggle to convey detailed controls. In contrast, Layout-to-Image (L2I) generation, aiming to generate realistic and complex scene images from user-specified layouts, has risen to prominence. However, existing methods transform layout information into tokens or RGB images for conditional control in the generative process, leading to insufficient spatial and semantic controllability of individual instances. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Spatial-Semantic Map Guided (SSMG) diffusion model that adopts the feature map, derived from the layout, as guidance. Owing to rich spatial and semantic information encapsulated in well-designed feature maps, SSMG achieves superior generation quality with sufficient spatial and semantic controllability compared to previous works. Additionally, we propose the Relation-Sensitive Attention (RSA) and Location-Sensitive Attention (LSA) mechanisms. The former aims to model the relationships among multiple objects within scenes while the latter is designed to heighten the modelâ€™s sensitivity to the spatial information embedded in the guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSMG achieves highly promising results, setting a new state-of-the-art across a range of metrics encompassing fidelity, diversity, and controllability.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
