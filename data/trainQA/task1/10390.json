      "content": "Paper Title: GPU Cluster Scheduling for Network-Sensitive Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Deep learning (DL) constitutes a significant workload within public or private datacenters. Organizations commonly engage in training multiple Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in multi-tenant GPU clusters. The primary consideration in training such models is the associated ”cost”, which correlates directly with the GPU usage duration in the cluster. Previous studies have demonstrated that communication overheads of interconnected GPU clusters could be a significant component of the overall training time and, thus, minimizing the communication overhead with intelligent scheduling of training jobs on physically close GPUs should minimize the long training times. However, state-of-the-art cluster schedulers are rather agnostic to the proximity-based job consolidation. To compound the issue, different DNN models display varied communication overheads even with similar levels of consolidation. This results in prolonged training times. In this context, we propose a novel GPU-cluster scheduler for distributed DL (DDL) workloads that enables proximity-based consolidation of GPU resources based on the DDL jobs’ sensitivities to the anticipated communication-network delays. Our scheduler consists of three major components: (i) a classical delay scheduling algorithm to facilitate job placement and consolidation; (ii) a network-sensitive job preemption strategy; and (iii) an ”auto-tuner” mechanism to optimize delay timers for effective delay scheduling. Additionally, to enable a cost-effective methodology for large-scale experiments, we develop a data-driven DDL cluster simulation platform. Employing the simulation platform we compare against several state-of-the-art alternatives on real-world workload traces to demonstrate the benefits of our design. Our scheduler can provide improvement of up to 69% in end-to-end Makespan for training all jobs compared to the prevailing consolidation-based scheduling methods, while reducing the average job completion time by up to 83% and minimizing the communication overheads by up to 98% under congested networking conditions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
