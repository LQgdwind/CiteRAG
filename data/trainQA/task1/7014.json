Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Pruning Adversarially Robust Neural Networks without Adversarial Examples\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Adversarial pruning compresses models while preserving robustness. Current methods require access to adversarial examples during pruning. This significantly hampers training efficiency. Moreover, as new adversarial attacks and training methods develop at a rapid rate, adversarial pruning methods need to be modified accordingly to keep up. In this work, we propose a novel framework to prune a previously trained robust neural network while maintaining adversarial robustness, without further generating adversarial examples. We leverage concurrent self-distillation and pruning to preserve knowledge in the original model as well as regularizing the pruned model via the Hilbert-Schmidt Information Bottleneck. We comprehensively evaluate our proposed framework and show its superior performance in terms of both adversarial robustness and efficiency when pruning architectures trained on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets against five state-of-the-art attacks. Code is available at https://github.com/neu-spiral/PwoA/.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
