Many interesting counting problems are finite linear combinations p​(⋅)=∑HαH​hom⁡(H,⋅)𝑝⋅subscript𝐻subscript𝛼𝐻hom𝐻⋅p(\\,\\cdot\\,)=\\sum_{H}\\alpha_{H}\\hom(H,\\,\\cdot\\,) of homomorphism counts from fixed graphs H𝐻H. It is known that such fixed linear combinations are hard to evaluate under standard complexity assumptions if there exists a large-treewidth graph S𝑆S with αS≠0subscript𝛼𝑆0\\alpha_{S}\\neq 0. This can be shown in two steps: In the first step, hardness is shown for the problems hom⁡(S,⋅)hom𝑆⋅\\hom(S,\\,\\cdot\\,) with colorful (i.e., bijectively colored) graphs S𝑆S of large treewidth. In the second step, it is shown that homomorphism counts from colorful graphs S𝑆S into graphs G𝐺G can be reduced to evaluating finite linear combinations of homomorphism counts that contain the uncolored version S∘superscript𝑆S^{\\circ} of S𝑆S. This second step can be performed via inclusion-exclusion in 2|E​(S)|​poly​(n,s)superscript2𝐸𝑆poly𝑛𝑠2^{|E(S)|}\\mathrm{poly}(n,s) time, where n𝑛n is the size of G𝐺G and s𝑠s is the maximum number of vertices among graphs in the linear combination. This running time is acceptable when S𝑆S and s𝑠s are small compared to n𝑛n, which is the setting considered in previous works. In this paper, we show that the second step can even be performed in time 4Δ​(S)​poly​(n,s)superscript4Δ𝑆poly𝑛𝑠4^{\\Delta(S)}\\mathrm{poly}(n,s), where Δ​(S)Δ𝑆\\Delta(S) is the maximum degree of S𝑆S. Our reduction is based on graph products with Cai–Fürer–Immerman graphs, a novel technique that is likely of independent interest. If Δ​(S)Δ𝑆\\Delta(S) is constant and s𝑠s is polynomial in n𝑛n, this technique yields a polynomial-time reduction from hom⁡(S,⋅)hom𝑆⋅\\hom(S,\\,\\cdot\\,) to linear combinations of homomorphism counts involving S∘superscript𝑆S^{\\circ}, even when S𝑆S is part of the input. Under certain conditions, it actually suffices that a supergraph T𝑇T of S∘superscript𝑆S^{\\circ} is contained in the target linear combination, which is useful, since large treewidth is witnessed by subgraphs of maximum degree 333. Using the new reduction, we obtain #​𝖯#𝖯\\mathsf{\\#P}-hardness results for problems that could previously only be studied under parameterized complexity assumptions that are a priori stronger than “classical” assumptions. For fixed graph classes ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} satisfying natural polynomial-time enumerability conditions, this includes the problems #​Hom​(ℋ)#Homℋ\\mathrm{\\#Hom}(\\mathcal{H}), #​Sub​(ℋ)#Subℋ\\mathrm{\\#Sub}(\\mathcal{H}) and #​Ind​(ℋ)#Indℋ\\mathrm{\\#Ind}(\\mathcal{H}) of counting, on input a graph H∈ℋ𝐻ℋH\\in\\mathcal{H} and a general graph G𝐺G, the homomorphisms from H𝐻H to G𝐺G, and the subgraph copies and induced subgraph copies of H𝐻H in G𝐺G. Generally speaking, the new reduction opens up the possibility of transferring techniques from parameterized counting complexity to “classical” non-parameterized counting complexity.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
