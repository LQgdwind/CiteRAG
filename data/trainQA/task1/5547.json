Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Style Transformer for Image Inversion and Editing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Existing GAN inversion methods fail to provide latent codes for reliable reconstruction and flexible editing simultaneously. This paper presents a transformer-based image inversion and editing model for pretrained StyleGAN which is not only with less distortions, but also of high quality and flexibility for editing. The proposed model employs a CNN encoder to provide multi-scale image features as keys and values. Meanwhile it regards the style code to be determined for different layers of the generator as queries. It first initializes query tokens as learnable parameters and maps them into W+superscriptùëäW^{+} space. Then the multi-stage alternate self- and cross-attention are utilized, updating queries with the purpose of inverting the input by the generator. Moreover, based on the inverted code, we investigate the reference- and label-based attribute editing through a pretrained latent classifier, and achieve flexible image-to-image translation with high quality results. Extensive experiments are carried out, showing better performances on both inversion and editing tasks within StyleGAN. Codes are available at https://github.com/sapphire497/style-transformer. **footnotetext: Corresponding author, email: sunli@ee.ecnu.edu.cn.
