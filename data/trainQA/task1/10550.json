      "content": "Paper Title: Learning on Multimodal Graphs: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Multimodal data pervades various domains, including healthcare, social media, and transportation, where multimodal graphs play a pivotal role. Machine learning on multimodal graphs, referred to as multimodal graph learning (MGL), is essential for successful artificial intelligence (AI) applications. The burgeoning research in this field encompasses diverse graph data types and modalities, learning techniques, and application scenarios. This survey paper conducts a comparative analysis of existing works in multimodal graph learning, elucidating how multimodal learning is achieved across different graph types and exploring the characteristics of prevalent learning techniques. Additionally, we delineate significant applications of multimodal graph learning and offer insights into future directions in this domain. Consequently, this paper serves as a foundational resource for researchers seeking to comprehend existing MGL techniques and their applicability across diverse scenarios.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 62 most likely reference titles for this paper.
