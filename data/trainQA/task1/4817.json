Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Improving Embedding Based Models of Social Network Alignment via Pseudo Anchors\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Social network alignment aims at aligning person identities across social networks. Embedding based models have been shown effective for the alignment where the structural proximity preserving objective is typically adopted for the model training. With the observation that “overly-close” user embeddings are unavoidable for such models causing alignment inaccuracy, we propose a novel learning framework which tries to enforce the resulting embeddings to be more widely apart among the users via the introduction of carefully implanted pseudo anchors. We further proposed a meta-learning algorithm to guide the updating of the pseudo anchor embeddings during the learning process. The proposed intervention via the use of pseudo anchors and meta-learning allows the learning framework to be applicable to a wide spectrum of network alignment methods. We have incorporated the proposed learning framework into several state-of-the-art models. Our experimental results demonstrate its efficacy where the methods with the pseudo anchors implanted can outperform their counterparts without pseudo anchors by a fairly large margin, especially when there only exist very few labeled anchors.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
