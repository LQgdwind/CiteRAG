Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: VAW-GAN for Singing Voice Conversion with Non-parallel Training Data\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Singing voice conversion aims to convert singer’s voice from source to target without changing singing content. Parallel training data is typically required for the training of singing voice conversion system, that is however not practical in real-life applications. Recent encoder-decoder structures, such as variational autoencoding Wasserstein generative adversarial network (VAW-GAN), provide an effective way to learn a mapping through non-parallel training data. In this paper, we propose a singing voice conversion framework that is based on VAW-GAN. We train an encoder to disentangle singer identity and singing prosody (F0 contour) from phonetic content. By conditioning on singer identity and F0, the decoder generates output spectral features with unseen target singer identity, and improves F0 rendering. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves better performance than the baseline frameworks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
