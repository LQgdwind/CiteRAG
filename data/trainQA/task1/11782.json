Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: STanH : Parametric Quantization for Variable Rate Learned Image Compression\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In end-to-end learned image compression, encoder and decoder are jointly trained to minimize a ùëπ+ùùÄ‚Äãùë´ùëπùùÄùë´\\boldsymbol{R}\\boldsymbol{+}\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}\\boldsymbol{D} cost function, where ùùÄùùÄ\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} controls the trade-off between rate of the quantized latent representation and image quality. Unfortunately, a distinct encoder-decoder pair with millions of parameters must be trained for each ùùÄùùÄ\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}, hence the need to switch encoders and to store multiple encoders and decoders on the user device for every target rate. This paper proposes to exploit a differentiable quantizer designed around a parametric sum of hyperbolic tangents, called STanH , that relaxes the step-wise quantization function. STanH is implemented as a differentiable activation layer with learnable quantization parameters that can be plugged into a pre-trained fixed rate model and refined to achieve different target bitrates. Experimental results show that our method enables variable rate coding with comparable efficiency to the state-of-the-art, yet with significant savings in terms of ease of deployment, training time, and storage costs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
