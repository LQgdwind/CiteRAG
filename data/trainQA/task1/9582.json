Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: SAFE: Saliency-Aware Counterfactual Explanations for DNN-based Automated Driving Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The explainability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has recently gained significant importance especially in safety-critical applications such as automated/autonomous vehicles, a.k.a. automated driving systems. CounterFactual (CF) explanations have emerged as a promising approach for interpreting the behaviour of black-box DNNs. A CF explainer identifies the minimum modifications in the input that would alter the model’s output to its complement. In other words, a CF explainer computes the minimum modifications required to cross the model’s decision boundary. Current deep generative CF models often work with user-selected features rather than focusing on the discriminative features of the black-box model. Consequently, such CF examples may not necessarily lie near the decision boundary, thereby contradicting the definition of CFs. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a novel approach that leverages saliency maps to generate more informative CF explanations. Our approach guides a Generative Adversarial Network based on the most influential features of the input of the black-box model to produce CFs near the decision boundary. We evaluate the performance of this approach using a real-world dataset of driving scenes, BDD100k, and demonstrate its superiority over several baseline methods in terms of well-known CF metrics, including proximity, sparsity and validity. Our work contributes to the ongoing efforts to improve the interpretability of DNNs and provides a promising direction for generating more accurate and informative CF explanations111Source codes are available at: https://github.com/Amir-Samadi//Saliency_Aware_CF.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
