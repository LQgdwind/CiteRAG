Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Programmable Photonic Extreme Learning Machines\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Photonic neural networks offer a promising alternative to traditional electronic systems for machine learning accelerators due to their low latency and energy efficiency. However, the challenge of implementing the backpropagation algorithm during training has limited their development. To address this, alternative machine learning schemes, such as extreme learning machines (ELMs), have been proposed. ELMs use a random hidden layer to increase the feature space dimensionality, requiring only the output layer to be trained through linear regression, thus reducing training complexity. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a programmable photonic extreme learning machine (PPELM) using a hexagonal waveguide mesh, and which enables to program directly on chip the input feature vector and the random hidden layer. our system also permits to apply the nonlinearity directly on-chip by using the system‚Äôs integrated photodetecting elements. Using the PPELM we solved successfully three different complex classification tasks. Additioanlly, we also propose and demonstrate two techniques to increase the accuracy of the models and reduce their variability using an evolutionary algorithm and a wavelength division multiplexing approach, obtaining excellent performance. Our results show that programmable photonic processors may become a feasible way to train competitive machine learning models on a versatile and compact platform.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
