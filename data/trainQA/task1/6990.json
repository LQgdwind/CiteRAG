Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Hypernetwork approach to Bayesian MAML\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The main goal of Few-Shot learning algorithms is to enable learning from small amounts of data. One of the most popular and elegant Few-Shot learning approaches is Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). The main idea behind this method is to learn the shared universal weights of a meta-model, which are then adapted for specific tasks. However, the method suffers from over-fitting and poorly quantifies uncertainty due to limited data size. Bayesian approaches could, in principle, alleviate these shortcomings by learning weight distributions in place of point-wise weights. Unfortunately, previous modifications of MAML are limited due to the simplicity of Gaussian posteriors, MAML-like gradient-based weight updates, or by the same structure enforced for universal and adapted weights. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for Bayesian MAML called BayesianHMAML, which employs Hypernetworks for weight updates. It learns the universal weights point-wise, but a probabilistic structure is added when adapted for specific tasks. In such a framework, we can use simple Gaussian distributions or more complicated posteriors induced by Continuous Normalizing Flows.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
