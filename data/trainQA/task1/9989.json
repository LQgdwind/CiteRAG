Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Symmetric Exponential Time Requires Near-Maximum Circuit Size\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We show that there is a language in ¬ß2\\E/1\\S_{2}\\E/_{1} (symmetric exponential time with one bit of advice) with circuit complexity at least 2n/nsuperscript2ùëõùëõ2^{n}/n. In particular, the above also implies the same near-maximum circuit lower bounds for the classes Œ£2‚Äã\\EsubscriptŒ£2\\E\\Sigma_{2}\\E, (Œ£2\\E‚à©Œ†2\\E)/1(\\Sigma_{2}\\E\\cap\\Pi_{2}\\E)/_{1}, and ùñπùñØùñ§\\NP/1\\mathsf{ZPE}^{\\NP}/_{1}. Previously, only ‚Äúhalf-exponential‚Äù circuit lower bounds for these complexity classes were known, and the smallest complexity class known to require exponential circuit complexity was Œî3‚Äã\\E=\\EŒ£2‚Äã¬∂subscriptŒî3\\Esuperscript\\EsubscriptŒ£2¬∂\\Delta_{3}\\E=\\E^{\\Sigma_{2}\\P} (Miltersen, Vinodchandran, and Watanabe COCOON‚Äô99). Our circuit lower bounds are corollaries of an unconditional zero-error pseudodeterministic algorithm with an \\NP\\NP\\NP oracle and one bit of advice (\\FZPP\\NP/1\\FZPP^{\\NP}/_{1}) that solves the range avoidance problem infinitely often. This algorithm also implies unconditional infinitely-often pseudodeterministic \\FZPP\\NP/1\\FZPP^{\\NP}/_{1} constructions for Ramsey graphs, rigid matrices, two-source extractors, linear codes, and KpolysuperscriptKpoly\\mathrm{K}^{\\mathrm{poly}}-random strings with nearly optimal parameters. Our proofs relativize. The two main technical ingredients are (1) Korten‚Äôs ¬∂\\NPsuperscript¬∂\\NP\\P^{\\NP} reduction from the range avoidance problem to constructing hard truth tables (FOCS‚Äô21), which was in turn inspired by a result of Je≈ô√°bek on provability in Bounded Arithmetic (Ann. Pure Appl. Log. 2004); and (2) the recent iterative win-win paradigm of Chen, Lu, Oliveira, Ren, and Santhanam (FOCS‚Äô23).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
