Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 65 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer.

      "content": "Paper Title: Producer vs. Rapper: Who Dominates the Hip Hop Sound? A Case Study\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In hip-hop music, rappers and producers play important, but rather different roles. However, both contribute to the overall sound, as rappers bring in their voice, while producers are responsible for the music composition and mix. In this case report, we trained Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) with songs produced by Dr. Dre, Rick Rubin and Timbaland using the goniometer and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). With these maps, we investigate whether hip hop producers have a unique sound profile. Then, we test whether collaborations with the rappers Eminem, Jay-Z, LL Cool J and Nas stick to, or break out of this sound profile. As these rappers are also producers of some songs, we investigate how much their sound profile is influenced by the producers who introduced them to beat making. The results speak a clear language: producers have their own sound profile that is unique concerning the goniometer, and less distinct concerning MFCCs. They dominate the sound of hip hop music over rappers, who emulate the sound profile of the producers who introduced them to beat making.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 65 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 65\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
