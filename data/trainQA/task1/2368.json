Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data.

      "content": "Paper Title: Subtype-aware Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Medical Diagnosis\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recent advances in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) show that transferable prototypical learning presents a powerful means for class conditional alignment, which encourages the closeness of cross-domain class centroids. However, the cross-domain inner-class compactness and the underlying fine-grained subtype structure remained largely underexplored. In this work, we propose to adaptively carry out the fine-grained subtype-aware alignment by explicitly enforcing the class-wise separation and subtype-wise compactness with intermediate pseudo labels. Our key insight is that the unlabeled subtypes of a class can be divergent to one another with different conditional and label shifts, while inheriting the local proximity within a subtype. The cases with or without the prior information on subtype numbers are investigated to discover the underlying subtype structure in an online fashion. The proposed subtype-aware dynamic UDA achieves promising results on a medical diagnosis task.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
