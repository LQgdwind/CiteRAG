      "content": "Paper Title: STEAM-EEG: Spatiotemporal EEG Analysis with Markov Transfer Fields and Attentive CNNs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals play a pivotal role in biomedical research and clinical applications, including epilepsy diagnosis, sleep disorder analysis, and brain-computer interfaces. However, the effective analysis and interpretation of these complex signals often present significant challenges. This paper presents a novel approach that integrates computer graphics techniques with biological signal pattern recognition, specifically using Markov Transfer Fields (MTFs) for EEG time series imaging. The proposed framework (STEAM-EEG) employs the capabilities of MTFs to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of EEG signals, transforming them into visually informative images. These images are then rendered, visualised, and modelled using state-of-the-art computer graphics techniques, thereby facilitating enhanced data exploration, pattern recognition, and decision-making. The code could be accessed from GitHub.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
