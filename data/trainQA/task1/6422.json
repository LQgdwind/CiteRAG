Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 62 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Linear Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire Neuron Model Based Spiking Neural Networks and Its Mapping Relationship to Deep Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are brain-inspired machine learning algorithms with merits such as biological plausibility and unsupervised learning capability. Previous works have shown that converting Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) into SNNs is a practical and efficient approach for implementing an SNN. However, the basic principle and theoretical groundwork are lacking for training a non-accuracy-loss SNN. This paper establishes a precise mathematical mapping between the biological parameters of the Linear Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire model (LIF)/SNNs and the parameters of ReLU-AN/Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Such mapping relationship is analytically proven under certain conditions and demonstrated by simulation and real data experiments. It can serve as the theoretical basis for the potential combination of the respective merits of the two categories of neural networks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 62 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 62\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
