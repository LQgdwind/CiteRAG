Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 41 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Jointly Complementary&Competitive Influence Maximization with Concurrent Ally-Boosting and Rival-Preventing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. In this paper, we propose a new influence spread model, namely, Complementary&Competitive Independent Cascade (C2IC) model. C2IC model generalizes three well known influence model, i.e., influence boosting (IB) model, campaign oblivious (CO)IC model and the IC-N (IC model with negative opinions) model. This is the first model that considers both complementary and competitive influence spread comprehensively under multi-agent environment. Correspondingly, we propose the Complementary&Competitive influence maximization (C2IM) problem. Given an ally seed set and a rival seed set, the C2IM problem aims to select a set of assistant nodes that can boost the ally spread and prevent the rival spread concurrently. We show the problem is NP-hard and can generalize the influence boosting problem and the influence blocking problem. With classifying the different cascade priorities into 4 cases by the monotonicity and submodularity (M&S) holding conditions, we design 4 algorithms respectively, with theoretical approximation bounds provided. We conduct extensive experiments on real social networks and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. We hope this work can inspire abundant future exploration for constructing more generalized influence models that help streamline the works of this area.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 41 most likely reference titles for this paper.
