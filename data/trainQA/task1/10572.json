Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Complexity of Boolean automata networks under block-parallel update modes\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Boolean automata networks (aka Boolean networks) are space-time discrete dynamical systems, studied as a model of computation and as a representative model of natural phenomena. A collection of simple entities (the automata) update their 00-111 states according to local rules. The dynamics of the network is highly sensitive to update modes, i.e., to the schedule according to which the automata apply their local rule. A new family of update modes appeared recently, called block-parallel, which is dual to the well studied block-sequential. Although basic, it embeds the rich feature of update repetitions among a temporal updating period, allowing for atypical asymptotic behaviors. In this paper, we prove that it is able to breed complex computations, squashing almost all decision problems on the dynamics to the traditionally highest (for reachability questions) class ùñØùñ≤ùñØùñ†ùñ¢ùñ§ùñØùñ≤ùñØùñ†ùñ¢ùñ§{\\mathsf{PSPACE}}. Despite obtaining these complexity bounds for a broad set of local and global properties, we also highlight a surprising gap: bijectivity is still ùñºùóàùñ≠ùñØùñºùóàùñ≠ùñØ{\\mathsf{coNP}}.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
