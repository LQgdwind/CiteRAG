Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Red Light Green Light Method for Solving Large Markov Chains\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Discrete-time discrete-state finite Markov chains are versatile mathematical models for a wide range of real-life stochastic processes. One of most common tasks in studies of Markov chains is computation of the stationary distribution. Without loss of generality, and drawing our motivation from applications to large networks, we interpret this problem as one of computing the stationary distribution of a random walk on a graph. We propose a new controlled, easily distributed algorithm for this task, briefly summarized as follows: at the beginning, each node receives a fixed amount of cash (positive or negative), and at each iteration, some nodes receive ‘green light’ to distribute their wealth or debt proportionally to the transition probabilities of the Markov chain; the stationary probability of a node is computed as a ratio of the cash distributed by this node to the total cash distributed by all nodes together. Our method includes as special cases a wide range of known, very different, and previously disconnected methods including power iterations, Gauss-Southwell, and online distributed algorithms. We prove exponential convergence of our method, demonstrate its high efficiency, and derive scheduling strategies for the green-light, that achieve convergence rate faster than state-of-the-art algorithms.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
