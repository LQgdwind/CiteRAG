Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 60 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data.

      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Deblur and Rotate Motion-Blurred Faces\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We propose a solution to the novel task of rendering sharp videos from new viewpoints from a single motion-blurred image of a face. Our method111Code and data available at https://gmeishvili.github.io/deblur_and_rotate_motion_blurred_faces/index.html. handles the complexity of face blur by implicitly learning the geometry and motion of faces through the joint training on three large datasets: FFHQ and 300VW, which are publicly available, and a new Bern Multi-View Face Dataset (BMFD) that we built. The first two datasets provide a large variety of faces and allow our model to generalize better. BMFD instead allows us to introduce multi-view constraints, which are crucial to synthesizing sharp videos from a new camera view. It consists of high frame rate synchronized videos from multiple views of several subjects displaying a wide range of facial expressions. We use the high frame rate videos to simulate realistic motion blur through averaging. Thanks to this dataset, we train a neural network to reconstruct a 3D video representation from a single image and the corresponding face gaze. We then provide a camera viewpoint relative to the estimated gaze and the blurry image as input to an encoder-decoder network to generate a video of sharp frames with a novel camera viewpoint. We demonstrate our approach on test subjects of our multi-view dataset and VIDTIMIT.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
