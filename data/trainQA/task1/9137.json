      "content": "Paper Title: Network Robustness Learning via Graph Transformer\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Learning and analysis of network robustness, including controllability robustness and connectivity robustness, is critical for various networked systems against attacks. Traditionally, network robustness is determined by attack simulations, which is very time-consuming and even incapable for large-scale networks. Network Robustness Learning, which is dedicated to learning network robustness with high precision and high speed, provides a powerful tool to analyze network robustness by replacing simulations. In this paper, a novel versatile and unified robustness learning approach via graph transformer (NRL-GT) is proposed, which accomplishes the task of controllability robustness learning and connectivity robustness learning from multiple aspects including robustness curve learning, overall robustness learning, and synthetic network classification. Numerous experiments show that: 1) NRL-GT is a unified learning framework for controllability robustness and connectivity robustness, demonstrating a strong generalization ability to ensure high precision when training and test sets are distributed differently; 2) Compared to the cutting-edge methods, NRL-GT can simultaneously perform network robustness learning from multiple aspects and obtains superior results in less time. NRL-GT is also able to deal with complex networks of different size with low learning error and high efficiency; 3) It is worth mentioning that the backbone of NRL-GT can serve as a transferable feature learning module for complex networks of different size and different downstream tasks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
