Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Robust and Scalable Routing with Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for MANETs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Highly dynamic mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) are continuing to serve as one of the most challenging environments to develop and deploy robust, efficient, and scalable routing protocols. In this paper, we present DeepCQ+ routing which, in a novel manner, integrates emerging multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) techniques into existing Q-learning-based routing protocols and their variants, and achieves persistently higher performance across a wide range of MANET configurations while training only on a limited range of network parameters and conditions. Quantitatively, DeepCQ+ shows consistently higher end-to-end throughput with lower overhead compared to its Q-learning-based counterparts with the overall gain of 10-15% in its efficiency. Qualitatively and more significantly, DeepCQ+ maintains remarkably similar performance gains under many scenarios that it was not trained for in terms of network sizes, mobility conditions, and traffic dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of MADRL for the MANET routing problem that achieves and maintains a high degree of scalability and robustness even in the environments that are outside the trained range of scenarios. This implies that the proposed hybrid design approach of DeepCQ+ that combines MADRL and Q-learning significantly increases its practicality and explainability because the real-world MANET environment will likely vary outside the trained range of MANET scenarios.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
