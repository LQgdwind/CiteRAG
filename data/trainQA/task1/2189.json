Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 58 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: An Improved Framework of GPU Computing for CFD Applications on Structured Grids using OpenACC\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper is focused on improving multi-GPU performance of a research CFD code on structured grids. MPI and OpenACC directives are used to scale the code up to 16 GPUs. This paper shows that using 16 P100 GPUs and 16 V100 GPUs can be 30×\\times and 70×\\times faster than 16 Xeon CPU E5-2680v4 cores for three different test cases, respectively. A series of performance issues related to the scaling for the multi-block CFD code are addressed by applying various optimizations. Performance optimizations such as the pack/unpack message method, removing temporary arrays as arguments to procedure calls, allocating global memory for limiters and connected boundary data, reordering non-blocking MPI I_send/I_recv and Wait calls, reducing unnecessary implicit derived type member data movement between the host and the device and the use of GPUDirect can improve the compute utilization, memory throughput, and asynchronous progression in the multi-block CFD code using modern programming features.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 58\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
