Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: : A Representative Error-Driven Approach for Active Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Given a limited labeling budget, active learning (al) aims to sample the most informative instances from an unlabeled pool to acquire labels for subsequent model training. To achieve this, al typically measures the informativeness of unlabeled instances based on uncertainty and diversity. However, it does not consider erroneous instances with their neighborhood error density, which have great potential to improve the model performance. To address this limitation, we propose , a novel approach to select data instances with Representative Errors for Active Learning. It identifies minority predictions as pseudo errors within a cluster and allocates an adaptive sampling budget for the cluster based on estimated error density. Extensive experiments on five text classification datasets demonstrate that consistently outperforms all best-performing baselines regarding accuracy and F1-macro scores across a wide range of hyperparameter settings. Our analysis also shows that selects the most representative pseudo errors that match the distribution of ground-truth errors along the decision boundary.
