Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: MAPLE: Mobile App Prediction Leveraging Large Language Model Embeddings\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. In recent years, predicting mobile app usage has become increasingly important for areas like app recommendation, user behaviour analysis, and mobile resource management. Existing models, however, struggle with the heterogeneous nature of contextual data and the user cold start problem. This study introduces a novel prediction model, Mobile App Prediction Leveraging Large Language Model Embeddings (MAPLE), which employs Large Language Models (LLMs) and installed app similarity to overcome these challenges. MAPLE utilises the power of LLMs to process contextual data and discern intricate relationships within it effectively. Additionally, we explore the use of installed app similarity to address the cold start problem, facilitating the modelling of user preferences and habits, even for new users with limited historical data. In essence, our research presents MAPLE as a novel, potent, and practical approach to app usage prediction, making significant strides in resolving issues faced by existing models. MAPLE stands out as a comprehensive and effective solution, setting a new benchmark for more precise and personalised app usage predictions. In tests on two real-world datasets, MAPLE surpasses contemporary models in both standard and cold start scenarios. These outcomes validate MAPLE’s capacity for precise app usage predictions and its resilience against the cold start problem. This enhanced performance stems from the model’s proficiency in capturing complex temporal patterns and leveraging contextual information. As a result, MAPLE can potentially improve personalised mobile app usage predictions and user experiences markedly.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
