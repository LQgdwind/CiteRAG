Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Exact schedulability test for sporadic mixed-criticality real-time systems using antichains and oracles\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This work addresses the problem of exact schedulability assessment in uniprocessor mixed-criticality real-time systems with sporadic task sets. We model the problem by means of a finite automaton that has to be explored in order to check for schedulability. To mitigate the state explosion problem, we provide a generic algorithm which is parameterised by several techniques called oracles and simulation relations. These techniques leverage results from the scheduling literature as “plug-ins” that make the algorithm more efficient in practice. Our approach achieves up to a 99.998% reduction in the search space required for exact schedulability testing, making it practical for a range of task sets, up to 8 tasks or maximum periods of 350. This method enables to challenge the pessimism of an existing schedulability test and to derive a new dynamic-priority scheduler, demonstrating its good performance. This is the full version of an RTNS 2024 paper [PPGG24a].\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
