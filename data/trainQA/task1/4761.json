Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Sci-Net: Scale Invariant Model for Buildings Segmentation from Aerial Imagery\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Buildingsâ€™ segmentation is a fundamental task in the field of earth observation and aerial imagery analysis. Most existing deep learning-based methods in the literature can be applied to a fixed or narrow-range spatial resolution imagery. In practical scenarios, users deal with a broad spectrum of image resolutions. Thus, a given aerial image often needs to be re-sampled to match the spatial resolution of the dataset used to train the deep learning model, which results in a degradation in segmentation performance. To overcome this challenge, we propose, in this manuscript, Scale-invariant Neural Network (Sci-Net) architecture that segments buildings from wide-range spatial resolution aerial images. Specifically, our approach leverages UNet hierarchical representation and Dense Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling to extract fine-grained multi-scale representations. Sci-Net significantly outperforms state of the art models on the Open Cities AI and the Multi-Scale Building datasets with a steady improvement margin across different spatial resolutions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 48\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
