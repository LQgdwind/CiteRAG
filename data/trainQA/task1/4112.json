Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: SIAM: Chiplet-based Scalable In-Memory Acceleration with Mesh for Deep Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. In-memory computing (IMC) on a monolithic chip for deep learning faces dramatic challenges on area, yield, and on-chip interconnection cost due to the ever-increasing model sizes. 2.5D integration or chiplet-based architectures interconnect multiple small chips (i.e., chiplets) to form a large computing system, presenting a feasible solution beyond a monolithic IMC architecture to accelerate large deep learning models. This paper presents a new benchmarking simulator, SIAM, to evaluate the performance of chiplet-based IMC architectures and explore the potential of such a paradigm shift in IMC architecture design. SIAM integrates device, circuit, architecture, network-on-chip (NoC), network-on-package (NoP), and DRAM access models to realize an end-to-end system. SIAM is scalable in its support of a wide range of deep neural networks (DNNs), customizable to various network structures and configurations, and capable of efficient design space exploration. We demonstrate the flexibility, scalability, and simulation speed of SIAM by benchmarking different state-of-the-art DNNs with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets. We further calibrate the simulation results with a published silicon result, SIMBA. The chiplet-based IMC architecture obtained through SIAM shows 130×\\times and 72×\\times improvement in energy-efficiency for ResNet-50 on the ImageNet dataset compared to Nvidia V100 and T4 GPUs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
