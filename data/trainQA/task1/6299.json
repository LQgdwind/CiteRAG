Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Note on the Hausdorff Distance between Norm Balls and their Linear Maps\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We consider the problem of computing the (two-sided) Hausdorff distance between the unit ‚Ñìp1subscript‚Ñìsubscriptùëù1\\ell_{p_{1}} and ‚Ñìp2subscript‚Ñìsubscriptùëù2\\ell_{p_{2}} norm balls in finite dimensional Euclidean space for 1‚â§p1<p2‚â§‚àû1subscriptùëù1subscriptùëù21\\leq p_{1}<p_{2}\\leq\\infty, and derive a closed-form formula for the same. We also derive a closed-form formula for the Hausdorff distance between the k1subscriptùëò1k_{1} and k2subscriptùëò2k_{2} unit Dùê∑D-norm balls, which are certain polyhedral norm balls in dùëëd dimensions for 1‚â§k1<k2‚â§d1subscriptùëò1subscriptùëò2ùëë1\\leq k_{1}<k_{2}\\leq d. When two different ‚Ñìpsubscript‚Ñìùëù\\ell_{p} norm balls are transformed via a common linear map, we obtain several estimates for the Hausdorff distance between the resulting convex sets. These estimates upper bound the Hausdorff distance or its expectation, depending on whether the linear map is arbitrary or random. We then generalize the developments for the Hausdorff distance between two set-valued integrals obtained by applying a parametric family of linear maps to different ‚Ñìpsubscript‚Ñìùëù\\ell_{p} unit norm balls, and then taking the Minkowski sums of the resulting sets in a limiting sense. To illustrate an application, we show that the problem of computing the Hausdorff distance between the reach sets of a linear dynamical system with different unit norm ball-valued input uncertainties, reduces to this set-valued integral setting.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper.
