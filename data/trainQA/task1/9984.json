Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Switch Architecture for Time-Triggered Transmission with Best-Effort Delivery\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In Time-Triggered (TT) or time-sensitive networks, the transmission of a TT frame is required to be scheduled at a precise time instant for industrial distributed real-time control systems. Other (or best-effort (BE)) frames are forwarded in a BE manner. Under this scheduling strategy, the transmission of a TT frame must wait until its scheduled instant even if it could have been transmitted sooner. On the other hand, BE frames are transmitted whenever possible but may miss deadlines or may even be dropped due to congestion. As a result, TT transmission and BE delivery are incompatible with each other. To remedy this incompatibility, we propose a synergistic switch architecture (SWA) for TT transmission with BE delivery to dynamically improve the end-to-end (e2e) latency of TT frames by opportunistically exploiting BE delivery. Given a TT frame, the SWA generates and transmits a cloned copy with BE delivery. The first frame arriving at the receiver device is delivered with a configured jitter and the other copy ignored. So, the SWA achieves shorter latency and controllable jitter, the best of both worlds. We have implemented SWA using FPGAs in an industry-strength TT switches and used four test scenarios to demonstrate SWA’s improvements of e2e latency and controllable jitter over the state-of-the-art TT transmission scheme.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
