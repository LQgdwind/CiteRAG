Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Solving Deep Reinforcement Learning Benchmarks with Linear Policy Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods can learn effective policies for challenging problems such as Atari games and robotics tasks, algorithms are complex and training times are often long. This study investigates how evolution strategies (ES) perform compared to gradient-based deep reinforcement learning methods. We use ES to optimize the weights of a neural network via neuroevolution, performing direct policy search. We benchmark both regular networks and policy networks consisting of a single linear layer from observations to actions; for three classical ES methods and for three gradient-based methods such as PPO. Our results reveal that ES can find effective linear policies for many RL benchmark tasks, in contrast to DRL methods that can only find successful policies using much larger networks suggesting that current benchmarks are easier to solve than previously assumed. Interestingly, also for higher complexity tasks, ES achieves results comparable to gradient-based DRL algorithms. Furthermore, we find that by directly accessing the memory state of the game, ES are able to find successful policies in Atari, outperforming DQN. While gradient-based methods have dominated the field in recent years, ES offers an alternative that is easy to implement, parallelize, understand, and tune.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
