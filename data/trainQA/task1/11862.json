      "content": "Paper Title: Embedded Model Bias Quantification with Measurement Noise for Bayesian Model Calibration\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The use of computer simulations to model physical systems has gained significant traction in recent years. A key factor in ensuring the accuracy of these models is the proper calibration of model parameters based on real-world observations or experimental data. Inevitably, uncertainties arise, and Bayesian methods provide a robust framework for quantifying and propagating these uncertainties to model predictions. However, predictions can become inaccurate if model errors are neglected. A promising approach to address this issue involves embedding a bias term in the inference parameters, allowing the quantified bias to influence non-observed Quantities of Interest (QoIs). This paper introduces a more interpretable framework for bias embedding compared to existing methods. Current likelihood formulations that incorporate embedded bias often fail when measurement noise is present. To overcome these limitations, we adapt the existing likelihood models to properly account for noise and propose two new formulations designed to address the shortcomings of the previous approaches. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of this bias-embedding approach in the presence of discrepancies between measurements and model predictions, including noise and outliers. Particular attention is given to how the uncertainty associated with the bias term propagates to the QoIs, enabling a more comprehensive statistical analysis of prediction reliability. Finally, the proposed embedded bias model is applied to estimate the uncertainty in the predicted heat flux from a transient thermal simulation, using temperature observations to illustrate its effectiveness.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper.
