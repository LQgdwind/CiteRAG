Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: End-to-End Training of CNN Ensembles for Person Re-Identification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We propose an end-to-end ensemble method for person re-identification (ReID) to address the problem of overfitting in discriminative models. These models are known to converge easily, but they are biased to the training data in general and may produce a high model variance, which is known as overfitting. The ReID task is more prone to this problem due to the large discrepancy between training and test distributions. To address this problem, our proposed ensemble learning framework produces several diverse and accurate base learners in a single DenseNet. Since most of the costly dense blocks are shared, our method is computationally efficient, which makes it favorable compared to the conventional ensemble models. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Noticeable performance improvements, especially on relatively small datasets, indicate that the proposed method deals with the overfitting problem effectively.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
