Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: An In-Depth Investigation of LEO Satellite Topology Design Parameters\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks are rapidly gaining traction today. Although several real-world deployments exist, our preliminary analysis of LEO topology performance with the soon-to-be operational Inter-Satellite Links (ISLs) reveals several interesting characteristics that are difficult to explain based on our current understanding of topologies. For example, a real-world satellite shell with a low density of satellites offers better latency performance than another shell with nearly double the number of satellites. In this work, we conduct an in-depth investigation of LEO satellite topology design parameters and their impact on network performance while using the ISLs. In particular, we focus on three design parameters: the number of orbits in a shell, the inclination of orbits, and the number of satellites per orbit. Through an extensive analysis of real-world and synthetic satellite configurations, we uncover several interesting properties of satellite topologies. Notably, there exist thresholds for the number of satellites per orbit and the number of orbits below which the latency performance degrades significantly. Moreover, network delay between a pair of traffic endpoints depends on the alignment of the satellite’s orbit (Inclination) with the geographic locations of endpoints.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 55\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
