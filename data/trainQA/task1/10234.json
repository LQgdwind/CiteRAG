In applications such as runtime monitoring, we must incorporate past observations. The timing of these observations matters but may be uncertain. Thus, we consider a setting in which we are given a sequence of imprecisely timed labels called the evidence. The problem is to compute reachability probabilities, which we condition on this evidence. Our key contribution is a method that solves this problem by unfolding the CTMC states over all possible timings for the evidence. We formalize this unfolding as a Markov decision process (MDP) in which each timing for the evidence is reflected by a scheduler. This MDP has infinitely many states and actions in general, making a direct analysis infeasible. Thus, we abstract the continuous MDP into a finite interval MDP (iMDP) and develop an iterative refinement scheme to upper-bound conditional probabilities in the CTMC. We show the feasibility of our method on several numerical benchmarks and discuss key challenges to further enhance the performance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
