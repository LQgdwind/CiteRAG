Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: JCLEC-MO: a Java suite for solving many-objective optimization engineering problems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Although metaheuristics have been widely recognized as efficient techniques to solve real-world optimization problems, implementing them from scratch remains difficult for domain-specific experts without programming skills. In this scenario, metaheuristic optimization frameworks are a practical alternative as they provide a variety of algorithms composed of customized elements, as well as experimental support. Recently, many engineering problems require to optimize multiple or even many objectives, increasing the interest in appropriate metaheuristic algorithms and frameworks that might integrate new specific requirements while maintaining the generality and reusability principles they were conceived for. Based on this idea, this paper introduces JCLEC-MO, a Java framework for both multi- and many-objective optimization that enables engineers to apply, or adapt, a great number of multi-objective algorithms with little coding effort. A case study is developed and explained to show how JCLEC-MO can be used to address many-objective engineering problems, often requiring the inclusion of domain-specific elements, and to analyze experimental outcomes by means of conveniently connected R utilities.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 49\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
