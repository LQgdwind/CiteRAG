Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: LSFSL: Leveraging Shape Information in Few-shot Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Few-shot learning (FSL) techniques seek to learn the underlying patterns in data using fewer samples, analogous to how humans learn from limited experience. In this limited-data scenario, the challenges associated with deep neural networks, such as shortcut learning and texture bias behaviors, are further exacerbated. Moreover, the significance of addressing shortcut learning is not yet fully explored in the few-shot setup. To address these issues, we propose LSFSL, which enforces the model to learn more generalizable features utilizing the implicit prior information present in the data. Through comprehensive analyses, we demonstrate that LSFSL-trained models are less vulnerable to alteration in color schemes, statistical correlations, and adversarial perturbations leveraging the global semantics in the data. Our findings highlight the potential of incorporating relevant priors in few-shot approaches to increase robustness and generalization.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
