Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Parameterized Algorithms for Balanced Cluster Edge Modification Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We introduce Cluster Edge Modification problems with constraints on the size of the clusters and study their complexity. A graph Gùê∫G is a cluster graph if every connected component of Gùê∫G is a clique. In a typical Cluster Edge Modification problem such as the widely studied Cluster Editing, we are given a graph Gùê∫G and a non-negative integer kùëòk as input, and we have to decide if we can turn Gùê∫G into a cluster graph by way of at most kùëòk edge modifications‚Äîthat is, by adding or deleting edges. In this paper, we study the parameterized complexity of such problems, but with an additional constraint: The size difference between any two connected components of the resulting cluster graph should not exceed a given threshold. Depending on which modifications are permissible‚Äîonly adding edges, only deleting edges, both adding and deleting edges‚Äîwe have three different computational problems. We show that all three problems, when parameterized by kùëòk, admit single-exponential time FPT algorithms and polynomial kernels. Our problems may be thought of as the size-constrained or balanced counterparts of the typical Cluster Edge Modification problems, similar to the well-studied size-constrained or balanced counterparts of other clustering problems such as kùëòk-Means Clustering.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
