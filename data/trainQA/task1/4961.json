Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: An original model for multi-target learning of logical rules for knowledge graph reasoning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Large-scale knowledge graphs provide structured representations of human knowledge. However, as it is impossible to collect all knowledge, knowledge graphs are usually incomplete. Reasoning based on existing facts paves a way to discover missing facts. In this paper, we study the problem of learning logical rules for reasoning on knowledge graphs for completing missing factual triplets. Learning logical rules equips a model with strong interpretability as well as the ability to generalize to similar tasks. We propose a model able to fully use training data which also considers multi-target scenarios. In addition, considering the deficiency in evaluating the performance of models and the quality of mined rules, we further propose two novel indicators to help with the problem. Experimental results empirically demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets. The results also prove the effectiveness of the indicators.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
