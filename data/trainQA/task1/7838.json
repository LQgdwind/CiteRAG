      "content": "Paper Title: Skeleton-based Human Action Recognition via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recently, there has been a remarkable increase in the interest towards skeleton-based action recognition within the research community, owing to its various advantageous features, including computational efficiency, representative features, and illumination invariance. Despite this, researchers continue to explore and investigate the most optimal way to represent human actions through skeleton representation and the extracted features. As a result, the growth and availability of human action recognition datasets have risen substantially. In addition, deep learning-based algorithms have gained widespread popularity due to the remarkable advancements in various computer vision tasks. Most state-of-the-art contributions in skeleton-based action recognition incorporate a Graph Neural Network (GCN) architecture for representing the human body and extracting features. Our research demonstrates that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can attain comparable results to GCN, provided that the proper training techniques, augmentations, and optimizers are applied. Our approach has been rigorously validated, and we have achieved a score of 95%percent9595\\% on the NTU-60 dataset.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
