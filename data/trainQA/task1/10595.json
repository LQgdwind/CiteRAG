Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 65 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Synthesizing Sentiment-Controlled Feedback For Multimodal Text and Image Data\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The ability to generate sentiment-controlled feedback in response to multimodal inputs—comprising both text and images—addresses a critical gap in human-computer interaction by enabling systems to provide empathetic, accurate, and engaging responses. This capability has profound applications in healthcare, marketing, and education. To this end, we construct a large-scale Controllable Multimodal Feedback Synthesis (CMFeed) dataset and propose a controllable feedback synthesis system. The proposed system includes an encoder, decoder, and controllability block for textual and visual inputs. It extracts textual and visual features using a transformer and Faster R-CNN networks and combines them to generate feedback. The CMFeed dataset encompasses images, text, reactions to the post, human comments with relevance scores, and reactions to the comments. The reactions to the post and comments are utilized to train the proposed model to produce feedback with a particular (positive or negative) sentiment. A sentiment classification accuracy of 77.23% has been achieved, 18.82% higher than the accuracy without using the controllability. Moreover, the system incorporates a similarity module for assessing feedback relevance through rank-based metrics. It implements an interpretability technique to analyze the contribution of textual and visual features during the generation of uncontrolled and controlled feedback.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 65 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 65\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
