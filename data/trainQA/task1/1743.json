Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Learning 3D Face Reconstruction with a Pose Guidance Network\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present a self-supervised learning approach to learning monocular 3D face reconstruction with a pose guidance network (PGN). First, we unveil the bottleneck of pose estimation in prior parametric 3D face learning methods, and propose to utilize 3D face landmarks for estimating pose parameters. With our specially designed PGN, our model can learn from both faces with fully labeled 3D landmarks and unlimited unlabeled in-the-wild face images. Our network is further augmented with a self-supervised learning scheme, which exploits face geometry information embedded in multiple frames of the same person, to alleviate the ill-posed nature of regressing 3D face geometry from a single image. These three insights yield a single approach that combines the complementary strengths of parametric model learning and data-driven learning techniques. We conduct a rigorous evaluation on the challenging AFLW2000-3D, Florence and FaceWarehouse datasets, and show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art for all metrics.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
