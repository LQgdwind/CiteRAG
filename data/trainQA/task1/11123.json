Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Design and implementation of a synchronous Hardware Performance Monitor for a RISC-V space-oriented processor\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The ability to collect statistics about the execution of a program within a CPU is of the utmost importance across all fields of computing since it allows characterizing the timing performance of a program. This capability is even more relevant in safety-critical software systems, where it is mandatory to analyze the software timing requirements to ensure the correct operation of the programs. Moreover, in order to properly evaluate and verify the extra-functional properties of these systems, besides timing performance, there are many other statistics available on a CPU, such as those associated with its resource utilization. In this paper, we showcase a Performance Measurement Unit (PMU), also known as a Hardware Performance Monitor (HPM), integrated into a RISC-V On-Board Computer (OBC) designed for space applications by our research group. The monitoring technique features a novel approach whereby the events triggered are not counted immediately but instead are propagated through the pipeline so that their annotation is synchronized with the executed instruction. Additionally, we also demonstrate the use of this PMU in a process to characterize the execution model of the processor. Finally, as an example of the statistics provided by the PMU, the results obtained running the CoreMark and Dhrystone benchmarks on the RISC-V OBC are shown.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 50\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
