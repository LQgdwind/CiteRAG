Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Sanity checks and improvements for patch visualisation in prototype-based image classification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this work, we perform an in-depth analysis of the visualisation methods implemented in two popular self-explaining models for visual classification based on prototypes - ProtoPNet and ProtoTree. Using two fine-grained datasets (CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars), we first show that such methods do not correctly identify the regions of interest inside of the images, and therefore do not reflect the model behaviour. Secondly, using a deletion metric we demonstrate quantitatively that saliency methods such as Smoothgrads or PRP provide more faithful image patches. We also propose a new relevance metric based on the segmentation of the object provided in some datasets (e.g. CUB-200-2011) and show that the imprecise patch visualisations generated by ProtoPNet and ProtoTree can create a false sense of bias that can be mitigated by the use of more faithful methods. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for other prototype-based models sharing the same visualisation method.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
