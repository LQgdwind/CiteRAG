Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data.

      "content": "Paper Title: Livestock Monitoring with Transformer\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Tracking the behaviour of livestock enables early detection and thus prevention of contagious diseases in modern animal farms. Apart from economic gains, this would reduce the amount of antibiotics used in livestock farming which otherwise enters the human diet exasperating the epidemic of antibiotic resistance — a leading cause of death. We could use standard video cameras, available in most modern farms, to monitor livestock. However, most computer vision algorithms perform poorly on this task, primarily because, (i) animals bred in farms look identical, lacking any obvious spatial signature, (ii) none of the existing trackers are robust for long duration, and (iii) real-world conditions such as changing illumination, frequent occlusion, varying camera angles, and sizes of the animals make it hard for models to generalize. Given these challenges, we develop an end-to-end behaviour monitoring system for group-housed pigs to perform simultaneous instance level segmentation, tracking, action recognition and re-identification (STAR) tasks. We present starformer, the first end-to-end multiple-object livestock monitoring framework that learns instance-level embeddings for grouped pigs through the use of transformer architecture. For benchmarking, we present Pigtrace, a carefully curated dataset comprising video sequences with instance level bounding box, segmentation, tracking and activity classification of pigs in real indoor farming environment. Using simultaneous optimization on STAR tasks we show that starformer outperforms popular baseline models trained for individual tasks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
