Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Objective Optimization for Value-Sensitive and Sustainable Basket Recommendations\n\nPaper Abstract: Zusammenfassung Sustainable consumption aims to minimize the environmental and societal impact of the use of services and products. Over-consumption of services and products leads to potential natural resource exhaustion and societal inequalities as access to goods and services becomes more challenging. In everyday life, a person can simply achieve more sustainable purchases by drastically changing their lifestyle choices and potentially going against their personal values or wishes. Conversely, achieving sustainable consumption while accounting for personal values is a more complex task as potential trade-offs arise when trying to satisfy environmental and personal goals. This article focuses on value-sensitive design of recommender systems, which enable consumers to improve the sustainability of their purchases while respecting personal and societal values. Value-sensitive recommendations for sustainable consumption are formalized as a multi-objective optimization problem, where each objective represents different sustainability goals and personal values. Novel and existing multi-objective algorithms calculate solutions to this problem. The solutions are proposed as personalized sustainable basket recommendations to consumers. These recommendations are evaluated on a synthetic dataset, which comprises three established real-world datasets from relevant scientific and organizational reports. The synthetic dataset contains quantitative data on product prices, nutritional values, and environmental impact metrics, such as greenhouse gas emissions and water footprint. The recommended baskets are highly similar to consumer purchased baskets and aligned with both sustainability goals and personal values relevant to health, expenditure, and taste. Even when consumers would accept only a fraction of recommendations, a considerable reduction of environmental impact is observed.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 57\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
