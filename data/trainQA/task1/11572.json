Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

A family of rùëür distinct sets {A1,‚Ä¶,Ar}subscriptùê¥1‚Ä¶subscriptùê¥ùëü\\{A_{1},\\ldots,A_{r}\\} is an rùëür-sunflower if for all 1‚©Ωi<j‚©Ωr1ùëñùëóùëü1\\leqslant i<j\\leqslant r and 1‚©Ωi‚Ä≤<j‚Ä≤‚©Ωr1superscriptùëñ‚Ä≤superscriptùëó‚Ä≤ùëü1\\leqslant i^{\\prime}<j^{\\prime}\\leqslant r, we have Ai‚à©Aj=Ai‚Ä≤‚à©Aj‚Ä≤subscriptùê¥ùëñsubscriptùê¥ùëósubscriptùê¥superscriptùëñ‚Ä≤subscriptùê¥superscriptùëó‚Ä≤A_{i}\\cap A_{j}=A_{i^{\\prime}}\\cap A_{j^{\\prime}}. Erd≈ës and Rado conjectured in 1960 that every family ‚Ñã‚Ñã\\mathcal{H} of ‚Ñì‚Ñì\\ell-element sets of size at least K‚Äã(r)‚Ñìùêæsuperscriptùëü‚ÑìK(r)^{\\ell} contains an rùëür-sunflower, where K‚Äã(r)ùêæùëüK(r) is some function that depends only on rùëür. We prove that if ‚Ñã‚Ñã\\mathcal{H} is a family of ‚Ñì‚Ñì\\ell-element sets of VC-dimension at most dùëëd and |‚Ñã|>(C‚Äãr‚Äã(log‚Å°d+log‚àó‚Å°‚Ñì))‚Ñì‚Ñãsuperscriptùê∂ùëüùëësuperscript‚àó‚Ñì‚Ñì|\\mathcal{H}|>(Cr(\\log d+\\log^{\\ast}\\ell))^{\\ell} for some absolute constant C>0ùê∂0C>0, then ‚Ñã‚Ñã\\mathcal{H} contains an rùëür-sunflower. This improves a recent result of Fox, Pach, and Suk. When d=1ùëë1d=1, we obtain a sharp bound, namely that |‚Ñã|>(r‚àí1)‚Ñì‚Ñãsuperscriptùëü1‚Ñì|\\mathcal{H}|>(r-1)^{\\ell} is sufficient. Along the way, we establish a strengthening of the Kahn‚ÄìKalai conjecture for set families of bounded VC-dimension, which is of independent interest.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
