      "content": "Paper Title: The 𝑞-ary Gilbert–Varshamov bound can be improved for all but finitely many positive integers 𝑞\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract For any positive integer q≥2𝑞2q\\geq 2 and any real number δ∈(0,1)𝛿01\\delta\\in(0,1), let αq​(n,δ​n)subscript𝛼𝑞𝑛𝛿𝑛\\alpha_{q}(n,\\delta n) denote the maximum size of a subset of ℤqnsuperscriptsubscriptℤ𝑞𝑛\\mathbb{Z}_{q}^{n} with minimum Hamming distance at least δ​n𝛿𝑛\\delta n, where ℤq={0,1,…,q−1}subscriptℤ𝑞01…𝑞1\\mathbb{Z}_{q}=\\{0,1,\\dotsc,q-1\\} and n∈ℕ𝑛ℕn\\in\\mathbb{N}. The asymptotic rate function is defined by Rq​(δ)=lim supn→∞1n​logq⁡αq​(n,δ​n).subscript𝑅𝑞𝛿subscriptlimit-supremum→𝑛1𝑛subscript𝑞subscript𝛼𝑞𝑛𝛿𝑛R_{q}(\\delta)=\\limsup_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{1}{n}\\log_{q}\\alpha_{q}(n,\\delta n). The famous q𝑞q-ary asymptotic Gilbert–Varshamov bound, obtained in the 1950s, states that Rq​(δ)≥1−δ​logq⁡(q−1)−δ​logq⁡1δ−(1−δ)​logq⁡11−δ=defRGV​(δ,q)subscript𝑅𝑞𝛿1𝛿subscript𝑞𝑞1𝛿subscript𝑞1𝛿1𝛿subscript𝑞11𝛿superscriptdefsubscript𝑅GV𝛿𝑞R_{q}(\\delta)\\geq 1-\\delta\\log_{q}(q-1)-\\delta\\log_{q}\\frac{1}{\\delta}-(1-\\delta)\\log_{q}\\frac{1}{1-\\delta}\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle\\mathrm{def}}}{{=}}R_{\\mathrm{GV}}(\\delta,q) for all positive integers q≥2𝑞2q\\geq 2 and 0<δ<1−q−10𝛿1superscript𝑞10<\\delta<1-q^{-1}. In the case that q𝑞q is an even power of a prime with q≥49𝑞49q\\geq 49, the q𝑞q-ary Gilbert–Varshamov bound was firstly improved by using algebraic geometry codes in the works of Tsfasman, Vladut, and Zink and of Ihara in the 1980s. These algebraic geometry codes have been modified to improve the q𝑞q-ary Gilbert–Varshamov bound RGV​(δ,q)subscript𝑅GV𝛿𝑞R_{\\mathrm{GV}}(\\delta,q) at a specific tangent point δ=δ0∈(0,1)𝛿subscript𝛿001\\delta=\\delta_{0}\\in(0,1) of the curve RGV​(δ,q)subscript𝑅GV𝛿𝑞R_{\\mathrm{GV}}(\\delta,q) for each given integer q≥46𝑞46q\\geq 46. However, the q𝑞q-ary Gilbert–Varshamov bound RGV​(δ,q)subscript𝑅GV𝛿𝑞R_{\\mathrm{GV}}(\\delta,q) at δ=1/2𝛿12\\delta=1/2, i.e., RGV​(1/2,q)subscript𝑅GV12𝑞R_{\\mathrm{GV}}(1/2,q), remains the largest known lower bound of Rq​(1/2)subscript𝑅𝑞12R_{q}(1/2) for infinitely many positive integers q𝑞q which is a generic prime and which is a generic non-prime-power integer. In this paper, we prove that the q𝑞q-ary Gilbert–Varshamov bound RGV​(δ,q)subscript𝑅GV𝛿𝑞R_{\\mathrm{GV}}(\\delta,q) with δ∈(0,1)𝛿01\\delta\\in(0,1) can be improved for all but finitely many positive integers q𝑞q. Precisely, for any given number ε∈(0,12)𝜀012\\varepsilon\\in(0,\\frac{1}{2}), if q𝑞q is large enough, then Rq​(δ)>RGV​(δ,q)subscript𝑅𝑞𝛿subscript𝑅GV𝛿𝑞R_{q}(\\delta)>R_{\\mathrm{GV}}(\\delta,q) for all δ∈[ε,1−ε]𝛿𝜀1𝜀\\delta\\in[\\varepsilon,1-\\varepsilon]. In particular, it is explicitly shown that Rq​(1/2)>RGV​(1/2,q)subscript𝑅𝑞12subscript𝑅GV12𝑞R_{q}(1/2)>R_{\\mathrm{GV}}(1/2,q) for all integers q>exp⁡(29)𝑞29q>\\exp(29). Furthermore, based on the q𝑞q-ary asymptotic Plotkin upper bound Rq​(δ)≤1−δ−δq−1subscript𝑅𝑞𝛿1𝛿𝛿𝑞1R_{q}(\\delta)\\leq 1-\\delta-\\frac{\\delta}{q-1} for all positive integers q≥2𝑞2q\\geq 2 and 0<δ<1−q−10𝛿1superscript𝑞10<\\delta<1-q^{-1}, we can define the growth on the rate function Rq​(δ)subscript𝑅𝑞𝛿R_{q}(\\delta) for δ∈(0,1)𝛿01\\delta\\in(0,1) fixed and q𝑞q growing large as follows η(δ)=lim infq→∞1log⁡qlog[1−δ−Rq(δ)]−1.\\eta(\\delta)=\\liminf_{q\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{1}{\\log q}\\log[1-\\delta-R_{q}(\\delta)]^{-1}. The q𝑞q-ary Plotkin upper bound implies that the growth satisfies η​(δ)≤1𝜂𝛿1\\eta(\\delta)\\leq 1, while the q𝑞q-ary Gilbert–Varshamov lower bound only provides the trivial bound η​(δ)≥0𝜂𝛿0\\eta(\\delta)\\geq 0. In this paper, we show that the growth has actually a nontrivial lower bound as η​(δ)≥1/6𝜂𝛿16\\eta(\\delta)\\geq 1/6 for δ∈(0,1)𝛿01\\delta\\in(0,1). These new lower bounds, which exceed the Gilbert–Varshamov bound, are achieved by using codes from geometry of numbers introduced by Lenstra in the 1980s.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
