Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: ECO: Enabling Energy-Neutral IoT Devices through Runtime Allocation of Harvested Energy\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Energy harvesting offers an attractive and promising mechanism to power low-energy devices. However, it alone is insufficient to enable an energy-neutral operation, which can eliminate tedious battery charging and replacement requirements. Achieving an energy-neutral operation is challenging since the uncertainties in harvested energy undermine the quality of service requirements. To address this challenge, we present a runtime energy-allocation framework that optimizes the utility of the target device under energy constraints using a rollout algorithm, which is a sequential approach to solve dynamic optimization problems. The proposed framework uses an efficient iterative algorithm to compute initial energy allocations at the beginning of a day. The initial allocations are then corrected at every interval to compensate for the deviations from the expected energy harvesting pattern. We evaluate this framework using solar and motion energy harvesting modalities and American Time Use Survey data from 4772 different users. Compared to prior techniques, the proposed framework achieves up to 35% higher utility even under energy-limited scenarios. Moreover, measurements on a wearable device prototype show that the proposed framework has 1000x smaller energy overhead than iterative approaches with a negligible loss in utility.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 57\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
