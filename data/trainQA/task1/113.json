Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: WaveTTS: Tacotron-based TTS with Joint Time-Frequency Domain Loss\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Tacotron-based text-to-speech (TTS) systems directly synthesize speech from text input. Such frameworks typically consist of a feature prediction network that maps character sequences to frequency-domain acoustic features, followed by a waveform reconstruction algorithm or a neural vocoder that generates the time-domain waveform from acoustic features. As the loss function is usually calculated only for frequency-domain acoustic features, that doesn’t directly control the quality of the generated time-domain waveform. To address this problem, we propose a new training scheme for Tacotron-based TTS, referred to as WaveTTS, that has 2 loss functions: 1) time-domain loss, denoted as the waveform loss, that measures the distortion between the natural and generated waveform; and 2) frequency-domain loss, that measures the Mel-scale acoustic feature loss between the natural and generated acoustic features. WaveTTS ensures both the quality of the acoustic features and the resulting speech waveform. To our best knowledge, this is the first implementation of Tacotron with joint time-frequency domain loss. Experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms the baselines and achieves high-quality synthesized speech.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
