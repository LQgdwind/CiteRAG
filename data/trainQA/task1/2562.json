Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Internal Language Model Training for Domain-Adaptive End-to-End Speech Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The efficacy of external language model (LM) integration with existing end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems can be improved significantly using the internal language model estimation (ILME) method [1]. In this method, the internal LM score is subtracted from the score obtained by interpolating the E2E score with the external LM score, during inference. To improve the ILME-based inference, we propose an internal LM training (ILMT) method to minimize an additional internal LM loss by updating only the E2E model components that affect the internal LM estimation. ILMT encourages the E2E model to form a standalone LM inside its existing components, without sacrificing ASR accuracy. After ILMT, the more modular E2E model with matched training and inference criteria enables a more thorough elimination of the source-domain internal LM, and therefore leads to a more effective integration of the target-domain external LM. Experimented with 30K-hour trained recurrent neural network transducer and attention-based encoder-decoder models, ILMT with ILME-based inference achieves up to 31.5% and 11.4% relative word error rate reductions from standard E2E training with Shallow Fusion on out-of-domain LibriSpeech and in-domain Microsoft production test sets, respectively.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
