Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Theoretical Justification for Image Inpainting using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We provide a theoretical justification for sample recovery using diffusion based image inpainting in a linear model setting. While most inpainting algorithms require retraining with each new mask, we prove that diffusion based inpainting generalizes well to unseen masks without retraining. We analyze a recently proposed popular diffusion based inpainting algorithm called RePaint [LDRYTV22], and show that it has a bias due to misalignment that hampers sample recovery even in a two-state diffusion process. Motivated by our analysis, we propose a modified RePaint algorithm we call RePaint+ that provably recovers the underlying true sample and enjoys a linear rate of convergence. It achieves this by rectifying the misalignment error present in drift and dispersion of the reverse process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first linear convergence result for a diffusion based image inpainting algorithm.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
