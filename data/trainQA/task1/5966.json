Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Polynomial formulations as a barrier for reduction-based hardness proofs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) asserts that for every ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 there exists k𝑘k such that k𝑘k-SAT requires time (2−ε)nsuperscript2𝜀𝑛(2-\\varepsilon)^{n}. The field of fine-grained complexity has leveraged SETH to prove quite tight conditional lower bounds for dozens of problems in various domains and complexity classes, including Edit Distance, Graph Diameter, Hitting Set, Independent Set, and Orthogonal Vectors. Yet, it has been repeatedly asked in the literature whether SETH-hardness results can be proven for other fundamental problems such as Hamiltonian Path, Independent Set, Chromatic Number, MAX-k𝑘k-SAT, and Set Cover. In this paper, we show that fine-grained reductions implying even λnsuperscript𝜆𝑛\\lambda^{n}-hardness of these problems from SETH for any λ>1𝜆1\\lambda>1, would imply new circuit lower bounds: super-linear lower bounds for Boolean series-parallel circuits or polynomial lower bounds for arithmetic circuits (each of which is a four-decade open question). We also extend this barrier result to the class of parameterized problems. Namely, for every λ>1𝜆1\\lambda>1 we conditionally rule out fine-grained reductions implying SETH-based lower bounds of λksuperscript𝜆𝑘\\lambda^{k} for a number of problems parameterized by the solution size k𝑘k. Our main technical tool is a new concept called polynomial formulations. In particular, we show that many problems can be represented by relatively succinct low-degree polynomials, and that any problem with such a representation cannot be proven SETH-hard (without proving new circuit lower bounds).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
