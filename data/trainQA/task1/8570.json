      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring the Mutual Influence between Self-Supervised Single-Frame and Multi-Frame Depth Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Although both self-supervised single-frame and multi-frame depth estimation methods only require unlabeled monocular videos for training, the information they leverage varies because single-frame methods mainly rely on appearance-based features while multi-frame methods focus on geometric cues. Considering the complementary information of single-frame and multi-frame methods, some works attempt to leverage single-frame depth to improve multi-frame depth. However, these methods can neither exploit the difference between single-frame depth and multi-frame depth to improve multi-frame depth nor leverage multi-frame depth to optimize single-frame depth models. To fully utilize the mutual influence between single-frame and multi-frame methods, we propose a novel self-supervised training framework. Specifically, we first introduce a pixel-wise adaptive depth sampling module guided by single-frame depth to train the multi-frame model. Then, we leverage the minimum reprojection based distillation loss to transfer the knowledge from the multi-frame depth network to the single-frame network to improve single-frame depth. Finally, we regard the improved single-frame depth as a prior to further boost the performance of multi-frame depth estimation. Experimental results on the KITTI and Cityscapes datasets show that our method outperforms existing approaches in the self-supervised monocular setting.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
