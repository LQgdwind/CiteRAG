Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Noise-tolerant learnability of shallow quantum circuits from statistics and the cost of quantum pseudorandomness\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This work studies the learnability of unknown quantum circuits in the near term. We prove the natural robustness of quantum statistical queries for learning quantum processes and provide an efficient way to benchmark various classes of noise from statistics, which gives us a powerful framework for developing noise-tolerant algorithms. We adapt a learning algorithm for constant-depth quantum circuits to the quantum statistical query setting with a small overhead in the query complexity. We prove average-case lower bounds for learning random quantum circuits of logarithmic and higher depths within diamond distance with statistical queries. Additionally, we show the hardness of the quantum threshold search problem from quantum statistical queries and discuss its implications for the learnability of shallow quantum circuits. Finally, we prove that pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) cannot be constructed using circuits of constant depth by constructing an efficient distinguisher and proving a new variation of the quantum no-free lunch theorem.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
