Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Value Activation for Bias Alleviation: Generalized-activated Deep Double Deterministic Policy Gradients\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract It is vital to accurately estimate the value function in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) such that the agent could execute proper actions instead of suboptimal ones. However, existing actor-critic methods suffer more or less from underestimation bias or overestimation bias, which negatively affect their performance. In this paper, we reveal a simple but effective principle: proper value correction benefits bias alleviation, where we propose the generalized-activated weighting operator that uses any non-decreasing function, namely activation function, as weights for better value estimation. Particularly, we integrate the generalized-activated weighting operator into value estimation and introduce a novel algorithm, Generalized-activated Deep Double Deterministic Policy Gradients (GD3). We theoretically show that GD3 is capable of alleviating the potential estimation bias. We interestingly find that simple activation functions lead to satisfying performance with no additional tricks, and could contribute to faster convergence. Experimental results on numerous challenging continuous control tasks show that GD3 with task-specific activation outperforms the common baseline methods. We also uncover a fact that fine-tuning the polynomial activation function achieves superior results on most of the tasks. Codes will be available upon publication.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
