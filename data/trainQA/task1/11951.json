      "content": "Paper Title: Geometry of naturalistic object representations in recurrent neural network models of working memory\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Working memory is a central cognitive ability crucial for intelligent decision-making. Recent experimental and computational work studying working memory has primarily used categorical (i.e., one-hot) inputs, rather than ecologically-relevant, multidimensional naturalistic ones. Moreover, studies have primarily investigated working memory during single or few number of cognitive tasks. As a result, an understanding of how naturalistic object information is maintained in working memory in neural networks is still lacking. To bridge this gap, we developed sensory-cognitive models, comprising of a convolutional neural network (CNN) coupled with a recurrent neural network (RNN), and trained them on nine distinct N-back tasks using naturalistic stimuli. By examining the RNNâ€™s latent space, we found that: 1) Multi-task RNNs represent both task-relevant and irrelevant information simultaneously while performing tasks; 2) While the latent subspaces used to maintain specific object properties in vanilla RNNs are largely shared across tasks, they are highly task-specific in gated RNNs such as GRU and LSTM; 3) Surprisingly, RNNs embed objects in new representational spaces in which individual object features are less orthogonalized relative to the perceptual space; 4) Interestingly, the transformation of WM encodings (i.e., embedding of visual inputs in the RNN latent space) into memory was shared across stimuli, yet the transformations governing the retention of a memory in the face of incoming distractor stimuli were distinct across time. Our findings indicate that goal-driven RNNs employ chronological memory subspaces to track information over short time spans, enabling testable predictions with neural data.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
