Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Pauli channel estimation with logarithmic quantum memory\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Here we revisit one of the prototypical tasks for characterizing the structure of noise in quantum devices: estimating every eigenvalue of an nùëõn-qubit Pauli noise channel to error ŒµùúÄ\\varepsilon. Prior work [14] proved no-go theorems for this task in the practical regime where one has a limited amount of quantum memory, e.g. any protocol with ‚â§0.99‚Äãnabsent0.99ùëõ\\leq 0.99n ancilla qubits of quantum memory must make exponentially many measurements, provided it is non-concatenating. Such protocols can only interact with the channel by repeatedly preparing a state, passing it through the channel, and measuring immediately afterward. This left open a natural question: does the lower bound hold even for general protocols, i.e. ones which chain together many queries to the channel, interleaved with arbitrary data-processing channels, before measuring? Surprisingly, in this work we show the opposite: there is a protocol that can estimate the eigenvalues of a Pauli channel to error ŒµùúÄ\\varepsilon using only O‚Äã(log‚Å°n/Œµ2)ùëÇùëõsuperscriptùúÄ2O(\\log n/\\varepsilon^{2}) ancilla qubits and O~‚Äã(n2/Œµ2)~ùëÇsuperscriptùëõ2superscriptùúÄ2\\tilde{O}(n^{2}/\\varepsilon^{2}) measurements. In contrast, we show that any protocol with zero ancilla ‚Äì even a concatenating one‚Äì must make Œ©‚Äã(2n/Œµ2)Œ©superscript2ùëõsuperscriptùúÄ2\\Omega(2^{n}/\\varepsilon^{2}) measurements, which is tight. Our results imply, to our knowledge, the first quantum learning task where logarithmically many qubits of quantum memory suffice for an exponential statistical advantage.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 65 most likely reference titles for this paper.
