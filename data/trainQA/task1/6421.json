      "content": "Paper Title: Parameterized Complexity of Streaming Diameter and Connectivity Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We initiate the investigation of the parameterized complexity of Diameter and Connectivity in the streaming paradigm. On the positive end, we show that knowing a vertex cover of size k𝑘k allows for algorithms in the Adjacency List (AL) streaming model whose number of passes is constant and memory is 𝒪​(log⁡n)𝒪𝑛\\mathcal{O}(\\log n) for any fixed k𝑘k. Underlying these algorithms is a method to execute a breadth-first search in 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k) passes and 𝒪​(k​log⁡n)𝒪𝑘𝑛\\mathcal{O}(k\\log n) bits of memory. On the negative end, we show that many other parameters lead to lower bounds in the AL model, where Ω​(n/p)Ω𝑛𝑝\\Omega(n/p) bits of memory is needed for any p𝑝p-pass algorithm even for constant parameter values. In particular, this holds for graphs with a known modulator (deletion set) of constant size to a graph that has no induced subgraph isomorphic to a fixed graph H𝐻H, for most H𝐻H. For some cases, we can also show one-pass, Ω​(n​log⁡n)Ω𝑛𝑛\\Omega(n\\log n) bits of memory lower bounds. We also prove a much stronger Ω​(n2/p)Ωsuperscript𝑛2𝑝\\Omega(n^{2}/p) lower bound for Diameter on bipartite graphs. Finally, using the insights we developed into streaming parameterized graph exploration algorithms, we show a new streaming kernelization algorithm for computing a vertex cover of size k𝑘k. This yields a kernel of 2​k2𝑘2k vertices (with 𝒪​(k2)𝒪superscript𝑘2\\mathcal{O}(k^{2}) edges) produced as a stream in poly​(k)poly𝑘\\text{poly}(k) passes and only 𝒪​(k​log⁡n)𝒪𝑘𝑛\\mathcal{O}(k\\log n) bits of memory.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
