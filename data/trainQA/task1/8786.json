Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

Additional references cover related neural network architectures, NLP applications, deep learning methodologies, optimization techniques, and advanced neural network methods that would be relevant for this research area.\"\n}\n\nReturn JSON object only."

      "content": "Paper Title: Domain Adaptive Sim-to-Real Segmentation of Oropharyngeal Organs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Video-assisted transoral tracheal intubation (TI) necessitates using an endoscope that helps the physician insert a tracheal tube into the glottis instead of the esophagus. The growing trend of robotic-assisted TI would require a medical robot to distinguish anatomical features like an experienced physician which can be imitated by utilizing supervised deep-learning techniques. However, the real datasets of oropharyngeal organs are often inaccessible due to limited open-source data and patient privacy. In this work, we propose a domain adaptive Sim-to-Real framework called IoU-Ranking Blend-ArtFlow (IRB-AF) for image segmentation of oropharyngeal organs. The framework includes an image blending strategy called IoU-Ranking Blend (IRB) and style-transfer method ArtFlow. Here, IRB alleviates the problem of poor segmentation performance caused by significant datasets domain differences; while ArtFlow is introduced to reduce the discrepancies between datasets further. A virtual oropharynx image dataset generated by the SOFA framework is used as the learning subject for semantic segmentation to deal with the limited availability of actual endoscopic images. We adapted IRB-AF with the state-of-the-art domain adaptive segmentation models. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach in further improving the segmentation accuracy and training stability.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
