Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Can ChatGPT Detect Intent? Evaluating Large Language Models for Spoken Language Understanding\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recently, large pretrained language models have demonstrated strong language understanding capabilities. This is particularly reflected in their zero-shot and in-context learning abilities on downstream tasks through prompting. To assess their impact on spoken language understanding (SLU), we evaluate several such models like ChatGPT and OPT of different sizes on multiple benchmarks. We verify the emergent ability unique to the largest models as they can reach intent classification accuracy close to that of supervised models with zero or few shots on various languages given oracle transcripts. By contrast, the results for smaller models fitting a single GPU fall far behind. We note that the error cases often arise from the annotation scheme of the dataset; responses from ChatGPT are still reasonable. We show, however, that the model is worse at slot filling, and its performance is sensitive to ASR errors, suggesting serious challenges for the application of those textual models on SLU.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 47\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
