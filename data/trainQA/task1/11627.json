      "content": "Paper Title: Digital Fingerprinting on Multimedia: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The explosive growth of multimedia content in the digital economy era has brought challenges in content recognition, copyright protection, and data management. As an emerging content management technology, perceptual hash-based digital fingerprints, serving as compact summaries of multimedia content, have been widely adopted for efficient multimedia content identification and retrieval across different modalities (e.g., text, image, video, audio), attracting significant attention from both academia and industry. Despite the increasing applications of digital fingerprints, there is a lack of systematic and comprehensive literature review on multimedia digital fingerprints. This survey aims to fill this gap and provide an important resource for researchers studying the details and related advancements of multimedia digital fingerprints. The survey first introduces the definition, characteristics, and related concepts (including hash functions, granularity, similarity measures, etc.) of digital fingerprints. It then focuses on analyzing and summarizing the algorithms for extracting unimodal fingerprints of different types of digital content, including text fingerprints, image fingerprints, video fingerprints, and audio fingerprints. Particularly, it provides an in-depth review and summary of deep learning-based fingerprints. Additionally, the survey elaborates on the various practical applications of digital fingerprints and outlines the challenges and potential future research directions. The goal is to promote the continued development of multimedia digital fingerprint research.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 238 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
