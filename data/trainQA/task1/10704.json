      "content": "Paper Title: Cooperative Backscatter Communications with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: An APSK Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, a novel amplitude phase shift keying (APSK) modulation scheme for cooperative backscatter communications aided by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS-CBC) is presented, according to which the RIS is configured to modulate backscatter information onto unmodulated or PSK-modulated signals impinging on its surface via APSK. We consider both passive and active RISs, with the latter including an amplification unit at each reflecting element. In the passive (resp. active) RIS-CBC-APSK, backscatter information is conveyed through the number of RIS reflecting elements being on the ON state (resp. active mode) and their phase shift values. By using the optimal APSK constellation to ensure that reflected signals from the RIS undergo APSK modulation, a bit-mapping mechanism is presented. Assuming maximum-likelihood detection, we also present closed-form upper bounds for the symbol error rate (SER) performance for both passive and active RIS-CBC-APSK schemes over Rician fading channels. In addition, we devise a low-complexity detector that can achieve flexible trade-offs between performance and complexity. Finally, we extend RIS-CBC-APSK to multiple-input single-output scenarios and present an alternating optimization approach for the joint design of transmit beamforming and RIS reflection. Our extensive simulation results on the SER performance corroborate our conducted performance analysis and showcase the superiority of the proposed RIS-CBC-APSK schemes over the state-of-the-art RIS-CBC benchmarks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
