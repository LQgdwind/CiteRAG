      "content": "Paper Title: Parameterized Complexity of Binary CSP: Vertex Cover, Treedepth, and Related Parameters\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We investigate the parameterized complexity of Binary CSP parameterized by the vertex cover number and the treedepth of the constraint graph, as well as by a selection of related modulator-based parameters. The main findings are as follows: ‚Ä¢ Binary CSP parameterized by the vertex cover number is W‚Äã[3]Wdelimited-[]3\\mathrm{W}[3]-complete. More generally, for every positive integer dùëëd, Binary CSP parameterized by the size of a modulator to a treedepth-dùëëd graph is W‚Äã[2‚Äãd+1]Wdelimited-[]2ùëë1\\mathrm{W}[2d+1]-complete. This provides a new family of natural problems that are complete for odd levels of the WW\\mathrm{W}-hierarchy. ‚Ä¢ We introduce a new complexity class XSLPXSLP\\mathrm{XSLP}, defined so that Binary CSP parameterized by treedepth is complete for this class. We provide two equivalent characterizations of XSLPXSLP\\mathrm{XSLP}: the first one relates XSLPXSLP\\mathrm{XSLP} to a model of an alternating Turing machine with certain restrictions on conondeterminism and space complexity, while the second one links XSLPXSLP\\mathrm{XSLP} to the problem of model-checking first-order logic with suitably restricted universal quantification. Interestingly, the proof of the machine characterization of XSLPXSLP\\mathrm{XSLP} uses the concept of universal trees, which are prominently featured in the recent work on parity games. ‚Ä¢ We describe a new complexity hierarchy sandwiched between the WW\\mathrm{W}-hierarchy and the AA\\mathrm{A}-hierarchy: For every odd tùë°t, we introduce a parameterized complexity class S‚Äã[t]Sdelimited-[]ùë°\\mathrm{S}[t] with W‚Äã[t]‚äÜS‚Äã[t]‚äÜA‚Äã[t]Wdelimited-[]ùë°Sdelimited-[]ùë°Adelimited-[]ùë°\\mathrm{W}[t]\\subseteq\\mathrm{S}[t]\\subseteq\\mathrm{A}[t], defined using a parameter that interpolates between the vertex cover number and the treedepth. We expect that many of the studied classes will be useful in the future for pinpointing the complexity of various structural parameterizations of graph problems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
