Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: TKUS: Mining Top-ùëò High-Utility Sequential Patterns\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract High-utility sequential pattern mining (HUSPM) has recently emerged as a focus of intense research interest. The main task of HUSPM is to find all subsequences, within a quantitative sequential database, that have high utility with respect to a user-defined minimum utility threshold. However, it is difficult to specify the minimum utility threshold, especially when database features, which are invisible in most cases, are not understood. To handle this problem, top-kùëòk HUSPM was proposed. Up to now, only very preliminary work has been conducted to capture top-kùëòk HUSPs, and existing strategies require improvement in terms of running time, memory consumption, unpromising candidate filtering, and scalability. Moreover, no systematic problem statement has been defined. In this paper, we formulate the problem of top-kùëòk HUSPM and propose a novel algorithm called TKUS. To improve efficiency, TKUS adopts a projection and local search mechanism and employs several schemes, including the Sequence Utility Raising, Terminate Descendants Early, and Eliminate Unpromising Items strategies, which allow it to greatly reduce the search space. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that TKUS can achieve sufficiently good top-kùëòk HUSPM performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithm TKHUS-Span.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
