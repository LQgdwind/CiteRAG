Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: A framework for the analysis of fully coupled normal and tangential contact problems with complex interfaces\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract An extension to the interface finite element with eMbedded Profile for Joint Roughness (MPJR interface finite element) is herein proposed for solving the frictional contact problem between a rigid indenter of any complex shape and an elastic body under generic oblique load histories. The actual shape of the indenter is accounted for as correction of the gap function. A regularised version of the Coulomb friction law is employed for modeling the tangential contact response, while a penalty approach is introduced in the normal contact direction. The development of the finite element (FE) formulation stemming from its variational formalism is thoroughly derived and the model is validated in relation to challenging scenarios for standard (alternative) finite element procedures and analytical methods, such as the contact with multi-scale rough profiles. The present framework enables the comprehensive investigation of the system response due to the occurrence of tangential tractions, which are at the origin of important phenomena such as wear and fretting fatigue, together with the analysis of the effects of coupling between normal and tangential contact tractions. This scenario is herein investigated in relation to challenging physical problems involving arbitrary loading histories.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
