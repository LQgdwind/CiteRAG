Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: SCENES: Subpixel Correspondence Estimation With Epipolar Supervision\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Extracting point correspondences from two or more views of a scene is a fundamental computer vision problem with particular importance for relative camera pose estimation and structure-from-motion. Existing local feature matching approaches, trained with correspondence supervision on large-scale datasets, obtain highly-accurate matches on the test sets. However, they do not generalise well to new datasets with different characteristics to those they were trained on, unlike classic feature extractors. Instead, they require finetuning, which assumes that ground-truth correspondences or ground-truth camera poses and 3D structure are available. We relax this assumption by removing the requirement of 3D structure, e.g., depth maps or point clouds, and only require camera pose information, which can be obtained from odometry. We do so by replacing correspondence losses with epipolar losses, which encourage putative matches to lie on the associated epipolar line. While weaker than correspondence supervision, we observe that this cue is sufficient for finetuning existing models on new data. We then further relax the assumption of known camera poses by using pose estimates in a novel bootstrapping approach. We evaluate on highly challenging datasets, including an indoor drone dataset and an outdoor smartphone camera dataset, and obtain state-of-the-art results without strong supervision.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
