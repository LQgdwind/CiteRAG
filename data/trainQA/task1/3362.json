      "content": "Paper Title: Self-Attention Networks Can Process Bounded Hierarchical Languages\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Despite their impressive performance in NLP, self-attention networks were recently proved to be limited for processing formal languages with hierarchical structure, such as 𝖣𝗒𝖼𝗄ksubscript𝖣𝗒𝖼𝗄𝑘\\mathsf{Dyck}_{k}, the language consisting of well-nested parentheses of k𝑘k types. This suggested that natural language can be approximated well with models that are too weak for formal languages, or that the role of hierarchy and recursion in natural language might be limited. We qualify this implication by proving that self-attention networks can process 𝖣𝗒𝖼𝗄k,Dsubscript𝖣𝗒𝖼𝗄𝑘𝐷\\mathsf{Dyck}_{k,D}, the subset of 𝖣𝗒𝖼𝗄ksubscript𝖣𝗒𝖼𝗄𝑘\\mathsf{Dyck}_{k} with depth bounded by D𝐷D, which arguably better captures the bounded hierarchical structure of natural language. Specifically, we construct a hard-attention network with D+1𝐷1D+1 layers and O​(log⁡k)𝑂𝑘O(\\log k) memory size (per token per layer) that recognizes 𝖣𝗒𝖼𝗄k,Dsubscript𝖣𝗒𝖼𝗄𝑘𝐷\\mathsf{Dyck}_{k,D}, and a soft-attention network with two layers and O​(log⁡k)𝑂𝑘O(\\log k) memory size that generates 𝖣𝗒𝖼𝗄k,Dsubscript𝖣𝗒𝖼𝗄𝑘𝐷\\mathsf{Dyck}_{k,D}. Experiments show that self-attention networks trained on 𝖣𝗒𝖼𝗄k,Dsubscript𝖣𝗒𝖼𝗄𝑘𝐷\\mathsf{Dyck}_{k,D} generalize to longer inputs with near-perfect accuracy, and also verify the theoretical memory advantage of self-attention networks over recurrent networks.111Code is available at https://github.com/princeton-nlp/dyck-transformer.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
