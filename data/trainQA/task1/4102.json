Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5.

      "content": "Paper Title: BloomNet: A Robust Transformer based model for Bloom’s Learning Outcome Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Bloom’s taxonomy is a common paradigm for categorizing educational learning objectives into three learning levels: cognitive, affective, and psychomotor. For the optimization of educational programs, it is crucial to design course learning outcomes (CLOs) according to the different cognitive levels of Bloom’s Taxonomy. Usually, administrators of the institutions manually complete the tedious work of mapping CLOs and examination questions to Bloom’s taxonomy levels. To address this issue, we propose a transformer based model named BloomNet that captures linguistic as well semantic information to classify the course learning outcomes (CLOs) . We compare BloomNet with diverse set of basic as well as strong baselines and we observe that our model performs better than all the experimented baselines. Further, we also test the generalisation capability of BloomNet by evaluating it on different distributions which our model does not encounter during training and we observe that our model is less susceptible to distribution shift compared to the other considered models. We support our findings by performing extensive result analysis. In ablation study we observe that on explicitly encapsulating the linguistic information along with semantic information improves the model’s IID (independent and identically distributed) performance as well as OOD (out-of-distribution) generalization capability.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
