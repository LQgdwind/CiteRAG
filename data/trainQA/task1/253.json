      "content": "Paper Title: Polynomial algorithms for p-dispersion problems in a planar Pareto Front\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. In this paper, p𝑝p-dispersion problems are studied to select p⩾2𝑝2p\\geqslant 2 representative points from a large 2D Pareto Front (PF), solution of bi-objective optimization. Four standard p𝑝p-dispersion variants are considered. A novel variant, Max-Sum-Neighbor p𝑝p-dispersion, is introduced for the specific case of a 2D PF. Firstly, 222-dispersion and 333-dispersion problems are proven solvable in O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) time in a 2D PF. Secondly, dynamic programming algorithms are designed for three p𝑝p-dispersion variants, proving polynomial complexities in a 2D PF. Max-min p𝑝p-dispersion is solvable in O​(p​n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑝𝑛𝑛O(pn\\log n) time and O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) memory space. Max-Sum-Neighbor p𝑝p-dispersion is proven solvable in O​(p​n2)𝑂𝑝superscript𝑛2O(pn^{2}) time and O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) space. Max-Sum-min p𝑝p-dispersion is solvable in O​(p​n3)𝑂𝑝superscript𝑛3O(pn^{3}) time and O​(p​n2)𝑂𝑝superscript𝑛2O(pn^{2}) space. These complexity results hold also in 1D, proving for the first time that Max-Sum-min p𝑝p-dispersion is polynomial in 1D. Furthermore, properties of these algorithms are discussed for an efficient implementation and for practical applications.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
