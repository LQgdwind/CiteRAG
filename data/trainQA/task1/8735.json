      "content": "Paper Title: Mastering the exploration-exploitation trade-off in Bayesian Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Gaussian Process based Bayesian Optimization is a well-known sample efficient sequential strategy for globally optimizing black-box, expensive, and multi-extremal functions. The role of the Gaussian Process is to provide a probabilistic approximation of the unknown function, depending on the sequentially collected observations, while an acquisition function drives the choice of the next solution to evaluate, balancing between exploration and exploitation, depending on the current Gaussian Process model. Despite the huge effort of the scientific community in defining effective exploration-exploitation mechanisms, we are still far away from the master acquisition function. This paper merges the most relevant results and insights from both algorithmic and human search strategies to propose a novel acquisition function, mastering the trade-off between explorative and exploitative choices, adaptively. We compare the proposed acquisition function on a number of test functions and against different state-of-the-art ones, which are instead based on prefixed or random scheduling between exploration and exploitation. A Pareto analysis is performed with respect to two (antagonistic) goals: convergence to the optimum and exploration capability. Results empirically prove that the proposed acquisition function is almost always Pareto optimal and also the most balanced trade-off between the two goals.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
