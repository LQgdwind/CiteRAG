Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: SLISEMAP: Supervised dimensionality reduction through local explanations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Existing methods for explaining black box learning models often focus on building local explanations of model behaviour for a particular data item. It is possible to create global explanations for all data items, but these explanations generally have low fidelity for complex black box models. We propose a new supervised manifold visualisation method, slisemap, that simultaneously finds local explanations for all data items and builds a (typically) two-dimensional global visualisation of the black box model such that data items with similar local explanations are projected nearby. We provide a mathematical derivation of our problem and an open source implementation implemented using the GPU-optimised PyTorch library. We compare slisemap to multiple popular dimensionality reduction methods and find that slisemap is able to utilise labelled data to create embeddings with consistent local white box models. We also compare slisemap to other model-agnostic local explanation methods and show that slisemap provides comparable explanations and that the visualisations can give a broader understanding of black box regression and classification models.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
